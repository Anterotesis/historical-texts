            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere I present unto thee a Piece, I dare promise, worthy of thy read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; wherein thou hast a true and plain Relation (without disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing) of many memorable Passages happened in the Church of God, and likewise some notable ones in the State of the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from the very first setling of State and Church in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. But namely, and chiefly, thou hast here related what princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally passed in Church and State in this our Countrey, during the great Work of purging the Church from the Superstitions and Idolatry, and freeing both Church and State from the Tyranny and Slavery of Popery, untill the coming of King <hi>James,</hi> our late Soveraign, to the Crown of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Further, beside the true and faithfull Relation of many Occurrences that fell out in these dayes in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> thou hast unfolded unto thee, and made plain, the strong Reasons, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery Causes that moved these men who are here named, although infirm and weake in themselves, to undergo the great Work of Reformation: With the solid Grounds upon which they went on with this weighty Businesse willingly and cheerfully, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the great rubs and difficulties they met withall, through the help and assistance of God, who by them, mean Instruments, brought things to passe, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of the malice and stratagems of Sathan, with his agents, for the good of his People, and the setling of his Church in Purity and Liberty.</p>
            <p>All these things are set down plainly and simply, in familiar and homely Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; Yet so, that they may be with ease apprehended and understood by any one. From what thou hast here, written in this Volume, although there were no other Writings in this kinde extant, thou mayest see easily, by what means the great Mystery of Iniquity, from the very first Rise, hath been set afoot, and constantly, ever since, hath been carried on; to wit, By cunning Devices, impudent Lyes, continued and crafty Plots, under specious Pretexts, and open Oppression, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Cruelties, within <hi>Scotland,</hi> till the yeer of Christ <hi>1567.</hi> After which time, the enemies of God, and of his People, have not been sleeping, till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, more then formerly. Wherefore, for thy good, <hi>Christian Reader,</hi> I have thought fit in this place to point at some main Occurrences from that time till now.</p>
            <p>First then, the adversaries of Truth and Goodnesse, under the specious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of restoring Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to her Liberty, and of re-establishing her in full Authority, and sole Power, did disquiet and trouble both Church and State in <hi>Scotland,</hi> both with open Force, and subtill Plots, for some yeers, that is, to the <hi>1573</hi> yeer. But finding that all their Undertakings, under this pretext, proved to be in vain, and without successe, and standing to their main Designe of undoing



<pb facs="tcp:61872:4"/>
Religion and Liberty, they bethought themselves of another way, in appearance more plausible, for compassing their wicked Intents; it was, To deal, by way of entreaty and request, with the chief Ministers of State and Church then, To have the Mother set at liberty, and to be joynt in Authority and Power with her Son. And, for the obtaining of this, was employed the credit of the French Court for the time, with all its skill and cunning; but to small purpose: For these rude fellows, who managed the publike Affairs then of State and Church, could not be corrupted with the French Complements. In this way the enemies continued, till the yeer <hi>1577,</hi> and did not then give over, notwithstanding their bad successe; but, according to their wonted and resolved custome, they went on with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, betaking themselves to a new course; wherein, they had indeed more successe then in either of the former two: It was this; They did set awork certain men, who with fair words, and flattering tales, so craftily dealt with the young King, hardly yet twelve yeers of age, that they made him cast off, as a yoke, the counsell and service of those, who, ever since his Birth-day, had carefully laboured for the good of State and Church, with the pereservation of his Authority, and safety of his Person: And so the inconsiderate young King, although of most nimble wit and knowing, above his yeers, under the shew of freedom, put himself in the power of those who wished no good to his Person and Authority, and as little to the Church and State, making no scruple to trouble both for their own ends, according to the Instructions of the Masters who set them awork. So, in very short time, they gave unto the young King such impressions (which did stick too much to him) that not onely he became averse from those who had been so usefull to the publike, and so serviceable to him, but also he suffered them to be persecuted, yea, some by death, and others by banishment.</p>
            <p>While the enemies were thus working businesse with us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were not idle with our neighbours in <hi>England;</hi> for they were contriving and plotting, under colour of setting the imprisoned Queen at liberty: And were gone so far on in this way in both Kingdoms, that to stop the course and progresse of the enemies, both Countries thought it necessary to enter into a mutuall League and Covenant one with another, for the defence of the Reformed Religion, and Liberties of both Kingdoms, with the preservation of the Persons and Authorities of both Princes, King <hi>James</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> against the common enemy. This was done by the consent of both Princes, in the yeer <hi>1686.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, the enemy seeing the warinesse of both Kingdoms to be such, that in a short time he was not likely to advance the main Designe according to his minde, by craft and cunning leaveth off for a time to act the part of the Fox, and openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himself to be a ravishing Wolf: So the yeer <hi>1588</hi> the Armado cometh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst both Kingdoms, which God, in his mercy unto our fathers and us, brought to nought. About this time, and some yeers before, the agents of the enemy were very busie with King <hi>James</hi> to break with <hi>England,</hi> and to revenge the hard usage, and ill treatment of his Mother: But God did direct him so, for his own good, that he did give no consent to their evil counsell. Upon this refusall of the Kings, the agents of the common enemy do bestir themselves to trouble both King and Kingdom; which they did in a high measure, in the yeer <hi>1595.</hi> This gave occasion then both to Prince and people to enter into Covenant for the defence of the Truth, and pure Doctrine of the Church, with the Reformed Discipline, and of the safety of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; by which means, the proceedings of the enemies was stopped for a while.</p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:61872:4"/>Now the time drawing neer of the Kings coming to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> the watching enemy returns to work again, in another manner then he had done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto; which was this: By the mouths of some timerous and worldly men, he causeth to present unto the King the consideration of great difficulties that he was likely to finde, in his succeeding to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> by two parties there, who were given out to be the Strength of the Kingdom; to wit, the profest <hi>Papists,</hi> and the <hi>Prelaticall</hi> men; therefore, to facilitate the businesse, they must be in some sort contented. For the satisfaction of the Prelates, the King, by degrees, must endeavour to bring again into <hi>Scotland</hi> Prelacy, with all its dependences; for no neglecter or contemner of the holy Order could be kindely received to reigne in <hi>England:</hi> and so this part of the advice was followed with all possible care and diligence. To content the Papists, they not onely must have given unto them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand hopes of connivence, and over seeing their practice; but also there must be a Letter written to the Pope, to assure his Holinesse of the Kings affection to the Catholike Cause. Thus both these parties were calmed so far, that the King came to the Crown of <hi>England, Anno 1602,</hi> without manifest opposition, albeit not without the grumbling and grudging of some. As for the stricter sort of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the Reformed Religion, going under the nick-name of <hi>Puritans,</hi> no oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or trouble to the Succession was feared from them, because the Principles upon which they go on, rising from the Word of God, are far other then those of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, which flow from interest, and consequently, they needed not Atonement, or Propitiatory Sacrifice, to befriend the King. But the holy Father not finding reall performance by the King of what he looked for, remembers the King in good earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of his promise not kept, by the Gun-powder Plot, <hi>Anno 1605.</hi> After which (by Gods mercy failing) men would have thought, that the Popish party should leave off all undertakings hereafter. But they follow their businesse more constantly then so; for no sooner one Plot fails, but incontinent they put another afoot; yea, they have severall Plots at one and the same time in hand, whereof it is likely that either one or other will take. Now this great Plot of the Gun-powder being come to nothing, they, as it were, go back for a time, to come forward in due season with another; and leaving for a while the open and devouring ravishing of the Wolf, they have recourse again to the cunning of the Fox.</p>
            <p>The next care then, after the calming in some measure the spirits of men, after so horrid a Treason, is to look about, and to studie by whom: he affairs of these Dominions were managed: And finding, by serious inspection, That all affairs received great influence from the Court, after mature deliberation, they resolved to make friends there; which they did, by subtill insinuations, fair words, high promises, and some reall performances of good Offices; yea, when money was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary, it was not spared. Thus, by degrees, having gotten friends at Court, in it they make a party next, for whose subsistence and increase, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all that they can. Now having power and credit at Court, more and clearly perceiving it to be the fountain from whence all preferment to Honour and benefit in Church and State did flow, they judged it fit for their purpose to make sure of some prime men both in Church and State, according to their minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was done as they desired. Thus having gained men chief in State and Church for their use, then they went to the corrupting of the Universities, being the Seminaries of all Liberall Education. This likewise they did effectuate; first, by the Over-seers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence to loosenesse of life in young people; next, by the bad example of the Seniors



<pb facs="tcp:61872:5"/>
the Iuniors were invited to do mischief. Then the Teachers, by their bad instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, did corrupt, namely, in Theologie, all sound Doctrine. And for this purpose, the earnest studie of the Old Testrment in the Originall Hebrew was cryed downe, as beseeming rather men of the Synagogue, then those of the Christian Schools. Likewise the Greek of the New Testament must not be read with diligence, for fear of spoyling the elegancy of the Greek Language, which is to be found in profane Authors. So they withdrew the Students from the studie of Scriptures in the Originall, and recommended to them the reading of humane Writings, particularly in Theologie, the Books of the Ancients, which are commonly called <hi>Fathers.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was recommended unto young men the studie of the Sophistry of the Monks, as of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> namely, with their Expositors. True it is, That if young men were well instructed in Theologie from the Scriptures, and taught the true Principles of Philosophie, in a setled course, by some judicious and diligent Professor, they might reade all these Books, and others in their kinde, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and benefit. But alas, young men not knowing the rudiments of Theologie, nor the first Elements of Philosophie, are let loose unto themselves, and so by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Books, having no sure ground to stick to, learn onely to doubt, and put Queries, yea, of the very Principles of all sound knowledge, both Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. Thus being brought to waver and doubt, they are easily led, what by inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, what by weaknesse, to embrace a bad Opinion; or at least, to hold all uncertain, as the ancient <hi>Scepticks,</hi> not being able to resolve: Yea, doubting is come to that height, that, in the opinion of many, he is the bravest fellow, and wittiest, that can raise most Queries, answer them who will or can: And so <hi>Wit</hi> is hugely cryed up, which is but meer froth; and poor solid <hi>Wisedom</hi> is not so much as named, or thought on.</p>
            <p>Then those of the richer sort, having spent some time idly and loosely at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, go beyond Sea, particularly to <hi>Italy,</hi> forsooth, either upon their own trust, or, which is little better, if not worse, many of those who go along with young men, to advise and direct them, have as much need of one for their guide, as the young men themselves; having neither staidnesse, discretion, nor probity. So that if there were a just account cast up of all those who either have been bred in the Universities, or gone beyond Sea these many yeers, I will speak within compasse, That of twenty you shall hardly finde one who is improved in vertue by this Breeding, for the good of the Church and State, whereof they are members, and perhaps considerable too, if they were wise and good. At this present both Church and State findes this to be true, by wofull experience, namely, in the Clergie, Gentry, and Nobility.</p>
            <p>Now these evils have not been in <hi>England</hi> alone, for <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to its proportion, in compasse of Bounds, numbers of people, provision of means, and in its distance from Court, hath its full share of all the evil: For first, the Schools of breeding young people at home were become very corrupt; and many in their travelling abroad, have either miscarried, or little benefited themselves: The fruit we have found, namely, in our corrupt Clergie, yea, and in some of our infatuated Gentry and Nobility: but blessed be God, things are now in a better posture and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution there, then they have been formerly; God grant we may have occasion to say the like of <hi>England.</hi> For Religion, sound knowledge, and true wisedome, with probity have been so neglected and contemned there, to the ignominy and reproach of Christianity, that in these times, there we have seen the dolefull effects of want of Religion, and of these other vertues. But to return to the Court.</p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:61872:5"/>The Popish party, although they had both power and credit at Court, yet they were not assured to go on so smoothly and speedily with the great Designe, so long as there were any of eminency there, of whom they could not be certain: So Prince <hi>Henry</hi> was first wished to be out of the way, next, by untimely death was taken away, to the grief of many honest men. This conceived <hi>Remora</hi> being laid aside, they resolve to go on more freely in their Designe. But although they had gained much upon the affection of the King, yet they can suffer him to expresse the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religion and wisedom, both by word and writing: Yea, they will yeeld him to follow so far his former Principles, as to match his daughter to one of his Profession: so he marries the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the Prince Elector Palatine, although it was not altogether so pleasing to some chief ones at Court then. These things passed, in the yeer <hi>1613.</hi> who, although they would not stop the Marriage to go on, yet they managed the businesse so, that they hindered the Prince Elector Palatine to receive the advantages which in reason he should have had by vertue of it, as help and ayd at his need, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we must make a little step beyond Sea, and presently return back. Now then, we must know, That as the Popish party have been very busie in these our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, in carrying on the Work of the great Designe of subjecting all to the Pope, directly, or indirectly; so in other places, where Idolatry and Tyranny had been cast off, they have not been sleeping nor idle, namely, in our neighbour Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys; where, when they had made things up for a combustion of War, by their crafty forecasting divisions and corruptions in life and Doctrine of men of place, they kindled the fire; witnesse the businesse of <hi>Barnevel</hi> in the Low Countreys, in the yeer <hi>1619.</hi> And not long thereafter, the troubles raised in <hi>France</hi> against the Professors of the Truth; then in <hi>Germany</hi> likewise, having all things ready for a War, as they were thinking that the two Houses of <hi>Saxe,</hi> to wit, the Weymerian, and the now Electorall, was most fit and easie to be embroyled, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the emulation of the Weymerian against the other, for the Electorall Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; taken from it, and given to the other: But conveniently for their purpose, the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> being made King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the great agent of the Pope, the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> takes occasion to make War against him, leaving the House of <hi>Saxe,</hi> &amp;c. Now to come home again.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> by this time is turned about, and his affection so much cooled and turned from the Protestant party distressed, that for all help or supply to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of <hi>France,</hi> he sends complements by Embassadours, with fair promises. And for his son-in-Law, with other Protestants his adherents in <hi>Germany,</hi> he did little more; so senselesse is he of the sufferings of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and unmindefull of his own interest, by suffering those in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> to perish, who not onely did so much honour him, but they being preserved, made him the most redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and considerable Prince in Christendom. To speak nothing of his tye by nature unto his own children. Then, contradicting his own published Dictates, he must seek after a Popish wife for his son; and, to hasten the businesse, the young Prince must be sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had two men by whom he was then advised; who, although they did not love one another, yet they did agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, To betray their old Master, with their Countrey, and their young Master in their company; whom they theu counselled to embrace Popery, and by writing engage himself unto the Pope. This is upon Record. At last, the Prince cometh home without the wife, which was never really intended for him, howsoever



<pb facs="tcp:61872:6"/>
things were given out, notwithstanding all the pains of the young Prince, and the earnest sollicitude of the Father, with the compliance of both. If it had not been for the hatred to the Palatine House, and fear of its advancement to the succession of those Dominions, the Prince never had seen this Island again, but in a Map. Howsoever, King <hi>James</hi> is glad to have his son safe returned: And at length, seeing clearly how he had been misled and gulled, bethinks himself how to amend his former mistakes and errours; but alas, it was too late: for as he was thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting with himself, death takes him away, <hi>An. 1625.</hi> not without suspition of wrong done unto him. The new King must have a Popish wife (according to the former intention) she cometh from <hi>France,</hi> and bringeth along with her, her strange gods. The Prelats had a main hand in this Popish Match, by actuall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance thereof, and by opening the way how the free exercise of Popery might be had, in favour of the Queen and her adherents, without breach of the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>The same yeer of the death of the late King, and of the Marriage of our now Sovereign, there was an Expedition made against the Spaniard, without any reall intention to do harm, as appears by the slack performance of the War, and by the shamefull Peace made thereafter. The main drift of this undertaking was, first, To try how ready the people would be to endure Souldiers in the Countrey, which they had not seen for a long time, and how willing they would be to undergo a War, at the command of the corrupt Court, and uphold it with Supplies of men and moneys. Next, There must be an Expedition against <hi>France,</hi> under pretext to help the then distressed Protestants there; which really was intended for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening of their ruine, and encrease of their desolation: and so it proved indeed, although the main and chief undertaker was prevented, by death, to see the effect of his intents. The other end of this undertaking was, To have Forces at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, both Horse and Foot, by Land, and a well-provided Navie at Sea, for the enslaving of the people to spirituall and temporall Bondage; which in all humane probability had not been difficile to effectuate then, such was the sheeppish sillinesse, and knavish basenesse of many men in these Dominions, of all ranks, conditions, and professions; as also the unpreparednesse of the wiser and better Patriots and Members of the Church, to withstand this mischief, if God in his mercy, by the unexpected death of the Court-ruler, and chief agent in the businesse, had not put in a <hi>Remora</hi> and lett: At which time, if men had returned unto God, amending their lives in private, and had expressed their true zeal then to the good of the Church and Countrey whereof they are members, according to their severall ranks and conditions, the designe of the common enemy had been fully dasht. But God in his wisedom hath been pleased to keep us yet a while longer under the rod of tryall, to see if we will return unto him at last. The Romish party, although asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and surprised at the death of their Engine and main Instrument here among us, gives not over, but continues the great Designe, without intermission, albeit not with such speed as formerly; for those to whose care principally the businesse was committed, and in whose hands the managing of matters had fallen, by the death of the late <hi>Fac totum,</hi> were not so powerfull to obtain, without refusall, what they pleased, at the Kings hands; neither were they in such opinion and reputation with inferiours, to make them go on in the work so earnestly; wherefore the Queen must be brought now of necessity, to take upon her the main care, and to obtain from the King whatsoever may conduce and further the businesse, and take away



<pb facs="tcp:61872:6"/>
all letts and stops which may hinder the proceedings: Then, to employ all her credit abroad, for countenancing and advancing affairs: And next, by her authority to draw on inferiours to act their part with affection and ardour. Now all things being thus cunningly and carefully, by degrees, in few yeers, prepared and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for enslaving Church and State, Prince and People, to <hi>Rome</hi> again, it was thought fit, by the hottest of the party, to wit, the Iesuites, to hasten the work openly, and delay no more time (the compassing of the Designe being conceived to be infallible) By this means they thought to shorten the businesse, and to make themselves so considerable, as to share deeply in the Booty; of which they looked for but little, if things were still lingred, and carryed on slowly. But how, and where to begin this new undertaking, was consulted upon; and, after deliberation, the Scots must be begun at, the way is resolved on, there must be a new Prayer-Book put upon these rude fellows, that they may say their Prayers in <hi>modo &amp; figura a la Romaine,</hi> and not so rudely and irregularly as they were wont to do, in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern way. Then they must have high-Commission Courts, Canons, and <hi>Etcetera</hi>'s: Which things, if the Scots be so wise to accept, as doubtlesse they will (reasoned these men: but he that reckons without this host, reckons twice) for their chief men of State are either actually at Court, or provided to places in the Countrey from Court, at least, they can do no businesse of moment, without the favour of the Court. At this time the devout and religious Prelats, with the rest of their good Clergie, are not onely in all earnestnesse bent for the work, according to their severall places in the Church, but also they over-sway all busines in State, Wherefore, without difficulty, we will compasse our main Designe thorow all these Dominions (said they.) And truely so they had, in all likelihood, as we may see by the wofull carriage of businesse, and so ill managing so good a Cause in <hi>England</hi> since; But God had, in his mercy towards us all, ordained otherwise. And if the Scots (say they) should be so mad as to refuse the commands from the Court, and think upon resistance, they shall be made obey the holy <hi>Mandate</hi> with a Vengeance and say their prayers with a rod; for we shall over-run their Countrey speedily, and subdue them, as poor, silly, ignorant fools, destitute of all means for War, to wit, wisedom, with resolution, not having breeding, and pressed down with poverty, to undertake and undergo such a businesse as War; and money and Arms to go on in it; for the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yl being barren, and the Havens bad, they cannot have the advantages of a fertile Countrey, furnished with good Harbours, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders or Leaders, to manage a War, their Military men being abroad, who will not easily quit the honorable and beneficiall Employments they have in forreigne Countreys, and come home to suffer want, with losse of credit. But God, who laughs from above at the foolish Counsells of vain men, in this particular hath made us see, That he hath an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver-ruling power over the affairs of men, making little and contemptible ones do great things, and bring to nothing the undertakings of the mighty and wise of this world.</p>
            <p>By this time the new Prayer-Book, designed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and perfected at <hi>London,</hi> is sent down into <hi>Scotland.</hi> After some little reluctancy, it is received by the Councell there, the major part whereof then were either Church-men, or their addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted friends. Then it is sent to the Churches, to be put in use and practice: But unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and unlooked for, it is opposed by inferiour people; from whence the oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on riseth to those of higher ranks: whereupon Petitions are drawn up, and sent to the King, to supplicate His Majesty, in all due respect, to free the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> from this new Prayer-Book, with the High-Commission Courts, Canons, <hi>Etcetera</hi>'s.



<pb facs="tcp:61872:7"/>
To these Demands of the Scots no answer is given, but hot threatnings; after which, preparatives of War were made against the Scots: and because the King did not shew himself propense enough to the undertaking of War, nor the Queen forward enough to engage the King in this holy War, the Queen-Mother, who, for her known faithfulnesse to her husband, and for her care of her son, both late Kings of <hi>France,</hi> must come to her Son-in-law (against his will) to help him with her best advice and counsell, and to better instruct her daughter how to carry her self with earnestnesse and addresse in the businesse.</p>
            <p>Things being thus disposed, there is an Expedition undertaken against the Scots, and followed to the Borders by the King present in person; but to small purpose; for the Scots came to the Borders duly prepared, notwithstanding their pre-concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wants and indisposition, to sell their Religion and Liberty at a dear rate: which being perceived by the Court, the Scots Demands, formerly rejected, are granted, and a Peace concluded. Then some of the chief men of the Scots were invited to go to Court, for the time at <hi>Barwick;</hi> who, upon certain advice of a Plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, were stopped by their friends, to trust themselves to the faith of the Court.</p>
            <p>After things in a kinde calmed there, the King, not suffered by his Counsell to go into <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to settle things fully, he sends Deputies thither, and returns to <hi>London.</hi> At his return, the Scots Commissioners are imprisoned at <hi>London,</hi> against their Safe-Conduct; and the Agreement with the Scots is burnt publikely, by the hand of the Hang-man, and a new Expedition, with more cunning and strength then the former, is undertaken against the Scots: Whereof the Scots duely advertised, judging it not to be safe to play alwayes after-games, settle their Countrey, make sure the strong Holds, which they had delivered, in simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart, unto the King, at the late Agreement, and come into <hi>England</hi> with such an Army, that they made their enemies retire. Upon this point of necessity, the King assembled divers of the Nobles, by whom he is advised to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is granted, although with difficulty. At the overture of the Parliament, having gained all the party possible, the King is made to demand assistance to repell the Scots from <hi>England,</hi> and chastise them; but to no purpose, wherefore the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament must pay for it; and to this purpose, the English Army afoot must be brought to <hi>London,</hi> under some pretext. This Plot failing, and discovered, the Scots must be tempted, under great offers, no lesse then the plunder of <hi>London,</hi> and the propriety of the adjacent Counties to their Countrey. The Scots not onely refused these great offers, but also give advice of them to the Parliament. Then the Scots must be hastened home, and the King must go into <hi>Scotland,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to settle things there, but really, to make a party, viewing by the way the Scots Army; and to make sure of some men dis-affected to the Designe of the Court. These things not succeeding, to smooth a little the shamefull businesse, Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Pensions are given to many.</p>
            <p>While the King is in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Rebellion riseth in <hi>Ireland,</hi> having its influence from the Court, whether by sealed Patents, or otherwise, I will not enquire now (more then of the Spanish Navie) but certain it is, it had its rise from Court. Some dayes after the Rebellion begun in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the King must return in all speed to <hi>London,</hi> under pretext to consult with the Parliament how to represse this odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rebellion; but really, to be revenged of the Parliament, for not assisting against the Scots, and for punishing the main agents of the Scotish party, witnesse the faction



<pb facs="tcp:61872:7"/>
the Queen had made in the City, during the Kings abode in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to divide the City and Parliament, and the demanding of the Members of the Houses, against all Law, upon accusation of Treason; whereof the chief and main point was, To have favourized the Scots Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> against expresse Acts of Oblivion of both Parliaments of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> As for the repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is so little taken to heart, that the King seldom goes to the House; and being there, speaks but little of the businesse. After a while, with much ado, the Popish Irish in Arms are declared Rebells, when they had ruined many families, and killed many of the innocent Protestants: But of the Kings Declaration there were but few Copies Printed, and of the few hardly any dispersed; when the Scots, before they had gathered any Head, were <hi>Prelatically</hi> excommunicated, and cursed thorow all the Parishes of <hi>England,</hi> and declared Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells every where by printed Papers: Who, as they intended no ill, so, blessed be God, never men of War in a Countrey did lesse harm then the Scots did. Yea, which is more, all the good intentions of both Parliament and City, with the ready offers of the Scots for the speedy help of the poor Protestants against the bloody Butchers in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was delayed, deluded, yea, almost put off, by the Court, and the corrupt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of both Houses, who since have shewed themselves openly what they are, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Affairs. But these Designes failing of apprehending the Members, and of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the City and Parliament, as was seen by the accompanying the Members to the Houses again, the King must leave <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here before we proceed any further, we shall go a little back.</p>
            <p>When the first undertaking was against the Scots, all things within these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions being disposed for the best furthering of the work, the holy Conclave of <hi>Rome</hi> forecasting all chances: and fearing that <hi>England</hi> would not altogether be so forward to contribute much unto the destruction of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherefore the King must be assured of some good friend abroad, and not far off, who may help in case of need: None is thought so fit as the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> being able to help with Moneys, Arms and Men for command: He must be gained, by offering him for his Son one of the Kings Daughters; who, notwithstanding his high minde, would have been glad of a lower Match. Now at the first, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> did onely look to have the second Daughter in due time: But, to engage him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he shall have the elder (not staying for her till she be nubile) and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, although she did little more then, then well discerne her right hand from her left. But this is not all; for the Mother must carry the Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to gain him more speedily, and make him more affectionate and sure to the Designes of our corrupted Court: So the Kings Daughter is sold, and made a Sacrifice for furtherance of the Catholike Cause, as his Grand-mother was sold to <hi>France</hi> to the same Designe, by the corrupt Court of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the time. What mischief this Marriage, and the Queens Voyage into <hi>Holland</hi> hath brought into this Countrey, and what stain she hath brought upon her self by it, we see all. And so many evils fell upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the sending the then young Queen into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you shall observe the jugling knavery of our corrupt Court, who cry out against the Scots for taking Arms for the just defence of their Liberty and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any by-respect, as their whole proceedings to this instant do testifie, as guilty of the most horrid crime of Rebellion against Higher Powers, as they call it; yet the same corrupt Court makes the King give his Daughter unto him, who is



<pb facs="tcp:61872:8"/>
not onely a chief man, but a main Instrument to make War for the Liberty and Religion of the Countrey where he liveth, against the unjust oppression of their Sovereign; as his renowned Brother, and most vertuous Father did before him; and as he intends to make his Son after him, witnesse the reversion of his Place he hath obtained, unto him, from the States. If the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by necessity hath been constrained to acknowledge the United Provinces free, it is nothing for the justice of their taking Arms to defend their Religion and Liberty: And if he had power, they would not be long free, witnesse the secret Plots to divide them, and over-reach them. Farther, he is very shie in his Writs, to call them Free, as every man knows.</p>
            <p>The Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> must not onely be neglected, and seen lose all that she and hers can claim for their own, but she and hers must be serviceable to those who have undone them: To this end she must have People about her, namely, Court-Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, to disguise businesse unto her, and so make her have a bad conception of those who are her best friends, to wit, the true Professors of the Truth, and good Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots in these Dominions. Next, her eldest son, after a long and great neglect of yeelding him any help for the recovery of his own, is betrayed at our corrupt Court, when he is put in away to do somewhat for his own restoring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, by the same Court, he is sollicited to take Arms here against the onely men, who really and constantly have expressed unto him and his, true affection; but they being stopped by the Court, could not effectuate much by their good will. He in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome refuseth to fight against his friends. Since he will not, his two next Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers must be employed; the eldest whereof is released from prison to that effect: And so they hazard their lives, and spend their blood, to serve the party who hath undone their Fortunes, and now strives to undo their persons.</p>
            <p>The King having left <hi>London,</hi> after he had been in severall places, retires to <hi>Yorke,</hi> where he begins to raise men against the Parliament. The Scots seeing this, send to him thither, to intreat him to lay aside all such intentions, and offer their service by way of Mediation betwixt him and the Parliament, to take away all known mistakes. The Scots Commissioners were not suffered to proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then, in the businesse, and were sent back, beyond the expectation of men. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long Pen-skirmishing on both sides, Armies are leavied, many men killed and taken at divers times on each side; yea, a set Battell fought, where numbers of men are slain.</p>
            <p>The Scots not being able any longer to see their Brethren in <hi>England</hi> destroyed, and the Executioners of <hi>Ireland</hi> butchering man, woman and childe (the help that the innocents should have had from <hi>England</hi> being almost altogether diverted, by the Intestine War) and neither say nor do in the businesse, under safe-Conduct send to the King and Parliament Commissioners, to intercede for an Agreement: But they being arrived at Court, were neglected with their Commission, and not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repair unto the Parliament: At last, they are dismissed, not without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and, having done nothing, return. Upon this, the Scots convene the States, to consult concerning their own safety, and the help of their friends: At this nick of time, when they received many fair promises from the Court, with a request to be quiet, a Plot of the Papists, set afoot by the Court, for embroyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Countrey, is discovered; by the means whereof, they were incited to look more narrowly to themselves and their friends. Then the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> sends to the Scots for help. Upon this, a Covenant is made betwixt the two



<pb facs="tcp:61872:8"/>
Nations, for the defence of the true Religion, and Liberty of the Countreys, with the Kings just Rights: and, after due preparation, the Scots having setled their own Countrey, enter into <hi>England</hi> with a strong Army, to fight the Battells of the Lord; having for scope of their Expedition, The glory of God, and the good of his People, with the Honour of the King.</p>
            <p>Here we shall observe, in these our Countreys, in these last yeers, such Riddles of State and Church, as have hardly been heard of: A Protestant Prince makes one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Nation fight against another, for the Protestant Religion, which have been thought to be of one and the same Doctrine, for the main: One Church thunders Curses against another: Then, a Prince misled, with the ayd of Papists and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, spoyling and destroying the professors of the Truth, because they professe it, for the good and advancement of the Protestant Religion: Next, in a very short time, a Prince to have all his subjects declared Rebells: First, he is made declare the Scots; Then, he is constrained to declare the Irish: An Army gotten together in the Kings name, declares all those that did oppose them, Rebells: The Parliament declares all those who in the Kings name oppose them, Rebells and Traytors: Farther, under the Kings Authority, the named Rebells in <hi>England</hi> by the King, maintain a War against the declared Rebells in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But the late carriage of things at Court, and by the Court-Instruments at home and abroad, hath solved the Riddle, namely, The Patent for the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> The detaining of help ordained for the repressing of it, The Kings offer to go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> The Cessation, and bringing over of the Irish, and, The last-discovered Plot in <hi>Scotland,</hi> all other things laid aside, tell us cleerly, howsoever the Proclamations and Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions going in the Kings name be soft and smooth as the voyce of <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet the hands are rough as of <hi>Esau,</hi> destroying, and seeking to destroy the true Religion, grounded in Gods Word, with the professors thereof, as also the lawfull Liberty of the Countrey, and bring all unto slavery. Let <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> say, if this be not true; and <hi>Scotland</hi> likewise, according to its <hi>genius,</hi> speak truth.</p>
            <p>I shall close up all with two or three Instances of eminent men amongst the Papists Clergie, to shew clearly how they stand affected to the Protestants.</p>

            <head>The LIFE OF IOHN KNOX.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>OHN KNOX</hi> was borne in <hi>Gifford,</hi> neer <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington,</hi> in <hi>Lothian,</hi> the yeer of Christ, <hi>1505.</hi> of honest Parentage: His father was a brothers son of the House of <hi>Ranferlie,</hi> which is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Family of Gentlemen in the West. When he left the Grammar Schoole in the Countrey, he was sent to the Vniversity of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> to studie under M. <hi>John Mair,</hi> who in those dayes was very famous for his Learning, which particularly did consist in the ergotie or disputative part of Philosophy, and in School-Divinity, wherein formerly, for many yeers together, almost all Learning was placed. In a very short time, <hi>John Knox</hi> became such a Proficient, that in this kinde of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge wherein his Master most excelled, he surpassed him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet very young, was thought worthy of Degrees in the School: Moreover, before the time ordinarily allowed by the Canons, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in Church Orders. Thereafter, laying aside the idle Disputes and Sophistry of the School, he betook himself to the reading of the Ancients; namely, of <hi>Augustine,</hi> with whose Writings he was much taken, by reason of their plainnesse and solidity. Last of all, he betook himself to the earnest study of the holy Scriptures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in having found the Truth of God concerning the salvation of Mankinde fully revealed, he in good earnest did embrace it, and freely professed it; yea, made it his main work to make it known to all men, and believed by them; in which work he was very active and vigilant, at home and abroad, namely, at home. For the Cause of the Truth he suffered very much by Sea and by Land, in minde and in body; among forraigners, and amongst his own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as ye may see in this History of the Church, which now here we present unto you: Which History, namely, so much of it, I mean, as formerly was published, hath gone commonly under his



<pb facs="tcp:61872:10"/>
name, because he is the man of whom most is spoken thorowout the whole History, as being a most earnest and diligent agent in the businesse of Reformation in the Church: Next, because he hath penned with his own hand, or spoken by word of mouth, the most part of the most remarkable and most usefull things for Posterity in the History. Thirdly, the whole History is gathered out of his Papers and Manuscripts: And so ye see why it is generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be of <hi>John Knox.</hi> But to return to his Life.</p>
            <p>He being constrained for a time to leave his Countrey, by reason of the Persecution raised in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the then Bishops, against the professors of the Truth, he came into <hi>England,</hi> where for some yeers he was busied, in preaching the Evangell of Christ, with a great deal of content and benefit to those that had the happinesse to hear him. His chief abode was in <hi>Berwick, Newcastle,</hi> and <hi>London:</hi> This was in the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, with whom he was in great favour and esteem; By whom being offered a Bishopricke, he not onely refused and rejected it, but with a grave and severe speech declared, That the proud Title of Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and that great State, was not to be suffered to be in the Church of God, as having <hi>quid commune cum Antichristo</hi>; that is, somewhat common with Antichrist. King <hi>Edward</hi> being dead, the persecution of <hi>Mary</hi> made him leave <hi>England,</hi> with many other godly Ministers, who went beyond Seas. First, <hi>John Knox</hi> went to <hi>Frankford,</hi> where for a time he preached the Gospel to the English Congregation there; From whence he wrote the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to <hi>England:</hi> But being molested there, partly by open Papists, and partly by false Brethren, was constrained to retire: And from thence he went to <hi>Geneva,</hi> from whence he wrote his Letter to <hi>Mary</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Appeal to the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Admonition to the Commons of <hi>Scotland.</hi> From <hi>Geneva,</hi> after some yeers abode there, he was called home to his own Countrey, the yeer of Christ <hi>1559.</hi> which was the <hi>54</hi> of his age, by the Noble-men, and others who had taken upon them the generall Reformation of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>; where, how soon that the reformed Church had any liberty, he was setled Minister at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he continued exercising his Ministery to his dying day; but not without interruption, by reason of the Civill disorders that fell out in those dayes.</p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:61872:10"/>During this his being at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he Preached many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sermons; whereof there be but few that were printed and conserved to Posterity, he not being willing to busie himself with the Presse: Yet some of them we have, as this, namely, which he Preached Aug. <hi>19, An. 1564.</hi> and for which he was forbidden to Preach for a time: He, to make known to the world what ground there was to deal so with him, took the care to have this Sermon printed, as you will finde it at the end of this History.</p>
            <p>Here I cannot let slip a remarkable passage; which was this; <hi>Anno 1566.</hi> the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> was slain upon the Saturday: The morrow after, <hi>John Knox</hi> preached in <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; where, as he was reading the Papers wherein was written the names of those that desired the Prayers of the Church, he findes a paper with these words, <hi>Take up the man whom ye accounted an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other god:</hi> which he passed, without expressing any commotion, and went on with his Prayer and Sermon. At the end of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he made moan for the losse that the Church and State of <hi>Scotland</hi> had, by the death of that vertuous man; and said, That as God in his mercy giveth good and wise Rulers, so taketh he them away from a people in his wrath. Then he added, There is one in this company that maketh the subject of his mirth this horrible murther, whereat all good men have occasion to be sorry: I tell him, That he shall die where there shall be none to lament him. He who had written the aforesaid words in the paper, was <hi>Thomas Metellan,</hi> a young Gentlemen of most rare parts, but youthfull, and bearing small affection to the Earle of <hi>Murray;</hi> who, when he heard this Commination of <hi>John Knox,</hi> went home to his lodging, and said to his sister, That <hi>John Knox</hi> was raving to speak of he knew not whom. His sister replyed, with tears in her eyes, If you had followed my advice, ye had not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten these words; and withall told him, That none of <hi>John Knox</hi> his threatnings fell to the ground without effect. And so it fell out in this particular; For shortly thereafter the young Gentleman went beyond Seas to travell, and died in <hi>Italy,</hi> having no known man to assist him, much lesse to lament him. Towards the latter dayes of his age, his body became very infirm, and his voice so weake, that the people could not hear him, Preaching in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, wherfore he made choice of another more commodious within



<pb facs="tcp:61872:11"/>
the Town, reading to his auditors the history of the Passion, in which, he said, it was his desire to finish and close his Ministery. Thus he continued Preaching, though with much weaknesse, two moneths and more, after this retiring: And foreseeing that he was not to remain long with them, he was instant with the Counsell of the City to provide themselves of a worthy man to succeed in his Place. Master <hi>James Lauson,</hi> who at that time professed Philosophy in the Vniversity of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> being commended for a good Preacher, Commissioners were directed from the Body of the Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and from Master <hi>John Knox</hi> in particular, to desire him to accept of the Charge. To the Letter that the Commissioners carried, after that he had set his hand, he added this Postscript, <hi>Accelera mi frater, alioqui sero venies:</hi> Make haste, Brother, otherwise ye shall come too late: Meaning, That if he made any stay, he should finde him dead and gone. These last words moved M. <hi>Lauson</hi> to take journey the morrow thereafter. When he was come to the Town, and had preached two severall times, to the good liking of the people, order was taken by the Rulers of the Church for his admission, and the day appointed; at which day <hi>John Knox</hi> himself would not onely be present, but also preach, though he could scarce walk on foot to the Chayre; which he did with such fervency of spirit, that at no time before was he heard to speak with such great power, and more content to the hearers: And in the end of the Sermon, calling God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, That he had walked in a good conscience amongst them, not seeking to please men, nor serving either his own, or other mens affections, but in all sincerity and truth preached the Gospel of Christ: With most grave and pithie words, he exhorted them to stand fast in the Faith they had received: And having conceived a zealous Prayer for the continuance of Gods blessing among them, and the multiplying of his Spirit upon the Preacher who was then to be admitted, he gave them his last fare-well. The people did convey him to his lodging, and could not be drawn from it, so loath were they to depart from him; and he the same day in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, was forced to take bed. During the time he lay (which was not long) he was much visited by all sorts of persons, to whom he spake most comfortably: Amongst others, to the Earle of <hi>Morton,</hi> who came to see him, he was heard say, <hi>My Lord, God



<pb facs="tcp:61872:11"/>
hath given you many blessings; he hath given you Wisdom, Honour, high Birth, Riches, many good and great friends, and is now to prefer you to the Government of the Realme</hi> (the Earle of <hi>Marr,</hi> late Regent, being newly dead) <hi>In his Name I charge you, That ye will use these blessings better in times to come, then you have done in times past: In all your actions seek first the glory of God, The further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Gospel, The maintenance of his Church and Ministery; and next, Be carefull of the King, to procure his good, and the welfare of the Realme. If you shall do this, God will be with you, and honour you: If otherwise ye do it not, he will deprive you of all these benefits, and your end shall be shame and ignominy.</hi> These speeches, the Earle, about nine yeers after, at the time of his Execution, called to minde, saying, That <hi>he had found them to be true, and him, therein, a Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A day or two before his death, he sent for Master <hi>David Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi> Master <hi>James Lauson,</hi> and the Elders and Deacons of the Church, to whom he said, <hi>The time is approaching, for which I have long thirsted, wherein I shall be relieved of all cares, and be with my Saviour Christ for ever: And now, God is my witnesse, whom I have served with my spirit, in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of his Son, That I have taught nothing but the true and solid Doctrine of the Gospel; and that the end I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in all my Doctrine, was, To instruct the ignorant, To confirm the weak, To comfort the consciences of those that were humbled under the sense of their sins, and born down with the threatnings of Gods Judgements: Such as were proud and rebellious, I am not ignorant that many have bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and yet do blame my too great rigour and severity; But God knoweth, That in my heart I never hated the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of those against whom I thundred Gods Judgements; I did onely hate their sins, and laboured, according to my power, to gain them to Christ: That I did forbear none, of whatsoever condition; I did it, out of the fear of my God, who hath placed me in the Function of his Ministery, and I know will bring me to an account. Now, brethren, for your selves; I have no more to say, but to warn you, That



<pb facs="tcp:61872:12"/>
you take heed to the Flock over which God hath placed you Overseers, which he hath redeemed by the Blood of his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son. And you, Master</hi> Lauson, <hi>fight a good fight, do the Work of the Lord with courage, and with a willing minde: And God from above blesse you, and the Church whereof you have charge: Against it (so long as it continueth in the Doctrine of the Truth) the gates of hell shall not prevail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This spoken, and the Elders and the Deacons dimitted, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the two Preachers unto him, and said, <hi>There is one thing that grieveth me exceedingly; You have sometimes seen the courage and constancy of the Laird of</hi> Grange <hi>in the cause of God; and that most unhappy man hath cast himself away: I will pray you two to take the pains to go unto him, and say, from me, That unlesse he forsake that wicked course wherein he is entred, neither shall the Rock in which he confideth defend him, nor the carnall wisedom of that man whom he counteth half a god</hi> (this was young Lethington) <hi>yeeld him help; but shamefully he shall be pulled out of that nest, and his carkase hung before the Sun</hi> (meaning the Castle he did keep against the Kings Authority: And so it fell out the yeer next following; for the Castle was taken, and he was publikely hanged, and his body hung before the Sun) <hi>The soul of that man is dear unto me; and, if it be possible, I could fain have him to be saved.</hi> They went, as he had desired, and conferred a long space with <hi>Grange;</hi> but with no perswasion could he be diverted from his course: Which being reported, he took most heavily. Yet <hi>Grange,</hi> at his death, did expresse serious repentance for his sins.</p>
            <p>The next day, he gave order for making his Coffin wherein his body should be laid; and was that day, as thorow all the time of his sicknesse, much in prayer, crying, <hi>Come, Lord Jesu; Sweet Jesu, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.</hi> Being asked by those that attended him, if his pains were great, he answered, That <hi>he did not esteem that a pain, which would be to him the end of all troubles, and beginning of eternall Joyes.</hi> Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, after some deep meditations, he burst forth in these words; <hi>O serve the Lord in fear, and death shall not be troublesome



<pb facs="tcp:61872:12"/>
unto you: Blessed is the death of those that have part in the death of Jesus.</hi> In the evening, which was the last of this wretched life, having slept some hours together, but with great unquietnesse, for he was heard to send forth many sighs and groans; one <hi>Campbell,</hi> and one <hi>John Johnston,</hi> which two waited very diligently upon him, asked, after he awaked, <hi>How he did finde himselfe, and what it was that made him to mourn so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily in his sleep?</hi> To whom he answered, <hi>In my life time I have oft been assaulted with Satan, and many times he hath cast in my teeth my sins, to bring me to despair; yet God gave me strength to overcome all his tentations: And now that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Serpent, who never ceases to tempt, hath taken another course, and seeks to perswade me, That all my labours in the Ministery, and the fidelity that I have shewn in that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, hath merited heaven and immortality: But blessed be God, that brought to my minde these Scriptures,</hi> What hast thou that thou hast not received? <hi>And,</hi> Not I, but the grace of God in me: <hi>With which, he is gone away ashamed, and shall no more returne: And now I am sure my Battell is at an end; and that without pain of body, or trouble of spirit, I shall shortly change this mortall and miserable life, with that happy and immortall which shall never have an end.</hi> After which discourse, a Prayer was said neer his bed where he lay: which being ended, it was asked, If he <hi>heard the Prayer?</hi> He answered, <hi>Would to God that ye had heard it with such an ear and heart as I have done;</hi> Adding, <hi>Lord Jesu receive my Spirit.</hi> With which words, without any motion of hands or feet, as one falling a sleep, rather then dying, he ended his life. He was a man endued with many excellent gifts, and with a very great measure of the Spirit: God raised him up to be a chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of the glorious Work of Reformation. The Court claw-backs and parasites, have been, and are displeased with his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine touching the Authority of Princes and Civill Magistrates, although there was never man born, who did more heartily reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Civill Authority, nor obey more willingly the lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thereof, then he: All his Doctrine concerning the Civill Authority, was, To correct the corruption brought in by the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish flatterers, who, abusing the simplicity and debonaritie of



<pb facs="tcp:61872:13"/>
those whom God has placed in Authority, maketh them inconsider<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ately to rebell wilfully and openly against God and his Son, and turn all things up-side down, and undo the poor people of God, for whose good and safety they are placed so high. Likewise were and are to this day the proud Prelats and idle belly-gods highly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Doctrine concerning Church-Government, although he intended no other thing, but the pulling down of Antichristian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme fully, and casting all tyranny and Idlenesse out of the House of God. Never was a man more observant of the true and just Authority of the Church-Rulers, according to the Word of God, and practice of the purest Primitive times. He alwayes urged pressingly due Obedience by the people, to the faithfull Pastors and Elders of the Church. Although he was both learned and eloquent, yet did he not much apply his minde to compose Books for Posterity; for he was wont to say, That <hi>God had called him rather to instruct the ignorant, comfort the sorrowfull, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the sinners, and confirm the weak living in his time, then to make Books for ages to come.</hi> Neverthelesse, he wrote severall good Pieces; for besides what we have spoken of already, namely, he left these, A learned Treatise against the blasphemous Anabaptists, Two Treatises against the Masse, One, of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, Some Sermons upon <hi>Genesis,</hi> Some also upon the <hi>Psalms,</hi> An Exhortation to all afflicted Churches, An Advice in time of trouble, The first blast of the Trumpet, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He died, <hi>Anno Dom. 1572,</hi> and of his age, <hi>62.</hi> His body was interred at S. <hi>Giles,</hi> without the Church. To his Buriall assisted many men of all Ranks; among others, the Earle of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who being neer to the grave, as the Corps was put in, said, by way of Epitaph, <hi>Here lies the body of him, who, in his life time, never feared the face of man.</hi>

            <p>We have said, That the In-dwellers of the north part of the Island were named <hi>Scoti</hi>; and that by a generall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision they were of two kindes, <hi>Brigantes,</hi> and <hi>Picti:</hi> Now we must enquire who are <hi>Brigantes,</hi> and who <hi>Picti</hi>; where they both lived, and from whence they came. And, to begin at <hi>Picti,</hi> They inhabited the East side of <hi>Britannia minor,</hi> which is the best: and, for the most part, they were of the ancient native <hi>Britons</hi>; of whom, sundry of old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the entry of the Romans into the Island, had drawn themselves Northward, to have more elbow-room for their course of life, which was, To feed Cattell, and to hunt, removing from one place to another, whereunto largenesse of Bounds is required.

            <p>Next came in to these North <hi>Britans,</hi> at divers times, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Colonies of Northern people from beyond Sea.

So it was not said much amisse by one, That this naming of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the name of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was first about <hi>Beda</hi> his time, who lived in the beginning of the eighth Age. <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> tells us, That the word <hi>Scot</hi> is no Irish word, but <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>; that is not used in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scotus non est nomen Hiberni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, sed Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannicum.</hi>
               </note> but in <hi>Britannia:</hi> what is the origine and signification of the word, we have heard before.</p>
            <p>As the Irish began to be called <hi>Scots,</hi> so the <hi>Picts</hi> left off to be so named; now withdrawing themselves from the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes,</hi> or <hi>Albini,</hi> and striking in with their enemies the Irish, by the Writers were called <hi>Scoti Hibernienses,</hi> and the <hi>Albins</hi> were called <hi>Scoti Albienses:</hi> And <hi>Ireland</hi> was called <hi>Scotia ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> because <hi>Albania</hi> or <hi>Albion</hi> in those dayes, which they called <hi>Scotia minor,</hi> was of lesse extent. But this name of <hi>Scots</hi> was not for any long time given to the Irish; So that at length the name of <hi>Scots</hi> became peculiar to the <hi>Albins</hi> or <hi>Brigantes</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the <hi>Albins</hi> having subdued the <hi>Picts,</hi> and made them no more a People, communicated into the Countrey, newly conquered by them, the name of <hi>Scotia,</hi> as one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey with <hi>Albinia</hi>; and so all the in-dwellers there, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Scots,</hi> with the <hi>Albins,</hi> as one people with them, and so they are to this day.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Albins</hi> or <hi>Brigantes</hi> being the onely Masters of <hi>Britannia minor,</hi> came to be called <hi>Scoto-Britanni</hi>; as the <hi>Picts</hi> had been of old, and are upon occasion called so to this day, to distinguish them from the South <hi>Britons,</hi> of whom, some are called <hi>Cambro-britanni,</hi> the rest, <hi>Anglo-britanni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the ancient <hi>Brigantes</hi> were called by forreigners <hi>Scoti,</hi> namely, by the <hi>Britons</hi> Provincialls, and the Romans, yet they did never name themselves so, by this name <hi>Scoti</hi>;



<pb facs="tcp:61872:20"/>
neither do the High-landers to this day, in their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage call themselves <hi>Scots,</hi> but <hi>Albins.</hi> So <hi>Scaliger</hi> had just reason to say, That <hi>Scoti</hi> was not an Irish name. As the <hi>Hellenes</hi> did never name themselves <hi>Greeks,</hi> although they were so commonly called by the forreigners: And the <hi>Misraims</hi> did not call themselves <hi>Egyptians,</hi> although for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners named them so.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> now adayes are divided in Highland-men, and Lowland-men: The Highlanders are the true Progenie of the ancient <hi>Brigantes,</hi> or <hi>Albins,</hi> for the most part, I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some are come in later times from other Countreys. And to this day our Highlanders, as the <hi>Brigantes</hi> of old, makes main use of their Bowes and Arrows, in their war, namely, when they are among the hills; so when they praise one for a Military man, they say, He is a good Bowe-man, and Bray-man; which two Epithites were expressed by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in one composed word, <hi>Scoto-Brigantes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lowland-men are made up of divers Nations; for a few of them are a little remnant of the ancient <hi>Picts</hi>; other few are descended from the ancient <hi>Albins:</hi> who leaving the hills, after the defeat of the <hi>Picts,</hi> did betake themselves to the Low Countrey. Divers from the South parts of <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> had fled thither from the Tyranny of the <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> as they did of old from the Tyranny of the Romans. Then the English, being so oft in <hi>Scotland</hi> with their Armies, have left divers in the Countrey. Also Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and other private occasions, have drawn sundry men from <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Lastly, sundry of the Low-Countrie people are come from beyond Seas, as from <hi>France, Germany, Hungary, Flanders, Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> of late dayes: So all being reckoned, they are but few in the Low Countrey come of the old <hi>Albins, Brigantes,</hi> or old <hi>Picts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Low-Countrey men calls the High-landers <hi>Irish,</hi> not so much for their ancient descent, as for their language, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differing from the Irish by dialect; and for their wayes of living not much unlike: yet one main difference is to be seen in the activity of the Scots, and the lazinesse of the Irish. On the other side, the Highlanders calls the Low-Countrey men



<pb facs="tcp:61872:21"/>
               <hi>Saxons,</hi> not so much for their descent (although many of them are come from the Southern people, as we have said, who are a Progenie of the <hi>Saxons</hi>) as for the language, which differeth onely by dialect from the language of the South, which acknowledgeth the <hi>Saxon</hi> language for its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue, and for the way of living not so different, save that the Scots are harder bred, and consequently, more fitted for toyling at War namely, then the English are; for we see the English to have pain to toyle, and endure Wars, at the first going to the Field, by reason of their tender and soft breeding. The language of the South-<hi>Britons</hi> of old, was not much different from that of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> from whence they came into <hi>Albion</hi>; witnesse <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in <hi>Agricola</hi> his Life: The <hi>Gauls</hi> then did speak a corrupt Greek,<note place="margin">In no Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage are the Greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors so well turned, as in French.</note> for they are come of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Besides, many words of the old <hi>Gaulois,</hi> the phrase and construction, are to this day in the French lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage kept; which doth signifie, that of old the Greek was spoken in <hi>Gaule,</hi> although corrupt grosly by ignorant men without learning, who neither could reade nor write. Yet in the South parts of <hi>Gaule,</hi> neer the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, wherein the Greek Islands are, the Greeke was spoken and taught, at <hi>Marseilles</hi> namely. The ancient language of the <hi>Britons</hi> suffred a great change by the Romans, and other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, who brought in amongst them their terms of Law, of divine Service, of War, and of Policie, with the names of divers Commodities, and the names of divers Trades.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> came into the Land, they confined the remnant of the ancient <hi>Britons</hi> unto the West Countrey, with their language, such as it was left unto them by the Romans, and other forreigners of old, and with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves planted the language which is spoken in all <hi>England</hi> now adays, with some alteration and change. The first nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change happened by the <hi>Normans,</hi> in whose language the Law hath been administred, &amp;c. The next change is from the <hi>Latin,</hi> in which language divine Service hath been for many yeers Officiated. Then the English language hath borrowed from all neighbour Nations many words, without any great change; so that the English language is said to be the quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essence



<pb facs="tcp:61872:21"/>
of all neighbour Languages: From it the Scotish Tongue differs but in dialect, as we have said. The High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers Language, as hath been said likewise, is Irish, which of old was a corrupt Greek also; for the Irish came into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from the North parts of <hi>Spain,</hi> who spake a corrupt Greek, as those of <hi>Gaule</hi> did; for the ancient in-dwellers of the North parts of <hi>Spain</hi> came also from the Greek Islands. So that of old, the Language of the ancient <hi>Britons</hi> was not altogether strange unto the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> or <hi>Alpins</hi>; yea, in this time wherein we live, notwithstanding the great changes that both the Languages have sustained by time, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of forreign Nations, they have many words which are one and the same, signifying the same thing.</p>
            <p>Thus much I have written of the beginning, names, way of living, and Languages of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to make known to all, how unjust and injurious unto us are some modern Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our neighbour Countreys; who first think they cannot prove their own people to be sufficiently ancient, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they take from their neighbour their just right of good Antiquity. Next, they conceive they cannot set forth fully enough the greatnesse of their own Countrey, except they make their neighbours no people at all, or at least, hardly considerable. Thirdly, they imagine, That they cannot extoll and magnifie the glory of their Countrey highly enough, unlesse they not onely depresse and extenuate their neighbours name, but also attribute unto themselves the advantages of their neighbours. But if these Antiquaries had considered with the eyes of men, That there is enough to be said for the credit of their own Countrey, without wronging others, they had not so stuffed their Books with mistaken and mis-applied Allegations of good ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, nor with Collection of fabulous and lying Monks tales, wherein some of them do fansie Learning mainly to consist. But of this enough.</p>
            <p>For this place, I will only adde this: As the Scots, although they be not of the greatest people, yet they are truely one of the most ancient People in <hi>Europe</hi>; So I dare be bold to say, That God (to whose praise be it spoken) in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse



<pb facs="tcp:61872:22"/>
towards them hath raised up of them, and amongst them, so many excellent and vertuous men, in Church and State, in Piety and Learning, in Policy and War, at home and abroad, of old and of late, that few Nations, ancient or moderne, although of greater bounds, can compare with them; fewer equall them, and hardly any at all go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them in this; for which we praise God, who of the best things hath given us the best measure; and say with the Historian,<note place="margin">

            <p>But now, since all former walls of separation and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, both ancient and moderne, Civill and Ecclesiasticall, are in a great measure taken away by Gods blessing: and since in so many respects the Scots and English are so neer one unto another, as we have said: But above all, since they both are members of the true Church and pure Spouse of Christ Jesus, to the upholding of whose Truth, and purging of it from uncleannesse they have newly bound themselves together as one People, yea, as one man, Let them then, in Gods Name, laying aside all excuses, envies, jealousies, and by-ends, as feeling members of one and the same Body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur unanimously, with their mutuall and best endeavours, to settle the true Worship of God in all true purity, and quiet all things speedily with wisedom, to the good of the people, with due obedience to our lawfull Sovereign under God, as we are taught by the Law of God, the Law of Nature, the Law of Nations, and the Municipall Laws of our severall Countreys. But to return to the Church.</p>
            <p>The Scots, although they received amongst them the light of the Gospel with the very first of the Gentiles, as we have said, yet had they not the Evangel so universally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed thorow the whole Countrey, till towards the first yeers of the third Age; that is, till <hi>Donald</hi> the first; who not onely professed the Faith of Christ himself, with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but did his best to cast out Idolatry wholly from his Dominions, and to settle the Ministery of the Gospel in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner thereof: But this religious King could not bring



<pb facs="tcp:61872:22"/>
to passe this his good Designe fully, being diverted by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Wars against the Romans the whole course of his life.</p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Donald,</hi> till toward the later end of the third age; that is, to the Reign of <hi>Crathilinth,</hi> this work of totally putting down Idolatry, and setling the Gospel every where in the Countrey, by the negligence of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Princes, was at a stay. In this King <hi>Crathilinth</hi> his dayes fell out the ninth persecution under <hi>Aurelius,</hi> and the tenth under <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> which gave occasion to many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians from divers parts of the Empire, but namely from the South parts of <hi>Britanie,</hi> now another time to flie into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for refuge, as they had done before under <hi>Domitian.</hi> Among those fugitives who did then repair into <hi>Scotland</hi> for shelter from the generall massacre, were many excellent men in Piety and Learning, whom the King <hi>Crathilinth</hi> not onely kindely received, but also employed to ayd and help him and his Councell in the further setling of Christs Truth in his Kingdom, and in the totall extirpation of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry out of it; which was so much the harder work, because of the <hi>Druides,</hi> the principall false Prophets, and Idolatrous Priests in those dayes; who not onely by their subtill hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and sense-pleasing Divine Service, but also by a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forecast, having drawn into their hands the hearing and determining of Civill affairs, had so gained upon the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the poor and simple people, that they could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how to be without them, and live. The resolute care and diligence of King <hi>Crathilinth</hi> and his Councell, with the help of those pious and learned men, surpasseth all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and having put quite down the Groves and Altars under the Oaks, and, in a word, all Idoll Service, establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pure Worship of the true God in every place of his Dominions, and filled up the rooms of those false Prophets, with godly and learned Teachers of the people; which was done every where thorow the Kingdom, but particularly in the Islands, which those pious men chose for their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall abode, as being most fit for a retired life; and namely, in the Isle of <hi>Man</hi> the King <hi>Crathilinth</hi> caused to build a



<pb facs="tcp:61872:23"/>

Those godly men being setled as aforesaid, and having withdrawn themselves from the sollicitude of worldly affairs, did wholly give themselves to divine Service, that is, To instruct the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, comfort the weak, administer the Sacraments to the people, and to train up Novices and Disciples, to do the same service in their due time.

These Overseers or Superintendents chosen of themselves, and by themselves, did discharge the Duties of their Function, indifferently every where, thorowout the whole Kingdom, without restraining themselves to any certain place, or Lording over their Brethren, or any part of the Flock of Jesus Christ, not attributing unto themselves any particular distinct holy order from the rest, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

onely to them, and to be onely conferred by them. This way of instructing the People, and governing the Church by <hi>Culdees,</hi> did continue for many yeers, under Gods mercy; the Ministery of Gods Church, as yet, not being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a businesse of gain, and of worldly pomp and pride; So these <hi>Culdees</hi> and Overseers of others, had no other emulation, but of weldoing, nor striving, but to advance true Pietie and godly Learning. The Overseers of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents of the <hi>Culdees,</hi> were commonly called by the Writers who writ of those dayes, <hi>Scotorum Episcopi,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any definition of place, or preeminence of one above another.

After the death of <hi>Fincormac,</hi> both the Church and State of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> fell in great disorder and troubles, by domestick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensions and factions for some yeers. The Roman Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Maximus,</hi> seeing the intestine troubles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to lay hold upon the occasion. First, he foments their divisions within them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> next, not onely he withdraws under fair promises from the Scots their ancient Allies, the <hi>Picts,</hi> but also obtains help of the <hi>Picts</hi> to make Warre against the Scots, and so to defeat them, which he did effectuate indeed in a battell fought with much bloodshed on both sides, at the Water of <hi>Dun,</hi> in <hi>Carrick,</hi> wherein the King <hi>Ewen</hi> was killed (this defeat fell out about 380. in the yeer of Christ) the most part of the Nobilitie, and numbers of People of those that escaped, some fled into the West Isles, some into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others to the Northern parts of <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Scandia</hi>; some submitted themselves to the will and discretion of the Conquerour, with the poor people that had not taken arms. Among those that fled away, was <hi>Ethod</hi> the Kings Brother, who went with sundry of the Nobilitie unto <hi>Scandia,</hi> where he and they stayed divers yeers, and from whence now and then they made secret attempts upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the help of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,



<pb facs="tcp:61872:24"/>
retired into the Islands and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but to small effect.</p>
            <p>Now as the face of the politique State of the Countrey was quite altered and undone, so the condition of the Church also was much disordered, and the <hi>Culdees</hi> were constrained to withdraw, and seek shelter up and down, where they could finde any; namely, they returned into the Isles, and into <hi>Ireland</hi>: At last the <hi>Picts</hi> perceiving by severall attempts made by the exiled Scots, to return home, and re-establish their State (although with little successe, as we have said) that the Scots were fully resolved to bestirre themselves continually, till they were restored, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>established in their ancient Inheritances; the <hi>Picts</hi> themselves being moved with the groaning miseries of their neighbour poor people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> now under the Roman yoak, chiefly by their means; and taking to their consideration, how foolishly they had suffered themselves be so farre cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented and deluded by the Romans, as to contribute to the ruine of their old friends; by whom, mainly in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, they had withstood the common enemy, did not onely comfort the poor oppressed remainers of the Scots at home, but also did invite these that were in exile to return, promising unto them the Lands which they had of theirs, and to help them with all their strength and counsell, in the recovery of their whole State from the Roman Tyrants. The exiled Scots under the conduct of <hi>Fergus</hi> the second, son to <hi>Ethod,</hi> beyond Sea, gathered all they could, both of their own people, and of their friends, from the places of their exile, namely, from <hi>Scandie,</hi> and from <hi>Ireland</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whence they chased away the Romans, by strong hand, with the help of the <hi>Picts,</hi> who made good their promise unto them, both in assisting them in the action of Warre, and in restoring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the Land that they had been possessed with by the Romans. The Auxiliaries from <hi>Ireland</hi> stayed still in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and had allowed unto them the Countrey of <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> for their reward; and because they were of the ancient <hi>Brigants</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> some of the late Writers have said,



<pb facs="tcp:61872:24"/>
That the <hi>Brigantes</hi> of <hi>Albion</hi> had their abode in <hi>Galloway.</hi> No sooner is <hi>Fergus</hi> Crowned in the fatall Chair, and setled in his Kingdom, but he takes to his first care to restore the puritie of Divine Service, which had been eclipsed in these bounds for severall yeers; and to this effect, he calls some of the dispersed <hi>Culdees</hi> of his Country, whom he settles in their ancient abodes; namely, in the Isle of <hi>Iona,</hi> where he furnished them with a Library of Books which he had gathered beyond Sea, as the Story tells us.</p>
            <p>This return of <hi>Fergus</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> son of <hi>Ethod,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to late <hi>Ewen,</hi> fell out about the yeer 420. The regaining by the Scots of their native Countrey, under the command of <hi>Fergus</hi> the second, will not seem strange unto them who have read what they did under the commands of <hi>William Wallace,</hi> and how under the conduct of <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> they recovered their liberty from the thraldom wherewith they were then oppressed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ewen,</hi> son to <hi>Fergus</hi> the second, by the counsell and ayd of his Grand-father by his Mother <hi>Grame</hi>; did not onely keep his Fathers ancient Kingdom, but also did enlarge the Limits thereof, having passed the next Wall of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which by <hi>Grame</hi> was pulled down in many places, hence it is called <hi>Grames</hi> Dyke; and he possessed himself, and the <hi>Picts</hi> with all the Lands lying an hundred miles Southward, that is, unto <hi>Tyne,</hi> and kept them till the entry of the <hi>Saxons</hi> into the Island. Next, he took unto his care not onely to seek out the <hi>Culdees</hi> fugitives, which had not yet returned, under his Father, but also he sent for others into the neighbour Countrey of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and assigned unto them convenient places for their abode, with a moderate competency of means for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that they should be in no wayes burdensome to the people, now looking to have some respite from their pressures and grievances. And such was the happinesse of these dayes, that a very small proportion did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Church-men, setting wholly their mindes to the conscionable discharge of their calling, which they did, Preaching Gods Word carefully, truely, and simply, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing

            </p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:61872:26"/>By these Authorities we see, That the Scots, before <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> had no Bishops at all; or at least, their Bishops were not of any distinct Order from other Priests and Culdees, by whom they were ordained, and of whom they were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, as we have touched before: and so they were not as those Bishops have been with us, in these later times.</p>
            <p>Next, let us observe, That the Scots Bishops, since <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> must acknowledge themselves clients of the Roman Antichrist, seeing of him they have their beginning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance: although in words, yea, in some part of Doctrine, they seem to disclaim him, yet in many parts they shew themselves to be of his Family, namely, in Government; for they, with him, Lord over the Inheritance of Christ, and, forsooth, take unto themselves the name of Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, as if they were Lords of the Spirits of men, contrary to Gods Word, wherein we are taught, That the Father and Maker of Spirits, is the onely Lord over them: or at least, Lords of Spirituall things, against the expresse words of the Apostles, who acknowledge themselves to be onely Ministers of the Spirit, and spirituall things, reputing it the greatest honour in the world to be so. And <hi>Peter,</hi> who after he had stiled himself no more then co-Presbyter with the rest of the Presbyters, he forbids them to Lord over the sort of Christ. Then, since in the first Primitive Church the Functions of Bishop, and Pastor, and Presbyter were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguished, and any one of the names indifferently deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Office, it must be confessed, That the change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which hath entred into the Church is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Christ and his Apostles, neither by Precept nor Example, but contrary to Christs Will and Intention, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in his Word; and according to the inventions of men, serving to the exorbitant affections of avarice, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lust; to the satisfaction of which, they have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineered over the Flock of Christ, like tyrants, devoured the substance thereof, like ravening Wolves: yea, what is worse, they have not onely been negligent and carelesse to distribute unto the people the Word of God, but also with their might and power have hindered and stopped others to



<pb facs="tcp:61872:27"/>
make known unto Gods people the pure light of his Gospel, the ordinary means of salvation; and consequently, so farre as in them lieth, by thus starving the people of this heavenly Food, send them to hell. Such were these Spirituall Lords; who,<note place="margin">See the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate of the Prelats by <hi>Huntley.</hi> 1637.</note> as they have encroached upon the Spirituall Lordship of Christ Jesus over his Flock, and usurped his Authority; yea, and opposed it flatly, under the name of Spirituall Authority and Jurisdiction; so have they boldly and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly invaded the Prerogative of civill Magistrates, by their Courts and Regalities within the Dominions of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they live: Yea, in sundry places they usurp the full Authority of Princes, and in others they flatly oppose it. And all this hath been done, not onely of old, by those who were called Romish Bishops, but also in our dayes by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; who in some things make a shew that they disclaim their Father the <hi>Pontif Roman,</hi> whom in their heart they love and respect, as their actions do witnesse.</p>
            <p>Although by <hi>Palladius</hi> Prelacy was brought in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by that means the Government was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and thereafter immediately by degrees other alterations crept into the Church, yet those times after <hi>Palladius,</hi> till the sixth Age, I mean, till <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monk, may be said to be golden times, and pure, in regard of the following dayes, wherein Church-men, without any restraint, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned themselves to ambition, avarice, and lust, neglecting altogether their Function; for in these fourth and fifth Ages they were many godly and learned men, who were dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in discharging the true Duty of a Pastor, as <hi>Colombe, Libthac, Ethernan, &amp;c.</hi> Then <hi>Knitogerne,</hi> who by nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name was called <hi>Mongo</hi>; because his Master <hi>Servian</hi> speaking unto him, used ordinarily this expression, <hi>Mon ga,</hi> which in corrupt French is as much to say, as <hi>My boy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Palladius</hi> having brought into the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, as we have said, takes to his next care to provide for the maintenance of this new Degree and Order; which was obtained without great difficulty, both of Prince and people, under pretext of Piety; but with bad successe, as by the wofull experience of following times we have found.</p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:61872:27"/>These new Bishop-Prelats, having pretty well setled their own condition for maintenance, which although it did exceed much the allowance of former Ages to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet it was very moderate in regard of the following times: Next, they obtained great Lands and Revenues from Prince and People, for other Presbyters and Ministers, who formerly had been very little burdensome to the people; for by their own industry and work of their hands, did provide for themselves, necessaries for the most part; by this means, the Prelats tie the other Presbyters and Ministers to them, and secondarily bring in, by little and little, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and slacknesse in discharging their calling, from whence are risen all the evills we have seen since in the Church.</p>
            <p>After the beginning of the fifth Age, to wit, 521. yeers, in this Island began (the old <hi>Saturnalia</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was first kept in honour of <hi>Saturne</hi>; but by the Successors of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> it was ordained to be kept, to the memory of him, and was called <hi>Iulia</hi>) to be celebrated unto the honour of Christs Birth, in the later end of <hi>December.</hi> The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was this, <hi>Arthur</hi> that renowned Prince wintering at <hi>York</hi> (whereof, he newly had made himself Master) with his Nobles, bethought himself with them, to passe some dayes in the dead of winter in good chear and mirth, which was done forth with, as it is given out for devotion to Christ, although, that then true Devotion was very little regarded; for as these men did exceed the Romans during this Feast in Ryot and Licentiousnesse; So they continued the Feast double the time that the Ethnick Romans were wont to kept it; for the Romans kept it onely five dayes, but these kept it ten dayes with their new devotion; yea, those of the richer sort in time following have kept it fifteene dayes. Thus was the beginning of the prophane idlenesse and ryot of Christmas, now kept twelve dayes with foolish excesse and ryot. As these Christmas keepers did mistake the way of honouring Christs Birth, by this kinde of solemnity; so did they mistake the time of his Birth; for the most exact Chronologers tells us, that Christ was born in <hi>October,</hi> and not in <hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:61872:28"/>The Scots retain still the old name <hi>Iulia,</hi> of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous-holy-Feast, for they call it corruptly <hi>Iul</hi>: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they never kept it of old, not being subject to the Romans.</p>
            <p>The French and Italians, in this, are nothing behinde with us;<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But the corruptions that were brought in our Church from <hi>Rome</hi> in the fourth and fifth Age, were nothing to what was brought in in the sixth and seventh Age, for then was Religion turned upside down, and so changed into Superstitious Ceremonies, and Idolatry, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by false miracles, that there was hardly left any trace of true Religion among men in these dayes. <hi>Palladius</hi> was the first that acquainted us with <hi>Rome,</hi> as we have said, and that brought in Prelacy amongst us, a little after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fourth Age, which he and his Successors by degrees brought unto a great height, both in worldly pomp and means (for the times) by the inconsiderate, debon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narty of the Prince, and simplicitie of the people, but not without struggling and resistance, by pious and wise men, for many yeers; it was the work of Church-men, set a foot by <hi>Palladius</hi> so till the sixth Age, that is, upon the matter, two hundred yeers, to raise themselves to Power, and Authority, and Means, whereunto they came insensibly, so much the rather, because they were sparing for these dayes, to invert the main Doctrine of the true Religion. The People and Magistrate seeing their Religion remaining in its maine, were, without great difficulty, drawn over to give way unto the greatnesse of the Church-men; But when these gallant fellows had wrought their own ends, they did shew plainly what was within their hearts; for then they declared themselves to be enemies both to God and to Man, by their vitious lives, contrary to the Laws of God and man; Their false Doctrine, contrary to Gods Word;



<pb facs="tcp:61872:28"/>
their Tyrannicall domineering over the people; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themselves from due obedience, unto the lawfull Magistrate. In a word, by directly opposing God, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing men to their utter ruine of soul and body, and setting up their own inventions for the Laws of God, and men, they were a bringing this height of iniquitie to passe, about the matter of two hundred yeers likewise, to wit, the sixth and seventh Age, although the workers of iniquity did at last bring their mischievous designe to an end, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of God, irritated against men for their sins, who not adhearing unto him, were abandoned so, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a prey unto Satan and his instruments, to follow all iniquity; yet, such was the mercy of God towards men in these most corrupt times, that the devill and his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments went not so cleerly on with their wicked businesse, but they had now and then, from time to time, remoraes and lets in it, by those whom God raised up to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to his Trueth; and in these dayes, sundry of the Scots Divines were very stout in the keeping of the ancient Tenets and Rites (which they had received from their first Apostles, Disciples to Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> according to the Church of the East; Witnesse the great strugling they had about the keeping of <hi>Pasche,</hi> or <hi>Easter</hi>-day; for till then, the Scots had kept the day of <hi>Pasche,</hi> upon the fourteen day of the Moon, whatsoever day of the week it fell out on; the Romanists called those that kept so this day, <hi>quartadecima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> and condemned them as Hereticks, and they kept the day constantly upon the next Sunday following, and not upon a working day; at last the Scots were constrained to yeeld in this,<note place="margin">Colmannus <hi>&amp; complures alii, qui maluerunt optione data loco ceders, quam ritus Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae ecclesiae recipere.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:61872:29"/>About the end of the seventh Age; men from <hi>Scotland,</hi> given to ambition and avarice, went frequently to <hi>Rome</hi> for preferment in the Church; and seeing it lay much that way then, they did their best to advance the designe of the Romish Party, wherein all the skill of worldly men was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, both in <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; among the Scots of that Party; many men went to and fro, between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to bring the Scots to a full obedience unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and conformitie; by name there was one <hi>Boniface</hi> sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> a main Agent for <hi>Rome</hi> in these affairs; but he was opposed openly, by severall of the Scots <hi>Culdees,</hi> or Divines; namely, by <hi>Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Samson,</hi> who told him freely, That he, and those of his Party, studied to bring men to the subjection of the Pope, and slavery of <hi>Rome,</hi> withdrawing them from obedience to Christ; and so in plain termes, they reproached to him, and to his assistants; That they were corrupters of Christs Doctrine, establishing a Sovereignty in the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the onely successour of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, excluding other Bishops; That they used and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Clericall tonsure; That they forbad Priests Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, extolling Celibat; That they caused Prayers to be made for the dead, and erected Images in the Churches; to be short, That they had introduced in the Church many Tenets, Rites and Ceremonies, unknown to the ancient and pure times, yea, contrary to them. For the which, and the like, the said <hi>Clemens,</hi> and those that were constant to the Truth, with him were excommunicated at <hi>Rome</hi> as Hereticks, as you have in the third Volume of the <hi>Concels</hi>: although the true reasons of their excommunication be not there set down.</p>
            <p>In the eighth Age, the poor people were so blindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved and intoxicat with the Cup of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they thought it a truely holy Martyrdome to suffer for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>Rome</hi>; yet, although most men had left God, to worship the Beast, in these dayes God raised up sundry great Lights in our Church, as <hi>Alcuin, Rabanus Maurus</hi> his Disciple, <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> and <hi>Claudius Clemens.</hi> In this we shall remarke the constant goodnesse of God towards his people,



<pb facs="tcp:61872:29"/>
who made his Light shine in some measure thorow the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and thickest darknesse, by raising up these men, who did bear witnesse to the Truth, both by word and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so that God did not altogether leave off his people. The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> caused to declare <hi>Alcuin</hi> (for his Book of the <hi>Eucharist</hi>) many yeers after his death an Heretike. So <hi>Rome</hi> persecutes the Saints of God, even after their death.</p>
            <p>In the ninth Age, both Prince and People, by dolefull experience, did finde the idlenesse, pride, ambition, avarice and ryot of Church-men, occasioned by the indulgence of Prince and People; wherefore, at <hi>Scone</hi> under King <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the second, there was had a convention of States for reforming the disorders in the Church. In this Assembly it was ordained, That Church-men should reside upon their charge; have no medling with secular affairs; that they should instruct the people diligently, and be good examples in their conversations; that they should not keep Hawks, Hounds, and Horses, for their pleasure; that they should carry no Weapons, nor be pleaders of civill Causes, but live contented with their own provisions: in case of failing in the observance of these points; For the 1, time, they were to pay a <hi>pecuniary mulct</hi> or fine; for the 2, they were to be deprived from <hi>Officio</hi> and <hi>Beneficio.</hi> Thus you see, in these most blinde and confused times, That resolute Princes and People did oppose manifestly the Popes omnipotency, and highest Sovereignty. In the later part of the same Age, King <hi>Gregory</hi> was most indulgent to Church-men; he was so farre from curbing and keeping them under, that he granted them many things they had not had before. Then in a conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of States holden at <hi>Forsane,</hi> it was ordained, That all Church-men should be free of paying Taxes and Impost; from keeping watch, and going to warfare. <hi>Item,</hi> They should be exempt from all Temporall judicature. <hi>Item,</hi> All Matrimoniall Causes were given over to be judgement of Church-men; as also Testaments, Legative Actions, and all things depending upon simple faith and promise. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the right of Tithes, with liberty to make Lawes,



<pb facs="tcp:61872:30"/>
Canons, and Constitutions; to try without the assistance of the temporall Judge, Heretikes, Blasphemers, Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Persons, Magicians, &amp;c. Lastly, it was ordained, That all Kings following, at their Coronation, should swear, to maintain Church-men in these their Liberties and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>In these dayes lived a Learned man, called <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Aerigiena,</hi> because he was born in the Town of <hi>Aire</hi>; he published a Treatise, <hi>De corpore &amp; sanguine Domini in Sacramento,</hi> wherein he maintained the opinion and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Bertram</hi>; whereby he offended highly the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the tenth Age things grew worse and worse, The Church-men did so blinde the King <hi>Constantine</hi> the third, That they perswaded him to quit the Royall Crown, and take the Clericall Tonsure of a Monk, which he did at Saint <hi>Andrews</hi>; There were some Priests in these dayes, who did strive to have liberty to take lawfull Wives, but in vain. A little thereafter, there were new disputes for Priests marriage; one <hi>Bernet</hi> a Scots Bishop, stood much for that cause in a nationall Councell. In this Age, although that avarice and ambition, had corrupted, and perverted Religion generally, yet there were constantly some godly men, who albeit they could not openly stop and oppose the torrent of these times, given to Idolatry and Superstition, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and teach the people, That Christ was the onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for sin, and that Christs blood onely did wash us from the guilt of sin.</p>
            <p>In the eleventh Age, <hi>Malcome</hi> gave away a part of the Crown Lands among his Nobles, for their good service against the <hi>Danes</hi>; the Nobles in recompence thereof, did grant unto the Crown the ward of these Lands, with the benefit that was to arise by the marriage of the Heir. Untill the later part of this Age, the Bishops of <hi>Scotland,</hi> although they had raised their Order unto a great power and riches, yet they were not distinguished in Diocesses, so till then indifferently, wheresoever they came, they did Ministrate their Function, without lording over one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular



<pb facs="tcp:61872:30"/>
place, or calling themselves Lords of any place. The Diocesses wherein <hi>Scotland</hi> was divided at first, were these, Saint <hi>Andrews, Glasgo, Murray, Catnes, Murthlac,</hi> or <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene.</hi> The Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> taking upon them in these dayes to be above Kings, and to conferre in matters of Honour, upon Kings, how, and where they pleased; and so by this means, to put a farther tye of Vassalage and subjection upon Princes. To this effect, in the yeer 1098. ordained King <hi>Edgar</hi> to be anointed with externall Oyl by the Bishop of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> a rite, which till that day, had not been in use among our Kings: yet they were as much the anointed of the Lord before, as they have been since, and as any other Princes, who before them had this externall anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi>; although the Romish Writers do make a greater esteem of these Kings anointed by them, then of others, because they conceive them to be more their own. Here note by the way, That all Princes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever in Scripture-Language, are said to be the Anointed of the Lord; and so <hi>Cyrus</hi> was named, although he was never anointed with externall Oyl. Next, although the first Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were anointed, as <hi>Saul, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> with some of the following Kings; namely, where there was any opposition feared of setling them in the Royall Throne; for further Confirmation were anointed. Read diligently the History of the Kings, and you shall not finde that each one, or every one of them was anoynted external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, although they were all the Anoynted of the Lord. Next, you shall note, That the Oyl wherewith <hi>Samuel</hi> anoynted <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> (and so the Oyl wherewith other Kings were anoynted) was not an Oyl consecrated, as that wherewith the High-Priest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was anoynted, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Oyl.</p>
            <p>The reason of the Scripture-phrase whereby all Princes are said to be anoynted, is this: Anoynting, in first and most ancient times, was a signe of setting apart of a man for the Office of a King. Hence, by progresse of time, any man that was set aside by Gods providence to execute the Office of a King, whether he came thereunto by Succession,



<pb facs="tcp:61872:31"/>
or by choice, or by Conquest, was called the Anoynted of the Lord, because they had the thing signified by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, notwithstanding they wanted the signe, to wit, the Oyntment.</p>
            <p>Further we shall observe here, That not onely those whom God hath set aside to be Kings, be called the Anoynted of the Lord; but also the people whom he hath set aside or apart for a peculiar end: So the Prophet, speaking of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> in Gods Name, useth this expression, <hi>Touch not mine Anoynted: For their sake I have reproved Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover note, That as the people set aside by God are said to be his Anoynted, so they are also called, <hi>A Royall Priesthood, Kings and Priests.</hi> Not that every one of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is a King or a Priest, these being particular Callings, no more then they were anoynted; but because they are set aside by God as Priests, to offer daily unto him the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Righteousnesse, &amp;c. And as Kings were anoynted with Oyl, to signifie their setting aside for their peculiar Office; so every one of us, being anoynted in Baptisme by the holy Spirit, is set aside to do justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a King, in our severall station.</p>
            <p>Thus much have I, in few words, spoken of Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynting, and how the people are said to be anoynted, or to be Priests and Kings, because in the beginning of the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Age, sundry were condemned as hereticks, for saying, That every man is a Priest in some kinde; and that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynting of Kings is now needlesse, being an invention of <hi>Rome,</hi> to subject Princes unto it.</p>
            <p>Some yeers after the beginning of the twelfth Age, King <hi>David,</hi> beside the Bishopricks formerly erected, did erect the Bishoprick of <hi>Rosse, Breachen, Dunkel,</hi> and <hi>Dumblane.</hi> This debonaire Prince was so profuse towards Church-men, that he gave them a good part of the ancient Patrimony of the Crown: So he and his Successors were necessitated to lay Taxes and Impost upon the people, more then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the harm of the Common-wealth. In this also he wronged the Church: for the Clergie being rich and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, left their Function, and gave themselves over to all



<pb facs="tcp:61872:31"/>
riot and idlenesse. Till riches made Church-men lazie, this distinction in discharging the Duty of a Pastor, or of the souls <hi>per se, aut per alium,</hi> was unknown. While riches did not so abound in the Church, Church-men kept more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in the discharging of their places.</p>
            <p>In this twelfth Age, the Scots, although they had Bishops ever since <hi>Palladius,</hi> who for a long time did discharge the Function indifferently in every place where they came to: And although they had of later times distinguished the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the bounds wherein they were to execute their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, by Diocesses; yet in that Age, I say, they were not come to that height, to have Primates, Metropolitans, and Arch-bishops. Wherefore their neighbour, the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> having gained the consent of the Pope, bestir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself very earnestly, by the assistance of his King, to have the Scotish Bishops acknowledge him for the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane; whereunto the stoutest of the Scotish Clergie would not consent; but they would depend immediately upon the Pope: and to this effect, Legats were sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Scotland</hi>; who being come hither, and seeing the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Scotish Bishops not to submit to the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi>; and finding their own benefit thereby, they did exempt and free the Scots Clergie, from the trouble of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke.</hi> There was one <hi>Gilbert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> a great strugler for this businesse.</p>
            <p>About the later end of this Age, sundry Priests were put from their Office, because they had taken Orders upon Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. In that time there was a Synod in <hi>Perth</hi> of Divines, such as they were, who decreed, That Sunday should be kept holy from all work, from Saturday at mid-day, or twelve of the clock, till Munday morning.</p>
            <p>In the thirteenth Age, few yeers after the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, divers kindes of Monks came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Land; as <hi>Dominicans, Franciscans, Iacobins,</hi> and sundry other of that sort of Locusts. In this Age these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of Monks did so multiply every where, that at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Lyons</hi> it was decreed, <hi>That no more new Orders of Monks



<pb facs="tcp:61872:32"/>
should be admitted or tolerated.</hi> But how the Decree hath been kept, we see in our dayes.</p>
            <p>Next, the Monks of severall kindes gave themselves so to Begging, that the people were much eaten up by them, and the poor his portion was withdrawn; which occasioned a great murmure among the Commons. Upon this, there was a Decree made then, <hi>That onely the Minorites, Praedicants, Carmelites, and Hermits of S.</hi> Augustine, <hi>should have liberty to beg:</hi> Whence they are called, The four Mendicants; <hi>Les quatre Mendiants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards the end of this thirteenth Age fell out that great desolation of the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> occasioned by the Controversie for the Succession of the Crown, betwixt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liol</hi> and <hi>Bruce; Baliol</hi> being constrained by the States of <hi>Scotland</hi> to break the promise he had made to <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> To subject the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> unto him, for judging the cause on his side. After much trouble and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of War, the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> receives <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> come of the second Branch, for King, recalling all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Allegiance that they had given to <hi>Baliol,</hi> because of his unworthinesse to Reign: who, beside unfitnesse to bear rule over a Military People, had basely condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enslave that Nation, to whom their Liberty hath been so dear to this day, that for it, and the purity of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which both, by Gods mercy, they now enjoy, they have willingly and cheerfully undergone all hazard of life and means; judging, That if they suffered these two twins, Liberty and Religion, either to be infringed, or taken from them, they had nothing left them, whereby they might be called men.</p>
            <p>The remarkable History of King <hi>Iames</hi> the first of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> fitteth this purpose very well. The Passage is this: King <hi>Iames</hi> the first going into <hi>France,</hi> was taken by the English, and kept prisoner by them for many yeers. In that time the King of <hi>England</hi> goes to <hi>France,</hi> to make Warre; and at his arrivall there, he findes an Army of Scots ready to fight for the <hi>Alliay</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the French King, against the English. Upon this, the King of <hi>England</hi> moves King



<pb facs="tcp:61872:32"/>
               <hi>Iames,</hi> whom he had taken along with him, to write unto the Scots, and to charge them, upon their Allegiance, not to draw their Sword against the party where he their King was in person. The Scots answered, That they were sent into <hi>France</hi> to assist their <hi>Alliays</hi> against the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. As for him who writ unto them, since he was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and not a free man, they neither owed him Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, nor would they give him any, so long as he was in prison; but if he were set at liberty, and were living among them, they would obey him according to the Laws of the Countrey; since the Crown was setled upon him by the consent of the States, and so they did; for these Kingdoms were governed in his name, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with him, during the time of his imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was very long; but when he went home, he was received and obeyed as King. From this Princes may learn, that although people do submit themselves to their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the resignation is not so full as to devest themselves of all power in such a way, That the Prince may dispose of them as he thinks right or wrong, he ordinarily being misled and kept captive, by those that are about him; who for the most part, have no regard to the publike good, nor to the credit and esteem of him, to whom in shew they professe themselves so addicted; the people have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly reserved even unto themselves by the consent of all men, yea, of the greatest Court-parasites and Sycophants of Princes, that the Prince cannot, nor ought not to enslave or subject the people to any Forreign Power; and where Princes by Pusillanimitie and ill counsell, have essayed or attempted such a thing, they have smarted for it, witnesse <hi>Baliol,</hi> who not onely was excluded himself from the Crown, but also his Posterity; and it was setled upon the next Branch, to wit, <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> with his descendents, where it continues to this day by Gods providence. Then since the people have reserved this power in themselves, to stop the Prince, to put them under any Forreign yoak or slavery; is it possible, That they have not reserved a power to right themselves from domestick, and intestine slavery,



<pb facs="tcp:61872:33"/>
and misery, slavery being ever one and the same? For what is it to me by whom I suffer evil of one and the same kinde and degree, whether it be by a neighbour, or a stranger, a forreigner, or a con-citizen? yea, when I suffer by him who should be my friend, and stand for the same Freedom with me, my suffering is the greater.</p>
            <p>To this purpose you have a memorable Passage of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the Norman; who, although he had invaded <hi>England</hi> with the Sword, and by it had defeated him who did oppose him for the Crown, with all his adherents and party, and in consequencie of this Victory, had committed many out-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with a strong hand; yet the same <hi>William</hi> could never assure himself nor his Posterity of the Allegeance of the People, till he had sworn solemnly (according to the Rite of the times) for himself and his, To govern according to the good and approved Laws of the Land, as the best Kings before him had done.</p>
            <p>Then the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> in its own name, and in the name of the whole Kingdom, declared, That neither <hi>Kent,</hi> nor any other of the Kingdom, was conquered, but in a peaceable way did submit to <hi>William</hi> the Norman, upon Condition, and with Proviso, That all their Liberties, and free Customs in use and practice, should be kept. If this was not accomplished afterwards, it was sillinesse of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that suffered themselves to be abused, and the fault of misled Princes, that did not keep their promise whereunto they were tyed: And sundry, for the breach of this promise, have had occasion to repent, when it hath been too late.</p>
            <p>We shall adde one example more, which is, of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; who, <hi>anno</hi> 1525, the seventeenth yeer of his Reign, by the advice of his Councell, put a Tax upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which the people did not onely refuse to pay, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That the thing was unjust and unlawfull. Withall, wherever they met those whom the King had employed for the gathering the money, they used them so kindely, that they did never come twice to one place for the payment of the Tax. The King seeing this, he disclaims the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Tax, and so do the Nobles that convened



<pb facs="tcp:61872:33"/>
at <hi>London,</hi> by his Command, for that purpose, and layes all the fault upon ill counsell, namely, upon <hi>Wolsey.</hi> This was <hi>Henry</hi> constrained to do, notwithstanding his resolutenesse against all forreign enemy, chiefly the Pope, with his shave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. By this instance, <hi>Henry</hi> acknowledged his power to be limited, and no wayes arbitrary: Against the doctrine of our now Cout-parasites.</p>
            <p>Now if the People have this much power in them, as to stand for their Temporall Liberty, both against forreign and domestick slavery; far more may they, and ought they, to defend the Spirituall Freedom, which Christ, having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with his Blood, hath left them, as Members of his Church. But all this defence of Liberty and Religion ought to be made so, that it be without by-ends, sinistrous respects, of hatred, malice, ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The onely scope and main drift being, To have Gods glory, in the Light of his Gospel, setled and maintained, The People at quiet, The Prince obeyed, in God, and for God <hi>(i. e.)</hi> according to the Law of God, Nature, Nations, and the Countrey or Kingdom, so far as possibly can be. This being lookt to carefully, there is no gap opened to Rebellion; which is a fighting against Gods Ordinance, and not the just and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary opposing of the abuse and corrupting of the good Ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>But here a Court-slave will say, If things be so, there is no absolutenesse in Monarchs and Princes?</p>
            <p>To answer this, we must know what is to be meant by <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,</hi> or <hi>absolutenes</hi>; whereof I finde two main significations. First, <hi>absolute</hi> signifieth perfect, and <hi>absolutenesse,</hi> perfection: Hence we have in Latin this expression, <hi>Perfectum est omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, numeris absolutum.</hi> And in our vulgar Language we say, A thing is absolutely good, when it is perfectly good. Next, <hi>absolute</hi> signifieth free from tye or bond; which in Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now, say I, if you take <hi>absolute</hi> for perfect, that Prince or Magistrate is most absolute, that is most perfect, who governs most absolutely, or most perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The absolutenesse or perfection of Government consists in its conformity to the perfect Rule which is written in the



<pb facs="tcp:61872:34"/>
Law of God, printed in the heart of man, received gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of all wise People, and in practice by all particular well-polished Common-wealths. Next, I say, if you take <hi>absolute</hi> for free from tye or bond, That no Prince nor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate is free; for every Magistrate or Prince, as well as the private man, is bound to keep the Law of God, of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not onely in particular things, for his own singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar carriage, but also in publike businesses, for the good and society of men, or of the people: for God hath given his Law, and Nature her Dictates to all, to the observance of which all men are tyed. Yea, farther, they are not onely bound in their severall Conditions, and tyed to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof in their own persons; but also are bound to further it with all their might, and take away all things that may lett and stop this performance, or deterre and withdraw men from it. Read <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. where every man is commanded to rebuke his neighbour, and stop him from sinning. Read <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19, 20. where the King is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have continually the Copie of the Law before him for his Rule and Guide. What is in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.10. is what a King is likely to do, and not what he ought or should do. This is cleer; for in the place now named, in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> the King is told what he ought to do; but that he is said to do in <hi>Samuel,</hi> is contrary to the Ordinance of God. Confer the places, and you will easily see this truth. Next, a Prince is said to be absolute, that is, not in any kinde subaltern to another, and whose subjects acknowledge (under God) no other but him. Hence you may see, That the Popish Kings and Princes are not absolute; for, beside the great number of people within their Dominions who are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate sworn vassalls to the Pope, I mean, the Shavelings; The Prince himself takes Oath, at his Reception, To up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the over-ruling Government of the Pope, under the masked name of Spirituality; and the simple abused Prince shall have for a reward, to make up all, a little holy Oyl to anoynt him, and bear the Title of most Christian or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Princes. Farther, I say, That the Prince, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in some things hath cast off the yoke of this god



<pb facs="tcp:61872:34"/>
upon earth (for so is the Pope now and then called) but keeps up a part of his tyranny in the Church of God over his people, wants and loses so much of his absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for this tye upon him from a forreign Prince, the Pope. But here the Pope sheweth the height of his cunning; for he seeing that Princes are told frequently, That they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther absolute, or ought to be such, bethinks himself to keep up his super-eminency above Princes, as his vassalls, and yet make the Princes finde an absolutenesse; which he acts by his Emissaries, and their inferiour instruments, for their own private ends, whom he makes inculcate in the ears of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, That their absolutenesse consisteth in doing with the Life, Liberty and Fortunes of the People, as seems good in their eyes, without any regard to the good of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which is the true End of all Government: But with this Proviso, That those who have relation to him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, be exempted: and these are not onely his shavelings, who are openly obedient to his commands and orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but also those, yea, in Kingdoms where his name is in a kinde rejected, who keep up his tyrannicall Laws and Ordinances, as we have felt of late, namely, in these Dominions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live, to our wofull experience; for they, to uphold and encrease their power, have cast both Prince and People into great troubles, making the Prince believe, That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them he hath no being.</p>
            <p>But to shew thee that Princes may use the people commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Charge like beasts, and yet neverthelesse are not absolute, cast thy eyes in the neighbour Countreys onely upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi>; who, although they be Sovereigns in a kinde over the people, and deal most hardly with them, taking their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes away at their pleasure, yet they are not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be absolute Princes; for they are vassalls of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and their chief titles are to be Officers thereof: So the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> is qualified Vicar of the Empire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you consider the Prince, and people committed to his Charge, as having relation one to another, I say, they are both bound one to another by Duty; the Prince first bound



<pb facs="tcp:61872:35"/>
to rule and govern according to the Law of God, of Nature, of Nations, and Municipall Laws of the Countrey and the People is bound to obey him accordingly: but if the Prince command any thing against these, his commands are not to be obeyed, God being onely he, to whose commands Obedience is simply due, and to be given; but to men, onely obedience with limitation, and in externall things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws so oft above named, at the least not against them, or opposite to them. The Chimaera, or rather Solaecisme in reason of passive Obedience, is not to be thought on among rationall men, it being the invention of Court-parasites, a meer nothing, or <hi>non ens,</hi> for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience consisteth in action, as all other vertues do, and not is suffering. Farther, whosoever, for not obeying a wicked command of a Superiour, suffereth, if he can stop it, or shun it, is an enemy to his own being, wherein he offends against nature; for you see every naturall thing striveth to conserve it self against what annoyeth it; then he sins against the Order of God, who in vain hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us so many lawfull Means for the preservation of our Being, if we suffer it to be destroyed, having power to help it. But then it will be demanded; What, is there no absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in humane Authority? I answer, simple absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse there is none under God; For all humane Authority is limited by the Laws aforesaid, and extends to farther then externall things; yet comparatively humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is said to be absolute,<note place="margin">

So when <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, having cast off the Romish yoak, and putting down the vassallage of these his Dominions unto the Pope, caused divers Books to be written of the absolute Empire or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Prince; although, after the freeing himself from the Pope, he had not, nor did not pretend to have any more absolute power over the people, then he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but albeit this Prince did much for the regaining the absolute Authority to the Crown again, in chasing away the Romish Pontiff, yet, he did it not fully, in so farre as he kept still the Romish Rites, and the Hierarchy,



<pb facs="tcp:61872:35"/>
or Prelacy, wherein the Romish Fox lurking, hath kept himself in these Countreys unto this day; and now having acted the Fox long enough, he is acting the Woolf by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destroying the people of God; if the Successors of King <hi>Henry</hi> had not kept in the Romish Superstitious Rites and Hierarchy, they, and we all had had better times, then we have all tasted of. Although King <hi>Henry</hi> for his Vices, be blame worthy to all posterity, yet I must say, in all humane appearance, That if the Prelat-Bishops, to whom he trusted the reforming of the abuses of the Church, had been as forward, as he was willing, there had been a better Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation then was in his time, witnesse this instance, <hi>The People desired freedome to read the Scripture, the then Bishops refused this unto the People.</hi> Whereupon the King was petitioned in the name of the People, the King grants their Petition; the Bishops hearing of the Kings grant, thus limit it, not daring to deny it flatly, <hi>That all Gentlemen should have liberty to read the Scripture, since it was the Kings pleasure</hi>; but for others, the permission was stopped: As if Yeomen and Tradesmen, had not as much interest in Gods Word, as Gentlemen. Then remarke all those that were put to death for the testimony of the Truth in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth his dayes, were persecuted by the Bishops of the time, although the blame lieth upon the Prince; for albeit they had in compliance to the King renounced the Pope by word of mouth, yet in effect they kept up his tyranny, by his doctrine (with small alteration changed) his Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Canons and Laws, Prelacie or Hierarchie main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: And seeing the King so opposite to the Pope, they condescended that the King should bear the blasphemous Title of the Pope, <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> although with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy: and so it proved; for notwithstanding all the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes that were made in favour of this Title taken from the Pope, and attributed to the King, the Bishops with cunning and subtill proceedings, kept a foot the power of the Pope; and so soon as they saw the occasion of Queen <hi>Marie</hi> her Reigne, they freely and easily brought all back again to <hi>Rome,</hi> without Maske or Limitation: and ever since,



<pb facs="tcp:61872:36"/>
their successors, although by the course of affairs (they) have been obliged to disclaim the Pope his authority, yea, and his doctrine in some measure; yet they, ever since, to this day, have expressed their inclinations, and done their endeavours to return thither again, as we all know by dolefull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But here it may be demanded, What drift or policie can it be in the Bishops, to desire to be subject to <hi>Rome,</hi> rather then to their Prince, and Laws of the Countrey? The answer is, The propensitie of us all, to follow evill rather then good, is known, namely, When the evill hath the mask of worldly dignitie, pomp, power, and pleasure, which hinders it to be seen in its own colours. Now the Bishops and all the rabble of that corrupt Clergy, are given to Temporall, howsoever unlawfull advantages, as their ambition, avarice, and lust, from the very beginning hath shewn; which exorbitant passions lead men head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, without measure, when once way is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, unlesse they meet with some lett or stop, which is both lesser and slower, when it is a farre off, namely, when it cometh from one who is possessed with the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, and himself of the same order of men with the Delinquent; and so the Bishops of this Island, had rather have to do with the Pope, then with the Prince.</p>
            <p>First, Because of mutuall infirmity the Pope proveth more indulgent then any Prince.</p>
            <p>Next, The Prince is too neer them, and so it is best for them to be so free of the Prince his Jurisdiction, that they may be able not onely to neglect him, but also to oppose him.<note place="margin">Read <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</note> For all, let that example of the <hi>Canterbury</hi>-prelat serve; who made the King for the time to hold the Stirrup when he gat up upon his horse. The Story is known.</p>
            <p>I called a little before the Title of <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> used by the Pope, and then given to <hi>Henry, blasphemous.</hi> To lay aside all other things that may be alleadged against this Title, I shall onely say this; The Church is the Spouse of Christ: No Spouse can be said to have any other Head, but him whose Spouse she is. Now if the Church should acknowledge her self to be the Spouse of any other but of



<pb facs="tcp:61872:36"/>
Christ, she were a professed Whore and Adulteresse. By no means then a Prince is to be called, <hi>The Head of the Church</hi>: For although the civill Magistrate is obliged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his rank and place, to see the Ministers of the Church do the work of the Lord, truely, diligently, and carefully, and to make them do it according to the Will of God declared in his Word; yet for all this, he is nothing but a servant, overseer, or grass, and not the <hi>Head,</hi> which is a Title belonging onely to Christ; wherefore, Princes or Magistrates, that by slavish flatterers had this Title given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them at the first, had done well to reject it, as their Successors, who have followed, had done well likewise, (according to God his Will) if they had not suffered this Title to have been continued unto them, namely, in the publike prayers, where the time-serving inconsiderate Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister prayeth, in the name of the Church, for her <hi>Head</hi>; if the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church needs to be prayed for, then the influences of the Head, upon the Church, will be but poor and weak, &amp;c. But of this enough for this place.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The flattering Preachers, unrequired in the publike prayers in the name of the Church, call the Prince forsooth, <hi>The Breath of our Nostrils,</hi> taking for his ground, the words of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> in his Lamentations, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. Which words, by the Current of the Ancients, and Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint, are to be understood of Christ Jesus; True it is, The <hi>Rabbins</hi> have interpreted the words of one of the Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> to wit, <hi>Iosias,</hi> or <hi>Zedekias</hi>; and hence some of the later Expositors have explained these words, <hi>That first and literally they may be applyed to one of the Kings of</hi> Judah, <hi>who were all figures of Christ to come, but principally, and mainly the words are to be understood of Christ Iesus, by the consent of all</hi>; So to attribute these words to any Prince earthly, cannot be without offense to Christ; For who can be said properly, and well, <hi>To be the Breath of our Nostrils,</hi> but he, who inspireth into us life, that is God. In like manner, the inconsiderate Ministers of the Gospel, abusing the Text of the eightieth <hi>Psalm,</hi> which, by the consent of all, is understood of Christ truely, and of <hi>David,</hi> as a figure



<pb facs="tcp:61872:37"/>
of Christ to come, call the King, <hi>The man of thy right hand,</hi> this in no wayes, without Blasphemie, can be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto any earthly Prince; for none is to be said a figure of Christ, as <hi>David,</hi> and his Successors were by a particular dispensation. But if misapplying, and mistaking of Texts of Scripture will do businesse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Domino Deo qui nostri.</hi>
               </note> since Magistrates are said to be gods, you may as well call the Prince god, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour was of old by some so called, and now the Pope, by his Court-parasites: which Titile of god, no Prince will suffer to be given unto him; Surely, as it is a very great crime, not to give due respect, reverence, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto him, whom God hath set over us for our good, according to his wise Ordinance; so on the other side, it is a huge sin to Idolize the Prince, making him a god, when he is but a weak, and infirme man, servant of God. This second fault is committed chiefly by the Sycophants and Parasites, who have no other Church, nor Chappell, but the Court, and make Petition to none, but to the King, whom to please, they wholly study, that they may catch somewhat to satisfie their inordinate desires. And the first is committed, namely, by their prelaticall Clergy, who withdraw from the Prince a great part of his due, when they study to exempt themselves from his Obedience, and take from him any inspection upon them, namely, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the discharge of their calling, although by Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance it be a main part of his Office, to see God served, and worshipped, according to his Will revealed in his sacred Word.</p>
            <p>We have a little above seen, how that by the flattery of some Court-preachers, the custome is brought into the Church, to give unto the Prince, not onely swelling, but blasphemous Titles in the publike Prayer, that is made by the Minister in the name of the Chruch; but although, this be too great an evill, and requireth Reformation, yet the flattery of some Preachers hath not stayed here; for they, according to their custome, having addicted themselves to any one, whom they conceive may help them to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, stick not in the pulpit, where all relation should be



<pb facs="tcp:61872:37"/>
laid aside, save that of a Minister of Gods Word, to publish themselves, yea, in their Prayers, to be varlets to this man, or that man; and, what is worse yet, in the Prayer they call their Masters and Lords Vertuous, Pious, and Religious, when it is known to all, That for the most part they have little Vertue, lesse Piety, and no Religion at all. To have pointed at these things, shall suffice for this place. If any man will be contentious for these practices, I answer him, That the wel-Reformed Churches have no such Customs; for among the other abuses whereof they have been purged, by the care and diligence of the faithfull Vine-dressers, under Gods blessing, they have been pruned of this rotten Bud of slavish flattery, as a corruption much opposite and contrary to the dignity and power of the Gospel. But let us return, after this long Digression.</p>
            <p>In these dayes (that is, in the thirteenth Age) lived <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Scot,</hi> renowned for his Learning in Physick, Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is remembred by <hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> very honourably. Also then lived <hi>Thomas Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> commonly called, The <hi>Rythmer</hi>; whose Predictions are extant to this day: But no wise man can make any thing of them, more then of <hi>Merlin</hi> his Prophesies, who lived long before him; although sundry have pleased their fansies with idle Expositions of these two mens dreams.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of this thirteenth Age, the good Roman Pontif <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, making use of the havie moans and complaints that some of <hi>Scotland,</hi> namely, of the Bishops and other Clergie-men,<note place="margin">You may see Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> his Letter to King <hi>Edward,</hi> and to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> for the time, in <hi>Iohn Fordon</hi> his <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Chronicon.</hi>
               </note> with their clients, made against King <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who then did cruelly afflict the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, claims a right unto the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igned unto him by the States: And upon this he writes an insulting Letter, and full of threatnings, unto <hi>Edward,</hi> that he was so malapert as to do any wrong to his vassalls and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, where he had none, truely, save the Bishops, and Shave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, with their clients. Whether the Clergie did make this offer of subjection unto the Pope, or whether he did falsly invent this lye, we cannot tell, but it is betwixt the Pope and his shaved creatures; such master, such men. Let this



<pb facs="tcp:61872:38"/>
teach us, how the Popes are, and have been, and will be ever constantly ready watching at all occasions, to draw all things to their Crosse. But this owning of the Scots by the Pope for his peculiar people did not last long; for in a very short time thereafter, notwithstanding the great ignorance of these dayes, the Scots shewed themselves refractaries to his holy Orders; and he, in revenge, did thunder the fire-bolts of his Excommunication against these rude fellows, putting them to the Interdict, all to small purpose; for by these Bolts they were but very little dashed.</p>
            <p>We have heard how that in former times the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was served by Culdees, and they ruled by their Presbyteries or Elders, having a Moderator, or Prefect of themselves, and of their own chusing: This was for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeers. When <hi>Palladius</hi> brought in Prelacie, a new ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Order, into the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> unknown to the preceding Ages, it was with this Restraint, That Bishops should be chosen by the Culdees, and of them: But when Bishops had once gotten certain Diocesses and Limits alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, they set up a new Presbytery of their own, or Councell of Canons or Regulars, which they called Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters; by whom they intended to be chosen in following times. The Culdees seeing this, did oppose it with their main strength, namely, under King <hi>David,</hi> who did take up the businesse thus (being carried away by the Prelats) That so many of the Culdees as would be Canons, should have hand in the chusing of the Bishops. But the Bishops, to elude this Ordinance of the Prince, obtained a Mandate from the Pope, That no Culdee should be received in the Convent of Canons, but by the consent of the Prior, and most part of the Canons. By these means the Culdees were kept out, and deprived of their voyce in chusing of the Bishop. In the time of the troubles of <hi>Baliol</hi> and <hi>Bruce,</hi> one <hi>William Cumin,</hi> Prefect of the Culdees, thinks it fit for to bestir himself, to trie what he could regain upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; and so he opposeth the Election by the Canons of one <hi>William Lamberton</hi> to the Sea of S. <hi>Andrews:</hi> The busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse being come to a great height, by Appeal was drawn



<pb facs="tcp:61872:38"/>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, after much debate <hi>pro forma,</hi> time and moneys employed, the holy Father <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight pronounces sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in favour of his dear Clients the Canons; and so <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton</hi> is made Bishop, and consecrated by the Pope <hi>Boniface.</hi> This fact turned so to the disgrace of the <hi>Culdees,</hi> that after that time we reade no more of them; so the Name and Order by little and little came to be quite extinguished, about the beginning of the thirteenth age.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the fourteenth age, the Order of the Templers was put down, whether for their just demerits, or for private ends and hatred, we leave it to the Histories of these times, Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fift by his Bull did cashier them, the Bull beginning thus, <hi>Quanquam de jure non possu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, tamen pro plenitudine potestatis dictum Ordinem reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp;c.</hi> After which all Christian Princes did cause them to be apprehended in their severall Dominions, and put them from their estates, which was then given to Hospital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Knights of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> after they had stood about two hundred yeers, instituted by <hi>Baldonin</hi> King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for defence of that Citie and Temple, and the safe convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all such as did travell thither: They are also called <hi>Red friers,</hi> because their Gownes were Red. In this four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth age did flourish the great Scholastick <hi>Iohannes,</hi> called <hi>Scotus</hi> from his Nation, and <hi>Duns</hi> from the place of his Birth, for he was born in the Town of <hi>Duns</hi> in the <hi>Mers</hi>; he was a great Opposer of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi> his Doctrine; his Sectaries were called <hi>Scotists,</hi> his Epitaph was thus:
<q>
                  <l>Scotia me genuit, Anglia suscepit,</l>
                  <l>Gallia edocuit, Germania tenet.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of the fifteenth age there was a great Schisme in the Romish Church, Pope against Pope; yea, sometimes there were three Popes at one time fighting one against another, and excommunicating one another; this Schisme lasted about thirty yeers, and by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Constance Martin</hi> the fift was made Pope, and the rest defeated: There was one <hi>Iohn Fogo,</hi> a Monke of <hi>Milros,</hi> who in <hi>Scotland</hi> defended the Election of <hi>Martin</hi> by the Councell, against <hi>Benedict,</hi> alias, <hi>Peter de Lune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:61872:39"/>During this forenamed Schisme, many (taking occasion of the opennesse of the times) began boldly and freely to speak against the bad Doctrine, Government and Lives of the Church-men, and that not only in private discourse, but they also preached it publikely, as <hi>Iohn Wickliffe</hi> in <hi>England, Iohn Hus</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who spoke before the people freely of the Tyrannie of the Government of the Clergie, the corruption of their Doctrine, and wickednesse of their lives. In those dayes also there were some in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who feared not to make known to the people the Truth of God, as namely <hi>Iames Resby</hi> and <hi>Paul Craw</hi> (among others) who suffered Martyrdom for the Truth. About this time the Carthusians were brought from <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had built unto them a Monasterie at <hi>Perth.</hi> In this Age the Universitie of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> was set up, chiefly by the means of <hi>Henry Wardlaw</hi> Bishop of the place, that in some kinde the Schools of Learning might not bee altogether want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which formerly had flourished for so long a time among the <hi>Culdees,</hi> and of later yeers had quite decayed; this good did <hi>Wardlaw:</hi> As his Predecessor <hi>William Trail</hi> had built the Castle of the same City; So his Successour <hi>Iames Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedy</hi> built the old Colledge likewise, called Saint <hi>Salvator</hi> his Colledge; <hi>Patrick Grahame,</hi> that came after him, was the man that brought into <hi>Scotland</hi> the Title of Primate, Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, and Archbishop, by Bull of <hi>Sextus quartus.</hi> From the first Preaching of the Gospel, till <hi>Palladius,</hi> the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was happy without Bishops. From <hi>Palladius</hi> to King <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colme</hi> his days the Bishops had no distinct Diocesses or Parishes from King <hi>Malcolme:</hi> till <hi>Patricke Grahame</hi> they were without Archbishops; this Title and higher rank of Authoritie did not succeed well with <hi>Grahame,</hi> for the other Bishops could suffer no Superiour under the Pope, namely so neer them, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto having rejected all the pretentions of the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>; The inferior Clergie also were afraid of the increase of the Authority of the Man whom they conceived austere and rigid, and so by the Faction of the corrupt Court and disordered Clergy, poor <hi>Grahame</hi> lost the Title he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, with the Benefice, and one <hi>Shevez</hi> got his spoyl; and



<pb facs="tcp:61872:39"/>
what a sweet Bird <hi>Shevez</hi> was, the Stories of that time doe sufficiently manifest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Blacater</hi> seeing the Bishop of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> now a Metropolitane and Archbishop, obtains from <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt a Bull, whereby he is made Archbishop also, and hee had under him the Bishops of <hi>Galloway, Argyle</hi> and <hi>Isles</hi>; which new dignitie angred the Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> above the losse of his Vassals; for to have a Companion in equall dignity set up beside him was hard; but he must digest the Pill, since the Pope will have it so.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>David Beaton</hi> brought in the Title of Cardinall into <hi>Scotland,</hi> who hath beene the onely man that hath born that Title in this Countrey, and how it did speed with him, the following Historie will tell you.</p>
            <p>As in the beginning of the fifteenth age the Schisme for the Papacie opened thorow Christendom many mens mouthes, and busied their Pennes to set forth the corruption of the Church, and the Vices of the Clergie; even so in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the sixteenth age, those that fought for the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> by their dissention gave occasion to many in <hi>Scotland</hi> to speak in publike and private of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Church-mens Lives, Government and Doctrine in <hi>Scotland</hi>; which coming to the Popes ears, presently he sent unto the King, <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth, a Sword, with the Title of <hi>Protector of the Faith</hi>; as if all Christian Princes were not in dutie bound to protect the Faith in Christ; but the Faith whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Some few yeers after this, <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth was declared by the Pope, <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> and had the Sword like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. <hi>Iames</hi> the 4 of <hi>Scotland</hi> being dead, now by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Courtiers the yong inconsiderate King <hi>Iames</hi> was made beleeve, That the conferring of this new Title by the Pope, did bring unto him a great preheminence; yea, the Court Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants did not stick to call it, <hi>A new Royaltie,</hi> when in effect it was nothing else but a new note of his Vas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

after this, during his short Reign, were persecuted, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death for the Truth of Christ. This is the second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Badge of slavery put upon our Princes by the Pope; the former was their Anointing by him, as wee have seen before.</p>
            <p>Here be pleased with me to remark, That of all the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> before the Reformation, namely, since they were made Lords of certain places, and had particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesses, you cannot finde one who had any care of the true Charge of Pastor; for their whole studie was, to raise their power, and to encrease their means for the upholding of their power: and, to effectuate this more easily and fully, they kept both Prince and people in dark ignorance of Gods Will and Word. But because they must seem to do somwhat for the name sake of Bishops, they caused to build walls of Temples and Chappels, set up images and pictures richly dressed, to content the eyes, and brought into the Church Instruments of Musick, and artificiall Singing with great skill, to content the ear; Also they brought in sweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume and incense for the smell; so the most subtill senses were thus satisfied. And, to make a shew to keep under the senses which are more grosse, there must be some kinde of Fasting enjoyned to the people, and chastenesse to the Church-men. But how, and to what purpose these two last have been kept, all men know. But kept or not, all is one, all these Ordinances which the Bishops set up for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, have been discovered by Gods mercy, to be not onely without Warant in Gods Word, but plainly contrary to the same. Of all the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> in time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, there was onely one or two who embraced the Truth, all the rest were either professed persecutors of Gods Children, and open enemies of the Truth, or else they were given altogether so to satisfie their bellies and lusts, that they had no care of Religion; witnesse <hi>George Creichton</hi> (in the name of all the rest) Bishop of <hi>Dunkell,</hi> who confessed truly, That he had lived a long time Bishop, and never knew any thing of the Old or New Testament.</p>
            <p>Impietie, Ignorance and Wickednesse came to such height



<pb facs="tcp:61872:40"/>
among the Church-men of all ranks, degrees and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that God being, after so long patience, in a manner vexed with them, did stirre up the people to chase them from the service of his House, and to put others in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as you will see in this following Historie, whereunto I referre you. And I shall close up this discourse with one or two passages, worthy to be known; whereby you may see the learning of the Church-Doctors in those dayes, and how they did imploy the knowledge they had to abuse the poor people. The first Passage is this: One <hi>Richard Marshall</hi> Prior of the <hi>Blackefriers</hi> at <hi>Newcastle</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> preached in Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> That the <hi>Pater-noster</hi> should be said to God onely, and not to the Saints: The Doctors of Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> offended at it, made a <hi>Gray frier,</hi> called <hi>Tottis,</hi> preach against <hi>Marshall</hi> his Tenet; which hee did thus, (taking his Text out of the fift of Saint <hi>Matthew, Blessed are the poore in spirit</hi>) Seeing we say, <hi>Good day, Father,</hi> to any old man in the Street, we may call a Saint, <hi>Pater,</hi> who is older then any alive; And seeing they are in Heaven, we may say to any of them, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven:</hi> And seeing they are holy, we may say to any of them, <hi>Hallowed be thy name:</hi> And since they are in the Kingdom of Heaven, we may say, <hi>Thy kingdom come:</hi> And seeing their will is Gods Will, we may say to any of them, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> But when the Gray Fryer preaching came to the fourth Petition, <hi>Give us this day our dayly bread,</hi> he was hissed at, and so was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained not onely to leave off Preaching, but also to leave the City for shame. Yet among the Doctors then assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the Dispute continued about the <hi>Pater</hi>; for some would have it said to God <hi>formaliter,</hi> and to the Saints <hi>materialiter</hi>; others, to God <hi>principaliter,</hi> to the Saints <hi>minus principaliter</hi>; others, <hi>primariò</hi> to God, <hi>secundariò</hi> to the Saints; others would have it said to God taking it <hi>strictè,</hi> and to the Saints taking it <hi>latè</hi>: Notwithstanding all these Distinctions, the Doctors could not agree upon the businesse. A fellow, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tom,</hi> servant to the Sub-Prior of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> one day perceiving his Master much troubled with some busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and as he conceived weighty, said to him, <hi>Sir, what



<pb facs="tcp:61872:41"/>
is the matter of this your trouble?</hi> The Master answered, <hi>We cannot agree about the saying of the</hi> Pater. The fellow replied, <hi>To whom should it be said, but to God alone?</hi> The Master an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers again, <hi>What shall we do then with the Saints?</hi> The fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low duplies, <hi>Give them</hi> Ave's <hi>and</hi> Credo's <hi>enough, that may suffice them, and too well too.</hi> If this was good Divinity, God knows. The second passage likewise is very well worth the knowing, and to this purpose very fit, which fell out about the same time with the former, that is, about the first beginning of the Reformation. A little before the death of <hi>George Wischard,</hi> there came home from <hi>Rome</hi> a fellow charged with very many holy Reliques, and new things of great vertue, as he gave out; but the things were not to be had, nor any benefit by the sight or touching of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moneys. Now upon a holy day, in a village neer <hi>Hading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> this Romish Pedler did open his pack, to try if he could vent any of his Wares among the Countrey people. Among other commodities, the good Merchant did shew unto the people there was a Bell of much value, by reason of its great vertue; which he gave out to be this, That if any two parties had any difference, which could not be otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided but by Oath, the truth of the Oath was to be made known by this Bell: for (said he) when any one sweareth, laying his hand on this Bell, if he swear true, he shall after the Oath sworn remove his hand easily from from the Bell, without any change to the Bell: But if he that sweareth having his hand upon the Bell sweareth falsly, his hand will stick to the Bell, and the Bell will rive asunder. Now we must tell you, That already there was a rift in the Bell, which this Romipete did affirm had happened by a false Oath of one that had sworn having his hand upon the Bell. At this tale the poor simple people were astonished, and fell in admiration. But among them was one <hi>Fermer,</hi> who had some light of the Truth of God; he drawing neer the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Merchant, desired to have the Bell in his hand, to see it neerly. This desire was granted unto him. Then he takes the Bell, and looks on it, expressing great admiration at first; but immediately thereafter, he asked at the Romipete,



<pb facs="tcp:61872:41"/>
if he would suffer him to swear in presence of the company, having his hand upon the Bell, for he had minde to take an Oath upon a weighty businesse. The man could not refuse him. Then said the Farmer to the company, Friends, before I swear, you see the rift that is already in the Bell, and how big it is, and that I have nothing upon my fingers to make them stick to the Bell. With this he sheweth them his hand open: then laying his hand upon the Bell, he did swear this; <hi>I swear, in the presence of the living God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these good people, That the Pope of Rome is Antichrist, and that all the rabble of his Clergie, Cardinalls, Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, Monks, with the rest of the crew, are Locusts, come from hell, to delude the people, and to withdraw them from God: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I promise, They will return to hell.</hi> Incontinent he lifted up his hand from the Bell before them all, and said, <hi>See, friends, that I have lifted up my hand freely from the Bell, and look unto the rift in the Bell, it is one and the same, without change; this sheweth, according to the saying of this Merchant, That I have sworn truth.</hi> Then this poor fellow went away, and never was more seen in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor any other of his kinde, who brought Reliques, or other like toyes from <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many more of this kinde might be alleadged, but let these suffice, to demonstrate the miserable ignorance from which God in his mercy hath delivered us; To whom be praise and glory, for this and all other benefits.</p>
            <p>With this I end the Preface, that you may come to the History it self.</p>

                  <hi>PAtrick Hamilton</hi> was three and twenty yeers of Age when he suffered. After his death, his brother German <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Levinston</hi> was accused likewise; but the King did cause to convey him secretly out of the way. Also <hi>Katherine Hamilton,</hi> his sister, was accused, and being que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned upon Works; she answered, That <hi>none was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his works.</hi> Then <hi>Iohn Spencer</hi> spake to her of the works of <hi>congruo</hi> and <hi>condigno</hi>; to which she answered, <hi>Work here, work there; what kinde of working is all this? no works can save me, but Christ's.</hi> At this, the King, being present, laughed, and after conveyed her away secretly. One <hi>Henry Forest,</hi> a Monk of the Order of <hi>Benet</hi> and <hi>Collet,</hi> as they spoke then, was also accused of heresie; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sufficient proof. Then he was sent to <hi>Walter Ange,</hi> (whom <hi>Buchanan,</hi> in his Satyre against the Gray Friers, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Langius</hi>) to be confessed: <hi>Langius</hi> having asked him, by way of confession, <hi>What he thought of</hi> Patrick Hamilton? He answered, That <hi>he was a good man, and that his Articles were to be maintained. Lange</hi> discovers this simple mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; and this confession being taken for a sufficient proof, the poor man was condemned to be burnt, and so he was, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after they had degraded him, according to their Custom. As they were leading him to the Execution-place, he complained of the Fryer who had betrayed him, and said, <hi>Let no man trust the false Fryers, after me; they are despisers of God, and deceivers of men.</hi> They burnt him at the North Style of the Abbey Church in Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> that the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of <hi>Angus</hi> might see the fire.</p>

               <p>One <hi>Andrew Oliphant</hi> accused with heat <hi>Walter Mill,</hi> an ancient man, and formerly a Priest, and said to him, being at his devotion, <hi>Rise up, Sir Walter.</hi> He answered, when he had ended his prayer, <hi>My name is Walter: I have been too long one of the Popes Knights</hi> (for all Priests are Sirs.) <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Oliphant</hi> said to him, <hi>Thou keepest my Lords too long here, therefore haste.</hi> He answered, <hi>I must obey God before men.</hi>



                  <pb facs="tcp:61872:42"/>
Being questioned by <hi>Oliphant</hi> concerning Priests Marriage, he answered, <hi>It was Gods Ordinance, That every man that had not the gift of chastity, should marry: but you abhor it, vowing chastity, which you cannot keep, but take other mens wives and daughters.</hi> Then, being asked if there were not seven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, he answered, <hi>Let me have two, take you the rest to your selves.</hi> Being asked about the Masse, he answered, <hi>A Lord sendeth, and calleth many to his dinner; and when all is ready, he causeth ring the Bell, the guests come into the hall; but he turning his back upon them, eateth all himself: And so do you.</hi> Then he added, <hi>The Scripture is not to be understood carnally; Christ hath put an end to all carnall Sacrifices, by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once for all his body upon the Crosse.</hi> Many other Queries were put to him, to which he answered stoutly. Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to recant, he told them, That he was corn, and not chaff. <hi>I will,</hi> said he, <hi>neither be blown by the winde, nor bruised with the Flail, but I will abide both: I will not recant the Truth.</hi> Being commanded to go to the stake by <hi>Oliphant,</hi> he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>By the Law of God I am forbidden to put hand on my self, therefore put thou me to it with thy hands, and then thou shalt see my resolution.</hi> After he had said his Prayer, he gat leave, with difficulty, to speak to the people standing by: In his Speech he told them, <hi>That although he was a great sinner, yet it was for Gods Truth, contained in his Word of the Old and New Testament, that he suffered, and that God, in the abundance of his mercy towards him, did honour him so far, as to make him seal his Truth with his life, among other of his Servants.</hi> He added, <hi>Dear friends, as you would escape eternall death, be no more seduced with lies of Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Priests, Monks, Friers, and the rest of the Antichristian rabble, but onely trust in God.</hi> This was the last man that died for Religion in <hi>Scotland:</hi> And by his death was given the very dead blow to Popery; for by his death the people of all ranks and conditions were so moved, that they made open profession of the Truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more dallying; and presently was, upon this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made a Covenant or Bond of mutuall defence, To defend one another by Arms, against the Tyranny of the Bishops, and their Parties.</p>

And by reason thereof held and travelled to hold the truth of God in thraldome and bondage, till that it pleased God of his great mercy in the yeer of God 1527. to raise up his servant Master <hi>Patrick Hammilton,</hi>

                  <p>This servant of God Master <hi>Patrick Hamilton,</hi> being in his youth provided to reasonable honours and living (he was intituled Abbot of <hi>Fern</hi>) as one hating the world and the vanitie thereof, left <hi>Scotland,</hi> and passed to the Schools in <hi>Germany</hi>; for then the fame of the Universitie of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> was greatly divulgate in all Countreys: where by Gods providence he became familar with those lights and notable servants of Christ Jesus of that time, <hi>Martin Luther, Philip Melancthon,</hi> and the said <hi>Francis Lambert,</hi> did so grow and advance in godly knowledge, joyned with fervencie and integrity of life, that he was in admiration with many. The zeal of Gods glory did so eat him up, that he could not long continue to remain there, but returned to his countrey where the bright beams of the true light, which by Gods grace was planted in his heart, began most abundantly to burst forth, as well in publike as in secret; for he was (besides his godly knowledge) well learned

in Phylosophie, he abhorred Sophistrie, and would that the Text of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> should have been better understood, and more used in the Schools than then it was; for Sophistrie had corrupted all, as well in Divinitie, as in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie. In short processe of time, the fame of his reasons and Doctrine troubled the Clergie, and came to the ears of Bishop <hi>Iames Betonne,</hi> of whom before we have made mention, who being a conjured enemy to Christ Jesus, and one that long hath had the whole regiment of this Realm, bare impatiently that any trouble should be made to the Kingdom of darknesse, whereof within this Realm he was the head. And therefore he so travelled with the said Master <hi>Patrike</hi> that he gat him to Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> where after the conference of divers dayes he had his freedom and liberty. The said Bishop and his bloody Butchers, called Doctours, seemed to approve his Doctrine, and to grant that many things craved Reformation in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall regiment. And amongst the rest, there was one that secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with him almost in all things, named, Frier <hi>Alexander Campbell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Dominican Frier.</note> a man of good wit and learning, but yet corrupt by the world, as after we will hear: when the Bishops and Clergie had fully understood the minde and judgement of the said Master <hi>Patrick,</hi> and fearing that by him their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should be endamaged, they travailed with the King, who then was young,<note place="margin">Note how Church-men rules the good nature of the Prince.</note> and altogether addict to their commandment, that he should passe in Pilgrimage to Saint <hi>Dothesse</hi> in <hi>Rosse,</hi> to the end that no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession should be made for the life of the innocent servant of God, who suspecting no such cruelty as in their hearts was conceived, remained still, (a lambe amongst the wolves) till that upon a night he was intercepted in his chamber, and by the Bishops Band was caried to the Castle, where that night he was kept, and upon the morrow after brought forth to Judgement, he was condemned to die by fire for the testimony of Gods Truth. The Articles for the which he suffered, were but of Pilgrimage, Purgatory, prayer to Saints, and for the dead, and such trifles. Albeit that matters of greater importance had been in question, as his Treatise which in the end we have added, may witnesse. Now that the condemnation of the said M. <hi>Patrike</hi> should have greater Authority, they caused the same to be subscribed by all those of any estimation that with them were present; and to make their number great, they took the subscription of children, if they were of the Nobility; for the Earle of <hi>Cassilles,</hi> which last deceased in <hi>France,</hi> then being but twelve or thirteene yeers of age, was compelled to subscribe his death, as himself did confesse. Immediately after dinner the fire was prepared before the old Colledge, and he led to the place of Execution, and yet men supposed that all was done but to give nnto him terrour, and to have caused him to have recanted, and have become recreant to those bloodie beasts; but God for his own glory; for the comfort of his servant, and for manifestation of their beastly tyrannie, had otherwise decreed; for he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the place of execution, he gave to his servant who had been chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to him of a long time, his Gown, his Coat, Bonnet, and such like gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, saying, These will not profit in the fire, they will profit thee; after this, of me thou canst receive no commoditie, except the example of my

death, which I pray thee bear in minde, for albeit it be bitter to the flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fearfull before men, yet is it the entrance unto eternall life, which none shall possesse that denies Christ Jesus before this wicked generation. The innocent servant of God being bound to the stake, in the midst of some coales, some timber, and other matter appointed for the fire, a traine of powder was made, and set on fire, which gave to the blessed Martyr of God, a blaise, and scorched his left hand and that side of his face, but neither kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled the wood nor yet the coales, and so remained the appointed to death in torment, till that men ran to the Castle again for more Powder, and fire wood more able to take fire, which at last being kindled, with loud voice, cried; <hi>Lord Iesus receive my spirit; How long shall darknesse overwhelm this Realme? And how long wilt thou suffer this tyrannie of men?</hi> The fire was slow, and therefore was his torment the more: But most of all was he grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by certain wicked men, amongst whom <hi>Campbel</hi> the black Frier (of whom we spake before) was principall, who continually cryed, <hi>Convert Heretick, Call upon our Lady,</hi> say, <hi>Salve Regina, &amp;c.</hi> To whom he answered, <hi>Depart, and trouble me not,</hi>

                     <hi>thou messenger of Satan.</hi> But while that the aforesaid Frier still roared, one thing in great vehemence he said unto him; <hi>Wicked man, thou knowest the contrary, and the contrary to me thou hast confessed; I appeale thee before the tribunall seat of Christ Iesus.</hi> After which, and other words, which well could not be understood nor marked because of the tumult, and vehemencie of the fire. The witnesse of Jesus Christ gate victory, after long sufferance, the last of February, in the yeere of God 1527. The said Frier departed this life within few dayes after, in what estate, we referre to the manifestation of the generall Day. But it was plainly known, that he died in <hi>Glasgow</hi> in a phrenzie, and as one despaired.</p>

he that believeth not Gods Word, he compteth him false, and a lyar, and believeth not that he may and will fulfill his Word, and so he denieth both the might of God, and himself. Faith is the gift of God: Every good thing is the gift of God.<note place="margin">Jam. 1.</note> Faith is good; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Faith is the gift of God; The gift of God is not in our power: Faith is the gift of God, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Faith is not in our power. Without faith it is impossible to please God; all that cometh not of faith,<note place="margin">Rom 14. Heb 11.</note> is sin; for without faith, can no man please God. Besides that, he that lacketh faith, he trusteth not God; he that trusteth not God, trusteth not in his Word; he that trusteth not in his Word, holdeth him false, and a lyar; he that holdeth him false and a lyar, he believeth not that he may do that he promiseth, and so denieth he that he is God: O how can a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this fashion, please God! No manner of wayes, yea suppose he did all the works of man and Angel.</p>
                                 <p>All that is done in faith, pleaseth God. Right is the Word of God, and all his works in faith: Lord thine eyes look to faith; that is as much to say, as, Lord thou delightest in faith: God loveth him that believeth in him, how can they then displease him? He who hath faith, is just and good, and a good tree bringeth forth good fruit. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all that is done in faith, pleaseth God. Moreover, he that hath faith, beleeveth God; he that believeth God, believeth his Word; he that believeth his Word, wotteth well that he is true and faithfull, and cannot lie; but knoweth well that he both may and will fulfill his Word. How can he then displease him? For thou canst do no greater honour unto God, than to count him true. Thou wilt then say, That theft, murder, adultery, and all vices please God: No verily, for they cannot be done in faith; for a good tree beareth good fruit. He that hath faith, wotteth well that he pleaseth God; for all that is done in faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. Rom 8.</note> pleaseth God; faith is a surenesse: <hi>Faith is a sure confidence of things which are hoped for, and a certainty of things which are not seen: The same spirit certifieth our spirit,</hi>

What, is this to say Christ died for thee?

                     </hi>; who in a Sermon preached in <hi>Dundie,</hi> spake somewhat more liberally against the licentious life of the Bishops, then they could well bear. He spake fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the abuse of cursing and of Miracles. The Bishop of <hi>Brechain,</hi> having his Parasites and Jack-men in the Towne, buffeted the Frier, and called him Hereticke. The Frier impatient of the injury received, past to S. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">M. <hi>Iohn Mair,</hi> whose History of <hi>Scotland</hi> we have, &amp;c.

There was one day appointed to the said Frier, to make repetition of the same Sermon: and advertisement was given to all such as was offended at the former, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.

                  <p>

                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61872:50"/>The theme of his Sermon was; <hi>Verity is the strongest of all things.</hi> His discourse of cursing was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That if it were warily used, it were the most fearfull thing upon the face of the earth;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arithe</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> for it were the very separation of man from God; but that it should not be used rashly, and for every light cause, but onely against open and incorrigible sinners: but now; said he, the avarice of Priests, and the ignorance of their Office, hath caused it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be vile-pended. For the Priest (saith he) whose Duty and Office is to pray for the people, standeth up on Sunday, and cryeth, <hi>Anne</hi> has lost her Spindle; There is a Flail stollen behinde the barne; The goodwife on the other side of the gate hath lost a horne spoon; Gods curse and mine I give to them that knoweth of thy goods, and restoreth them not. How the people mocked their cursing, he further told a merry tale, How after a Sermon that he made at <hi>Dumfermeling,</hi> he came to a house where gossips were drinking their Sundayes penny; and he being drie, asked drink; Yes Father (said one of the gossips) ye shall have drinke, but ye must first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve one doubt which is risen among us, to wit, What servant will serve a man best at least expences? The good Angel, said I, who is mans keeper, who maketh good service without expences. Tush, said the gossip, we mean no such high matters; we mean, What honest man will do greatest service for least expences. And while I was musing (said the Frier) what that should mean, she said, <hi>I see, father, that the greatest Clerks are not the wisest men.</hi> Know ye not how the Bishops and their Officials serve us husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Will they not give to us a letter of cursing for a plack, to last for a yeare, to curse all that look over our ditch, and that keep our Corne bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor the sleeping boy that will have three shillings of Fee, a shirt, and a pair of shooes in the yeer. And therefore if their cursing do any thing, we hold the Bishops the cheapest servants in that behalf, that are within the Realme. As concerning Miracles,<note place="margin">False Miracles.</note> he declared what deligence the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients took to try true miracles from false. But now, said he, the greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Priests not onely receive false miracles, but also they cherish and hire knaves for that purpose, that their Chappels may be the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, and Offerings may be augmented. And thereupon are many Chappels founded, as that if our Lady were mightier, and that she took more pleasure in one place than in another; As of late dayes our Lady of <hi>Karsgreng</hi> hath hopped from one green hillock to another: But honest men of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> (said he) if ye love your wives and daughters, hold them at home, or else send them in good honest company; for if ye knew what miracles were wrought there, ye would neither thank God nor our Lady. And thus he meerly tanted their Priests of whoredome and adultery used at such devotion.</p>
                  <p>Another Article was judged more hard; for he alleadged the common Law, That the Civill Magistrate might correct the Church-men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Benefices for open vices. Another day the same Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er made another Sermon of the Abbot of <hi>Unreason,</hi> unto whom, and whose Laws; he compareth Prelats of that age; for they were subject to no Laws, no more than was the Abbot of <hi>Unreason.</hi> And among other things, he told such a merry jest: There was, said he, a Prelate, or at least a Prelats Peere, a true servant to the King of Love, who upon a night after



<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61872:51"/>
Supper, asked of his Gentlemen, by the faith that they ought to the king of Love, that they truely declare how many sundry women every one of them had, and how many of them were mens wives. One answered, He had lien with five, and two of them were married. The other answered, I have had seven, and three of them are married. It came last to my Lord Abbot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who making it very nice for a little space, gave in the end a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and said, I am the youngest man, and yet have I had the round do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and seven of them are mens wives. Now said the Frier, This god and king of Love, to whom our Prelates do homage, is the master devill of hell, from whom such fruits and works do proceed. This Frier was known by his proper tokens to have been Prior <hi>Patrike Hepburne,</hi> now Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Murray,</hi> who to this day hath continued in the profession that he hath made to his god and king of love.</p>
                  <p>It was supposed, notwithstanding this kinde of preaching, that this Frier remained Papist in his heart: For the other Friers fearing to lose the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> of the Bishops, to wit, Their <hi>Malt and their Meale,</hi> and their other appointed Pensions, caused the said Frier to flie to <hi>England,</hi> where for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the people and Papistry, he was cast into prison at King <hi>Henries</hi> commandment. But so it pleased God to open the mouth of <hi>Balaams</hi> own Asse to cry out against the vitious lives of the Clergie of that age.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after this, new consultation was taken there that some should be burnt; for men began liberally to speak. A merry Gentleman named <hi>Iohn Lindsey,</hi> familiar to Bishop <hi>Iames Betonne,</hi> standing by when consultation was had, said, My Lord, If ye burne any more, except ye follow my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, ye will utterly destroy your selves; if ye will burne them, let them be burnt in hollow Cellars; for the smoke of Master <hi>Patrike Hammilton</hi> hath infected as many as it blew upon. Thus it pleased God that they should be tanted in their own face. But here followeth the most merry of all: One <hi>Alexander Furrour,</hi> who had been imprisoned seven yeers in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Dungwaill</hi> (according to the charity of Church-men) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained his wife, and wasted the poor mans substance; for the which cause at his returning, he spake more liberally of Priests, then they could bear: And so was he declared to be accused for heresie, and called to his answer to Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> he leapt up merrily upon the Scaffold, and casting a gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade, said,<note place="margin">

Master <hi>Andrew Olyphant</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended therewith, said, It shall be no Play to you, Sir, before ye depart, and so began to reade his Accusation; the first Article whereof was, <hi>That he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised the Masse.</hi> His answer was, <hi>I heare more Maffes in eight dayes, than three Bishops there sitting say in a yeare.</hi> Accused secondly of <hi>the contempt of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. The Priests,</hi> said he, <hi>were the most common contemners of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and specially of Matrimony.</hi> And that he witnessed by many of the Priests there present, and named the mans wife with whom they had med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and especially Sir <hi>Iohn Dungwaill,</hi> who had seven yeers together abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his own wife, and consumed his substance; and said, because I complain of such injuries, I am here summoned and accused as one that is worthy to be burnt: For Gods sake, said he, will ye take wives of your own, that I and others whom ye have abused, may be revenged upon you. Then Bishop <hi>Gawin Dumbar,</hi> named the old Bishop of <hi>Aberdein,</hi> thinking to justifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self



<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61872:51"/>
before the people, said, Carle, thou shalt not know my wife. The said <hi>Alexander</hi> answered, My Lord, ye are too old, but with the grace of God I shall drink with your daughter or I depart, and thereat was smiling of the best, and loud laughter of some, for the Bishop had a daughter married with <hi>Andrew Balfour</hi> in that Town. Then the Bishop bade away with the carle. But he answered, Nay, I will not depart this hour, for I have more to speak against the vices of Priests, than I can expresse this whole day. And so after divers purposes, they commanded him to burn his Bill. And he demanding the cause, they said, Because ye have spoken these Articles whereof ye are accused. His answer was, The great devill beare them away that first and last said them; and so he took the Bill, and chawing it, he spat it in Master <hi>Andrew Olyphants</hi> face, saying, Now burn it or drown it, whether ye wil, ye hear no more of me. But I must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of every one of you, to begin my pack againe, which a Priest and my wife, a Priests whore, have spent. And so every Prelat and rich Priest, glad to be quit of his evill, gave him somewhat, and so departed he, for he understood nothing of Religion. But so fearfull it was then to speak any thing against Priests, that the least word spoken against them, yea, albeit it was spoken in a mans sleep, was judged Heresie, and that was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised upon <hi>Richard Carmichell,</hi> yet living in <hi>Fyfe,</hi> who being young, and Singer in the Chappel Royal of <hi>Sterelin,</hi> happened in his sleep to say, The devill take away the Priests, for they are a greedy pack. He therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused by Sir <hi>George Clapperton,</hi> Dean of the said Chappel, was compelled forthwith to burne his Bill. But God shortly after raised up against them stronger Champions: For <hi>Alexander Seton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alexander Seton,</hi> a black Frier.</note> a black Frier, of good learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and estimation, began to blame the corrupt doctrine of Papistry. For the space of a whole Lent, he taught the Commandment onely, ever beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ears of his auditors, That the Law of God had of many yeers not been truely taught: for mens Tradition had obscured the purity of it. These were his accustomed Propositions; 1. Christ Jesus is the end and perfection of the Law. 2. There is no sin, where Gods Law is not violated. 3. To satisfie for sins, lies not in mans power; but the remission thereof cometh by unfained Repentance, and by faith apprehending God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mercifull in Jesus Christ his Son. While oftentimes he puts his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in minde of this and the like Heads; he maketh no mention of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, Pardons, Pilgrimage, prayer to Saints, nor of such trifles. The dumb Doctors, and the rest of that forsworne rabble began to suspect him, and yet said they nothing publikely, till Lent was ended. And he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to <hi>Dundie:</hi> And then one in his absence, hired to that purpose, openly condemned the whole Doctrine that before he had taught.

The man being witty, and minding that which was his most assured defence, said, My Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The reporters of such things are manifest liars. Whereat the Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, and said, Your answer pleaseth me well; I never could think of you that ye would be so foolish as to affirm such things: Where are the knaves that have brought me this tale? Who comparing and affirming the same that they did before, he still replyed, That they were liers. But while the witnesses were multiplied, and men were brought to attention, he turned him to the Bishop, and said, My Lord, ye may hear and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what ears these Asses have,<note place="margin">

And so yet again, my Lord, I say, That they are manifest liars that reported unto you that I said, That ye and others that preach not, are no Bishops, but belly-gods. Albeit after that the Bishop was highly offended, as well at the scoffe and bitter mock, as at the bold liberty of that learned man, yet durst he not hazard for that present, to execute his malice conceived. For nought only feareth he the learning, and bold spirit of the man, but also the favour that he had, as well of the people, as of the Prince, King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth,<note place="margin">

This accusation was easily believed of the young Prince; who being much given to the lusts of the flesh, abhorred all counsell that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned thereto. And because he did remember what a terrour the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of the said <hi>Alexander</hi> was unto his blinded conscience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance he subscribed to their accusation, affirming that he knew more then they did in that matter. For he understood well enough that he smelled of the new Doctrine, by such things as he had shewed to him under Confession. And therefore he promised that he should follow the counsell of the Bishops in punishing of him, and of all others of that Sect. These things understood by the said <hi>Alexander,</hi> as well by the information of his friends and familiars, as by the strange countenance of the King unto him; provideth the next way to avoid the fury of a misled Prince, and so in his habit he departeth the Realme; and coming to <hi>Berwicke,</hi> wrote back again to the King his Complaint and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition;

                        <p>It is not, I wot, unknowne to thy gracious Highnesse, how that thy Majesties some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time servant and Orator (and ever shall be to my lives end) is departed out of thy Realm, unto the next adjacent of <hi>England</hi>; neverthelesse, I believe the cause of my departing is unknown to thy gracious Majesty: Which onely is, Because the Bishops and Church-men of thy Realm have had heretofore such authority upon thy subjects, that apparently they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King, and thou the subject; which unjust Regiment is of it self false, and contrary to holy Scripture, and Gods Law. Then thou art the King and Master, and they thy subjects, which is very true, and testified ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly by the Word of God. And also because they will give no man of any degree or state (whom they often call Hereticks) audience, time, nor place to speak and have defence, which is against all Law, both the old Law (called the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>) and the new Law of the Gospel. So that if I might have had audience and place to speak, and have shewed my just defence, conformable to the Law of God, I should never have fled to any other Realm, suppose it should have cost me my life. But because I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that I should have no audience, nor place to answer (they are so great with thy Majestie) I departed not doubting, but moved of God, unto a better time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God illuminate thy Majestie, even to give every man au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (is thou shouldst and mayst, and is bound by the Law of God) who are accused to the death. And to certifie thy Highnesse that these are no vain words, but of deed and effect, here I offer me to thy Majestie to come in thy Realme again, so that thy Majestie will give me audience, and hear what I have for me of the Law of God: and cause any Bishop or Abbot, Friar or Secular, which is most cunning (some of them cannot reade their Mattins, who are made Judges of Heresie) to impugne me by the Law of God; and if my part be found wrong, thy Majestie being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Judge, I refuse no pain worthy or condigne for my fault. And if that I convince them by the Law of God, and that they have nothing to lay to my charge, but the law of man, and their own inventions to uphold their own glory and pridefull life, and daily scourging of thy poor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I refer my self to thy Majestie as Judge, Whether he hath the victory that holds him at the Law of God, which cannot fail, or be false, or they that holds them at the Law of man, which is very oft plain contrary, and against the Law of God; and therefore of necessity false, and full of lies. For all things that is contrary to the veritie (which is Christ and his Law) is of necessity a lie. And to witnesse that this comes of all my heart, I shall remain at <hi>Berwike</hi> while I get thy Majesties answer, and shall without fail return, having thy hand write, that I may have audience, &amp; place to speak. No more I desire of thee, whereof if I had been sure, I should never

have departed; and that thou mayst know the truth thereof, if fear of the justnesse of my Cause, or dread of persecution for the same, had moved me to depart, I could not so pleasantly revert, onely distrust was the cause of my departing. Pardon me to say that which lieth to thy Majesties charge. Thou art bound by the Law of God (suppose they falsly lie, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it pertaineth not to thy Majestie to intermeddle with such matters) to cause every man in any case accused of his life, to have their just defence &amp; their accusers produced conform to their own law. They blinde thy Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> eyes, that knows nothing of thy law: but if I prove not this out of their own law, I offer me to the death. Thy Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> therefore by experience, may daily learn (seeing they neither fear the King of Heaven, as their lives testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, neither thee their Naturall Prince, as their usurped power in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shews) why thy Highnes should be no longer blinded. Thou maist consider that they pretend nothing else, but onely the maintenance and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of their barded mules, augmenting of their insatiable avarice, and continuall overthrowing and swallowing up thy poore subjects; neither preaching nor teaching out of the Law of God (as they should) the rude ignorant people, but contend who may be most high, most rich, and neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy Majesty; to put thy Temporal Lords and Lieges out of thy counsell and favour, who should be, and are most tender servants to thy Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty in all time of need, to the defence of thee and thy Crown: And where they desire thy Majesty to to put out thy Temporal Lords and Lieges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they despise their vitious life, What else intend they, but onely thy death and destruction, as thou maist easily perceive: suppose they colour their false intent and minde with the pursuit of heresie; for when thy Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons are put downe, What art thou but the king of Land, and not of men, and then of necessity must be guided by them: and there (no doubt) where a blinde man is guide, must be a fall in the mire. Therefore let thy Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty take boldnes and authority, which thou hast of God, and suffer not their cruell persecution to proceed, without audience given to him that is accused, and just place of defence: and then, no doubt, thou shalt have thy subjects hearts, and all that they can or may do in time of need, tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, justice, and policy, and finally, the Kingdom of the heavens. May it please you to give one Copy of this to the Clergie, and keep the Original, and thy Majestie shall have experience, if I go against one word that I have spoken. I shall daily make my hearty devotion for thy Majestie, and for the prosperity and welfare of thy body and soul.

The rage of these bloody beasts proceeded so farre, that the Kings Court it selfe escaped not that danger; for in it divers were suspected, and some accused. And yet ever did some lyght burst out in the midst of darknesse; for the trueth of Christ Jesus entred even into the Cloisters as well of Friars and Monks as of Channons. <hi>Iohn Lyn,</hi> a gray Frier, left his hypocriticall habit, and the den of those murtherers, the gray Friers. A black Frier, called Frier <hi>Killor,</hi> set forth the History of Christs passion in forme of a Play, which he both Preached and practised openly in <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the King himselfe being present upon a Good-Friday in the Morning, in the which all things were so lively expressed, that the very simple people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood and confessed, That as the Priests and obstinate Pharisees perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people to refuse Christ Jesus, and caused <hi>Pilate</hi> to condemne him;

                     <hi>O eternall God, how wonderfull is that love and mercy that thou bearest unto mankinde, and unto me the most caitife and miserable wretch above all others; For, even now, when I would have denied thee, and thy Son, our Lord Iesus Christ my onely Saviour, and so have cast my self into everlasting damnation; Thou by thine own hand hast pulled me from the very bottome of hell, and made me to feele that heavenly comfort, which takes from me that ungodly feare wherewith before I was oppressed.

These vain promises lifted up in pride the heart of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy king, and so begins the Warre. The Realme was Quartered, and men were laid in <hi>Iedburgh</hi> and <hi>Kelso:</hi> All men (fools we mean) bragged of victory, and in very deed the beginning gave us a faire shaw: For at the first Warden Reade which was made on Saint <hi>Bartholomewes</hi> day, in the yeere of our Lord, 1542. was the Warden Sir <hi>Robert Bowes,</hi> his brother <hi>Richard Bowes</hi> Captaine of <hi>Norhame,</hi> Sir <hi>William Mamebery</hi> Knight, a Bastard Sonne of the Earle of <hi>Angus,</hi> and <hi>Iames Dowglas</hi> of <hi>Parkhead,</hi> then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, with a great number of Borderers Souldiers and Gentlemen taken:

Finally, conclusion was taken that the West borders of <hi>England,</hi> which was most empty of men and Garrison, should be invaded. The Kings own Banner should be theirs, <hi>Oliver</hi> the great Minion should be Generall-Lieutenant, but no man should be privie (except the counsell that was then present) of the enterprise, till the very day and execution thereof.

And so was the scroell thankfully received by the king himselfe, and put into his owne pocket, where it remained to the day of his death, and then was found. In it were contained more then an hundred landed men, besides other of meaner degree: Among whom was the Earle of <hi>Arran,</hi> notwithstanding his siding with the current of the Court, and his neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in blood to the King. It was bruted that this roade was devised by the Lord <hi>Maxwell,</hi> but the certaintie thereof we have not.

And command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all men to march forward, and to follow the King (who was constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supposed to have been in the host) guides were appointed to conduct them towards <hi>England,</hi> as both faithfully and closely they did; upon the point of day they approached to the enemies ground, and so passed the water without any great resistance made unto them.

The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided people were altogether amazed, for bright day appearing, they saw an army of ten thousand men: Their Beacons on every side, send flames of fire unto the heaven: To them it was more then a wonder that such a multitude could have been assembled and conveyed, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof coming to any of their Wardens. For support they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, and so at the first they utterly despaired, and yet began they to assemble together, ten in one company, twenty in another, and so as the Fray proceeded their Troopes increased, but to no number (for <hi>Carlile</hi> fearing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and so the greatest number that ever appeared or approached before the discomfiture past not three or four hundreth men, and yet they made hot skirmishing, as in their own ground, in such feats as they are most expert, about ten hours: When fires were kindled, and almost slackned on every side, <hi>Oliver</hi> thought time to shew his glory, and so incontinent was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the Kings Banner, and he upholden by two Spears, lift up upon mens shoulders there with sound of Trumpet was proclaimed Generall Lieutenant, and all men commanded to obey him, as the Kings own Person, under all highest pains.

While such disorder rises more and more in the Army, every man cried aloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Lord Lievtenant, What will ye do? Charge was given that all men should light, and go to array in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for they would fight: Others cried, Against whom will ye fight? yonder men will fight none other wayes than ye see them do, if ye will stand here while the morrow. New purpose was taken, That the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (they had there with them certain Bands of Souldiers) should safely retire towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Horse-men should take their Horse again, and so follow in order. Great was the noyse and confusion that was heard, while that every man calleth his own sluggards; the day was neer spent, and that was the cause of the greatest fear. The Lord <hi>Maxwell</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving what would be the end of such beginnings, stood upon his feet with his friends, who being admonished to take his horse, and provide for himselfe, answered, <hi>Nay, I will rather abide here the chance that it shall please God to send me, than to go home, and there be hanged</hi>; and so he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained upon his foot, and was taken while the multitude fled, and tooke the greater shame. The enemies perceiving the disorder, increased in courage. Before they shouted, but then they stroke; they shot Spears, and dagged Arrows where the Companies were thickest; some encounters were made, but nothing availeth, the Souldiers cast from them their Pikes and Culverings, and other Weapons fencible; the Horse-men left their Spears, and so without judgement all men fled. The Sea was filling, and so the water made great stop; but the fear was such, as happy was he that might get a taker: Such as passed the water, and escaped that danger, not well acquainted with the ground, fell into the slimy mosse; the entry thereof was pleasing enough, but as they proceeded, all that took that way, either lost their horse, or else themselves and horse both.

After that he spake not many words that were sensible, but ever harped on his old song, <hi>Fie, fled Oliver, is Oliver taken, all is lost.</hi> In this mean time, in his great extremity, comes the Cardinall (a fit comforter for a desperate man) he cries in his eare; <hi>Take order, Sir, with your Realme, who shall rule during the minority of your daughter: ye have knowne my service, What will ye have done? Shall there not be four Regents chosen? And shall not I be principall of them?</hi> Whatsoever the King answered, Documents were taken, That so it should be, as my Lord Cardinall thought expedient. As many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, a dead mans hand was made to subscribe one blank, that they might write above what it pleased them best; the Cardinall having hired one <hi>Henry Balfour,</hi> a Priest, to make a false Testament; which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, but in vain. This finished, the Cardinall posted to the Queen, lately before delivered,<note place="margin">Mark the Queens mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the King.</note> as is said.

Some praised him for the repressing of theft and oppression; others dispraised him for being much given to women. The Prelats and Clergie feared a change in the Kings minde, as he had expressed himself some few yeers before. And thus men spake even as their affection led them, and yet none spake altogether besides the truth; for part of these aforesaid were so manifest, that as the vertues could not be denied, so could not the vices by any craft be cloked. Yet to speak truth of him, his vices may justly be attributed to the times, and his breeding, and not any wickednesse in his nature; for he gave many expressions of a good nature, namely, in his sobriety and justice, &amp;c. The question of Government was thorow this Realme universally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The Cardinall proclaimed the Kings last Will, and therein were expressed four Protectors or Regents, of whom himself was the first and principall, and with him were joyned the Earls of <hi>Huntley, Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Murhay:</hi> this was done on Munday, at the Market Crosse of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> But the Munday following took the whole Regents remission for their usurpation: for by the stout and wise counsell of the Laird of <hi>Grange,</hi> did the Earle of <hi>Arran,</hi> then so neer to the Crown, cause assemble the Nobility of the Realme, and required the equity of their judgements in that his just suit to the Government of this Realm, during the minority of her to whom he pretended to succeed, failing of her, and of her lawfull succession. His friends convened, the Nobility assembled, the day of decision is appointed; the Cardinall and his faction opposes them, and are against the Government of one man, and especially of any called <hi>Hammilton:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Character of the <hi>Hamiltons.</hi>

These two things, together with an opinion that men had of his simplicity, bowed the hears of many unto him in the beginning; who after, with dolour of hearts, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to change their opinions: but hereof we will after speak.

At their instant suit, more than of his own motion, was <hi>Thomas Guilliame,</hi> a black Frier, called to be Preacher. The man was of sound judgement, of reasonable letters (as for that age) and of a prompt and good utterance.

To wit, <hi>That under paine of Heresie, no man should reade any part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Vulgar Tongue, neither yet any Tractate or Exposition of any place of Scripture</hi>: Such Articles began to come in question we say: And men began to enquire, If it were not lawfull to men that understood no <hi>Latine,</hi> to use the word of their Salvation in the Tongue they understood, as it was for the <hi>Latine</hi> men to have it in <hi>Latine, Grecians</hi> or <hi>Hebrews</hi> to have it in their Tongues. It was answered, That the Church, he means the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, first had forbidden all Tongues but the three <hi>viz.

Hume,</hi> sister to the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> his lawfull wife, and consequently his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Beton,</hi> Neece to <hi>Iames Beton,</hi> Bishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> (<hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Hume</hi> being alive) must be null, and he declared Bastard. <hi>Caiphas</hi> spake Prophesie, and yet wist not what he spake: For at that time there was hardly any man that truely feared God that minded any such thing, but with their whole force would have fortified him in the place that God had given unto him, and would never have called in question things done in time of darknesse. But this head we passe by till God declare his will therein. Another practise was used: As for the Cardinall, he being set at libertie (as before we have heard) ceased not to traffique with such of the Nobility as he might draw to his faction, or corrupt by any meanes, to raise a partie against the said Governour, and against such as stood fast at the Contract of Marriage and Peace with <hi>England.</hi> And so assembled at <hi>Lynlytquow,</hi> the said Cardinall, the Earles <hi>Argyle, Huntlie, Bothwell,</hi> the Bishops and their bands. And thereafter they passed to <hi>Strevelin,</hi> and took

New Commission was sent to Master <hi>Radulph Saidler</hi> (who then still remained in <hi>Scotland</hi>) to demand the cause of that sudden alteration, and to travell by all meanes possible, that the Governour might be called back to his former godly purpose, and that he would not do so foolishly, and dishonestly, yea, so cruelly and unmercifully to the Realme of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> that he would not onely lose the commodities offered, and that were presently to be received. But that also that he would put it to the hazard of fire and sword, and other inconveniences that might ensue the war that was to follow upon the violation of his Faith. But nothing could availe. The devil kept fast the grype that he got, yea all the dayes of his government: For the Cardinall got his eldest son in pledge, whom he kept in the Castle of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> while the day that Gods hand punished his pride. King <hi>Henry</hi> perceiving that all hope of the Governours repentance was lost, called back his Ambassadours, and that with fearfull threatnings as <hi>Edinburgh</hi> after felt: Denounced War, made our Ships prises, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Mariners lawfull prisoners, which to the Broughes of <hi>Scotland</hi> was no small hership. But thereat did the Cardinall and Priests laugh, and jestingly he said, <hi>When we shall conquer</hi> England <hi>the Merchants shall be recompensed.</hi> The Summer and the Harvest passed over without any notable thing: For the Cardinall and Abbot of <hi>Paislay</hi> parted the prey amongst them; The abused Governour bare the name onely. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Winter came the Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> sent from <hi>France</hi> in hatred of the Governour, whom the King (by the Cardinals advice) promised to pronounce Bastard, and so to make the said Earle Governour; First,<note place="margin">All this was then said by the Cardinall, <hi>Penes authorem fides est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they had no will to be in the Cardinals mercy. Fair promises enow were made for their security. Then was the Cardinall and his Band commanded to depart, as that he did, according to the purpose taken. The Governour remained, and a certain number with him: To whom came without company, the said Earle, Lord, and M. <hi>Henry.</hi> After many fair words given to them all, to wit, That he would have them agreed with the Cardinall, and that he would have Master <hi>Henry Balnaves</hi> the worker and instrument thereof, he drew them forwards with them towards Saint <hi>Iohnston,</hi> whereto the Cardinall was ridden. They began to suspect (albeit it was too late) and therefore they desired to have returned to their folks, for putting order unto them: But it was answered, They should send back from the town, but they must needs go forward with my Lord Governour: and so, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by flattery, and partly by force, they were compelled to obey; and as soon as they were in the Towne, they were apprehended, and on the morrow sent all three to the <hi>Black Nesse,</hi> where they remained as it pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cardinals gracelesse Grace, and that was till the Band of <hi>Manred,</hi> and of service, set some of them at liberty.

Shortly after, the Admirall shot a flott Boat, which from <hi>Granton hills,</hi> till by East <hi>Leith,</hi> sounded the deep, and so returned to her Ship. Hereof were divers opinions; men of judgement foresaw what it meant, but no credit was given to any that would say, They minded to land, and so passed every man to his rest, as if the Ships had been a guard for their defence. Upon the point of day upon Sunday the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> addresse they for landing, and they ordered the Ships so, that a Galley or two laid their snouts to the hills: the small Ships, called Pinnaces and light Horse-men, approached as neer as they could. The great Ships discharged their Souldiers into the smaller Vessels, and they by Boats set upon dry Land before ten of the clock, 10000 men, as was judged, and more. The Governour and Cardinall seeing then the thing that they could not, or at least they would not believe before, after they had made a brag to fight, fled as fast as horse could carry them; so that after, they approached not within twenty miles of the danger.

And because the most part were either sick, or else were in company with those that were sick, he choosd the head of the East port of the Towne for his Preaching place, and so the whole stood or sat within, the sick and suspected without the Port or gate. The Text upon the which his first Sermon was made, he took from the hundred and seventh Psalme; The Sentence thereof, <hi>He sent his Word and healed them</hi>; And therewith joyned these words, <hi>It is neither herbe nor plaister, O Lord, but thy Word healeth all.</hi> In which Sermon he most comfortably did entreat of the dignity &amp; utility of Gods word, the punishment that comes for the contempt of the same; the promptitude of Gods mercy to such as truly turn to him; yea, the great happinesse of them whom God taketh from this misery, even in his own gentle visitation, which the malice of man can neither mend nor pair.

With dejected visage, he said, I had rather ye had been in your beds, and it had been more profitable for you; for I was scarce well occupied. When they instantly urged him to let them know some comfort, he said, I will tell you, That I am assured that my travell is neer an end, and therefore call to God with me, that now I shrinke not when the battell waxes most hot.

To this time God hath used my labours to the instruction of others, and unto the disclosing of darknesse, and now I lurke as a man that were ashamed, and durst not shew himself before men. By these and the like words, they that heard him understood that his desire was to preach,<note place="margin">Note the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of a Preacher.</note> and therefore said, Most comfortable it was unto us to hear you; but because we know the danger wherein ye stand, we dare not desire you.

Finally, it was concluded, That the next Sunday he should preach in <hi>Leith,</hi> as he did, and took the Text, <hi>The Parable of the sower that went forth to sow seed, Matth.</hi> 13. And this was upon the fifteenth day before Christmas. The Sermon ended, the Gentlemen of <hi>Lowthan,</hi> who then were earnest Professors of Christ Jesus, thought not expedient that he should remain in <hi>Leith,</hi> because that the Governour and Cardinall were shortly to come to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and therefore they took him with them, and kept him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>Brunston,</hi> sometimes in <hi>Langnidrie,</hi> and sometimes in <hi>Ormeston.</hi> For these three diligently waited upon him.

said publikely, <hi>I know that my Lord Governour. and my Lord Cardinall shall hear that I have been at this preaching</hi> (for they were then at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) <hi>Say unto them, That I will avow it, and will not onely maintain the Doctrine that I have heard, but also the person of the Teacher, to the uttermost of my power.</hi> Which words greatly rejoyced the people, and the Gentlemen then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. One thing notable in that Sermon we cannot passe by: Amongst others,<note place="margin">Two gray Friers.</note> there came two gray Friers, and standing in the entry of the Church door, they made some whispering to such as came in: which perceived, the Preacher said to the people that stood neer them, <hi>I heartily pray you to make room to those two men, it may be that they be come to learne.</hi> And unto them he said, <hi>Come neer</hi> (for they stood in the very entry of the door) <hi>for I assure you ye shall hear the Word of verity, which shall either seal in you this same day your salvation or condemnation.</hi> And so proceeded he in Doctrine, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing they would have been quiet: But when he perceived them still to trouble the people that stood neer them (for vehement was he against the false worshipping of God) he turned unto them the second time, and with an irefull countenance said, <hi>O Sergeants of Sathan, and deceivers of the souls of men, Will ye neither heare Gods Truth, nor suffer others to heare it; Depart, and take this for your portion, God shall shortly confound and disclose your hypocrisie within this Realme; ye shall be abominable unto men, and your places and habitations shall be desolate.</hi> This Sentence he pronounced with great vehemency in the midst of the Sermon: And turning to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he said, <hi>You wicked men have provoked the Spirit of God to anger.</hi> And so he returned to his matter, and proceeded to the end.

The cause was judged to have been, That the Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who in those bounds used to have great credit and obedience, by procurement of the Cardinall, had given inhibition, as well unto the Towne, as unto the Countrey, that they should not hear him, under the pain of his displeasure. The first night he lay within the Towne, with <hi>David Forrest,</hi> now called the Generall, a man that long professed the truth, and upon whom many in that time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. The second night he lay in <hi>Lethington,</hi> the Laird whereof was ever civill, albeit not perswaded in Religion. The day following, before the said M. <hi>George</hi> past to the Sermon, there came to him a boy, with a Letter from the <hi>Westland</hi>; which received and read, he called for <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> who had waited upon him carefully from the time he came to <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaine,</hi> with whom he began to enter into purpose, That he wearied of



<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61872:69"/>
the world, for he perceiveth that men began to be weary of God. The cause of his complaint was; The Gentlemen of the West had written unto him, That they could not keep the meeting at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The said <hi>Io. Knox</hi> wondering that he desired to keep any purpose before Sermon (for that was not his accustomed use before) said, <hi>Sir, the time of Sermon approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, I will leave you for the present to your meditation.</hi> And so he took the Bill containing the purpose aforesaid, and left him: the said Master <hi>George</hi> walked up and down behinde the high Altar more than half an houre. His weary countenance and visage declared the grief and alteration of his minde. At last he passeth to the Pulpit; but the Auditory was small, he should have begun to have treated of the second Table of the Law: but thereof in that Sermon spake he very little. He began on this manner: <hi>O Lord, How long shall it be that thy holy Word shall be despised, and men shall not regard their owne salvation? I have heard of thee, Hadington, That in thee would have been, at any vaine Clarke Play, two or three thousand people; and now to hear the Messenger of the Eternall God, of all the Towne or Parish, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be numbred one hundred persons: Sore and fearfull shall the plagues be, that shall ensue upon of this thy contempt, with fire and sword shalt thou be plagued: Yea, thou Hadington in speciall,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Hading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>strangers shall possesse thee, and you the present inhabitants shall either in bondage serve your enemies, or else ye shall be chased from your own habitations; and that because ye have not knowne, nor will not know the time of Gods mercifull visitation.</hi> In such vehemency and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning continued that servant of God, neer an hour and an half; in the which he declared all the plagues that ensued as plainly, as after our eyes saw them performed. In the end he said, <hi>I have forgotten my self, and the matter that I should have treated of: But let these my last words concerning publike Preaching remain in your mindes, till that God send you new comfort.</hi> Thereafter he made a short Paraphrase upon the second Table, with an Exhortation to patience, to the fear of God, and unto the works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and so ended, as it were making his last Testament, as the issue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fully. The Spirit of Truth and of true Judgement were both in his heart and mouth: for that same night was he apprehended before mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, in the house of <hi>Ormeston,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Master <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde</hi> taken at <hi>Ormeston.</hi>
                     </note> by the Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> made for money butcher to the Cardinall. The manner of his taking was thus: Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the towne of <hi>Hadington,</hi> he took his good-night, as it were, for ever,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> of all his acquaintance, especially from <hi>Hewe Dowglas</hi> of <hi>Langin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie. Iohn Knox</hi> pressing to have gone with the said Master <hi>George,</hi> he said, <hi>Nay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He means Gods people.</note> 
                     <hi>returne to your children, and God blesse you; one is sufficient for one Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> And so the said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> albeit unwillingly obeyed, and returned with <hi>Hewe Dowglas</hi> of <hi>Langindrie,</hi> Master <hi>George</hi> having to accompany him the Laird of <hi>Ormeston, Iohn Sandelandes</hi> of <hi>Calder</hi> younger, the Laird of <hi>Brounston,</hi> and others, with their servants, passed upon foot (for it was a vehement Frost) to <hi>Ormeston.</hi> After supper he held com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable purpose of Gods chosen children, and merrily said, <hi>Methinke that I desire earnestly to sleep:</hi> And therewith he said, <hi>Shall we sing a Psalm?</hi> And so he appointed the One and fiftieth Psalme, which was put in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Meeter, and began thus, <hi>Have mercy on me now good Lord after thy great mercy, &amp;c.</hi> Which being ended, he past to his Chamber, and sooner



<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61872:70"/>
then his common diet, was to passe to bed with these words, <hi>And grant qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et rest.</hi> Before midnight the place was beset about, that none could escape to make advertisement. The Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> came and called for the Laird, and declared the purpose, and said, That it was but in vain to make him to hold his house, for the Governour and the Cardinall with all their power were coming (and indeed the Cardinall was at <hi>Elphinston,</hi> not a mile distant from <hi>Ormeston</hi>) But if he would deliver the man to him, he would promise upon his Honour,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Bothwels</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</note> That he should be safe, and that it should passe the power of the Cardinall to do him any harme or hurt. Allured with these words, and taking counsell with the said Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>George,</hi> (who at the first word said, <hi>Open the gates, the blessed will of my God be done.</hi>) They received in the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> himself, with some Gentlemen with him: To whom Master <hi>George</hi> said, <hi>I praise my God, that so honourable a man as you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">M <hi>Georges</hi> words to the Earl <hi>Bothwell.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>my Lord, receiveth me this night, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of these noble men: For now I am assured, That for your Honours sake, ye will suffer nothing any wayes to be done to me, but by the order of Law. I am not ignorant that all their Law is nothing but corruption, and a cloake to shed the blood of the Saints. But yet I lesse fear to die openly, than se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to be murthered.</hi> The said Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> answered, <hi>I shall not onely preserve your body from all violence that shall be purposed against you against order of Law, but also I promise here in the presence of these Gentlemen, That neither shall the Governour nor the Cardinall have their will of you, But I shall retaine you in mine owne hands, and in mine owne house, till that either I shall make you free, or else restore you in the same place where I receive you.</hi> The Lairds aforesaid, said, <hi>My Lord, If ye will do as you have spoken, and as we thinke your Lordship will do, then do we here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise unto your Lordship, That not onely we our selves shall serve you all the dayes of our life, but also we shall procure the whole professors within</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than <hi>to do the same. And upon either the preservation of this our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or upon his delivery againe to our hands; we being reasonably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised to receive him, That we, in the name and behalfe of our friends, shall deliver to your Lordship, or any sufficient man that shall deliver to us againe this servant of God, our Band of Manred in manner requisite.</hi> And thus promise made in the presence of God, and hands stricken upon both the parties for observation of the promise, the said Master <hi>George</hi> was delivered to the hands of the said Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi>; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately departing with him, came to <hi>Elphinston,</hi> where the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall was. Who knowing that <hi>Calder Younger,</hi> and <hi>Brunston,</hi> were with <hi>Iohan Cocburne</hi> Laird of <hi>Ormeston,</hi> sent back with expedition to apprehend them also. The noyse of Horse-men being heard, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants gave advertisement, That more then departed, or was there before, were returned. And while that they dispute what should be the motive, the Cardinalls Garrison had seized both the outer and inner Close. They called for the Laird, and for the Laird of <hi>Calder,</hi> who presenting themselves, demanded what their COMMISSION was. To bring you two, and the Laird of <hi>Brouneston</hi> to my Lord GOVERNOUR. They were nothing content (as they had no cause) and yet they



<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61872:70"/>
made faire countenance, and intreated the Gentlemen to drinke, and to baite their horses, till that they might put themselves in readinesse to ride with them. In this meane time <hi>Brounston</hi> conveyed himselfe first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, and then by speed of foot to <hi>Ormiston</hi> wood, and from thence to <hi>Dundallon,</hi> and so escaped that danger; the other two were put into the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the one, to wit, <hi>Calder Zounger,</hi> remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his baud of <hi>Manred</hi> to the Cardinall, was the meanes of his deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: And the other, to wit, <hi>Ormiston,</hi> freed himselfe by leaping off the wall of the Castle, betwixt ten of the clock and eleven before noon: And so breaking Ward, he escaped prison, which he unjustly suffered. The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God M. <hi>George Wischarde,</hi> was carried first to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after brought backe, for fashion sake, to the house of <hi>Hailles</hi> againe, which was the principall place that then the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> had in <hi>Lothiane.</hi> But as gold and women have corrupted all worldly and fleshly men from the beginning, so did they him: For the Cardinall gave gold, and that large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the Queen, with whom the said Earle was then in the Glunders, promised him favour in all his lawfull suites to women: if he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the said M. <hi>George,</hi> to be kept in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> He made some resistance at the first, by reason of his promise. But an effeminate man cannot long withstand the assaults of a gracious Queene, and so was the servant of God transported to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the Cardinall then had a convention of Prelats, wherein somewhat was said of redressing the abuses of the Church, and reforming the lives of the Clergie, but it tooke no effect. M. <hi>Wischarde</hi> remained but few dayes in <hi>Edinburgh</hi>: For that bloodie woolfe the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> ever thirsting after the blood of the servant of God, so travelled with the abused <hi>Governour,</hi> that he was content that Gods servant should be delivered to the power of that Tyrannie. And so small inversion being made, <hi>Pilate</hi> obeyed the petition of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and of his fellows, and adjudged <hi>Christ</hi> to be crucified. The Cardinall seeing it was forbidden by the Canon Law to Priests to sit as Judges upon life and death, although the crime were Heresie, sent to the Governour, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to name some Lay-Judge to pronounce Sentence against M. <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde.</hi> The Governour had freely condescended to the Cardinalls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, without delay, if <hi>David Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Preston,</hi> a godly and wise man, had not remonstrated unto him, That he could expect no better end then <hi>Saul,</hi> since he persecuted the Saints of God, for that Truth which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed once with such a shew of earnestnesse; the profession thereof, being the onely cause of his advancement to that high degree wherein he was: The Governour moved at this Speech of <hi>David Hamiltons,</hi> answered the Cardinall; That he would not meddle with the blood of that good man; and told him, That his blood should be on him, for he himselfe would be free of it. At this the Cardinall was angry, and said he would proceed, and that he had sent to the Governour of meere civility, without any need. And so the servant of God, delivered to the hand of that proud and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse Tyrannie, triumph was made by the Priests. The godly lamented, and accused the foolishnesse of the Governour: For by the retaining of the said M. <hi>George,</hi> he might have caused Protestants and Papists (rather proud Romanists) to have served; The one, to the end the life of their



<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61872:71"/>
Preacher might have been saved; The other, for feare that he should have set him at liberty again, to the confusion of the Bishops. <hi>But where God is left (as he had plainely renounced him before) what can counsell or judgement availe?</hi> How the servant of God was dealt withall, and what he did from the day that he entred within the sea Tower of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> which was in the end of January,<note place="margin">1546.</note> in the yeere of God 1546. unto the first of March the same yeere when he suffered, we cannot certainly tell, except we understand he wrote somewhat in prison, but that was suppressed by the enemies. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> delayed no time, but caused all <hi>Bishops,</hi> yea, all the Clergie that had any preheminence, to be called to S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> against the seven and twentieth day of February, that consultation might be had in that question; which in his minde was no lesse resolved, then Christs death was in the minde of <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> But that the rest should bear the like burden with him, he would that they should before the world subscribe whatsoever he did. In that day was wrought a wonder, not unlike that which was at the accusation and death of Jesus Christ, when <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> who before were enemies, were made friends, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting of them both to Christs condemnation;<note place="margin">

                     </note>The Cardinall was knowne proud; and <hi>Dumbar</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi> was knowne a glorious foole: And yet because sometimes he was called the Kings Master, he was Chancellour of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Cardinall cometh even the same yeere, in the end of harvest before to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> upon what purpose we omit. But while they remaine together, the one in the Towne, the other in the Castle; Question riseth for bearing of their Crosses.<note place="margin">A question worthy of such two Prelats.</note> The Cardinall alleadged, That by reason of his Cardinalship, and that he was <hi>Legatus natus,</hi> and Primate within <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>Antichrist</hi>; That he should have the preheminence, and that his Crosse should not onely go before, but that also it should onely be borne wheresoever he was. Good <hi>Gukstone Glakstone,</hi> the aforesaid <hi>Archbishop,</hi> lacked no reasons, as he thought, for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his glory. He was an Archbishop in his owne Diocesse, and in his owne Cathedrall Seat and Church, and therefore ought to give place to no man. The power of the Cardinall was but begged from <hi>Rome,</hi> and appertaineth but to his own person, and not to his Bishoprick, for it might be, that his successour should not be Cardinall, but his dignity was annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his office, and did appertaine to all that ever should be Bishops of <hi>Glasgow.</hi> Howsoever these doubts were resolved by the Doctors of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of both the Prelats, yet the decision was as ye shall heare; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth (or going in, all is one) at the Queere doore of <hi>Glasgow</hi> Church, begins striving for state betwixt the Crosse-bearers, so that from glouming they came to shouldring, and so from shouldring they go to buffets, and from dry blowe-neffaling; and then for charities sake, they cry, <hi>Disperst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61872:71"/>
staffe was strongest, and which Crosse-bearer could best defend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters preheminence; and that there should be no superiority in that behalf, to the ground go both their Crosses. And then began no little fray, but yet a merry game, for rockets were rent, tippets were torne, crowns were knapped, and side gowns might have been seen wantonly to wagge from the one wall to the other: Many of them lacked beards, and that was the more pity, and therefore could not buckle other by the brises, as bold men would have done. But fie on the Jackmen, that did not their duty: For had the one part of them recountred the other, then had all gone right; but the Sanctuary we suppose saved the lives of many. How merrily so ever this be written, it was bitter mirth to the Cardinall and his court. It was more then irregularity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, it might well have been judged <hi>laese majesté</hi> to the son of perdition, the Popes own person; and yet the other in his folly, as proud as a Peacocke, would let the Cardinall know, that he was a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, when the other but <hi>Beton,</hi> before he gat the Abbey of <hi>Aberbroth.</hi> This enmity was judged mortall, and without all hope of reconciliation. But the blood of the innocent servant of God, buried in oblivion all that bragging and boast. For the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was the first unto whom the Cardinall wrote, signifying unto him what was done, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly craving of him, that he would assist with his presence and counsell, how that such an enemy to their estate might be suppressed. And thereto was not the other slow, but kept time appointed, sat next to the Cardinall, waited and subscribed first in ranke, and lay over the East block-house with the said Cardinall, till the Martyr of God was consumed with fire: for this we may note, That all these beasts consented in heart to the slaughter of that Innocent. So did they approve it with their presence, having the whole ordnance of the Castle of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> bent towards the place of execution, which was neere to the Castle, ready to have shot, if any would have made defence or rescue to Gods servant. The manner of his Accusation, Processe, and Answers followeth, as we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from certaine Records, which we relate truely, as neere as possibly we can.</p>
                  <p>Upon the last of February was sent to the prison where the servant of God lay,<note place="margin">1546.</note> the <hi>Deane</hi> of the Towne, by the commandment of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> and his wicked counsell, and there summoned the said Master <hi>George,</hi> that he should on the morrow following appeare before the Judge, then and there to give account of his seditious and Hereticall Doctrine. To whom the said Master <hi>George</hi> answered; What needeth (said he) the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to summon me to answer for my Doctrine openly before him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whose power and Dominion I am thus straightly bound in irons? May not he compell me to answer, of his extort power? Or beleeveth he that I am unprovided to render account of my Doctrine? To mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest your selves what men ye are, it is well done that ye keepe your old Ceremonies and Constitutions made by men. Upon the next morrow the Lord Cardinall caused his servants to addresse themselves in their most warlike array, with Jack, Knapscall, Splent, Spear, &amp; Axe, more seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the war then for the Preaching of the true word of God. And when these armed Champions, marching in warlike order, had conveyed the



<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61872:72"/>
Bishops into the Abbey-church, incontinently they sent for M. <hi>George,</hi> who was conveyed unto the said Church by the Captaine of the Castle, and the number of an hundred men, addressed in manner aforesaid, like a Lamb led they him to the sacrifice. As he entred in at the Abbey-Church doore, there was a poore man lying vexed with great infirmities, asking of his almes, to whom he flung his purse, and when he came before the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, by and by the Sub-prior of the Abbey,<note place="margin">Who was a learned man and heartily favoured the pure Religion, in secret.</note> called Deane <hi>Iohn Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame,</hi> stood up in the Pulpit, and made a Sermon to all the congregation there then assembled, taking his matter out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. Whose Sermon was divided into foure parts. The first was, A short and briefe declaration of the Evangelist. The second, of the interpretation of the good seed: And because he called the Word of God the good seed, and Heresie the evil seed; he declared what Heresie was, and how it should be knowne. He defined it on this manner;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bona heresios definitio, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Heresie is a false Opinion, defended with Pertinacie, clearely repugning the Word of God.</hi> The third part of his Sermon was, The cause of Heresie within that realm, and all other realms. The cause of Heresie (said he) is the ignorance of them which have the cures of mens soules: to whom it necessarily belongeth to have the true understanding of the Word of God,<note place="margin">Note the cause of Heresie.</note> that they may be able to winne again the false Teachers of Heresies, with the sword of the Spirit, which is, the word of God: and not onely to win again, but also to overcome, as faith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, A bishop must be faultlesse, as becometh the minister of God, not stubborn, nor angry, no drunkard, no fighter, not given to filthy lucre, but harbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, one that loved goodnesse, sober-minded, righteous, holy, temperate, and such as cleaveth unto the true Word of Doctrine. That he may be able with wholsome learning, and to impugne that which they say against him.</hi> The fourth part of his Sermon was, how Heresies should be knowne; Heresies (quoth he) be knowne on this manner;<note place="margin">The Proofe of Heresie.</note> As the God-smith knoweth the fine gold from the unperfit, by the touch-stone; So likewise may we know Heresie by the undoubted Touch-stone, that is, The true, sincere, and undefiled Word of God. At the last he added, That Hereticks should be put down in this present life. To which Proposition, the Gospel he treated of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not to repugne, <hi>Let them both grow to the harvest.</hi> The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest is the end of the world, neverthelesse he affirmed, That they should be put down by the civill Magistrate, and Law. And when he ended his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, incontinent they caused M. <hi>George</hi> to ascend into the Pulpit, there to heare his Accusation and Articles, for right against him stood one of the fat flock, a monster, <hi>Iohn Lawder,</hi> a Priest, laden full of cursings, written in paper of the which he took out a roule, both long, and also full of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, threatnings, maledictions, and words of devilish spite and malice, saying to the innocent M. <hi>George,</hi> so many cruell and abominable words, and hit him so spitefully with the Popes thunder, that the ignorant people dreaded lest the earth then would have swallowed him up quick. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he stood still with great patience, hearing their sayings, not once moving or changing his countenance. When that this fat sow had read thorowout all his lying menaces, his face running down with sweat, and froathing at the mouth like a boare: He spate at M. <hi>Georges</hi> face, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>What answers thou to these sayings? Thou runagate, traitour, theefe, which we



<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61872:72"/>
have duely proved by sufficient witnesse against thee.</hi> Master <hi>George</hi> hearing this, sate downe upon his knees in the Pulpit, making his prayer to God. When he had ended his Prayer, sweetly and Christianly, he answered unto them all in this manner:</p>

Wherefore I pray your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions quietly to heare me, that ye may know what were my Sayings, and the manner of my Doctrine. This my Petition (my Lords) I desire to be heard for three causes. The first is, Because through preaching of the Word of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his glory is made manifest. It is reasonable therefore, for the advancing of the glory of God, that ye heare me teaching truely the pure and sincere Word of God, without any dissimulation. The second reason is, Because that your health <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> springeth of the Word of God, for he worketh all things by his Word. It were therefore an unrighteous thing, if ye should stop your eares from me, teaching truely the Word of God. The third reason is, Because your Doctrine speaketh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> forth many pestilentious, blasphemous, and abominable words, not coming by the inspiration of God, but of the devill, on no lesse perill than my life. It is just therefore and reasonable for <hi>your discretions,</hi> to know what my words and Doctrine are, and what I have ever taught in my time in this Realme, that I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish not unjustly, to the great perils of your selves. Wherefore both for the glory of God, your owne health, and safeguard of my life, I beseech your discretions to heare me, and in the meane time I shall recite my Doctrine, without any colour.</p>
                              <p>First and chiefly, since the time that I came into this Realme, I taught nothing but the ten Commandments of God, the twelve Articles of the <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Prayer of the Lord in the mother Tongue. Moreover, in <hi>Dundie</hi> I taught the Epistle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And I shall shew <hi>your discretions</hi> faithfully what fashion and-manner I used, when I taught without any humane dread. So that <hi>your discretions</hi> give me your eares benevolent and attentive.</p>

To whom this humble man answered, saying,</hi> I refuse not my Lord Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but I desire the Word of God to be my Iudge, the Temporall estate with some of your Lordships mine auditors, because I am here my Lord Governours prisoner. <hi>Whereupon the pridefull and scornfull people that stood by, mocked him saying,</hi> Such man, such Iudge, <hi>speaking seditious and reproachfull words against the Governour, and other of the Nobles, meaning them also to be hereticks. And incontinent, without all delay, they would have given sentence upon M.</hi> George, <hi>and that without further Processe, had not certain men there councelled my Lord Cardinall to reade againe the Articles, and to heare his answers thereupon, that the people might not complaine of his wrongfull condemnation.

                                    <p>My Lords, I say, That Auricular Confession, seeing that it hath no promise of the Gospel, truely it cannot be a Sacrament.

The lawfull use of the Sacrament is most acceptable unto God. But the great abuse of it, is very detestable unto him: But what occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they have to say such words of me, I shall shortly shew your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.

We see the poor almost perish through hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger amongst you, yet you are not moved with pity towards them: But amongst us <hi>Iewes,</hi> though we be poor, there are no beggers found. Secondarily, It is forbidden by the Law to fain any kinde of Imagery, of things in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the Sea under the earth, but one God onely to honour. But your Sanctuaries and Churches are full of Idolls. Thirdly, a piece of bread baked upon the ashes, ye adore and worship, and say that it is your God.

                                 <p>Thou false Hereticke doest say, That we should not pray unto Saints, but to God onely; Say whether thou hast said this or no, say shortly.</p>

                                    <p>For the weaknesse and infirmity of the hearers, he said, without doubt plainely, That Saints should not be honoured, nor called upon. My Lords (said he) there are two things worthy of note.<note place="margin">
                                          <hi>Note.</hi>
                                       </note> The one is certaine, and the other uncertain. It is found plainely and certain in Scriptures, That we should worship and honour one God, according to the saying of the first Commandment, <hi>Thou shalt onely worship and honour thy Lord God with all thine heart.</hi> But as for praying to, and honouring of Saints, there is great doubt amongst many, whether they heare or no the invocation made unto them. Therefore I exhorted all men equally in my Doctrine, That they should leave the unsure way, and follow the way which was taught us by our Master Christ. He is onely our Mediatour, and maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us to God his Father. He is the doore by the which we must enter in: He that entreth not in by this doore, but climeth another way, is a thiefe and a murderer. He is the veritie and life: he that goeth out of the way, there is no doubt he shall fall into the mire: Yea, verily he is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into it already. This is the fashion of my Doctrine, the which I have ever followed. Verily that which I have heard and read in the Word of God, I taught openly and in no corners, and now ye shall witnesse the same, if your Lordships will heare me: Except it stand by the Word of God, I dare not be so bold to affirme any thing. These sayings he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed divers times.</p>

                                    <p>Of this, my Lords, I have read in the Gospel, That there are three kinde of chaste men, some are gelded from their mothers womb: some are gelded by men, and some have gelded themselves for the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens sake; Verily, I say, these men are blessed by the Scripture of God. But as many as have not the gift of chastity; nor yet for the Gospel, have overcome the concupiscence of the flesh, and have vowed chastity; ye have experience, although I should hold my tongue, to what inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences they have vowed themselves.

                  <p>Then by and by they caused the common people to remove, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was always to hear that Innocent man speak. Then the sons of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse pronounced their sentence definitive, not having respect to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. When all this was done and said, the Cardinall causeth his tormentors to passe again with the meek Lambe unto the Castle, untill such time as the fire was made ready. When he was come into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, then there came two <hi>fiends,</hi> two gray-Friers, Frier <hi>Scot</hi> and his mate, saying, Sir, you must make your confession unto us. He answered, I will make no confession: Go fetch me yonder man that preached unto us this day, and I will conferre with him. Then they sent for the <hi>Sub-prior</hi> of the Abbey, who came to him with all diligence. And conferred with him a pretty while, at last burst forth in teares, but so soon as he was able to speak, he asked him, If he would receive the Communion; Master <hi>Wischarde</hi> answered, He would most willingly, if he could have it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christs institution under both kindes. The Sub-prior went to the Cardinall and his Prelats, he told them, That Master <hi>Wischarde</hi> was an innocent man; which he said, not to intercede for his life; but to make known the innocency of the man unto all men, as it was known to God. At these words the Cardinall was angry, and said to the Sub-Prior, Long agoe we knew what you were; Then the Sub-Prior demanded, Whether they would suffer M. <hi>Wischarde</hi> to receive the Communion or no; They answered, No. A while after M. <hi>Wischarde</hi> had ended with the Sub-Prior, the Captaine of the Castle, with some other friends, came to him, and asked him; If he would break fast with them; He answered, Most willingly, for I know you to be most honest and godly men; So all being ready, he desired them to sit downe, and heare him a while with patience; Then he discoursed to them about halfe an houre concerning the Lords Supper, his Sufferings and Death for us; He exhorteth them to love one another, laying aside all rancor, envie, and vengeance as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect members of Christ, who intercedes continually for us to God the Father. After this he gave thanks, and blessing the Bread and Wine, he took the Bread and brake it, and gave to every one of it, bidding each of them, <hi>Remember that Christ had died for them, and feed on it spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So taking the Cup, he bade them, <hi>Remember that Christs blood was

shed for them, &amp;c.</hi> And after he gave thanks and prayed for them. When he had done, he told them, That he would neither eat nor drink more in this life; and so retired to his Chamber. Immediately after came to him (sent from the Cardinall) two executioners; one brought him a coat of Linnen died black, and put it upon him; The other brought some baggs full of Powder, which they tied to severall parts of his body: Thus having dressed him, they brought him to an outer Roome, neere to the gate of the Castle; Then the fire was made ready, and the Stake at the West port of the Castle, neere to the Priory. Over against the place of execution, the Castle Windows were hung with rich hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Velvet Cushions, laid for the Cardinall and Prelats, who from thence did feed their eyes with the torments of this innocent man. The Cardinall dreading that Master <hi>George</hi> should have been taken away by his friends; Before had commanded to bend all the ordnance of the Castle right against the place of execution; and commanded all his Gunners to be ready, and stand beside their Gunnes, unto such time as he was burnt. All this being done, they bound Master <hi>George</hi> his hands behinde his backe, and with sound of Trumpet, led him forth with the Souldiers, from the Castle, to the place of their cruell and wicked exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. As he came forth of the Castle gate, there met him certain beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, asking of him almes for Gods sake; To whom he answered, I want my hands, wherewith I was wont to give you almes; But the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Lord, of his benignity and abundant grace, that feedeth all men, vouchsafe to give you necessaries both unto your bodies and soules. Then afterward met him two false <hi>Fiends,</hi> (I should say Friers) saying, M. <hi>George,</hi> pray to your Lady, that she may be a Mediatrix for you to her Sonne: To whom he answered meekly; Cease, tempt me not, I intreat you. After this he was led to the fire, with a rope about his neck, and a chaine of iron about his middle.</p>
                  <p>When that he came to the fire he sat downe upon his knees, and rose againe; And thrice he said these words; <hi>O thou Saviour of the world, have mercy on me: Father of heaven, I commend my spirit into thy holy hands.</hi> When he had made this Prayer, he turned him to the people, and said these words, having obtained leave to speak a little: I beseech you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian brethren and sisters, that ye be not offended at the Word of God, for the affliction and torments which ye see already prepared for me. But I exhort you that ye love the Word of God for your salvation, and suffer patiently, and with a comfortable heart, for the Words sake, which is your undoubted salvation, and everlasting comfort. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I pray you, shew my brethren and sisters, which have heard me oft before, that they cease not, nor leave off to learne the word of God which I taught them, after the grace given unto me, for no persecutions nor troubles in this world, which last not: And shew unto them that my Doctrine was no wives fables, after the constitutions made by men; And if I had taught mens doctrine, I had gotten greater thanks by men. But for the Words sake and true Gospel, which was given to me by the grace of God, I suffer this day by men, not sorrowfully, but with a glad heart and minde. For this cause I was sent, That I should suffer this fire for Christs

Some have said of me, That I taught that the soul of man should sleep untill the last day: But I know surely, and my faith is such, That my soul shall sup with my Saviour this night, ere it be six hours, for whom I suffer this. Then he prayed for them which accused him, saying, <hi>I beseech the Father of heaven to forgive them that have of any ignorance, or else of any evil minde forged lies upon me; I forgive them with all my heart: I beseech Christ forgive them that have condemned me to death this day ignorantly.</hi> And last of all, he said to the people on this manner; I beseech you brethren and sisters to exhort your <hi>Prelats</hi> to the learning of the Word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they may be ashamed to do evil, and learn to do good; And if they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themselves from their wicked errour, there shall hastily come upon them the wrath of God, which they shall not eschew. Many faithfull words said he in the meane time, taking no heed or care of the cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were then prepared for him. Then the Executioner that was his tormentor, sate down upon his knees, and said, <hi>Sir, I pray you forgive me, for I am not guilty of your death.</hi> To whom he answered, Come hither to me: When he was come to him, he kissed his cheek, and said, Lo here is a token that I forgive thee, my heart, do thy Office: And then by and by the Trumpet sounding, he was tyed to the stake, and the fire kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The Captain of the Castle, for the love he bore to M. <hi>Wischarde,</hi> drew so neer to the fire, that the flame thereof did him harme; he wished M. <hi>Wischarde</hi> to be of good courage, and to beg from God the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his sins; to whom M. <hi>Wischarde</hi> answered thus; <hi>This fire torments my body, but no wayes abates my spirit.</hi> Then M. <hi>Wischarde</hi> looking towards the Cardinall, said, <hi>He who in such state, from that high place, feedeth his eyes with my torments, within few dayes shall be hanged out at the same window, to be seen with us much ignominy, as he now leaneth there in pride.</hi> Then with this, the Executioner drawing the Cord, stopt his breath; presently after, the fire being great, he was consumed to powder. The Prelats would not suffer any prayers to be made for him, according to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. After the death of Master <hi>Wischarde,</hi> the Cardinall was cryed up by his flatterers, and all the rabble of the corrupt Clergie, as the onely Defender of the Catholike Church, and punisher of hereticks, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the authority of the sluggish Governour: And it was said by them, <hi>That if the great Prelates of latter dayes, both at home and abroad, had been so stout and zealous of the credit of the Catholike Church, they had not onely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed all hereticks, but also kept under the Lay-men, who were so froward and stubborne.</hi> On the other side, when that the people beheld the great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of that innocent, they could not withhold from piteous mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and complaining of the innocent lambs slaughter. After the death of this blessed Martyr of God, began the people in plaine speaking, to damne and detest the cruelty that was used; yea, men of great birth and estimation and honour at open tables avowed, That the blood of the said Master <hi>George</hi> should be revenged, or else it should cost life for life: and



<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61872:78"/>
that in a short time they should be like hogs kept for slaughter, by this vitious Priest, and wicked Monster, which neither minded God, nor cared for man. Amongst those that spake against the Cardinalls cruelty, <hi>Iohn Lesley,</hi> brother to the Earle of <hi>Rothes</hi> was chief, with his Cozen <hi>Norman Lesley,</hi> who had been a great follower of the Cardinall, and very active for him but a little before, fell so foule with him, that they came to high reproaches one with another. The occasion of their falling out was a private businesse, wherein <hi>Norman Lesley</hi> said he was wronged by the Cardinall: On the other side, the Cardinall said he was not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect used by <hi>Norman Lesley</hi> his inferiour. The said <hi>Iohn Lesley</hi> in all companies spared not to say, That that same dagger (shewing forth his dagger) and that same hand should be put in the Cardinalls brest. These brutes came to the Cardinalls ears:<note place="margin">

                     </note> but he thought himselfe stout enough for all <hi>Scotland:</hi> For in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, in his new <hi>Block-House,</hi> he was sure, as he thought, and upon the fields he was able to match all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: And to speak the truth, the most part of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> had either given unto him their Bands of <hi>Manred,</hi> or else were in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, and promised amity with him, and so he gave his bastard eldest daughter in Marriage to the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> his eldest son and heir, and caused the Wedding to be celebrate with such State, as if she had been a Princes lawfull daughter. He onely feared them in whose hands God did deliver him, and for them he laid his nets so secretly (as that he made a full compt) that their feet could not escape, as we shall after hear. And something of his former practices we may recompt. After <hi>Easter</hi> he came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to hold the Seingnye (as the Papists termed then their unhappy Assembly of <hi>Baals</hi> shaven sort) It was bruted that something was purposed against him at that day by the Earle of <hi>Angus</hi> and his friends, whom he mortally feared, and whose destruction he sought; but it failed, and so returned he to his strength; yea, to his god and onely comfort, as well in heaven as in earth; and there he remained without all fear of death, promising to himself no lesse pleasure then did the rich man of whom mention is made by our Master in the Gospel; for he did not onely say, Eat and be glad, my soul, for thou hast great riches laid up in store for many dayes; but he said, <hi>Tush, a figge for the fooles, and a button for the bragging of heretickes, and their assistance in</hi> Scotland: <hi>Is not my Lord Governour mine? witnesse his eldest son in pledge at my table. Have I not the Queen at my owne devotion</hi> (he meant of the mother <hi>Mary</hi> that now 1566 raigns) <hi>Is not</hi> France <hi>my friend,</hi>

                     <hi>and I am friend to</hi> France? <hi>What danger should I feare?</hi> And thus in vanity the carnall Cardinall delighted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a little before his death. But yet he had devised to have cut off such as he thought might trouble him: For he had appointed the whole Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>Fyfe</hi> to have met him at <hi>Falkland</hi> the Munday; but he was slain upon the Saturday before. His treasonable purpose was not understood, and it was this; That <hi>Norman Lesley,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Fyfe,</hi> and apparent heir to his Father the Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi>

used at his pleasure. This enterprise was disclosed after his slaughter, partly by Letters and Memorialls found in his chamber, but plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by such as were of the counsell. Many purposes were devised, how that wicked man might have been taken away; But all faileth, till Friday the twenty eighth of <hi>May,</hi>

Last came <hi>Iohn Lesley</hi> as aforesaid, who was most suspected: What conclusion they took that night, it was not knowne, but by the issue that followed. But early upon the Saturday in the morning, the 29 of <hi>May,</hi> were they in sundry Companies in the Abbey Church-yard, not far distant from the Castle: First, the Gates being open, and the draw-Bridge letten downe, for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Lime and Stones, and other things necessary for building (for <hi>Babilon</hi> was almost finished) First, we say, assayed <hi>William Kirkcaldie</hi> of <hi>Grange</hi> younger, and with him six persons, and getting entry, held pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with the Porter, If my Lord was walking; who answered, No: (and so it was indeed,<note place="margin">How the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the night before that in the morning he was slain.</note> for he had been busie at his compts with Mistris <hi>Marion Ogilbie</hi> that night, who was espied to depart from him by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Posterne that morning; and therefore quietnesse, after the rules of Physick, and a morning sleep, was requisite (for my Lord.) While the said <hi>William</hi> and the Porter talketh, and his servants made them to look the work and workmen, approached <hi>Norman Lesley</hi> with his company; and because they were in great number, they easily gat entrie. They addresse to the midst of the Court: and immediately came <hi>Iohn Lesley,</hi> somewhat rudely, and four persons with him: The Porter fearing, would have drawne the Bridge; but the said <hi>Iohn</hi> being entred thereon, stayed it, and leapt in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And while the Porter made him for defence, his head wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The shout ariseth; the work-men, to the number of more then a hundred, ran off the walls, and were without hurt put forth at the Wicket Gate. The first thing that ever was done, <hi>William Kirkal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> took the Guard of the privy Posterne, fearing lest the Fox should have escaped. Then go the rest of the Gentlemens Chambers, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence done to any man, they put more then fifty persons to the Gate: The number that enterprised and did this, was but sixteen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The Cardinall wakened with the shouts, asked from his window, What meant that noyse? It was answered, That <hi>Norman Lesley</hi> had taken his Castle: Which understood, he ran to the Posterne; but perceiving the passage to be kept without, he returned quickly to his Chamber, took his two handed sword, and caused his Chamberlain to cast Chests and other impediments to the doore. In this mean time came <hi>Iohn Lesley</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and bids open. The Cardinall asking, Who calls; he answered, My name is <hi>Lesley.</hi> He demanded, Is that <hi>Norman?</hi> The other saith, Nay, my name is <hi>Iohn.</hi> I will have <hi>Norman,</hi> saith the Cardinall, for he is my friend. Content your self with such as are here, for other you shall have none. There were with the said <hi>Iohn, Iames Melvene,</hi> a man familiarly acquainted with Master <hi>George Wischarde,</hi> and <hi>Peter Carmichaelle,</hi> a stout Gentleman. In this mean time, while they force at the door, the



<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61872:79"/>
Cardinall hides a box of gold under coales that were laid in a secret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. At length he asketh, <hi>Will ye save my life?</hi> The said <hi>Iohn</hi> answered, <hi>It may be that we will.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Cardinals demand.</note> 
                     <hi>Nay</hi> (saith the Cardinall) <hi>Swear unto me by Gods wounds, and I will open you.</hi> Then answered the said <hi>Iohn, It that was said, is unsaid</hi>; and so cryed; <hi>Fire, fire,</hi> (for the doore was very strong) and so was brought a chimley full of burning coales, which perceived, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall or his Chamberlain (it is uncertain) opened the doore, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall sat down in a chaire,<note place="margin">The Cardinals confession.</note> and cryed, <hi>I am a Priest, I am a Priest, ye will not slay me.</hi> The said <hi>Iohn Leslie</hi> (according to his former Vows) stroke him first once or twice, and so did the said <hi>Peter.</hi> But <hi>Iames Melvin</hi> (a man of nature most gentle and most modest) perceiving them both in choler, withdrew them, and said, <hi>This work and judgement of God (although it be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) ought to be done with greater gravity.</hi> And presenting unto him the point of the sword,<note place="margin">The fact and words of <hi>Iames Melvin.</hi>
                     </note> said, <hi>Repent thee of thy former wicked life, but especially of the shedding of the blood of that notable instrument of God M.</hi> George Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde, <hi>which albeit the flame of fire consumed before men, yet cries it for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon thee, and we from God are sent to revenge it. For here before my God, I protest, That neither the hatred of thy person, the love of thy riches, nor the fear of any trouble thou couldst have done to me in particular, moved, or moveth me to strike thee; But onely because thou hast been, and remainest an obstinate enemy against Christ Iesus and his holy Gospel.</hi> And so he stroke him twice or thrice thorow with a stog sword: And so he fell, never word heard out of his mouth,<note place="margin">The Cardinals last words.</note> but <hi>I am a Priest, fie, fie, all is gone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While they were thus busied with the Cardinall, the fray rose in the Town, the Provost assembles the Commonalty, and comes to the house side, crying, <hi>What have ye done with my Lord Cardinall? Where is my Lord Cardinall? Have ye slain my Lord Cardinall?</hi> They that were within an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered gentlely; <hi>Best it were for you to return to your own houses, for the man ye call the Cardinall hath received his reward, and in his own person will trouble the world no more.</hi> But then more inragedly they cry, <hi>We shall never depart till that we see him.</hi> And so was he brought to the East block-house head, and shewed dead over the wall, to the faithlesse multitude, which would not beleeve before they saw, and so they departed without <hi>Requiem aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, &amp; requiescat in pace,</hi> sung for his soule. Now because the weather was hot (for it was in May, as ye have heard) and his funerals could not suddenly be prepared, it was thought best to keep him from stinking to give him great salt enough, a cope of lead, and a corner in the bottom of the sea Tower (a place where many of Gods children had been imprisoned before) to await what exequies his brethren the Bishops would prepare for him.<note place="margin">Advertisement to the Reader.</note> These things we write merrily, but we would that the Reader should observe Gods just judgements, and how that he can deprehend the worldly wise in their own wisdom, make their table to be a snare to trap their own feet, and their own purposed strength to be their own destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. These are the works of our God, whereby he would admonish the tyrants of this earth, that in the end he will be revenged of their crueltie, what strength soever they make in the contrary. But such is the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of man (as <hi>David</hi> saith) that the posterity doth ever follow the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of their wicked fathers, and principally in their impiety. For how

little differs the cruelty of that bastard, that yet is called Bishop of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> from the cruelty of the former we will after heare.</p>
                  <p>The death of this aforesaid Tyrant, as it was pleasing to some, to wit, to those who had received the Reformation of Religion, for they were mightily afraid of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also to sundry Romanists whom he kept under as slaves; so on the other side it was dolorous to the Priests, dolorous to the Governour, dolorous to the Queene Dowager: for in him perished faithfulnesse to <hi>France,</hi>

To the Court again repaires the Earle of <hi>Angus,</hi> and his brother Sir <hi>George</hi>; labour is made for the Abbacie of <hi>Arbroth,</hi> and a grant was once made of the same (in memory whereof <hi>George Dowglas,</hi> bastard sonne to the said Earle, is yet called <hi>Postulant.</hi>) But it was more proper (think the <hi>Hamiltons</hi>) for the Governours itching, then for reward to the <hi>Dowglasses</hi>; And yet in hope thereof, the said Earle, and Sir <hi>George</hi> his brother, were the first that voted, that the Castle of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> should be besieged: Divers Gentlemen of <hi>Fyfe</hi> went into the Castle, and abode there with the <hi>Leslies</hi> during the first siege; and <hi>Iohn Rough</hi> was Preacher to them. The Bishop,<note place="margin">The Bishop of S <hi>Andrews</hi> was glad, and yet made himselfe to be angry at the slaughter of the Cardinall.</note> to declare the zeale that he had to revenge the death of him that was his predecessour (and for his riches he would not have had him living againe) still blew the coles. And first he made summons, then he denounced accursed, at last rebels, not onely the first enterprisers, but all such also as after did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them. And last of all a siege was concluded, which began in the end of August (for the 23 day thereof departed the Souldiers from <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>) and continued neer to the end of January. At what time, because they had no other hope of winning of it, but by hunger, and thereof also they despaired, for they within had broken through the East wall, and made a plaine passage by an iron gate to the sea, which greatly relieved the besieged, and abased the besiegers; for then they saw that they could not stop them of victuals, unlesse that they should be masters of the sea, and that they clearly understood they could not be; for the English Ships had once been there, and had brought <hi>William Kirkcaldie</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> and with much difficultie (because the said gate was not then prepared) and some losse of men, had rendered him to the Castle againe; and had taken with them to the Court of <hi>England, Iohn Leslie,</hi> and Master <hi>Henry Balnaves,</hi> for perfecting of all Contracts betwixt them and the King <hi>Henry,</hi> who promised to take them into his protection,<note place="margin">Upon what conditions King <hi>Henry</hi> took the castle of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> into his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> upon condition onely that they should keep the Governours son, my Lord of <hi>Arrane,</hi> and stand friends to the Contract of Marriage, whereof before we have made mention. These things clearly understood (we say) by the Governour and his Counsell, the Priests and the shaven sort; they concluded to make an appointment, to the end, that under Truce, they might either get the Castle betrayed, or else some principall men of the company taken at unawares.<note place="margin">The first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The appointment made, all the godly were glad, for some hope they had that thereby Gods Word should somewhat bud, as indeed so it did: For <hi>Iohn Rough</hi> (who soon after the Cardinals slaughter entred within the Castle and had continued in it during the whole siege) having left the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, because he could do little good upon those that were with him; so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted were they to their evil wayes, began to Preach in the city of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews.</hi> And albeit he was not the most learned, yet was his doctrine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corruption, and therefore well liked of the people.

These words were spoken in the open audience of the Parish Church of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> after the said Dean <hi>Iohn</hi> had spoken what it pleased him, and had refused to dispute.

He briefly treated of the state of the Israelites, who then were in bondage in <hi>Babylon,</hi> for the most part, and made a short discourse of the four Empires, The <hi>Babylonian,</hi> The <hi>Persian,</hi> That of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> And the fourth of the <hi>Romanes</hi>; in the destruction whereof, rose up that last Beast, which he affirmed to be the Romane Church; for to none other power that ever hath yet beene, do all the notes that God hath shewed to the Prophet appertain, except to it alone; And unto it they do so properly appertaine, that such as are not more then blinde, may cleerly see them. But before he began to open the corruptions of <hi>Papistrie,</hi> he defined the true Church, shewed the true notes of it, whereupon it was built, why it was the Pillar of Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and why it could not erre; to wit, <hi>Because it heard the voyce of the onely Pastor,</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>would not heare a stranger, neither would be carried with every winde of Doctrine.</hi> Every one of these heads suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared, he entred to the contrary; and upon the notes given in his Text, he shewed that the Spirit of God in the new Testament gave to this King other new names; to wit, <hi>The man of sin,</hi> The <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> The <hi>Whore of Babilon.</hi> He shewed, That this <hi>man of sin,</hi> or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> was not to be restrained to the person of any one man onely, no more then by the fourth Beast, was to be understood the person of any one <hi>Emperour.</hi> But by such names the Spirit of God would forewarne his chosen of a body and a multitude, having a wicked head, which should not onely be sinfull himself, but also should be occasion of sin, to all that should be subject unto him (as Christ Jesus is the cause of Justice to all the Members of his Body) and is called the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that is to say, One contrary to Christ, because that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him in <hi>Life, Doctrine, Lawes, and Subjects.</hi> And there began to decipher the lives of divers <hi>Popes,</hi> and the lives of all the <hi>Shavelings</hi> for the most part: Their Doctrine and Lawes, he plainly proved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne directly to the Doctrine and Lawes of God the Father, and of

                     <item>4. <hi>The Sacraments of the New Testament, ought to be ministred as they were instituted by Christ Iesus, and practised by his Apostles, nothing ought to be added unto them, nothing ought to be diminished from them.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. <hi>The Masse is abominable Idolatry, blasphemous to the death of Christ, and a prophanation of the Lords Supper.</hi>

                     <item>6. <hi>There is no Purgatory, in the which the soules of men can either be pined or purged after this life. But heaven resteth to the faithfull, and hell to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate and unfaithfull.</hi>

                  <p>The strangenesse (said the Sub-Prior) of these Articles which are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered forth of your Doctrine have moved us to call for you, to hear your own answers. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> said, I for my part praise my God, that I see so honourable, and apparantly so modest and quiet an Auditory: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is long since that I have heard, that ye are one that is not ignorant of the Trueth, I may crave of you in the Name of God, yea, and I appeal your conscience, before that supreme Judge; That if ye think any Article there expressed, contrary unto the Truth of God, That ye oppose your self plainely unto it, and suffer not the people to be therewith deceived. But on the other side, if in your conscience ye know the Doctrine to be true, then will I crave your Patrocinie thereto; That by your authority the people may be moved the rather to beleeve the Truth, whereof many doubts, by reason of your thoughts. The Sub-Prior answered, I came not here as a Judge, but onely familiarly to talke, and therefore I will neither allow nor condemne. But if ye list, I will reason.</p>

                     <p>It is in Faith that the Ceremonies are commanded, and they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per significations to help our Faith, as the hards in Baptisme signifie the roughnesse of the Law, and the oyle the softnesse of Gods mercy; and likewise every one of the Ceremonies hath a godly signification, and therefore they both proceed from Faith, and are done in Faith.</p>

                     <p>It is not enough that man invent a Ceremony, and then give it a signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication according to his pleasure. For so might the Ceremonies of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and this day the Ceremonies of <hi>Mahomet</hi> be maintained. But if that any thing proceed from Faith, it must have the Word of God for its assurance. For ye are not ignorant; <hi>That Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> Now if that ye will prove that your Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies proceed from Faith, and do please God, ye must prove that God in expresse words hath commanded them. Or else shall you never prove that they proceed from Faith, nor yet that they please God; but that they are sinne, and do displease him, according to the words of the Apostle, <hi>Whatsoever is not of Faith is sinne.</hi>

                     <p>Will ye binde us so straight, that we may do nothing without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Word of God.

And first to your drinking, I say, that if ye either eat or drink without assurance of Gods Word, that in so doing ye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please God, and sinne in your very eating and drinking. For saith not the Apostle (speaking even of meat and drink) That <hi>the creatures are sanctified unto men, even by word and prayer.</hi> The word is this, <hi>All things are cleane to the cleane.</hi> Now let me hear this much of your Ceremonies, and I shall give you the Argument, but I wonder that they compare things prophane and holy things so indiscreetly together. The Question was not, nor is not of meat or drink, whereinto the Kingdom of God consisteth not. But the Question is of Gods true worshipping, without the which we can have no societie with God. And here it is doubted, if we may take the same freedom in the using of Christs Sacraments, that we may do in eating and drinking. One meat I may eat, another I may refuse, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out scruple of conscience. I may change one with another, even as oft as I please. Whether may we cast away what we please, and retaine what we please? If I be well remembred, <hi>Moses</hi> in the Name of God saith to the people of Israel; <hi>All that the Lord thy God commandeth thee to do, that do thou to the Lord thy God,</hi> adde nothing to it, diminish nothing from it.

                     <p>I praise my God through Jesus Christ, for I finde his promise sure, true, and stable.

If I had sought the whole Scriptures, I could not have produced a place more proper for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, nor more potent to confound you. Now to your Argument. The Ceremonies of the Church (say ye) are gold, silver, and precious stones, because they are able to abide the fire. But I would learne of you, What fire is it which your Ceremonies do abide? And in the mean time, while ye be advised to answer, I will shew my minde, and make an Argument against yours, upon the same Text.

                     </note> he affirmed, That the Apostles had not received the Holy Ghost when they did write their Epistles, but after they received him, and then they ordained Ceremonies (few would have thought that so learned a man would have given so foolish an answer, &amp; yet it is even as true as he did bear a gray Coull) <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> hearing the answer, start, and said, <hi>If that be true, I have long been in an errour, and I think I shall die therein.</hi> The Sub-Prior said to him, <hi>Father, What say ye?

                  <p>After this the Papists and Friers, had no great heart of further disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reasoning, but invented another shift, which appeared to proceed from godlinesse,<note place="margin">The practises of Papists, that their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse should not be disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> and it was this: Every learned man in the Abbey, and in the Universitie should Preach in the Parish Church his Sunday about. The <hi>Sub-Prior</hi> began, followed the <hi>Officiall,</hi> called <hi>Spittall</hi> (Sermons was penned) to offend no man, followed all the rest in their ranks.

the ships, and so did the ordnance, planted upon <hi>Myde-hill</hi> shoot terribly. But the ordnance of the Gallies shooting amongst the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraied them wonderously. And while that every man laboured to draw from the North, from whence the danger appeared, they begin to faile, and with that were the <hi>English</hi> foot-men marching forward: Albeit that some of their horse-men were upon the flight. The Earle of <hi>Angus</hi> army stood still, looking that either <hi>Huntly</hi> or the Governour should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred the next battell. But they had decreed that the favourers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Hereticks (as the priests called them) and the <hi>Englishmen</hi> should part it betwixt them for that day. The feare riseth, and at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, they which before were victors, and were not yet assaulted with any force (except with ordnance, as is said) cast from them their spears and fled: So that Gods power was so evidently seen, that in one moment, yea at one instant time, both the armies were fleeing. The shout came from the hill, from those that hoped no victory upon the <hi>English</hi> part. The shout rises (we say) <hi>They flee, they flee,</hi> but at the first it could not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, till at the last, it was clearly seene, that all had given back, and still began the cruell slaughter (which was the greater, by reason of the late displeasure of the men of arms) the chase and slaughter lasted till neer <hi>Edinburgh</hi> upon the one part, and toward <hi>Dalketh</hi> upon the other. The number of the slain upon the <hi>Scottish</hi> side, were judged nigh ten thousand men. The Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi> was taken and carried to <hi>London</hi>: But he relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himselfe, being surety for many reasons, Honesty or unhonesty, we know not, but as the bruite was, he used policie with <hi>England.</hi> In that same time was slain the Master of <hi>Erskin,</hi> dearly beloved of the Queene: for whom she made great lamentation, and bare his death many dayes in minde.

Of this, the examples are so frequent, that we spare to name them heere. But to returne to our Historie.</p>
                  <p>This conclusion, That our Queene (without further delay) should be delivered to <hi>France.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The siege of <hi>Hadington.</hi>
                     </note> The siege continued, great shooting, but no assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet they had fair occasion offered unto them. For the <hi>English-men</hi> approaching to the Town, for the comforting of the besieged, with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, victuals,<note place="margin">Tuesdayes chase.</note> and men, lost an Army of six thousand men. Sir <hi>Robert Bowes</hi> was taken, and the most part of the borderers were taken or slain. And so might the Town justly have despaired of any further succour to have been looked for. But yet it held good for the stout courage and prudent government of Sir <hi>Iames Wolford</hi> General, who did so incourage the whole Captains and Souldiers, that they determined to die upon their walls. But from the time that the <hi>French-men</hi> had gotten the <hi>Bone,</hi> for the which the <hi>Dog barked,</hi> the pursuit of the Town was slow. The siege was raised, and the Queen she was conveyed by the west seas to <hi>France,</hi> with 4 Gallies &amp; some Ships. And so the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> got her in his keeping, a morsell I assure you, meet for his own mouth. We omit many things that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in this time, as the sitting down of the Ship, called, The Cardinall (the fairest Ship in <hi>France</hi>) betwixt S. <hi>Colmes Inch</hi> and <hi>Cramond,</hi> without any occasion except negligence, for the day was faire and weather calme. But God would shew,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> that the Countrey of <hi>Scotland</hi> can beare no Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. In this time also was there a Combat betwixt the Gallies and the <hi>English</hi> Ships. They shot frankely a while. An <hi>English</hi> Ship took fire, or else the Gallies had come short home, and as it was, they fled without mercy, till that they were above S. <hi>Colmes Inch.</hi> The Captaines left the Gallies, and took a Fort, made in the <hi>Inch,</hi> for their defence. But the <hi>English</hi> Ships made no pursuit (except that they burnt the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, where she lay) and so the Gallies and the Galley-men did both escape.</p>
                  <p>Order was taken that the next September some Gallies should remain in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the rest should return to <hi>France,</hi> as they did all, except one that was taken by an <hi>English</hi> Ship, (by an <hi>English</hi> Ship, onely we say) as they were passing betwixt <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That winter remained <hi>Monsieur de Arfe</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the bands of <hi>French-men.</hi> They fortified <hi>Enneresk,</hi> to stay the <hi>English</hi> that they should not invade <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Leyth.</hi> Some skirmishes there were betwixt the one and the other, but no notable thing done, except that the <hi>French</hi> had almost taken <hi>Hadington</hi>; The occasion whereof was this:</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French-men</hi> thinking themselves more then masters in all parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> principally, thought they could doe no wrong to no <hi>Scottish-man.</hi> For a certaine <hi>French-man</hi> delivered a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to <hi>George Tod, Scottish-man,</hi> to be stocked, who bringing it thorow the street, another <hi>French-man</hi> claimed it, and would have taken it from the said <hi>George,</hi> but he resisted, alleadging that the



<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61872:88"/>
                     <hi>French-man</hi> did wrong: Thus began parties to assemble, as well to the <hi>Scottish-man</hi> as to the <hi>French,</hi> so that two of the <hi>French-men</hi> were stricken down, and the rest chased from the Crosse to <hi>Nudris-winde-head.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost being in the street, apprehended two of the <hi>French,</hi> and was carrying them to the Tolbuith, but from <hi>Monsieur de Essies</hi> lodging, or close, issued forth <hi>French-men,</hi> to the number of threescore persons, with drawn swords, and resisted the said Provost. Then the Town assembling, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed them, till that they came to the nether <hi>Bow.</hi> And there <hi>Monsieur de la Chapelle,</hi> with the whole bands of <hi>French-men</hi> armed recountred the said Provost,<note place="margin">The slaughter of the Captain of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                     </note> and violently repulsed him (for the Town was without weapons, for the most part) and so made invasion upon all that they met. And first in the entrie of the <hi>Bow</hi> were slain <hi>David Kyrk,</hi> and <hi>David Barber</hi> (being at the Provosts back) and afterward was slain the said Provost himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laird of <hi>Stanehouse,</hi> and Captain of the Castle, <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> his son, <hi>William Chapman,</hi> M. <hi>William Stuart, William Purvesse,</hi> and a woman named <hi>Elizabeth Stuart.</hi> And thereafter tarried within the Town by force, from five of the clock till after seven at night, and then retired to the <hi>Cannon gate,</hi> as to their receptacle and refuge.</p>
                  <p>The whole Town, yea the Governour and Nobility commoved at the unworthinesse of this bold attempt, craved justice upon the malefactours, or else they would take justice of the whole. The Queen craftily enough, <hi>Monsieur de Essie,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur Doseil,</hi> laboured for pacification, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, That unlesse the <hi>French-men</hi> by themselves alone, should do such an act as might recompence the wrong that they had done, that then they should not refuse, but that Justice should be executed to the rigour. <hi>These faire words pleased our fools,</hi> and so were the <hi>French</hi> bands the next night di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>Hadington,</hi> to the which they approched a little after midnight so secretly, that they were never espied till that the foremost were within the outer Court, and the whole Company in the Church-yard, not two paire of Buts length distant from the Town. The Souldiers <hi>English-men</hi> were all asleep except the watch, the which was slender; and yet the shout arises, <hi>Bowes and Bils,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hadington</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most surprised by the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Bowes and Bils</hi>; which is signification of extreme defence, to avoide the present danger in all Towns of war. They affrighted arise, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons that first came to hand serve for the need. One amongst many came to the <hi>East-gate,</hi> where lay two great peeces of Ordnance, and where the enemies were known to be, and cried to his fellows, that were at the gate making defence. <hi>Beware before,</hi> and so fires a great peece, and thereafter another, which God so conducted, that after them was no further pursuit made: for the Bullets redounded from the wall of the <hi>Frier-Church,</hi> to the wall of S. <hi>Katherines</hi> Chappell, which stood directly over it, and from the wall of the said Chappell to the said Church wall again, so oft, that there fell more then an hundred of the <hi>French</hi> at those two shots onely. They shot oft; but the <hi>French</hi> retired with diligence, and returned to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> without harme done, except the destruction of some drinking Beere, which lay in the Sands, Chappell, and Church. And this was satisfaction more then enough, for the slaughter of the foresaid captain, and Provost, and for the slaughter of such as were slain with them. This was the beginning of the <hi>French</hi> fruits.</p>

quoth the Bishop, ye hear this, my Lords. What sayest thou of the Masse, speires the Earle of <hi>Huntly?</hi> He answered, I say, my Lord, as my Lord Jesus Christ saith, <hi>That which is in greatest estimation before men, is abhomination before God.</hi> Then all cried out, <hi>Heresie, Heresie.</hi> And so was the simple servant of God adjudged to the fire, which he patiently sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that same day at after-noon upon the Castle-hill.</p>
                  <p>And so began they again to pollute the land which God had lately plagued, for yet their iniquity was not come to full ripenesse, as that God would that they should be manifested to this whole Realme (as this day they are) to be Fagots prepared for everlasting fire; and to be men whom neither Plagues may correct, nor the light of Gods Word convert from their darknesse and impiety.</p>
                  <p>The Peace as is said, is contracted. The Queen Dowager past by sea to <hi>France,</hi> with Gallies that for that purpose were prepared, and took with her divers of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Earles <hi>Huntley, Glencarne, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell, Cassiles</hi>: The Lords <hi>Maxwell, Fleiming,</hi> Sir <hi>George Dowglas,</hi> together with all the late Kings naturall sons, and divers Barons, and Gentlemen of Ecclesiasticall estate; the Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> and many others, with promise that they should be richly rewarded for their good service. What they received we cannot tell, but few were made rich at their returning. The Dowager had to practise somewhat with her brethren, the Duke of <hi>Gwise,</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine.</hi> The weight whereof the Governour after felt; for shortly after her returne, was the Governour deposed of the government (justly by God, but most unjustly by man) and she made Regent, in the yeer of our Lord 1554. and a Crown put upon her head, as seemly a sight (if men had eyes) as to <hi>put a Saddle upon the backe of an unruly Cow.</hi> And so began she to practise, practise upon practise, How <hi>France</hi> might be advanced, her friends made rich, and she brought to immortall glory: For that was her common talk, <hi>So that I may procure the wealth and honour of my Friends, and a good fame unto my selfe, I regard not what God do after with me.</hi> And in very deed, in deep dissimulation to bring her owne purpose to effect, she passed the common sort of women, as we will after heare. But yet God, to whose Gospel she declared her selfe enemie, in the end frustrated her of all her devices. Thus did light and darknesse strive within the Realme of <hi>Scotland:</hi> The darknesse ever before the World suppressing the light, from the death of that notable servant of God,<note place="margin">The death and vertues of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the sixth.</note> Master <hi>Patricke Hamilton,</hi> untill the death of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, the most godly and most vertuous King that had been known to have reigned in <hi>England,</hi> or elsewhere, these many yeeres by past, who departed the miseries of this life the sixth of July, <hi>Anno</hi> 1553. The death of this Prince was lamented of all the godly within <hi>Europe,</hi> for the graces given unto him of God, as well of nature, as of erudition and godlinesse, passed the measure that accustomably is used to be given to other princes in their greatest perfection, and yet exceeded he not 16 yeers of age. What Gravity, above age? What Wisdom, wherein he passed all understanding or expectation of man? And what Dexterity in answering in all things proposed, were in that excellent Prince. The Ambassadours of all Countries (yea, some that were mortall enemies to him, and to his

Realme, amongst whom the Queen Dowager of <hi>Scotland</hi> was not the least) could and did testifie: For the said Queen Dowager returning from <hi>France</hi> through <hi>England,</hi> communed with him at length, and gave record when she came to this Realme, That she found more wisdome and solide judgement in young King <hi>Edward,</hi> then she would have looked for in any three Princes that were then in <hi>Europe.</hi> His liberality towards the godly and learned that were in other Realms persecuted was such, as <hi>Germans, French-men, Italians, Scots, Spaniards, Polonians, Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Hebrews</hi> born, can yet give sufficient document. For how honourably was <hi>Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr, Iohn Alasco, Emanuel Gualterus,</hi> and many others upon his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like stipends entertained, their parents can witnesse, and they themselves during their lives would never have denied. After the death of this most vertuous Prince; of whom the godlesse people of <hi>England</hi> (for the most part) were not worthy, Satan intended nothing lesse then the light of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ utterly to have been extinguished within the whole Isle of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> For after him was raised up in Gods hot displeasure, that Idolatresse and mischievous <hi>Mary</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> blood, a cruell persecutrix of Gods people, as the acts of her unhappy reigne can sufficiently witnesse. And in <hi>Scotland</hi> that same time (as we have heard) reigned that crafty practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Loraine,</hi> then named Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who bound to the devotion of her two brethren, the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> did onely abide the opportunity to cut the throat of all those, in whom she suspected any knowledge of God to be within the Realme of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And so thought Satan that his kingdome of darknesse was in quietnesse and rest, as well in the one Realme as in the other. But that provident eye of our eternall God, who continually watches for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Church, did so order all things, that Satan shortly after found himselfe farre disappointed of his conclusion taken.

                     </note> were godly men dispersed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers nations; of whom it pleased the goodnesse of God to send some unto us for our comfort and instruction. And first came a simple man, <hi>William Harlaw,</hi> whose erudition, although it excell not, yet for his whole and diligent plainnesse in Doctrine, is he to this day worthy of praise, and remaines a fruitfull member within the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> After him came that notable man <hi>Iohn Willocke,</hi> as one that had some Commission to the Queen Regent, from the Dutchesse of <hi>Emden.</hi> But his principall purpose was to essay what God would worke by him in his native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. These two did sometimes in severall companies assemble the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who by their exhortations began greatly to be encouraged, and did shew that they had an earnest thirst of godlinesse. And last came <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> in the end of the harvest, <hi>Anno</hi> 1555. who first being lodged in the house of that notable man of God <hi>Iames Sime,</hi> began to exhort secretly in that same house, whereunto repaired the Laird of <hi>Dun, David Forresse,</hi> and some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain personages of the Town,<note place="margin">

that she had heard before (for she had heard none except Friers) and did with such greedinesse drinke thereof, that at her death she did expresse the fruit of her hearing, to the great comfort it of all those that repaired unto her. For albeit she suffered most grievous torment in her body, yet out of her mouth was heard nothing, but praising of God, except that sometimes she lamented the troubles of those that were troubled by her. Being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times demanded by her sisters; What she thought of that pain which she then suffered in body, in respect of that wherewith sometimes she was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in spirit. She answered, <hi>A thousand yeere of this torment, and ten times more joyned unto it, is not to be compared in the quarter of an houre that I suffered in my spirit. I thanke my God, through Iesus Christ, that hath delivered me from that fearfull pain, and welcome be this, even so long as it pleaseth his godly Majestie to exercise me therewith.</hi> A little before her departure, she desired her sisters and some others that were beside her, to sing a Psalme, and amongst others she appointed the 103. Psalme, beginning, <hi>My soule praise thou the Lord alwayes,</hi> which ended, she said, <hi>At the Teaching of this Psalme, began my troubled soule, first effectually to taste of the mercy of my God, which now to me is more sweet and precious, then if all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the earth were given to me to possesse them a thousand yeeres.</hi> The Priests urged her with their Ceremonies and Superstitions. To whom she answered, <hi>Depart from me ye Sergeants of Satan: for I have refused, and in your own presence doe refuse all your abominations. That which you call your</hi> Sacrament, <hi>and</hi> Christs body <hi>(as ye have deceived us to beleeve in times past) is nothing but an Idoll, and hath nothing to do with the right Institution of Iesus Christ, and therefore in Gods Name I command you not to trouble me.</hi> They departed, alleadging, That she raved, and wist not what she said. And she shortly after slept in the Lord Jesus, to no small comfort of those that saw her blessed departing. This we could not omit of this worthy woman, who gave so notable a Confession, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the great light of Gods Word did universally shine thorowout this Realme.</p>
                  <p>At the first coming of the said <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> he perceiving divers who had a zeale to godlinesse, make small scruple to go to the Masse, or to communicate with the abused Sacraments in the Papisticall manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan as well in privie Conference as in Preaching, to shew the impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Masse, and how dangerous a thing it was, to communicate in any sort with Idolatrie: wherewith the conscience of some being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, the matter began to be agitate from man to man. And so was the said <hi>Iohn</hi> called to Supper, by the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> for that same purpose, where were assembled <hi>David Forresse,</hi> Master <hi>Robert Lockart, Iohn Willocke,</hi> and <hi>William Maitland</hi> of <hi>Lethington</hi> younger, a man of good Learning, and of sharpe wit and reasoning. The Question was Proposed, and it was answered by the said <hi>Iohn; That in no wise it was lawfull to a Christian to present himselfe to that Idoll.</hi> Nothing was omitted that might serve for the purpose, and yet was every head so fully answered,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> and especially one, whereunto they thought their great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence stood: To wit, That <hi>Paul</hi> at the commandment of <hi>Iames,</hi> and of the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> passed to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and fained himselfe to



<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61872:93"/>
pay his vow with others. This, we say, and other things, were so fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that <hi>William Maitland</hi> concluded, saying, <hi>I see very perfectly that our shifts will serve nothing before God, seeing that they stand us in so small stead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men.</hi> The answer of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> to the fact of <hi>Paul,</hi> and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of <hi>Iames</hi> was;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> That <hi>Pauls</hi> fact had nothing to do with their going to Masse. For to pay Vowes was sometimes Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as was never Idolatry: But their Masse from the originall, was, and remained odious Idolatry; Therefore the fact was most unlike. Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily, said he, I greatly doubt whether either <hi>Iames</hi> his commandment or <hi>Pauls</hi> obedience, proceeded of the holy Ghost: We know their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell tendeth to this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> That <hi>Paul</hi> would shew himselfe one that observed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently the very small points of the Law, to the end he might purchase to himself the favours of the Jews, who were offended at him, by reason of the bruites that were spread, That he taught defection from <hi>Moses.</hi> Now while he obeyed their counsell, he fell into the most desperate danger that ever he sustained before; whereby it was evident, That God approved not that mean of reconciliation; but rather, that he plainely declareth, That evil should not be done, that good might come of it. Evil it was for <hi>Paul</hi> to confirme those obstinate Jewes in their Superstition by his example;<note place="margin">Note dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> worse it was to him to expose himselfe and the Doctrine which before he had taught to slander and mockage. And therefore concluded the said <hi>Iohn,</hi> That the fact of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the sequell that thereof followed, appeared rather to fight against them that would go to the Masse, then to give unto them any assurance to follow his example; unlesse that they would that the like trouble should instantly apprehend them, that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him for obeying worldly-wise councell. After these, and like reasonings,<note place="margin">Masse abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> the Masse began to be abhorred of such as before used it for the fashion and avoiding of slander (as then they termed it) <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> at request of the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> followed him to his place of <hi>Dun,</hi> where he remained a moneth, daily exercised in Preaching, whereunto resorted the principall men of that countrey. After this returning, his residence was most in <hi>Calder,</hi> whither repaired unto him, the Lord <hi>Erskin,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Argyle,</hi> then Lord of <hi>Lorne,</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> then Priour of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and after Earle of <hi>Murrey,</hi> where they heard, and so approved his Doctrine, that they wished it to have been publike. That same Winter he taught commonly in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and after Christmas, by the conduct of the Laird of <hi>Bar,</hi> and <hi>Robert Campbell</hi> of <hi>Kingieancleuch,</hi> he came to <hi>Kyle,</hi> and taught in the <hi>Bar,</hi> in the house of the <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Before <hi>Easter</hi> the Earl of <hi>Glencarne</hi> sent for him to his place of <hi>Fynlaston,</hi> where after Sermon, he also mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred the Lords Table. Whereof besides himself, were partakers, his Lady, two of his sons, and certain of his friends. And so returned he to <hi>Calder,</hi> where divers from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and from the Countrey about, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, as well for the Doctrine, as for the right use of the Lords Table, which before they had never practised. From thence he departed the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> and teaching then in greater liberty, the Gentlemen required, That he should minister likewise unto them the



<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61872:93"/>
Table of the Lord Jesus, where were partakers, the most part of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the <hi>Mernes,</hi> who God be praised, to this day do constantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the same doctrine which then they professed. To wit, That they refused all society with Idolatry, and bent themselves to the uttermost of their powers to maintain the true Preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as God should offer unto them Preachers and opportunitie. The bruite hereof spread (for the Friers from all quarters flocked to the Bishops) the said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was summoned to appear in the Church of the blacke Friers in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the fifteenth day of May, which day the said <hi>Iohn</hi> decreed to keep, and for that purpose <hi>Iohn Erskin</hi> of <hi>Dun,</hi> with divers other Gentlemen assembled to the Town of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> But that Diet held not. For whether the Bishops perceived informalitie in their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, or if they feared danger to ensue upon their extremity, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known unto us. But the Saturday before the day appointed, they cust their own summons, and the said <hi>Iohn,</hi> the same day of the summons taught in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in a greater audience then ever before he had done in that Town. The place was the Bishop of <hi>Dunkelles,</hi> his great lodging, where he continued in Teaching ten dayes, before and after noon. The Earle of <hi>Glencarne</hi> allured the Earle of <hi>Masrchell,</hi> who with <hi>Henry Drummond</hi> (his counseller for that time) heard an exhortation (but it was in the night) who were so well contented with it, that they both willed the said <hi>Iohn</hi> to write unto the Queen Regent somewhat that might move her to hear the Word of God.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> He obeyed their desire, and wrote that which after was published<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we have caused to be Printed at the end of this Book, and is called, <hi>The Letter to the Queen Dowager</hi>; Which was delivered unto her own hands by the said <hi>Alexander</hi> Earle of <hi>Glencarne:</hi> Which Letter when she had read, within a day or two, she delivered it to the proud Prelate <hi>Betone,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and said in mockage; <hi>Please you my Lord to read a Pasquill:</hi> Which words coming to the ears of the said <hi>Iohn,</hi> was the occasion that to his Letter he made his additions, as yet may be seen. As concerning the threatnings pronounced against her own person, and the most principall of her friends; let these very flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers see what had failed of all that he had written.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was thus occupied in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Letters came to him from the English Church that was assembled at <hi>Geneva</hi> (which was sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from that superstitious and contentious company that was at <hi>Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>) commanding him in Gods Name, as he that was their chosen Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour, to repaire unto them for their comfort. Upon the which the said <hi>Iohn</hi> took his leave from us, almost in every congregation where before he had Preached, and exhorted us to Prayers, to Reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and mutuall conference, untill such time as God should give unto us greater libertie. And hereupon he sent before him to <hi>Deep,</hi> his mother in Law <hi>Elizabeth Bowes,</hi> and his wife <hi>Marjory,</hi> with no small dolour of their hearts, and of many of us.

still, but he resolved on his journey, would not at that time stay for no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, adding, That if God blessed those small beginnings, and if that they continued in godlinesse, whensoever they pleased to command him, they should finde him obedient. He said, That once he must needs visit that little flock which the wickednesse of men had compelled him to leave. And so in the moneth of July he left this Realm, and past to <hi>France,</hi> and so to <hi>Geneva.</hi> Immediately after, the Bishops summoned him, and for <hi>non</hi>-appearance burnt him in effigie, at the Crosse of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in the yeer of our Lord 1555. from the which unjust Sentence the said <hi>Iohn</hi> made his appellation,<note place="margin">1555.</note> and caused to Print the same, and direct it to the Nobility and Commons of <hi>Scotland,</hi>

                     <hi>Such is the fidelitie of Princes, guided by Priests, whensoever they seeke their owne affections to be served.</hi> In the end of that next harvest was seen upon the borders of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> a strange fire, which descended from the heaven, and burnt divers cornes in both the Realms, but most in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> There was presented to the Queen Regent, by <hi>Robert Ormestone,</hi> a Calfe,<note place="margin">A calfe with two heads.</note> having two heads, whereat she skipped, and said, <hi>It was but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing.</hi> The Warre began in the end of the harvest, as is said, and conclusion was taken that <hi>Warke</hi> should be assieged. The Army and Ordnance past forward to <hi>Maxwell Hewcht.</hi> The Queen Regent remained in the Castle of <hi>Hume,</hi> and thinking that all things were in assurance, <hi>Monsieur Dosell,</hi> then Lieutenant for <hi>France,</hi> gave charge that the Canons should be transported over the water of <hi>Tweid,</hi> which was done with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition (for the <hi>French</hi> in such facts are expert) but the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> nothing content of such proceedings,<note place="margin">The fact of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at <hi>Maxwel Hewcht</hi>

And therefore commanded the Ordnance to be retired: And so it was without further delay. This put an affray in <hi>Monsieur Dosells</hi> breeches, and kindled such a fire in the Queen Regents stomacke, as was not well slacked till her breath failed. And thus was that enterprise frustrate. But yet Warre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, during the which, the Gospel of Jesus Christ began wonderously to flourish.

zeal and godly courage daily encreased. And albeit he contracted a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous sicknesse, yet he ceased not from labours, but taught and exhorted from his bed some of the Nobility (of whom some are fallen back, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them the Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> is chief) with many Barons and Gentlemen his auditors,<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Seton</hi> an Apostata.</note> and by him were godly instructed, and wonderously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.

And yet consented she to summon the Preachers: whereat the Ptotestants neither offended, neither yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of afraid, determined to keep the day of Summons, as that they did. Which perceived by the Prelats and Priests,<note place="margin">The practice of Prelats, and what thereof ensued.</note> they procured a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be publikely made, That all men that were come to the Towne without commandment of the Authority, should with all diligence repair to the Borders, and there remain fifteen dayes: For the Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> in this manner of rime said to the Queen; <hi>Madame, because they are come without order; I read ye send them to the Border.</hi> Now so had God provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That the quarter of the Westland (in the which was many faithfull men) was that same day returned from the Border; who understanding the matter to proceed from the malice of the Priests, assembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together, and made passage to themselves, till that they came to the very privie chamber, where the Queen Regent and the Bishops were. The Gentlemen began to complain upon their strange intertainment, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her Majesty had found in them so faithfull obedience in all things lawfull. While the Queen began to craft, a zealous and a bold man, <hi>Iames Chalmers</hi> of <hi>Gaithgyrth,</hi> said, <hi>Madame, we know that this is the malice and device of the Iewels,</hi>

could the Bishops in no sort be quiet; for Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> day approaching, they gave charge to the Provost-Ballies, and counsell of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> either to get again the old Saint <hi>Gyle,</hi> or else upon their expences to make a new Image.<note place="margin">The command of the Bishop</note> The Counsell answered, <hi>That to them the charge appeareth very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just; for they understood that God in some places had commanded Idols and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be destroyed:</hi>

Yet would not the Priests and Friers cease to have that great solemnity, and manifest abomination, which they accustomedly had upon Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> day; to wit, They would have that Idoll borne, and therefore was all preparations duely made. A Marmou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set Idoll was borrowed from the gray Friers (a silver piece of <hi>Iames Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michell</hi> was laid in pledge) it was fast fixed with Iron nailes, upon a barrow called there <hi>Fertor.</hi>

Well, about goeth it, and cometh downe the high street, and downe to the common Crosse. The Queen Regent dined that day in <hi>Alexander Carpentar</hi> his house, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Bowes: And so when the Idol returned back again, she left it, and past in to her dinner. The hearts of the brethren were wonderously enflamed; and seeing such abomination so manifestly maintained, were decreed to be revenged. They were divided in severall companies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not one knew of another. There were some temporizers that day (amongst whom <hi>David Forresse,</hi> called the Generall, was one) who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chance to be done, as it fell, laboured to stay the brethren; but that could not be: For immediately after that the Queen was entred in the lodging, some of those that were of the enterprise drew nigh to the Idol, as willing to help to bear him; and getting the <hi>Fertor</hi> upon their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, began to shoulder, thinking that thereby the Idol would have fallen, but that was provided and prevented by the Iron nailes, as we have said.

                     <hi>Down with the Idoll, down with it:</hi> And then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay it was pulled downe. Some brag made the Priests Patrones at the first; but when they saw the feeblenesse of their god (for one tooke him by the heeles, and dading his head to the street, left <hi>Dagon</hi> without a head or hands, and said, <hi>Fie upon thee, thou young Saint</hi> Gyle, <hi>thy father would have tarried for such.</hi>) This considered (we say) the Priests and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fled faster then they did at <hi>Pinckey Clewch.</hi> There might have beene so sudden a fray as seldome hath been amongst that sort of men within this Realme; for down goeth the Crosses, off goeth the Surplices, round Caps, Cornets with the Crowns. The gray Friers gaped, the black Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers blew, the Priests panted and fled, and happy was he that first gat the house; for such a sudden fray came never amongst the generation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist within this Realme before. By chance there lay upon a stayre a merry English-man;<note place="margin">A merry Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-man.</note> and seeing the discomfiture to be without blood,

thought he would adde some merrinesse to the matter: and so cried he over the staire, and said, <hi>Fie upon you whorsons, why have you broken order, down the street they passed in aray, and with great mirth: why flee the villains now without order? turn and strike every man a stroke for the honour of his God; fie cowards fie, ye shall never be judged worthy of your wages againe.</hi> But exhortations were then unprofitable: For after that <hi>Bell</hi> had broken his necke,<note place="margin">

Search was made for the doers, but none could be deprehended: For the brethren assembled themselves in such sort, in companies, singing Psalmes, and praising God, that the proudest of the enemies were astonished.

This same Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> after Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> and the said Bishop were commonly at debate in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and therefore the said Lord, hearing of the Bishops disease, came to visit him: and finding him not so well at a point, as he thought he should have been, and as the honour of the countrey required, said unto him; <hi>Fie, my Lord, how lie you so? will you not go to your Chamber, and not lie heere in this utter Roome.</hi>

                  <p>When the word of the departing of so many Patrons of Papistry, and of the manner of their departing, came unto the Queene Regent, after astonishment and musing,<note place="margin">The Queen Regents sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the death of her Papists.</note> she said; <hi>What shall I say of such men? They left me as beasts, and as beasts they die: God is not with them, neither with that which they enterprise.</hi> While these things were in doing in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> that perfect hypocrite, Master <hi>Iohn Synclare,</hi> then Deane of <hi>Lestarrige,</hi> and now Lord President, and Bishop of <hi>Brechin,</hi> began to Preach in his Church of <hi>Lestarrige,</hi> and at the beginning held himselfe so indifferent,<note place="margin">Dean of <hi>Lestar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rige</hi> hypocrite began to preach.</note> that many had opinion of him, That he was not far from the Kingdom of God. But his hypocrisie could not long be cloaked: for when he understood that such as feared God began to have a good opinion of him, and that the Friers and others of that sect began to whisper, That if he took not heed in time to himself and unto his Doctrine, he would be the destruction of the whole state of the Church. This by him understood, he appointed a Sermon, in the which he promised to give his judgement upon all such heads, as then were in controversie in the matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The bruit hereof made his audience great at the first: But that day he so handled himself, that after that no godly man did credit him: for he not onely gainsaid the Doctrine of Justification and of Prayer, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had taught, but also he set up and maintained Papistry to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most prick, yea, Holy-water, Pilgrimage, Purgatory, and Pardons were of such vertue in his conceit, That without them he looked not to be saved. In this mean time the Clergy made a brag, That they would dispute. But M. <hi>David Panter,</hi>

And therefore if ye love your selves enter never into disputation, neither yet call ye the matter into question, but defend your possession, or else all is lost. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> could not give any better counsell to his companions, but yet God disappointed both them and him, as after we shall heare. At this same time some of the Nobility directed their Letters to call <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> from <hi>Geneva,</hi> for their comfort, and for the comfort of their brethren the Preachers, and others that then couragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fought against the enemies of Gods Trueth.

a faithfull brother, which made mention, that a new consultation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> was appointed for finall conclusion of the matter before purposed; and willed me therefore to abide in these parts till the determination of the same. The other Letter was directed from a Gentleman to a friend, with charge to advertise me, That he had communed with all those that seemed most franke and fervent in the matter; and that in none did he finde such boldnesse and constancy as was requisite for such an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise; but that some did (as he writeth) repent that ever any such thing was moved: Some were partly ashamed, and others were able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ever they did consent to any such purpose, if any tryall or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion should be taken thereof, &amp;c. Which Letters when I had consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I was partly confounded, and partly was pierced with anguish and sorrow. Confounded I was, that I had so far travelled in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, moving the same to the most godly and most learned that this day we know to live in <hi>Europe,</hi> to the effect that I might have their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and grave counsells, for assurance as well of your consciences, as of mine, in all enterprises. And then that nothing should succeed of so long consultation, cannot but redound, either to your shame or mine. For either it shall appeare that I was marvellous vain, being so solicited, where no necessity required; Or else that such as were movers thereto, lacked the ripenesse of judgement in their first Vocation. To some it may appeare, a small and light matter, that I have cast off, and as it were abandoned, as well my particular care, as my publike Office and Charge, leaving my house and poor family destitute of all head, save God only, and committing that small (but to Christ dearly beloved) flock, over the which I was appointed one of the Ministers, to the charge of another. This, I say, to worldly men, may appeare a small matter: But to me, it was and is such, that more worldly substance then I will expresse, could not have caused me willingly to behold the eyes of so many grave men weep at once for my cause, as that I did in taking my last good night from them: To whom if it please God that I returne, and question be demanded, What was the impediment of my purposed journey, judge you what I shall answer. The cause of my dolour and sorrow (God is my witnesse) is for nothing pertaining either to my corporall content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or worldly displeasure; but it is for the grievous plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of God, which assuredly shall apprehend, not onely you, but every inhabitant of that miserable Realm and Isle, except that the power of God, by the liberty of his Gospel, deliver you from Bondage.

Then considering that there are divers Articles of Heresie to be laid to him, that he is dilated of, and that he is presently in my Lords company: That my Lord would by some honest way part with this man, and put him from him, and from his sons company: For I would be right sorry that any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any of their companies should be called for such causes, or that any of them should be bruited to hold any sik man.

                           <hi>Memorandum,</hi> This present Writ is to make answer particularly to every Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, directed from my Lord of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> to me, by Sir <hi>David Hamilton,</hi> which Articles are in number nine; and heere repeated and answered, as I trust, to his Lordships contentment.</head>
                        <p n="1">1.

                           <hi>Answer,</hi> True it is, my Lord, that there is well-long continuance of my house, by Gods providence, and benevolence of our Princes whom we have served,<note place="margin">

And the like obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, towards Gods and our Princes remaineth with us yet, or rather better, (praised be the Lords Name) neither know we any spot towards our Princesse, and her due obedience. And if there be offence towards God, he is mercifull to remit our offences. For he will not the death of a sinner. Like as it standeth in his omnipotent power to make up houses, to

For in exalting, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing, and changing of houses, the laud and praise must be given to that one eternall God, in whose hands the same standeth.</p>

Thirdly, Your Lordship declareth how displeasant it is to you that I should be seduced by an infamed person of the Law, and by the flattery of a forsworn Apostata, that under pretence of his giving forth, maketh us to understand, That he is a Preacher of the Gospel, and therewith rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Schismes and Divisions in the whole Church of God: And by our maintenance and defence would infect this Countrey with Heresie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging that to be Scripture, which these many yeeres past hath been condemned as Heresie by the generall Councells, and whole estate of Christian people.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> The God that created heaven and earth, and all that is therein, preserve me from seducing: for I dread others; many under the colour of godlinesse are seduced, and think that they do God a pleasure, when they persecute one of them that professe his Name. What that man of the Law is, we know not; we hear none of his flattery, his perjured Oath of Apostasie is unknown unto us: But if he have made any unlawfull Oath, contrary to Gods commandment, it were better to violate it, then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it. He Preaches nothing to us but the Gospel, if he would do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, we would not beleeve him, nor yet an Angel of heaven: we heare him sowe no Schismes nor Divisions, but such as may stand with Gods Word, which we shall cause him to confesse, in presence of your Lordship and the Clergy, when ye require us thereto. And as to it that hath been condemned by generall Councels, we trust you know well, that all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels have been at diversity among themselves, and never two of them universally agreeing in all points, in so much as they are of men. But the Spirit of Verity that bears testimony of our Lord Jesus, hath not, neither can erre. For heaven &amp; earth shal perish, ere one jot of it perish. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this, my Lord, neither teacheth he neither will we accept of him, but that which agrees with the Word of God, set forth by the Patriarks, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apostles, and Evangelists, left to our salvation in expresse words. And so my Lord, to condemn the Doctrine not examined, is not required: For when your Lordship pleaseth to hear the confession of that mans Faith, the manner of his Doctrine, which agreeth with the Gospel of



<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61872:100"/>
Jesus Christ, I will cause him to assist to judgement, and shall be present there at Gods pleasure, that he may render reckoning of his belief, and our Doctrine to the superiour Powers, according to the prescription of that blood of the eternall Testament, sealed by the Immaculate Lambe; To whom with the Father and the holy Spirit, be all honour and glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <p n="5">5. The fifth Article puts me in remembrance how woe your Lordship would be, to hear, to see, or know any displeasure that might come to me, my son, or any of my House, and especially in my time and dayes: And as to heare the great and evill brute of me, that should now in my old age in a manner, begin to vary in my Faith, and to be altered therein, when it is time that I should be most sure and firm therein.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> Your Lordships good will is ever made manifest unto me in all your Articles, that you should be sorry to hear, see, or know my displeasure, for the which I am bound to render your Lordship thanks, &amp; shall do the same assuredly. But as for wavering in my Faith, God forbid that I should so do: For I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven &amp; earth; And in Jesus Christ his onely Son our Saviour. My Lord, I vary not in my Faith; but I praise God, that of his goodnesse now in my latter days, hath of his infinite mercy opened his bosome of grace unto me, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him the eternall Wisedome, his Son Jesus Christ, my one sufficient Satisfaction, to refuse all Idolatry, Superstition, and Ignorance, wherewith I have been blinded in times past, and now believe that God will be mercifull unto me; for now he hath declared his blessed Will clearly to me, before my departing out of this transitory life.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The sixth Atticle declareth, That there are delations of sundry points of Heresie upon that man, <hi>Dowglas</hi> or <hi>Grant,</hi> which lies to your charge and conscience to put remedie to; or else that all the pestilentious doctrine he sowes, and all whom he corrupteth with his seed, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at your hands, and all whom he draws from your Christian Faith; and if ye should suffer him, that ye will be accused for all them whom he infecteth with Heresie; and therefore to regard your Lordships honour and conscience therein.</p>

For I would maintain no man in heresie or errour. Your Lordship regards your conscience in the punishment thereof: I pray God that ye do so, and examine well your conscience. He preacheth against Idolatry; I remit to your Lordships conscience, if it be heresie or not. He preacheth against adultery and fornication, I refer that to your Lordships conscience. He preacheth against hypocrisie, I refer that to your Lordships conscience. He preaches against all manner of abuses, and corruption of Christs sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Religion, I refer that to your Lordships conscience. My Lord, I exhort you, in Christs Name, to weigh all these affairs in your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and consider if it be your duty also, not onely to suffer this, but in like manner to do the same. This is all, my Lord, that I vary in my old age, and in no other thing, but that I knew not these offences to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to God, and now knowing his will by manifestation of his Word, abhor them.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The seventh Article desireth me to weigh these matters in most hearty manner, and to take them in best part, for the weale of both our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, my house, friends and servants, and put such a man out of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for fear of the rumour and brute that should follow thereupon, by reason he is delated of sundry heresies: And that your Lordship would be sorry to hear any of your servants delated or bruted for such a cause, or for holding of any such men; and that your Lordship would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand mine answer hereunto, or any summons passed thereupon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> I thank your Lordship greatly, that ye are so solicited for the weale of me and of my house, and are so humane, as to give me adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement, before ye have summoned, of your owne good will and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. I have weighed these matters, as highly as my judgement can serve me, both for your Lordships honour and mine.

Your Lordship knows well the man, he hath spoken with your Lordship: I thought you content with him, I heare no occasion of offence in him, I cannot well want him, or some Preacher. I cannot put away such a man, without I knew him an offender, as I know not; for I heare nothing of him, but such as your Lordships self heares of him, and such as he yet will professe in your presence, whensoever your Lordship requires. Such a man that is ready to present himself to judgement, should not be expelled without knowledge of the cause; for like as I answered before in another Article, when your Lordship pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that all the Spirituall and Temporall men of estate in <hi>Scotland</hi> be assembled, I shall cause him to render an account of his belief and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in your presences, then if he deserves punishment and correction, let him so suffer; if he be found faithfull, let him live in his faith.</p>

                           <pb n="117" facs="tcp:61872:101"/>8. The eight Article proposes to me, That your Lordship would take the labour to get me a man to instruct me in your Catholike Faith, and to be my Preacher, for whose Doctrine ye would lay your soul, that he would teach nothing, but truely conform to your faith.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> God Almighty send us many of that sort, that will preach truely, and nothing but a Catholike or Universall Christian Faith; and we High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land rude people have misse of them. And if your Lordship would get and provide me such a man, I should provide him a corporall Living, as to my self, with great thanks unto your Lordship: For truely, I and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more have great misse of such men. And because I am able to sustain more then one of them, I request your Lordship earnestly, to provide me a man as ye wrote; <hi>for the harvest is great, but the labourers are few.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. The last and ninth Article putteth me in remembrance to consider what murmure your Lordship suffers, and great brute, at many mens hands, both Spirituall and Temporall, and at the Queens hand, and other well given people, for not putting order to these affairs; and that your Lordship hath abstained from execution hereof, for love of my House and Posterity, to the effect that my self should remedy it, for fear of the dishonour that might come upon us both for the same: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remedied, might bring us out of all danger.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> My Lord, I know well what murmure and indignation your Lordship suffers at enemies hands of all estates, for not pursuing of poor simple Christians: And I know, That if your Lordship should use their counsell, who would by blood-shedding and burning of poor men, to make your Lordship serve their wicked appetites; Yet your Lordship knows your owne duty, and should not fear the danger of men, as of him whom ye professe. And verily, my Lord, there is nothing that may be to your Lordships relief in this behalf, but I will use your Lordships counsell therein, and further the same, Gods honour being first provided, and the Truth of his eternall Word having liberty. And to abstain for my love from pursuit, as your Lordship hath signified, I am indebted to your Lordship, as I have written divers times before. But there is one above, for whose fear ye must abstain from blood-shedding, or else, my Lord, knock in your conscience. Last of all, your Lordship please to consider how desirous some are to have sedition amongst friends; how mighty the devill is to sow discord; how that many would desire no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter game, but to hunt us at other. I pray your Lordship beguile them, we will agree upon all purposes with Gods pleasure, standing to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. There are divers Houses in <hi>Scotland</hi> neer us, that professe the same God secretly; they desire but that ye begin the bargaine at us; and when it begins at us, God knows the end therof, and who shall bide the next put. My Lord, consider this; make no Preparative of us: Let not the vain exhortation of them that regard little of the weale and strength of both our Houses, stirre up your Lordship as they would, to do against God, your owne conscience, and the weale of your posterity for ever. And therefore now in the end I pray your Lordship weigh these things wisely; and if ye do otherwise, God is God, was, and shall be God, when all is wrought that man can work.</p>

Shortly after that, God called to his mercy the said Earle of <hi>Argyle</hi> from the miseries of this life; whereof the Bishops were glad; for they thought that their great enemy was taken out of the way, but God disappointed them: For as the said Earle departed most constant in the true Faith of Jesus Christ, with a plain renounciation of all Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Superstition, and Idolatry; so he left it to his Son in his Testament, That he should studie to set forward the publike and true preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Note the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> his Testament.</note> and to suppresse all Superstition and Idolatry to the uttermost of his power.

And as ye have by your false doctrine and wresting of Gods Word, learned of your father Sathan, induced the whole people, high and low, into a sure hope and belief, That to clothe, feed, and nourish you, is the onely most acceptable Alms allowed before God; and to give a penny, or a piece a bread once in a week is enough for us.

                     <p>These things being resolved, and sufficiently proved by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Scriptures of God, we began every man to look more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to his Salvation: For the Idolatry and Tyranny of the Clergy (called the Church-men) was and is so manifest, that whosoever doth deny it, declareth himself ignorant of God, and enemy to Christ Jesus. We therefore, with humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our former offences, with Fasting, and Supplication unto God, began to seek some remedy in so present a danger.

And first it was concluded, <hi>That the Brethren in every Towne at certaine times should assemble together, to Common Prayers, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, in reading of the Scriptures, till it should please God to give the gift of Exhortation by Sermon unto some, for the Comfort and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the rest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this our weake beginning God did so blesse, that within a few Moneths the hearts of many were so strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that we sought to have the face of a Church amongst us, and open crimes to be punished without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: And for that purpose by common Election, were Elders appointed, to whom the whole Brethren promised Obedience: For at that time we had no publike Ministers of the Word; onely did certaine zealous men (amongst whom was the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">This was called the privie Church.</note>

                                    <head>Here beginneth the particular Demands.</head>
                                    <p>FIrst, Humbly we ask, That as we have by the Lawes of this Realme, after long debate obtained to reade the holy Books of the Old and New Testament, in our Vulgar Tongue, as Spirituall food to our soules: so from henceforth it may be lawfull, that we may meet publikely or privately to our Common-Prayers in our Vulgar Tongue, to the end that we may increase and grow in knowledge, and be induced by fervent and oft Prayer, to commend to God the holy Universall Church, the Queene our Soveraigne, her honourable and gracious Husband, the abilitie of their succession, your Majestie Regent, the Nobilitie, and whole State of this Realme.</p>
                                    <p>Secondly, If it shall happen in our said meetings any hard place of Scripture to be read, of which, without explanation, hardly can arise any profit to the hearers, that it shall be lawfull to any qualified persons in knowledge, being present, to interpret and open up the said hard places, to Gods glory, and to the profit of the Auditory. And if any thinke that this libertie should be occasion of Confusion, Debate, or Heresie, we are content that it be provided that the said Interpretation shall underly the judgement of the godly, and most learned within the Realme at this time.</p>
                                    <p>Thirdly, That the holy Sacrament of Baptisme may be used in the Vulgar Tongue, that the God-fathers and Witnesses may not onely understand the points of the League and Contract made betwixt God and the Infant, but also that the Church then assembled, more gravely may be informed and instructed of their



<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61872:107"/>
duties, which at all times they owe to God, according to that promise made unto him, when they were received into his houshold by the lavacre of spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
                                    <p>Fourthly, We desire that the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper, or of his blessed Body and Blood may likewise be ministred unto us in the Vulgar Tongue, and in both kindes, according to the plaine Institution of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ Iesus.</p>
                                    <p>And lastly, We most humbly require, That the wicked, slanderous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable life of Prelats, and of the state Ecclesiasticall, may be reformed, that the people by them have not occasion (as of many dayes they have had) to contemne their Ministerie, and the Preaching, whereof they should be Messengers. And if they suspect that we rather envying their honours, or coveting their riches and possessions, then Zealously desiring their amendment and salvation, do travell and labour for this Reformation:<note place="margin">
                                          <hi>The offer.</hi>
                                       </note> We are content, that not onely the Rules and Precepts of the New Testament, but also the Writings of the ancient Fathers, and the godly and approved Lawes of <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperour, decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie betwixt us and them. And if it shall be found, that either malevolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ignorantly we aske more then these three forenamed have required, and continually do require of able and true Ministers in Christs Church, we refuse not correction, as your Majestie with right judgement shall think meet. But if all the forenamed shall condemne that which we condemne, and approve that which we require; Then we most earnestly beseech your Majestie, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the long custome which they have had to live at their lust, that they be compelled either to desist from Ecclesiasticall administration, or to discharge their duties, as becometh true Ministers. So that the grave and godly face of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church reduced; Ignorance may be expelled; True Doctrine and good Manners may once againe appeare in the Church in this Realme. These things we, as most obedient Subjects, require of your Majestie, in the Name of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, and of his Son Christ Iesus, in presence of whose Throne judiciall, ye, and all other that heere in earth beareth authority shall give account of your temporall regiment. The spirit of the Lord Iesus move your Majesties heart to Iustice and Equity.</p>

                     <p>These our Demands being proposed, the State Ecclesiasticall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to storme,<note place="margin">The practise of Satan.</note> and to devise all manner of lies to deface the equitie of our cause. They bragged as that they would have publike Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which also we most earnestly required,<note place="margin">Disputation with condition</note> two things being provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; First, That the plaine and written Scriptures of God should decide all Controversies: Secondly, That our brethren, of whom some were then exiled, and by them unjustly condemned, might have free accesse to the said Disputation, and safe-conduct to return to their dwelling places, notwithstanding any Processe which before had been laid against them in matters concerning Religion. But these being by them utterly denied (for no Judge would they admit, but themselves, their Counsels, and Canon Law) They and their faction began to draw certain Articles of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">The offer of the Papists.</note> promising unto us, If we would admit the Masse to stand in its former reverence and estimation; Grant Purgatory after this life; Confesse prayer to Saints, and for the dead, and suffer them to enjoy their accustomed Rents, Possession, and Honour: That then they would grant us to pray,



<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61872:108"/>
and baptize in the Vulgar Tongue, so that it were done secretly, and not in the open assembly. But the grosenesse of these Articles was such, that with one voice we refused them, and constantly craved justice of the Queene Regent, and a reasonable answer of our former Petitions. The Queene then Regent, a woman crafty, dissimulate, and false-thinking, to make her profit of both parties,<note place="margin">The grant of the Queene Regent.</note> gave to us permission to use our selves god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to our desires provided, that we should not make publike as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> nor <hi>Lieth,</hi> and did promise her assistance to our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, untill some uniform order might be established by a Parliament. To them (we mean the Clergie) she quietly gave signification of her minde, promising that how soon any opportunity should serve, she should so put order to these matters, that after they should not be troubled: for some say, they gave her a large purse 40000. l. <hi>Turn.</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> gathered by the Laird of <hi>Earleshale.</hi> We nothing suspecting her doublenesse nor falshood, departed fully contented with her answer, and did use our selves so quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that for her pleasure we put silence to <hi>Iohn Dowglas,</hi> who publikely would have preached in the Town of <hi>Lieth</hi>; for in all things we sought the contentment of her minde, so far as God should not be offended against us, for obeying her in things as we thought unlawfull.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after these things, that cruell Tyrant and unmercifull hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, falsly called, Bishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> apprehended that blessed Martyr of Christ Jesus, <hi>Walter Mill,</hi>

                        </note> a man of decrepite age, whom most cruelly and most unjustly he put to death by fire in Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> the twenty eighth day of April, in the yeere of God 1558. Which thing did so highly offend the hearts of all godly,<note place="margin">1558.</note> that immediatly after his death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a new fervencie among the whole people, yea, even in the Towne of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> began the people plainely to condemne such unjust cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And in testification that they would his death should abide in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent memory, there was cast together a great heap of stones in the place where he was burnt. The Bishop and Priests thereat offended, caused once or twice to remove the same,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Note.</hi>
                        </note> with denunciation of cursing, if any man should there lay any stones. But in vaine was that winde blowne, for still was the heape made, till that the Priests and Papists did steale away by night the stones to build their walls, and to other their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uses.</p>
                     <p>We suspecting nothing that the Queene Regent was consenting to the forenamed murther, most humbly did complain of such unjust crueltie, requiring that justice in such cases should be ministred with greater indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie. She as a woman born to dissemble,<note place="margin">The hypocrisie of the Queene Regent.</note> and deceive, began with us to lament the cruelty of the Bishop, excusing her selfe as innocent in that cause, for that the sentence was given without her knowledge. Because the man sometimes had been a Priest; therefore the Bishops Officiall did proceed upon him without any commission of the Civill authority, <hi>ex officio,</hi> as they terme it. We yet nothing suspecting her falshood, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some order to be taken against such enormities, which she promised as oft before. But because shortly after there was a Parliament to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, for certain affaires, pertaining rather to the Queens profit particular, then to the commodity of the Common-wealth, we thought good to



<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61872:108"/>
expose our matter unto the whole Parliament, and by them to seek some redresse: we therefore with one consent did offer to the Queen and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament a Letter, in this Tenor:

                              <head>The Forme of the Letter given in Parliament.</head>
                              <p>UNto your Majesty, and unto your Right honorable Lords, Barons, and Burgesses of this present Parl. Humbly means, and sheweth your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties faithfull and obedient subjects, That where we are daily molested, slandered, and injured by wicked and ignorant persons, place-holders of the Ministers of the Church, who most untruely cease not to infame us, as hereticks, &amp; under that name they most cruelly have persecuted divers of our brethren; and farther intend to execute their malice against us, unlesse by some godly order their fury and rage be bridled and stayed. And yet in us they are able to prove no crime worthy of punishment, unlesse that to reade the holy Scriptures in our Assemblies, to invocate the Name of God in publike Prayers, with all sobriety to interpret and open the places of Scripture that be read to the further edification of the brethren assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and truely, according to Christ Jesus his holy Institution, to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Sacraments, be crimes worthy of punishment: other crimes (we say) in us they are not able to convince. And to the premises we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, for that the said Place-holders discharge no part of their duties rightly to us, neither yet to the people subject to us; and therefore, unlesse we should declare our selves altogether unmindfull of our own salvation, we are compelled in very conscience to seek how that we and our brethren may be delivered from the thraldom of Sathan: For now it hath pleased God to open our eyes, and manifestly we see, That without extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of our souls, we may in no wayes communicate with the damnable Idolatry, and intolerable abuses of the Papisticall Church. And therefore most humbly require we of your Majesty, and of your Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lords, Barons, and Burgesses assembled in this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prudently to weigh, and as it becometh just Judges, to grant these our most just and reasonable Petitions:</p>

                                 <hi>Seeing that the controversie in Religion which hath long continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Protestants of Almany, Helvetia, and other Provinces; and the papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Church is not yet decided by a lawfull and generall Counsell: And seeing that our consciences are likewise touched with the fear of God, as was theirs in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their controversie, we most humbly desire, That all such Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as in the time of darknesse gave power to the Church-men to execute their tyrannie against us, by reason that we to them were delated as hereticks, may be suspended and abrogated, till a Generall Councell lawfully assembled, have deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all controversies in Religion. And lest that this mutation should seem to set all men at liberty to live as they list, we secondarily require that it be Enacted by this present Parliament, That the Prelats and their Officers be removed from place of Iudgement, onely granting unto them neverthelesse the place of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sators in the presence of a Temporall Iudge; before whom the Church men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusators shall be bounden to call any by them accused of heresie: To whom also they shall be bounden to deliver an authenticke Copy of all Depositions, Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and Processe laid against any person accused.

                                 <hi>Last, We require that our brethren be not condemned for heretickes, unlesse by the manifest Word of God they be convinced to have erred from that faith which the holy Spirit witnesseth to be necesiary to Salvation: And if so they be, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse not but that they be punished according to justice; Unlesse by wholesome admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they can be reduced to a better minde.</hi>
                              </p>

                                 <hi>These things require we to be considered of by you, who are in the Place of the Eternall God (who is God of Order and Truth) even in such sort, as ye will answer in presence of his Throne judiciall: Requiring further, That favourably you would have respect to the tendernesse of our consciences, and to the trouble which appeareth to follow in this Common-wealth, if the tyranny of the Prelates, and of their adherents be not bridled by God and just Lawes. God move your hearts deeply to consider your owne duties, and our present troubles.</hi>

                     <p>These our Demands did we first present to the Queen Regent, because that we were determined to enterprise nothing without her knowledge, most humbly requiring her favourably to assist us in our just action. She spared not amiable looks, and good words in abundance. But alwayes she kept our Petition close in her pocket. When we required secretly of her Majesty that our Petition should be proposed to the whole Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: She answered, That she thought not that expedient; for then would the whole Ecclesiasticall Estate be contrary to her proceedings, which at that time was great: For the Matrimoniall Crowne was asked, and in that Parliament granted. But, said she, how soon order can be taken with these things, which now may be hindred by the Church-men, ye shall know my good minde. And in the meane time whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I can grant unto you, shall gladly be granted. We yet nothing sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting her falshood, were content to give place for a time to her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and pretended reason. And yet thought we expedient somewhat to protest, before the dissolution of the Parliament: For our Petition was manifestly knowne to the whole Assembly; as also how that for the Queens pleasure we had ceased to pursue the uttermost. Our Protestation was formed in manner following.</p>

                           <p>IT is not unknowne to this Honourable Parliament, what controversie is now lately risen betwixt those that will be called the Prelats and



<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61872:109"/>
Rulers of the Church, and a great number of us the Nobility and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty of the Realme, for the true worshipping of God, for the duty of Ministers, for the right Administration of Christ Jesus holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How that we have complained by our supplication to the Queen Regent, That our consciences are burthened with unprofitable Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; And that we are compelled to adhere to Idolary: That such as take upon them the Office Ecclesiasticall, discharge no part thereof as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh true Ministers to do; and finally, That we and our brethren are most injuriously oppressed by their usurped authority. And also we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is a thing sufficiently known, That we were of minde at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Parliament to seek redresse of such enormities: but considering that the troubles of the time do not suffer such Reformation as we by Gods plain Word do require, we are enforced to delay that which most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly we desire: And yet lest that our silence should give occasion to our adversaries to thinke that we repent of our former enterprisers, we cannot cease to protest, for remedy against that most unjust tyranny which we heretofore have most patiently sustained.</p>
                           <p>And first we protest, <hi>That seeing we cannot obtain a just Reformation according to Gods Word, that it be lawfull to us to use our selves in matters of Religion and conscience, as we must answer unto God, unto such time as our adversaries be able to prove themselves the true Ministers of Christs Church, and to purge themselves of such crimes as we have already laid to their charge, offering our selves to prove the same whensoever the sacred Authority please to give us audience.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly we protest, <hi>That neither we, nor yet any other of the godly that list to joyn with us in the true Faith which is grounded upon the invincible Word of God, shall incur any danger of life or lands, or any politicall pain, for not observing such Acts as heretofore have passed in favour of our adversaries, neither yet for viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of such Rites as man without Gods Commandment or Word hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We thirdly protest, <hi>That if any tumult or uprore shall arise amongst the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Realme for the diversity of Religion;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists observe.</note> 
                              <hi>and if it shall chance that abuses be violently reformed, that the crime thereof be not imputed to us, who most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do now seek all to be reformed by an Order. But rather whatsoever inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shall happen to follow for lack of Order taken,</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>And last we protest, <hi>That these our requests, proceeding from conscience, do tend to none other end, but to the reformation of the abuses in Religion onely: Most humbly beseeching the sacred Authority to take us faithfull and obedient subjects into protection against our adversaries, and to shew unto us such indifferency in our most just Petition, as it becometh Gods Lieutenants to do to those that in his Name do call for defence, against cruell oppressors,</hi> and blood-thirsty Tyrants.</p>

                     <p>This our Protestation publikely read, we desired it to have been inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the common Register, but that, by the labor of enemies, was denied unto us. Neverthelesse the Queen Regent said, <hi>Me will remember what it protested, and me shall put good order after this to all things that now be in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</hi> And thus after she by craft had obtained her purpose, we departed ed, in good hope of her favour, praising God inour hearts, that she was



<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61872:110"/>
so well inclined towards godlinesse. The good opinion that we had of her sincerity, caused us not onely to spend our goods, and hazard our bodies at her pleasure, but also by our publike Letters written to that excellent servant of God <hi>Iohn Calvine</hi> we did praise and commend her, for her excellent knowledge in Gods Word,<note place="margin">Letters to <hi>Iohn Calvine.</hi>
                        </note> and good will towards the advancement of his glory; requiring of him, That by his grave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and godly exhortation, he would animate her Majestie constantly to follow that, which godlily she had begun. We did farther sharply rebuke both by word and writing, all such as appeared to suspect in her any venom or hypocrisie, or that were contrary to that opinion which we had conceived of her godly minde. But how far we were deceived in our opinion, and abused by her craft, did suddenly appear: For how soon that all things pertaining to the commodity of <hi>France</hi> were granted by us, and that Peace was contracted betwixt King <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> and us, she began to spue forth, and disclose the latent venom of her double heart. Then began she to frowne, and to look forwardly to all such as she knew did favour the Gospel of Jesus Christ. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her houshold to use all abominations at <hi>Easter</hi>; and she first her self, to give example to others, did communicate to the Idol in open audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; she controlled her houshold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would know where that every one received ther Sacrament. And it appeared, That after that day that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice took more violent and strong possession in her, then it did before; for from that day forward she appeared altogether altered, insomuch that her countenance and facts did declare the venom of her heart: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent she caused our Preachers to be summoned; for whom when we made intercession, beseeching her Majesty not to molest them in their Ministry, unlesse any man were able to convince them of false Doctrine, she could not bridle her tongue from open blasphemy, but proudly she said,<note place="margin">Blasphemy.</note> 
                        <hi>In despight of you and your Ministers both, they shall be banished out of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, albeit they preached as true as ever did Saint</hi> Paul.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Note.</hi>
                        </note> Which proud and blaspemous answer,<note place="margin">She had gotten her lesson from the Cardinall. Forefather to the now Earle of <hi>Lowdone,</hi> Chancellor. Queen Regents answer.</note> did greatly astonish us: and yet ceased we not most humbly to seek her favour; and by great diligence, at last we obtained that the Summons at that time were delayed: For to her were sent <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Glenclarne,</hi> and Sir <hi>Hues Campbell</hi> of <hi>Lowdone</hi> Knight, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of <hi>Air,</hi> to reason with her, and to crave some performance of her manifold promises; to whom she answered, <hi>It becomes not subjects to burthen their Princes with promises, further then it pleased them to keep the same.</hi> Both the Noble men faithfully and boldly discharged their duty, and plainly forewarned her of the inconveniences that were to follow: wherewith she somewhat astonied, said she would advise.</p>
                     <p>In this mean time did the Town of <hi>Perth,</hi> called Saint <hi>Iohnston,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Truth,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Iohnston</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Gospel.</note> which did provoke her to a new fury; in which she wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lord <hi>Ruthuein</hi> Provest of that Towne, so suppresse all such Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion there.<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Ruthuens</hi> answer.</note> To the which when he answered, That he could make their bodies to come to her Majesty, &amp; to prostrate themselves before her, till that she was fully satiate with her blood: but to cause them to do against their conscience, he could not promise. She in fury did answer, That



<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61872:110"/>
he was too mallapart, to give her such answer, affirming that both he and they should repent it. She solicited M. <hi>Iames Haliburntoun</hi> Provest of <hi>Dundie,</hi> to apprehend <hi>Paul Methuen,</hi> who fearing God, gave secret adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement to the man to avoid the Town for a time. She sent forth such as she thought most able to perswade at <hi>Easter,</hi> to cause <hi>Montrosse, Dundie,</hi> S. <hi>Iohnston,</hi> and other such places as had received the Gospel, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Idoll of the Masse, but they could profit nothing, the hearts of many were bent to follow the Trueth revealed, and did abhorre Superstition and Idolatry. Whereat she more highly commoved, did Summon again all the Preachers to appear at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the tenth day of May, in the yeere of our Lord 1559.<note place="margin">1559</note> Which understood by us, we with all humble obedience sought the means how she might be appeased, and our Preachers not molested: but when we could prevaile nothing, it was concluded by the whole brethren,<note place="margin">The first assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at S. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston.</hi>
                        </note> That the Gentlemen of every Countrey should accompany their Preachers, to the day and place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; Whereto all men were most willing. And for that purpose, the Town of <hi>Dundie,</hi> the Gentlemen of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Mernes,</hi> passed forward with their Preachers to S. <hi>Iohnston,</hi> without Armour, as peaceable men, minding onely to give confession with their Preachers. And lest that such a multitude should have given feare to the Queene Regent, the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> a zealous, prudent, and godly man, passed before to the Queene, then being at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> to declare to her, That the cause of their Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was onely to give confession with their Preachers, and to assist them in their just defence.<note place="margin">The Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> stayed the congregation, and the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> She understanding the fervencie of the people, began to use craft with him, soliciting him to stay the multitude, and the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers also, with promise that she would take some better order. He a man most gentle of nature, and most addict to please her in all things not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to God,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Note.</hi>
                        </note> wrote to those that then were assembled at S. <hi>Iohnston,</hi> to stay, and not to come forward, shewing what promise and hope he had of the Queens favour. At the reading of his Letters, some did smell the craft and deceit, and perswaded to passe forward, untill that a discharge of the former Summons should be had, alleadging that otherwise their Processe of Rebellion should be executed against the Preachers: And so should not onely they, but also all such as did accompany them, be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a like crime. Others did reason, That the Queens promise was not to be suspected, neither yet the Laird of <hi>Duns</hi> request to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and so did the whole multitude with their Preachers stay.</p>
                     <p>In this mean time that the Preachers were summoned, to wit, the second of May 1559. arrived <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> from <hi>France,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1559</note> who lodging two nights onely in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> hearing the day appointed to his brethren, repaired to <hi>Dundie,</hi> where he earnestly required them, That he might be permitted to assist his brethren, and to give confession of his Faith with them, which granted unto him, he departed unto S. <hi>Iohnston</hi> with them, where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to exhort, according to the grace of God granted unto him. The Queen perceiving that the Preachers did not appear, began to utter her malice; and notwithstanding any request made to the contrary, gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to put them to the <hi>Horne</hi>; inhibiting all men, under pain of high Rebellion, to assist, comfort, receive, or maintain them in any sort:

which extremity perceived by the said Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> he prudently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himselfe (for otherwise by all appearance he had not escaped impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment.) For the Master of <hi>Maxwell,</hi> a man zealous and stout in Gods Cause (as then appeared) under the cloke of another small crime, was that same day committed to ward, because he did boldly affirme, That to the uttermost of his power,<note place="margin">

The Laird of <hi>Dun</hi> coming to S. <hi>Iohnston,</hi> exposed the case even as it was, and did conceal nothing of the Queens craft and falshood: Which understood, the multitude was so inflamed, that neither could the exhortation of the Preachers, nor the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Magistrate, stay them from destroying the places of Idolatry. The manner whereof was: The Preachers had declared before how odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Idolatry was in Gods presence: What commandment he had given for the destruction of the monuments thereof:<note place="margin">The taking down of the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> What Idolatry, and what abomination was in the Masse. It chanced that the next day, which was the eleventh of May, after that the Preachers were exiled, that after the Sermon, which was very vehement against Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, a certaine Priest in contempt would go to the Masse; and to declare his malapart presumption, he would open up a glorious Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which stood upon the high Altar: There stood beside, certain god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and amongst others, a young boy, who cryed with a bold voice, <hi>This is intolerable,</hi>

                        <hi>that when God by his Word hath plainely condemned Idolatry, we shall stand and see it used in despight.</hi> The Priest hereat offended, gave the childe a great blow; who in anger took up a stone, and casting at the Priest, hit the Tabernacle, and brake down an Image: And immediatly, the whole multitude threw stones, and put hands on the said Tabernacle, and on all other Monuments of Idolatry; Which they dispatched before the tenth man in the Town were advertised (for the most part were gone to diner) which noised abroad, the whole multitude assembled, not of the Gentlemen, neither of them that were earnest Professours, but of the ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call multitude, who finding nothing to do in that Church, did run with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deliberation to the <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> and notwithstanding that they had within them very strong guards kept for their defence, yet were their gates incontinent burst up. The first invasion was upon Idolatry, and thereafter the common people began to seek some spoile. And in very deed the <hi>Gray-Friers</hi> was a place so well provided, that unlesse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men had seen the same, we would have feared to have reported what provision they had,<note place="margin">The <hi>Gray Friers</hi> their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> their sheets, blankets, beds, and coverlets were such, that no Earle in <hi>Scotland</hi> had better: Their naperie was fine, they were but 8 persons in the Convent, and yet had they 8 puncheons of salt Beef (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the time of the yeere, the eleventh of May) wine, beere, and ale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side store of victuals belonging thereto. The like abundance was not in the Black-Friers, and yet there was more then became men professing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. The spoile was permitted to the poore: For so had the Preachers before threatned all men, That for covetousnesse sake, none should put their hand to such a Reformation, that no honest man was inriched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the value of a groat. Their conscience so moved them, that they

suffered those hypocrites to take away what they could, of that which was in their places. The Prior of the <hi>Charter-house</hi> was permitted to take with him even as much gold and silver as he was able to carry.<note place="margin">

                        </note> but onely to abolish Idolatry, the places and Monuments thereof, in which they were so busie, and so laborious, that within two dayes these three great places, Monuments of Idolatry, to wit, the Black and Gray Theeves, and <hi>Charter-house</hi> Monks (a building of wonderous cost and greatnesse) was so destroyed, that the walls onely did remain of all those great edifices. Which reported to the Queen, she was so inraged,<note place="margin">A godly vow.</note> That she did vow utterly to destroy S. <hi>Iohnston,</hi> man, woman, and childe, and to consume the same by fire, and thereafter to salt it, in signe of a perpetuall desolation. We suspecting nothing such cruelty, but thinking that such words might escape her in choler without purpose determined, because she was a woman, set on fire by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of those hypocrites, who flocked unto her as Ravens to a carion. We (we say) suspecting nothing such beastly cruelty, returned to our own houses: leaving in S. <hi>Iohnston, Iohn Knox</hi> to instruct the people, because they were yong and rude in Christ. But she, set on fire partly by her own malice, partly by commandment of her friends in <hi>France,</hi> and not a little by bribes, which she and <hi>Monsieur Dosell</hi> received from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and the Priests here at home, did continue still in her rage. And first she sent for all the Nobility,<note place="margin">The complaint of the Queene Regent.</note> to whom she complained, That we meaned nothing but Rebellion: She did grievously lament the destruction of the <hi>Charter-house,</hi> because it was a Kings foundation, and there was the tombe of King <hi>Iames</hi> the first, and by such other perswasions she made the most part of them grant to pursue us. And then incontinent sent she for her French men: For that was, and ever hath been her joy, to see Scottish men dip one with anothers blood. No man was at that time more franke against us then was Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> led by that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell beast the Bishop of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> and by those that yet abuse him, the Abbot of <hi>Kilvinning,</hi> and <hi>Matthew Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Milburne,</hi> two chiefe enemies to the Duke and to his whole house, but in so far as thereby they may procure their own particular profit. These and such other pestilent Papists ceased not to cast fagots on the fire continually, crying, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon these Hereticks, we shall once rid this Realme of them. The certaintie hereof coming to our knowledge, some of us repaired to the Towne againe, about the two and twentieth day of May, and there did abide for the comfort of our brethren: Where after Invocation of the Name of God, we began to put the Town and our selves in such strength, as we thought might best serve for our just defence.<note place="margin">

Adding further, That he declared himself no faithfull servant unto his Master the King of <hi>France,</hi> if for the pleasure of the Priests he would persecute us, and so compell us to take the sword of just defence. In like manner we wrote to Captain <hi>Serre la Bourse,</hi> and to all other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and French Souldiers in generall, admonishing them that their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was not to fight against us naturall Scotish-men, nor yet that they had any such Commandment of their Master: We besought them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to provoke us to enmity against them, and to consider that they had found us favourable, in their most great extremities. We declared farther unto them, That if they entred in hostility and bloody War against us, that the same should remain longer then their owne lives, to wit, even in all posteritie to come, so long as naturall Scotish-men should have power to revenge such cruelty, and most horrible ingratitude. These Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were caused to be spread abroad in great abundance, to the end that some might come to the knowledge of men. The Queen Regent her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was laid upon her Cushion in the Chappel Royall at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where she was accustomed to sit at Masse; she looked upon it, and put in the pocket of her Gown: Monsieur <hi>d' Osel</hi> and the Captains, received theirs, delivered even by their own souldiers (for some amongst them were favourers of the Truth) who after the reading of them, began to pull their own beards, for that was the modest behaviour of Monsieur <hi>d' Osell,</hi> when truth was told unto him, so that it repugned to his fantasie. These our Letters were suppressed to the utmost of their power, and yet they came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many. But the rage of the Queen and the Priests could not be stayed, but forward they move against us, who then were but a very few and mean number of Gentlemen in S. <hi>Iohnston</hi>; we perceiving the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to approach, did write to all brethren to repair towards us for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, to the which we found all men so ready bent, that the Work of God was evidently to be espied: the Tenour whereof followeth. And because that we would omit no diligence to declare our innocency to all men, we formed a Letter to those of the Nobility, who then persecuted us, as after followeth:

shall excuse you in Gods presence, who commandeth none to suffer death till that he be openly convinced in judgement, to have offended against God, and against his Law written; which no mortall creature is able to prove against us: for whatsoever we have done, the same we have done at Gods commandment, who plainly commands Idolatry, and all Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the same to be destroyed and abolished.<note place="margin">The constant request of the Protestants of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                                 </note> Our earnest and long request hath been, and is, That in open Assembly it may be disputed, in presence of indifferent auditors, Whether that these abominations, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>by the pestilent Papists,</hi> Religion, which they by fire and sword de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, be the true Religion of Jesus Christ or not?

If ye think that we be criminall, because that we dissent from your opinion, consider, we beseech you, that the Prophets under the Law, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of Christ Jesus after his Ascension, his Primitive Church and holy Martyrs, did disagree from the whole world in their dayes. And will ye deny but that their action was just, and that all those that persecuted them were murtherers before God? May not the like be true this day? What assurance have ye this day of your Religion, which the world that day had not of theirs? ye have a multitude that agree with you, and so had they: ye have antiquity of time, and that they lacked not: ye have Counsells, Laws, and men of reputation, that have established all things, as ye suppose: but none of all these can make any Religion acceptable unto God, which onely depended upon his owne will, reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to man in his most sacred Word.<note place="margin">

For if the tree shall be judged by the fruit (as Christ Jesus affirmeth that it must needs be) then of necessity it is, That your Prelats, and the whole rabble of their Clergie be evill trees: For if Adultery,<note place="margin">Probation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> Pride, Ambition, Drunkennesse, Covetousnesse, Incest, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse, Oppression, Murther, Idolatry, and Blasphemy, be evill fruits, there can none of that Generation which claim to themselves the title of Churchmen, be judged to be good trees: For all these pestilent and wicked fruits do they bring forth in greatest abundance. And if they be evil trees (as ye your selves must be compelled to confesse they are) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise prudently with what consciences ye can maintain them to occupy the room and place in the Lords Vine-yard.

For our enemies look not to the power of God, but to the force and strength of man; when the number is mean to resist them, then rage they as bloody wolves; but a part equall or able to resist them by appearance, doth bridle their fury. Examine your owne consciences, and weigh that Sentence of our Master Christ Jesus, saying, <hi>Whosoever denieth me, or is ashamed of me before men, I shall deny him before my Father.</hi> Now is the day of his Battell in this Realm, if ye deny us your brethren, suffering for his Names sake, ye do also deny him, as himselfe doth witnesse, in these words, <hi>Whatsoever ye did to any of these little ones, that ye did to me, and what ye did not to one of these little ones, that ye did not to me:</hi> If these sentences be true as concerning meat, drink, cloathing, and such things a appertain to the body, shall they not be likewise true in these things that appertain to the preservation of the lives of thousands, whose blood is now sought, for profession of Christ Jesus?

And yet once again of you, who blinded by superstition, persecute us: We require moderation, till our cause may be tried; which if ye will not grant unto us for Gods Cause, yet we desire you to have respect to the preservation of your common Countrey, which we can no sooner betray into the hands of strangers, then that one of us destroy and murther another.

                     <p>They all three did promise to report his words so far as they could, which afterwards we understood they did; yea the Lord <hi>Sempill</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, a man sold unto sin, enemie to God and all godlinesse, did yet make such report, That the Queen was somewhat offended, that any man should use such libertie in her presence. She still proceeded in her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, for immediately thereafter she sent her Lion Herald with Letters, straitly charging all men to avoid the Towne under the paine of Treason. Which Letters, after he had declared them to the chiefe men of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, he publikely proclaimed the same upon Sunday the 27 of May. In this meane time came sure knowledge to the Queen, to Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and to <hi>Monsieur Dosell,</hi> That the Earle of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> the Lords <hi>Uchiltrie</hi> and <hi>Boyde,</hi> the young Sheriffe of <hi>Air,</hi> the Lairds of <hi>Craggy, Wallace, Sesnock, Carnell, Bar, Gairgirth,</hi> and the whole congregation of <hi>Kyle</hi> and <hi>Cuninghame</hi> approached for our reliefe, and in very deed they came in such diligence, and such a number, That as the enemy had just cause to fear; so have all that professe Christ Jesus, just matter to praise God, for their fidelity and stout courage in that need: For by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence was the tyrannie of the enemy bridled.

                        </note> that albeit the passage by <hi>Sterlin</hi> and six miles above was stopped (for there lay the Queen with her bands, and caused the Bridges to be cut upon the waters of <hi>Forth, Gudy,</hi> and <hi>Teith,</hi> above <hi>Sterlin</hi>) yet made they such expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition through desert and mountaine, that they prevented the enemy, and approached within sixe miles of our Campe, which then lay without the Towne awaiting upon the enemy, before that any assured knowledge came to us of their coming. Their number was judged to twentie five hundred men, whereof there was twelve hundred Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The Queene understanding how the said Earle and Lords, with their company approached, caused to beset all wayes, that no advertisement should come to us: To the end, That we despairing of support, might condiscend to such appointment as she required. And sent

first to require that some discreet men of our number would come and speak to Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Monsieur Dosell,</hi> (who then with their Army lay at <hi>Achtererdoch,</hi> ten miles from S. <hi>Iohnston</hi>) to the end, that some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable appointment might be had. She had perswaded the Earle of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi> and all others, That we meant nothing but Rebellion; and therefore had he promised unto her, That in case we would not stand content with a reasonable appointment, he would declare himselfe open enemy unto us, notwithstanding that he professed the same Religion with us. From us were sent the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Inuerquhartye,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> of <hi>Abbotshall,</hi> to hear what appointment the Queene would offer. The Duke and <hi>Monsieur Dosell</hi> required, That the Towne should be made patent, and that all things should be referred to the Queenes pleasure. To the which they answered, That neither they had commission so to promise, neither durst they in conscience so perswade their brethren: But if the Queene would promise,<note place="margin">The Petition of the Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, for the rendering of S <hi>Iohnston.</hi>
                        </note> That no inhabitant of the Town should be troubled for any such crimes as might be alleadged against them, for the late mutation of Religion and abolishment of Idolatrie, and for down-casting the places of the same; If she would suffer the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion begun to go forward, and leave the Towne at her departing free from the Garrisons of French Souldiers; That they would labour at the hands of their brethren, that the Queene should be obeyed in all things. <hi>Monsieur Dosell</hi> perceiving the danger to be great, if that a sudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment should be made, and that they were not able to execute their tyrannie against us, after that the Congregation of <hi>Kyle</hi> (of whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming we had no advertisement) should be joyned with us, with good words dismissed the said Lairds to perswade the brethren to quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. To the which we were all so well minded, that with one voice they cried; <hi>Cursed be they that seek effusion of blood; Let us possesse Christ Iesus, and the benefit of his Gospel, and none within</hi> Scotland <hi>shall be more obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects then we shall be.</hi> With all expedition were sent from <hi>Sterlin</hi> againe (after that the coming of the Earle of <hi>Glencarne</hi> was knowne, for the enemie for feare quaked) the Earle of <hi>Argyle</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. And in their company a crafty man Master <hi>Gauin Hamilton,</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Kilwinning,</hi> who were sent by the Queen to finish the appointment aforesaid. But before that they came, was the Earle of <hi>Glencarne</hi> and his honourable company arrived in the Towne: and then began all men to praise God, for that he had so mercifully heard them in their most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame necessitie, and had sent unto them such reliefe as was able without effusion of blood to stay the rage of the enemie. The Earle of <hi>Argyle</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames</hi> did earnestly perswade the agreement, to the which all men were willing: but some did smell the craft of the adversary, to wit, That they were minded to keep no point of the promise longer then they had obtained their intent. With the Earle of <hi>Glencarne</hi> came our loving brother <hi>Iohn Willock, Iohn Knox</hi> was in the Town before. These two went to the Earle of <hi>Argyle</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames,</hi>

                        </note> accusing them of infidelity, in so far as they had defrauded their brethren of their dutifull support, and comfort in their greatest necessity.

uttermost of their power. But because they had promised to labour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and to assist the Queen in case we refused reasonable offers, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and honour they could do no lesse then be faithfull in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made: And therefore they required that the brethren might be perswaded to consent to that reasonable appointment;<note place="margin">The promise of the foresaid.</note> promising in Gods presence, That if the Queen did break in any jot thereof, that they with their whole powers would assist and concurre with the brethren in all times to come. This promise made, the Preachers appeased the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and obtained in the end that all men did consent to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment foresaid; which they obtained not without great labours; and no wonder, for many foresaw the danger to follow: yea the Preachers themselves in open Sermon did affirme plainly, That they were assuredly perswaded that the Queen meant no truth.

                        </note> who unjustly did burthen us with Rebellion, they most earnestly required all men to approve the appointment, and so to suffer hypocrisie to disclose it self. This appointment was concluded the 28 of May, and the day following, at two in the after noon, departed the Congregation from Saint <hi>Iohnston,</hi> after that <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> had in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon exhorted all men to constancy, and unfainedly to thanke God, for that it had pleased his mercy to stay the rage of the enemy without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of blood; Also that no brother should be weary, nor faint, to support such as should after be likewise persecuted: for (said he) I am assured that no part of this promise made shall be longer kept, then till the Queen and her French-men to have the upper hand. Many of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were at the same Sermon: For after that the appointment was made, they had free entry in the Towne to provide Lodgings.

The Townes of <hi>Dundie</hi> and S. <hi>Andrews</hi> declared themselves both stout and faithfull. <hi>Cowper,</hi> because it stood in greatest danger, was assisted with the whole Force. Finally, God did so multiply our number, That it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as men had rained from the clouds. The enemy understanding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our Force assured themselves of Victory. Who had beene in <hi>Falkland</hi> the night before, might have seen embracing and kissing, betwixt the Queen, the Duke, and the Bishop: But Master <hi>Gawin Hamilton,</hi> gaper for the Bishoprick of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> above all others, was lovingly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the Queen; For he made his solemne Vow,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Gawin Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons</hi> Vow.</note> That he would fight, and that he would never return till he brought those Traitours to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, either quick or dead. And thus before midnight did they send forward their Ordnance, themselves did follow before three of the clock in the morning. The Lords hereof advertised, assembled their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny early in the morning upon <hi>Cowper-moore</hi>; where by the advice of M. <hi>Iames Haliburtoun</hi> Provest of <hi>Dundie,</hi> was chosen a place of ground con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for our defence: For it was so chosen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That upon all sides our Ordnance might have beaten the enemy, and yet we have stood in safety, if we had been pursued till we had come to hand strokes. The Lord <hi>Ruthuen</hi> took the charge of the horsemen, and ordered them so, That the enemy was never permitted to espie our number; the day was dark, which helped thereto. The enemy (as before is said) thinking to have found no resistance, after that they had twice or thrice made shew unto us, as that they would retire, marched forward with great expedition, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached within a mile before that ever their horsemen stayed, and yet they kept betwixt us and them a water, for their strength. It appeared to us, That either they marched for <hi>Cowper</hi> or S. <hi>Andrews:</hi> and therefore our Horse-men in their Troope, and a part of the Foot-men with the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance marched somewhat alwayes before them for safety of the Towne. The Lords, with the Gentlemen of <hi>Fyfe,</hi> and so many of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Mearns</hi> as were present, kept themselves close in a knot, neere to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a thousand Speares. The Townes of <hi>Dundie</hi> and S. <hi>Andrews</hi> were arrayed in another battell, who came not to the sight of the enemy, till that after twelve of the clock the mist began to vanish, and then passed some of their Horse-men to a mountaine, from the height whereof they might discerne our number. Which perceived by them, their Horse-men and Foot-men stayed incontinent, Posts ran to the Duke and <hi>Monsieur Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,</hi> to declare our number, and what order we kept: And then were Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators sent to make appointment, but they were not suffered to approach neere to the Lords, neither yet to the view of our Camp; which put them in great feare.

Moreover, please your Majestie, That the Duke and the Noble-men being in <hi>Sterlin</hi> for the time, by your Majesties advice, solicited us to presse the Congregation assembled at the Town of <hi>Perth,</hi> to Commune of Concord, where we did our exact diligence, and brought it to passe, as your Majestie knows.

To the which they answered proudly, That they would keep and defend that Towne, according to their promise made to the Queen Regent. This answer received, preparation was made for the Siege and assault. For amongst all, it was concluded that the Towne should be set at liberty, to what danger soever their bodies should be exposed. While preparation was in making, came the Earle of <hi>Huntly,</hi> the Lord <hi>Erskin,</hi> Master <hi>Iohn Ballenden,</hi> Justice <hi>Clerk,</hi> requiring that the pursuit of the Town should be delayed.<note place="margin">Communing at S. <hi>Iohnston.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Huntly.</note> displeased at this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, departed, and was highly offended that he could not dresse such an appointment, as should have contented the Queen and the Priests. After their departing the Town was again summoned: but the Captaines sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that no sudden pursuit should be made, and looking for reliefe to have been sent from the Queen, abode in their former opinion. And so upon Saterday the nine and twentieth of June, at ten of the clock at night, commanded the Lord <hi>Ruthuen</hi> who besieged the west Quarter, to shoot the first Volley, which being done, the Town of <hi>Dundie</hi> did the like, whose Ordnance lay on the east side of the Bridge. The Captaines and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers within the Town, perceiving that they were unable long to resist, required assurance till twelve houres upon the morrow; promising, That if before that houre there came unto them no relief from the Queen Regent, that they would render the Town: Provided that they should be suffered to depart the Town with Ensigne displayed. We thirsting the blood of no man, and seeking onely the liberty of our brethren, condescended to their desires, albeit that we might have executed against them judgement without mercy, for that they had refused our former favours, and had slain one of our brethren, and hurt two in their resistance, and yet we suffered them freely to depart without any further molestation. The Town being delivered from their thraldom, upon Sunday the six and twentieth of June thanks was given to God for this great benefit received, and consultation was taken, what was further to be done.

order should be taken with him, and with that place, which lay neer to the Towns end. The Lords wrote unto him (for he lay within two miles of S. <hi>Iohnston</hi>) That unlesse he would come and assist them, they neither could spare nor save his place. He answered by his writing, That he would come, and would do as they thought expedient; that he would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them with his Force, and would consent with them against the rest of the Clergie in Parliament. But because this answer was slow in coming, the Town of <hi>Dundie</hi> partly offended for the slaughter of their men, and especially bearing no good favour to the said Bishop, for that he was and is chief enemy to Christ Jesus, and that by his counsell alone was <hi>Walter Mile</hi> our brother put to death, they marched forward: To stay them was first sent the Provest of <hi>Dundie,</hi> and his brother <hi>Alexander Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyburtoun</hi> Captaine; who little prevailing, was sent unto them <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>; but before his coming, they were entred to the pulling downe of the Idols and dortoir.

But because the multitude had found buried in the Church a great number of hid goods, of purpose to have preserved them to a better day (as the papists speak) the Towns of <hi>Dundie</hi> and S. <hi>Iohnston</hi> could not be satisfied, till that the whole reparation and Ornaments of the Church (as they terme it) were destroyed. And yet did the Lords so travell, that they saved the Bishops Palace, with the Church and place for that night: For the two Lords did not depart, till they brought with them the whole number of those that most sought the Bishops displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The Bishop greatly offended that any thing should have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprised in reformation of his place, asked of the Lords his Band and hand-writing, which not two hours before he had sent unto them; which delivered to his Messenger Sir <hi>Adam Browne,</hi> advertisement was given, That if any farther displeasure chanced unto him, he would that he should not blame them. The Bishops servants that same night began to fortifie the place again, and began to do violence to some that were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away such Baggage as they could come by. The Bishops Girnall was kept the first night by the labours of <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> who by exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on removed such as violently would make interruption. The same night departed from S. <hi>Iohnston</hi> the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and L. <hi>Iames,</hi> as after shall be declared.<note place="margin">The cause of the burning of <hi>Scone.</hi>
                        </note> The morrow following, some of the poor, in hope of spoyl, and some of <hi>Dundie,</hi> to consider what was done, passed up to the said Abbey of <hi>Scone</hi>; whereat the Bishops servants offended, began to threaten and speak proudly: and as it was constantly affirmed, one of the Bishops sons thrust thorow with a Rapier one of <hi>Dundie,</hi> for because he was looking in at the Girnell door. This brute noysed abroad, the Town of <hi>Dundie</hi> was more enraged then before; who putting themselves in Armour, sent word to the inhabitants of S. <hi>Iohnston,</hi> That unlesse they would support them to avenge that injury, they should never after that day occure with them in any action. The multitude easily enflamed, gave the Alarm, and so was



<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61872:121"/>
that Abbey and Palace appointed to Saccage, in doing whereof they took no long deliberation, but committed the whole to the merciement of fire. Whereat no small number of us were so offended, that patiently we could not speak, to any that were of <hi>Dundie</hi> or Saint <hi>Iohnston.</hi> A poor aged matron seeing the flame of fire to passe up so mightily, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that many were thereat offended,<note place="margin">Speaking of an ancient matron when <hi>Scone</hi> was burning.</note> in plain and sober manner of speaking, said, <hi>Now I see and understand that Gods judgements are just, and that no man is able to save where he will punish: since my remembrance this place hath been nothing else but a Den of Whore mongers: It is incredible to believe how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wives have been adulterate, and virgins deflowred by the filthy beasts which have been fostered in this den; but especially by that wicked man who is called the Bishop. If all men knew as much as I, they would praise God, and no man would be offended.</hi> This woman dwelt in the Towne nigh to the Abbey. At whose words were many pacified, affirming with her, That it was Gods just Judgement. And assuredly if the labours or travell of any man could have saved that place, it had not been at that time destroyed: for men of greatest estimation laboured with all diligence for the safety of it. While these things were done at Saint <hi>Iohnston,</hi> the Queen fearing what should follow, determined to send certain Bands of French Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> of purpose to stop the passage to us that then were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the North side of <hi>Forth.</hi> Which understood, the Earle of <hi>Argyle</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames</hi> departed secretly in the night, and with great expedition preventing the French,<note place="margin">The taking of <hi>Stirlin.</hi>
                        </note> they took the Towne (before whose coming the rascall multitude put hands on the thieves, I should say Friers places, and utterly destroyed them) whereat the Queen and her Faction not a little afrayed, with all diligence departed from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to <hi>Dumbar.</hi> And so we with reasonable diligence marched forward to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for Reformation to be made there; where we arrived the 29 of June. The Provest for that time, the Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Shaton.</hi>
                        </note> a man without God, without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, and oftentimes without reason, had before greatly troubled and molested the brethren, for he had taken upon him the protection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Gray Friers</hi>; and for that purpose did not onely lie himself in one of the Colledges every night, but also constrained the most honest of the Towne to watch those monsters, to their great grief and trouble. But hearing of our sudden coming,<note place="margin">The coming of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Edinburg.</hi>
                        </note> he abandoned his charge, and left the spoyl to the poor, who had made havock of all such things as was moveable in those places before our coming, and left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bare walls; yea, not so much as door or window: whereby we were the lesser troubled in putting order to such places. After that we had deliberate certain dayes what was best to be done, and what order was to be taken for suppressing all Monuments of Idolatry within that Towne, and the places next adjacent, determination was taken to send some Message to the Queen then Regent. For she had bruted (as her accustomed manner was, by advice of her counsell, ever to forge lies) that we sought nothing but her life, and a plain <hi>revoltment from the lawfull obedience due to our Soveraigne her Authority,</hi> as by the Tenour of these Letters may be seen.</p>

The Queen Regent with all possible diligence posted for her Faction: Master <hi>Iames Balfour</hi> was not idle in the mean time.

Beseeching your Majestie to beare patiently therewith, and interpose your Authority to the furtherance of the same, as is the duty of every Christian Prince, and good Magistrate.

                     <p>And for further purgation hereof, it was thought necessary that we should simply expose as well to her Majesty, as to the whole people what were our requests and just petitions: And for that purpose after that safe-Conduct was purchased and granted, we directed unto her two grave men of counsell, to wit, the Lairds of <hi>Pittarrow</hi> and <hi>Cuninghamehead,</hi> to whom we gave commission and power, first to expose our whole purpose and intent, which was no other then before, at all times we had required; to wit, First, That we might enjoy the liberty of conscience. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That Christ Jesus might be truely preached, and his holy Sacraments rightly ministred unto us. Thirdly, That unable Ministers might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from Ecclesiasticall Administration: And that our Preachers might be relaxed from the <hi>Horne,</hi> and permitted to execute their charges, without molestation unto such as either by a generall Councell lawfully convened, or by a Parliament within the Realme the controversies in Religion were decided. And for declaration that her Majestie was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to willing that the Bands of French-men, who then were a burden into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to the Countrey, and to us so fearfull, that we durst not in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet manner haunt the places where they did lie, should be sent to <hi>France</hi> their native Countrey: Which things granted, Her Majestie should have experience of our accustomed obedience. To these Heads she did answer at the first so pleasantly, that she put both our Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in full esperance that all should be granted, and for that purpose she desired to speak with some of greater Authority; promising, That if they would assure her of their dutifull obedience, that she would deny nothing of that which was required. For satisfaction of her minde, we sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Earle of <hi>Glencarne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The craftines of the Queen Regent may yet be espied.</note> the Lord <hi>Ruthwen,</hi> the Lord <hi>Uchiltrie,</hi> and the said Laird of <hi>Pittarrow,</hi> with the same Commission as before. But then she began to handle the matter more craftily, complaining that she



<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61872:122"/>
was not sought in a gentle manner. And that they in whom she had put most singular confidence, had left her in her greatest need. And such other things pertaining nothing to the Commission, she proposed to spend and drive the time. They answered, That by unjust tyrannie devised against them and their brethren (as her Majestie did well know) they were compelled to seek the extreame remedie, and therefore that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie ought not to wonder though godly men left the company, where they neither found fidelity nor trueth. In the end of this communing; which was the twelfth day of July 1559.<note place="margin">1559.</note> She desired to have talked privately with the Earle of <hi>Argyle</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> Prior of S. <hi>Andrews</hi>; for else (as she alleadged) she could not but suspect that they pretended to some other higher purpose then Religion. She and her crafty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell had abused Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> perswading him and his friends, That the said Earle and Lord <hi>Iames</hi> had conspired,<note place="margin">Accusations.</note> first to deprive our Soveraigne her daughter of her authority,<note place="margin">Mark the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie calumnies.</note> and thereafter the Duke and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of their pretended Title to the Crowne of <hi>Scotland.</hi> By these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented lyes she inflamed the hearts of many against us, insomuch that some of our own number began to murmure. Which perceived, as well the Preachers in their publike Sermons, as we our selves by our publike Proclamation, gave purgation and satisfaction to the people, plainely and simply declaring what was our purpose, taking God to witnesse, That no such crimes were ever entred into our hearts, as most unjustly was laid to our charge. The Counsell after consultation, thought not expedient that the said Earle and Lord <hi>Iames</hi> should talke with the Queen in any sort; for her former practises put all men in suspition, That some deceit lurked under such coloured communing. She had before said, That if she could by any meane sunder these two from the rest, she was assured shortly to come by her whole purpose. And one of her chiefe Counsell in those dayes (and we feare but too inward with her yet) said, That ere <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi> day they two should lose their heads; and therefore all men fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to commit two such young plants to her mercy and fidelity. It was therefore finally denied that they should talk with the Queen, or any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to her, but in places void of all suspicion, where they should be equall in number with those that should talk with them. The Queen perceiving that her craft could not prevaile, was content that Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> and that Earle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> with others by her appointed, should convene at <hi>Preston,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at <hi>Preston.</hi>
                        </note> to Commune with the said Earle and Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> and such others as the Lords of the Congregation would appoint, to the number of an hundred on each side: Of the which number, eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons onely should meet for conference. The principals for their party, were the Duke, and Earle <hi>Huntly,</hi> the Lords <hi>Erskin</hi> and <hi>Somerwell,</hi> M. <hi>Gawin Hamilton,</hi> and the Justice <hi>Clerk.</hi> From us were directed the Earles of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi> and <hi>Glencarne,</hi> the Lords <hi>Ruthuen</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames, Boyde</hi> and <hi>Uchil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,</hi> the Lairds <hi>Dun</hi> and <hi>Pittarrow.</hi> Who Convening at <hi>Preston,</hi> spake the whole day without any certaine conclusion: For this was the practise of the Queen and of her faction, <hi>By drift of time to weary our company,</hi> who for the most part, had been upon the fields from the tenth day of May: That we being dispersed, she might come to her purpose, in



<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61872:123"/>
which she was not altogether deceived: For our Commons were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to scatter for lack of expences: And our Gentlemen partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by lack of furnishing, and partly hoping some finall appointment, after so many Communings, returned for the most part to their dwelling places, for reposing of themselves. The Queen in all those Conventions seemed that she would give liberty to Religion;<note place="margin">The demand of the Queen Regent, and answer of the Protestants</note> Provided, <hi>That whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she was, our Preachers should cease, and the Masse should be maintained.</hi> We perceiving her malicious craft, answered, <hi>That as we would compell her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, to no Religion; so could we not in conscience, for the pleasure of any earthly treasure, put silence to Gods true Messengers: neither could we suffer that the right administration of Christs true Sacraments should give place to manifest Idolatry, for in so doing we should declare our selves enemies to God, to Christ Iesus his Son, to his eternall Veritie, and to the libertie and establishment of his Church within this Realme: For your request being granted, There can no Church within the same be so established, but at your pleasure, and by your residence and remaining there, ye might overthrow the same.</hi> This our last answer we sent unto her with the Lord <hi>Ruthuen</hi> and Laird of <hi>Pittarrow,</hi> requiring of her Majestie in plaine words, to signifie unto us, What hope we might have of her favour towards the upsetting of Religion? We also requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That she would remove her French-men, who were a feare to us, and a burden most grievous to our Countrey; and that she would promise to us in the word of a Prince, That she would procure no man to be sent in. And then should we not onely support to the uttermost of our powers to furnish Ships and Victuals for their transporting, but also upon our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours should we take her body into our protection.<note place="margin">The last offers of the Protest<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ants to the Q.

Finally, That we should submit our selves to a lawfull Parliament. Provided that the Bishops, as the partie accused and our plaine enemies, should be removed from judgement.</p>
                     <p>To no point would she answer directly, but in all things she was so generall and so ambiguous, that her craft appeared to all men. She had gotten assured knowledge that our company was scattered (for her French-men were daily amongst us, without molestation or hurt done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them) and therefore she began to disclose her minde,<note place="margin">The scoffing of the Queen Regent.</note> and said, The Congregation hath reigned these two moneths past; Me my selfe would reigne now other two. The malice of her heart being plainely percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, deliberation was had what was to be done. It was concluded, That the Lords, Barons, and Gentlemen, with their chiefe domesticks, should remaine in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> that whole Winter, for establishing of the Church there. And because it was found, That by the corrupting of our Money the Queen made to her selfe immoderate gaines,<note place="margin">

                        </note> for maintaining of her Souldiers, to the destruction of the whole Common-wealth: It was thought necessary, That the Printing yrons, and all things pertaining should be stayed, for feare that she should privily cause to transport them

to <hi>Dumbar.</hi> In this mean time came assured word, first, That the King of <hi>France</hi> was hurt, and after that he was dead. Which albeit it ought to have put her in minde of her own estate and wicked enterprises:<note place="margin">The death of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi>
                        </note> for he that same time in the fulnesse of his glory (as she her selfe used to speak) had determined most cruell persecution against the Saints of God in <hi>France,</hi> even as she her selfe was here persecuting in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and yet he so perished in his pride, That all men might see that Gods just vengeance did strike him, even when his iniquity was come to full ripenesse. Albeit we say, That this wonderous work of God in his sudden death, ought to have danted her fury, and given unto her admonition, That the same God could not suffer her obstinate malice against his Truth, long to be unpunished: Yet could her indurate heart nothing be moved to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for hearing of the staying of the Printing yrons, she raged more outragiously then before, and sending for all such as were of her faction, exposed her grievous complaint, aggravating the same with many lies,<note place="margin">Note how this agrees with our times.</note> to wit, That we had declared that which before she suspected: For what could we mean else but usurpation of the Crown, when we durst put hands to the Coining-house, which was a portion of the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the Crown. She further alleadged, That we had spoiled the Coining-House of great sums of money. To the which we answered, both by our Letters sent to her and her Counsell, and by publike Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the people, That we without usurpation of any such thing, justly appertaining to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Answer to the calumnie.</note> did stay the Printing yrons, in consideration that the Common-wealth was greatly hurt by corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our money. And because we were born Counsellers of this Realm, sworn to procure the profit of the same, we could do no lesse of dutie and of conscience,<note place="margin">Note, Nobles.</note> then to stay that for a time, which we saw so abused, That unlesse remedy were found, should turn to the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the whole body of this Realme. And as to her false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of spoil, we did remit us to the conscience of M. <hi>Robert Richeson,</hi> master of the Coining-house, who from our hands received silver, gold, and mettall, as well Coined as un-Coined, so that with us there did not remain the value of a Bawbee, or Farthing. This our Declaration and purgation notwithstanding, she, partly by her craft and policie, and partly by the labours of the Bishops of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glasgow,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the whole number that were with her, to consent to pursue us with all cruelty and expedition, before that we could have our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (which then was dispersed for new furnishing) assembled again. The certaintie hereof coming to our knowledge the Saturday at night, being the 25 of July, we did what in us lay to give advertisement to our brethren: but impossible it was that the Wast, <hi>Angus, Mernes, Straitherne</hi> or <hi>Fyfe,</hi> in any number could come to us. For the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie Marched from <hi>Dumbar</hi> upon the Sunday, and approached within two miles of us before Sun-rising upon Munday. For they verily suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have found no resistance, being assured that the Lords onely with certain Gentlemen remained with their private houses: calling upon God for counsell in that straight, we sought what was the next defence. We might have left the Town, and might have retired our selves without any



<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61872:124"/>
danger, but then we should have abandoned our brethren of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and suffered the Ministery thereof to have decayed; which to our hearts was so dolorous, that we thought better to hazard the extremitie then so to do. For then the most part of the Town appeared rather to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us then the Queens faction, and did offer unto us the uttermost of their support, which for the most part they did faithfully keep. The same did the Town of <hi>Leith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Leith</hi> left us the congregation.</note> but they kept not the like fidelity. For when we were upon the field, marching forward for their support (for the French marched nigh to them) they rendred themselves without further resistance. And this they did, as is supposed, by the treason of some within themselves, and by perswasion of the Laird of <hi>Lestarrig,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared himselfe to be one of us; and notwithstanding that same day rendred himselfe undesired to <hi>Monsieur Dosell.</hi> Their unprovided and sudden defection astonished many, and yet we retired quietly to the side of <hi>Cragingate,</hi> which place we took for resisting the enemy. In the mean time divers mediatours passed betwixt us, amongst whom the Lord <hi>Ruthuen</hi> for our part was principall. <hi>Alexander Erskin</hi> did much travell to stay us and our Souldiers, that we should not joyne with them of <hi>Leith,</hi> till that they, as is said, had rendred themselves to the French. The said <hi>Alexander</hi> did oft promise that the French would stay, provided, That we would not joyne with those of <hi>Leith.</hi> But after that they were rendred, we heard nothing of him but threatning and discomfortable words. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was eight of the clock in the morning, God had given unto us both courage, and a reasonable number to withstand their furie. The Towne of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> so many as had subject themselves to discipline, and divers others besides them, behaved themselves both faithfully and stoutly. The Gentlemen of <hi>Lowthiane,</hi> especially <hi>Calder, Hatton,</hi> and <hi>Ormeston,</hi> were very comfortable, as well for their counsell as for their whole assistance. Some Gentlemen of <hi>Fyfe</hi> prevented the French-men, other were stopped by reason that the French had passed <hi>Leith.</hi> Alwayes the enemy took such a fear, That they determined not to invade us where we stood, but took purpose to have passed to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by the other side of the water of <hi>Leith:</hi> and that because they had the Castle to their friend, which was to us unknown, for we supposed the Lord <hi>Erskin,</hi> Captain of the same, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have been our friend, or at least to have been indifferent. But when we had determined to fight,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Erskin</hi> and his fact.</note> he sent word to the Earle of <hi>Argyle,</hi> to Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> his sisters son, and to the other Noble-men, That he would declare himselfe, both enemy to them and to the Town, and would shoot at both, if they made any resistance to the French-men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Town. This his treasonable defiance sent us, by the Laird of <hi>Ricarton</hi> did abate the courage of many, for we could not fight, nor stop the enemy, but under the mercy of the Castle and whole Ordnance thereof. Hereupon was consultation taken, and in conclusion, it was found lesse damage to take an appointment, albert the Conditions were not such as we desired; then to hazard battell betwixt two such enemies. After long talking, certaine heads were drawn by us, which we desired to be granted.</p>

At this, and some other Sermons was the Duke, and divers other of the Queens faction. This liberty of Preaching, and resort of all people thereto did highly offend the Queen and the other Papists. And first they began to give terrours to the Duke, affirming, That he would be reputed as one of the Congregation, if he gave his presence to the Sermons. Thereafter they began to require, That <hi>Masse</hi> might be set up again in S. <hi>Giles</hi> Church, and that the people should be set at liberty to chuse what Religion they would. For that said they was contained in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, That the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> should chuse what Religion they listed. For obtaining hereof were sent to the Town the Duke, the Earle of <hi>Huntly,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi> to solicite all men to condiscend to the Queens minde, wherein the two last did labour what they could, the Duke not so, but as a beholder, of whom the brethren had good hope, and after many perswasions and threatnings made by the said Earle and Lord, the brethren stoutly and valiantly in the Lord Jesus, gain-said their most unjust Petitions. Reasoning, That as in conscience they might not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Idolatry to be erected, where Christ Jesus was truely Preached; so could not the Queen nor they require any such thing, unlesse she and they would plainely violate their Faith, and chiefe Article of the appointment. For it is plainely appointed, <hi>That no member of the Congregation shall be molested in any thing; That at the day of the appointment they peaceably possessed.</hi> But so it was, That we the brethren and Protestants of the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with our Ministers the day of the appointment, did peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enjoy Saint <hi>Giles</hi> Church, appointed us for Preaching of Christs true Gospel, and right ministration of his holy Sacraments. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without manifest violation of the appointment, you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move us therefrom, untill a Parliament have decided the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. This answer given, the whole brethren departed, and left the foresaid Earle, and Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi> then Provest of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> still in the <hi>Tolbuith.</hi> Who perceiving that they could not prevaile in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, began to entreat that they would be quiet, and that they would so far condiscend to the Queens-pleasure, as that they would chuse them another within the Town, or at the least be content that <hi>Masse</hi> should be said, either after or before their Sermon. To the which, answer was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; That to give place to the devil (who was the chiefe Inventer of the Masse) for the pleasure of any creature,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Note.</hi>
                        </note> they could not. They were in possession of that Church which they could not abandon, neither yet could they suffer Idolatry to be erected in the same, unlesse by violence they should be constrained so to do. And then they were determined to seek the next remedy. Which answer received, the Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi> did lovingly intreat them to quietnesse, faithfully promising, That in no sort they should be molested, so that they would be quiet, and make no farther uproare. To the which they were most willing, for they sought onely to serve God, as he had commanded, and to keep their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, according to the appointment: which by Gods grace they did, till the moneth of November, notwithstanding the great boasting of the enemy.

even in the eyes of the very enemy, to the great comfort of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflicted consciences, and as God did strongly work with his true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and with his troubled Church: so did not the devil cease to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the malice of the Queen, and of the Papists with her. For that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her coming to the Abbey of <hi>Halyrud-house,</hi> she caused Masse to be said first in her own Chappell, and after in the Abbey where the Altars before were cast down.

Her French Captains, with their Souldiers in great companies, in time of Preaching and Prayers resort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Saint <hi>Giles</hi> Church in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and made their common deam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation therein with such loud talking, as no perfect audience could be had. And although the Minister was there-through oft times compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to cry out on them, Praying to God to rid them of such Locusts, they neverthelesse continued still in their wicked purpose devised and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Queen, to have drawn our brethren of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and them in cumber, so that she might have had any coloured occasion to have broken the League with them.

                        </note> albeit in all these things before-named, and in every one of them she is justly accounted to have gaine-said the said appointment. We passe over the oppressing of our brethren in particular, which had been sufficient to have proved the appointment to have been plainly violated. For the Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any occasion offered unto him, brake a chase upon <hi>Alexander Whitlam,</hi> as he came from <hi>Preston,</hi> accompanied with M. <hi>William Knox,</hi> towards <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and ceased not to pursue him, till he came to the Towne of <hi>Ormeston.</hi> And this he did, supposing that the said <hi>Alexander</hi> had been <hi>Iohn Knox.</hi> In all this mean time, and while that moe French-men ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they are not able to prove that we brake the appointment in any jote, except that a horned Cap was taken off a proud Priests head, and cut in four quarters, because he said, He would wear it in despight of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. In this mean time, the Queen, then Regent, knowing assuredly what force was shortly to come unto her, ceased not, by all meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to cloke the in-coming of the French, and to inflame the hearts of our Countrey-men against us.

And first, where she alleadgeth, That certain seditious persons have of malice invented and blown abroad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers rumors, tending thereby (as she alleadgeth) to stir up the hearts of the people to sedition, by reason that the French-men are crept in of late in our Countrey. True it is (dear brethren) that all such as bear na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall love to their Countrey, to you their brethren inhabitants thereof, to our houses, wives, children, the esperance of our posterity; and to be short, To our Common-wealth, and to the ancient Laws and Liberties therof, cannot but in heart lament, and with mouth &amp; tears complain, the most crafty assaults devised and practised, to the utter ruine of all these things forenamed. This is so manifestly gone to work, that even in our eyes, our dear brethren, true members of our Common-wealth, are most cruelly oppressed by strangers; in so far, as some are banished their owne houses, some robbed and spoiled of their substance purchast by their just labours in the sweat of their brows, some cruelly murthered at the pleasure of these inhumane souldiers, and altogether have their lives in such fear and dread, as if the enemy were in the midst of them; so that nothing can seem pleasant unto them which they possesse in the bowells of their native Countrey; so neer judged every man (and not without just cause) the practise used upon their brethren, to approach next unto them, their wives, childrens, houses, and substances, which altogether are cast at the feet of strangers men of War, to be by them thus abused at their unbridled lusts desire. Now if it be sedition (dear brethren) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, lament, and pour forth before God the sorrows and sobs of our dolorous hearts, crying to him for redresse of those enormities (which elsewhere is to be found) which altogether do proceed of the unlawfull holding of strange Souldiers over the heads of our brethren. If this to complain be sedition, then indeed (dear brethren) can none of us be purged of that crime; for as in very heart we condemne such inhumane cruelty, with the wicked and crafty pretence thereof, so can we not, nor dare we, neither by mouths speaking, nor yet by keeping silence, justifie the same. Neither do we here aggravate the breaking of the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made at <hi>Leith</hi> (which alwayes hath manifestly been done) but herein we remember what oath we have made to our Common-wealth, and how the duty we ought to the same compelleth us to cry out, That

Again, What favour to our Common-wealth doth she at this instant bear, when even now presently, and of a long time by-gone, by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of some (who better deserve the Gallows then ever did <hi>Cochran</hi>) she doth so corrupt the good money, and hath brought it to such busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and such a deale of strife, that all men that had their eyes open may perceive an extream beggery to be brought there-through upon the whole Realme. So that the whole exchange and traffique to be had with Forraigne nations (a thing most necessary in all Common-wealths) shall thereby be utterly extinguished, and all the gaines received thereby is, That she therewith entertaineth strangers upon our heads. For bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you know that her money hath served for no other purpose in our Common-wealth this long time bygone. And the impunity of those wicked Ministers (whom lately we spake of) hath brought the matter to such a licentious enormitie and plaine contempt of the Common-weale, that now they spare not plainely to break down and convert the good and weighty money Coined in our Soveraignes lesser age into this their corrupted skruife and baggages of Hard-heads and Non-sunts,<note place="margin">Let Sir <hi>Robert Richardson</hi> and others answer to this.</note> most like as she and they had conspired to destroy all the whole good Coine of this Realme; and consequently that part of the Common-weale.

Whose oppression as doubtlesse it is entred in before the Justice-seat of God, so ought it justly to move our hearts to have pity and compassion upon these our poore brethren, and at our powers to provide remedie for the same. And albeit her strangers had been garnished with money (as you know well they were not) yet can there here lying be no wayes but most hurtfull to our Common-wealth, seeing that the fertility of this Realme had never been so plentifull that it was able of any continuance to sustain it selfe and inhabitants thereof, without support of Forraigne Countreys, far lesse able besides the same to sustain thousands of strangers wherewith it is burthened, to the dearth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all victuals, as the murmure and complaint of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> this day doth testifie. But to what effect the Common-weale is thus burdened, the end doth declare. For shortly were they brought to the fields against our Soveraigns true Lieges, even us your brethren, who (God knoweth) sought nothing else but peace of conscience, under protection of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, and Reformation of these enormities, for no other cause but that we would not renounce the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and subdue our necks under the tyranny of that wicked Man of sin, the <hi>Romane Antichrist</hi> and his forsworn Shavelings, who at that time most tyrannically oppressed our souls with hunger of Gods true Word, and rest our goods and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, to waste the same upon their foule lusts and stinking harlots. But (O dear brethren) this was not the chiefe pretence and finall scope of her proceedings (as these dayes do well declare) for had not God given in our hearts to withstand that oppression, with weapons of most just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, thou, O Saint <hi>Iohnston</hi> and <hi>Dundie,</hi> had been in no better state then your sister of <hi>Leith</hi> is this day. For though we in very deed (God is witnesse) meant then nothing, but in the simplicity of our hearts, the maintenance of true Religion, and safetie of our brethren, Professours of the same, yet lay there another serpent lurking in the brest of our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, as this day (praise to God) is plainely opened to all that list to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to wit, <hi>To bring you and us both under the perpetuall servitude of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> For we being appointed, as ye know, touching Religion to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with all in the Councell, at the day affixed, and no occasion made to break the same on our side (as is well known) yet come there forth wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and complaints,<note place="margin">See how this agrees with our times.</note> That this day and that day we were prepared to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Queens person (when in very truth there was never such thing thought, as the very deed hath declared.)

Indeed her Majestie is, and hath been at all times carefull to procure by her craft of fair words, of fair promises, and sometimes of buds to allure your simplicity to that point, to joyn your selves to her Souldiers, to daunt and oppresse us, that you the remnant (we being cut off) may be an easie prey to her sleights: Which God of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath now discovered to the eyes of all that list to behold.

                           <p>If it be sedition to speak the trueth in all sobriety, and to complaine, when they are wounded, or to call for help against unjust tyrannie before that their throats be cut, then can we not denie, but we are criminall and guilty of tumult and sedition. For we have said, That our Common-weale is oppressed, that we and our brethren are hurt by the tyrannie of strangers, and that we fear bondage and slaverie, seeing that multitudes of cruell murtherers are daily brought into our Countrey without our counsell, knowledge, and consent. We dispute not so much whether the bringing in of moe French-men be violating of the appointment (which the Queen and her faction cannot deny to be manifestly broken by them in moe causes then one) as that we would know, if that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of strangers upon strangers, above us, without our counsell or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, be a thing that may stand with the Liberty of our Realme, and with the profit of our Common-wealth. It is not unknown to all men of judgement, That the fruits of our Countrey, in the most common yeers, be no more then sufficient reasonable to nourish the born inhabitants of the same. But now seeing we have been vexed with wars, taken upon us at the pleasure of <hi>France,</hi> by the which the most fruitfull portion of our Countrey in Corne hath been wasted. What man is so blinde, but that he may see, That such bands of ungodly and idle Souldiers can be nothing else but an occasion to famish our poore brethren. And in this point we refuse not (which is the chiefe) the judgement of all naturall Scottish-men. The Queen Regent alleadged, That although there was an hundred French-men for one that is in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet she is not minded to trouble

any unjust possession. Whereto we answer, That we dispute not what she intended (which neverthelesse by probable conjectures it is to be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) but alwayes we affirm, that such a multitude of French-men is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not onely unprofitable, but also intolerable to this poor Realme; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially being treated as they are by her and Monsieur <hi>Dosell:</hi> For if their wages be paid out of <hi>France,</hi> then are they both (the Queen, we say, and Monsieur <hi>Dosell</hi>) traytors to the King and Counsell;<note place="margin">

                           <p>What motherly affection she hath declared to this Realm, and to the inhabitants of the same, her works have evidently declared, even since the first hour that she hath borne Authority. And albeit men will not this day see what danger hangs over our heads, yet fear we that ere it be long, experience shall teach some, that we have not feared without cause. The cruell murther and oppression used by those whom now she foster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is to us a sufficient argument what is to be looked for when her num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is so multiplied, that our force shall not be able to gainstand their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Where she complaineth of our Preachers, affirming that unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently they speak of Princes in generall, and of her in particular, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the people thereby to defection from their duty, &amp;c. And therefore that such a thing cannot be suffered. Because this occasion is laid against Gods true Ministers, we cannot but witnesse what course and order of Doctrine they have kept, and yet keep in that point.</p>
                           <p>In publike prayers they recommend to God all Princes in generall,<note place="margin">

                              </note> and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of this our native Realme in particular. In open audience they declare the Authority of Princes and Magistrates to be of God, and therefore they affirm that they ought to be honoured, feared, and obeyed, even for conscience sake; provided that they command nor require nothing expresly repugning to Gods Commandment and plain Will revealed in his holy Word. Moreover, they affirm, That if wicked persons abusing the Authority established by God, move Princes to command things manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, That such as can and do bridle those inordinate appetites of misled Princes, cannot be accused as resistaries of the Authority, which is Gods good Ordinance. To bridle the rage and fury of misled Princes in free Kingdoms and Realms, they affirm it appertaineth to the Nobility, sworn and borne Councellors of the same, and also to the Barons and people, whose votes and consents are to be required in all great and weighty matters of the Common-wealth; which if they do not, they declare themselves cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall with their misled Princes, and so subject to the same vengeance of God, which they deserve, for that they pollute the seat of Iustice, and do as it were make God author of Iniquity. They proclaim and cry, That the same God who plagued <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> repulsed <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> struck <hi>Herod</hi> with worms, and made the bellies of dogs the grave and sepulcher of the spitefull <hi>Jesabell,</hi> will not spare misled Princes, who authorize the murtherers of Christs members in this our time.

                              </note> and of your Majesty in particular. This onely we have heard one of our Preachers say, rebuking the vain excuses of such as flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by reason of Authority; Many now adayes (said he) will have no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion nor faith, then the Queen and Authority had: But is it not possible that the Queen be so far blinded, that she will have no Religion, nor no other faith, then may

Let men therefore consider what danger they stand in, if their salvation shall depend upon the Queens faith and Religion. Further, we never heard any of our Preachers speak of the Queen Regent, neither publikely nor privately. Where her Majestie declareth, It will not be suffered that our Prerchers meddle with Policy, or speak of her, or of other Princes, but with reverence: we answer, That as we will justifie and defend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our Preachers which we finde not God to have justified and allowed in his Messengers before them; so we dare not forbid them openly to reprehend that which the Spirit of God, speaking in the Prophets and Apostles, hath reprehended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. <hi>Helias</hi> did personally reprove <hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Jesabell</hi> of idolatry, of avarice,<note place="margin">

Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus called <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox; and <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the high Priest a painted wall, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto God that he should strike him, because that against justice he commanded him to be smitten. Now if the like (and greater) corruptions be in the world this day, Who dare enterprise to put to silence the Spirit of God, which will not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the appetites of misled Princes.</p>

And seeing the faithfulnesse of your antecessors, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of your Father of honourable memory, who was so recommended and dear to the Estates and Councellors of this Realme, through affection they perceived in him towards the Common-wealth thereof, that they doubted not to give in his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the key, as it were, of the Councell, of the Iustice and Policy of this Realme, the Castles of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Sterlin,</hi> we cannot but believe ye will rather aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the honourable favour of your House by stedfast favour and loyalty to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, then through the subtill perswasions of some (which care not what after shall come to you and your House, at the present would abuse you to the performance of their wicked enterprises and pretences against our Common-wealth)

utterly destroy the same.

Thus we write, not that we are in doubt of you, but rather to warne you of the danger, in case ye suffer your selfe to be inchanted with fair promises, and crafty Councellors: For let no man flatter himself; we desire all men to know; That though he were our father (seeing God hath opened our eyes to see his Will) if he be enemy to the Common wealth,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which is now assailed, and we with it, and all true members thereof, he shall be knowne, and as he is indeed enemy to us, to our lives, our houses, babes, heritages, and whatsoever is contained within the same: For as the Ship perishing, What can be safe that is within?

Save your person by wisedome, strengthen your self against force: And the Almighty God assist you in both, that one ayd the other, and open the eyes of your understanding to see and perceive the craft of Sathan and his supposts.</p>

For this point I will not conceale from your Majestie, That amongst us there is a solemned Oath, that none of us shall traffique with your Majestie secretly, neither yet that any of us shall treat or deale for himselfe particularly: Which Oath, for my part, I purpose to keep unviolated to the end. But when the rest of the Noble-men shall conveene, I shall leave nothing that lyeth in my power undone, that may make for the quietnesse of this poore Realme: Provided, That the glory of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus be not hindered by our concord. And if your Majestie shall be found so tractable, as now ye offer, I doubt not to obtaine of the rest of my brethren such favour towards your service, as your Majestie shall have just occasion to stand content: For I take God to record, That in this action I have neither sought, neither yet seek any other thing then to increase Gods glory, and the Libertie of this poore Realme to be maintained. Further, I have shewed unto your Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger what things have misliked me in your proceedings, even from such a heart as I wish to God you knew fully, and all men else. And this, with hearty commendation of service to your Majestie, I heartily commit your Highnesse to the eternall protection of the omnipotent.</p>

And that the fortification of <hi>Leith,</hi> is a purpose devised in <hi>France,</hi> and that therefore <hi>Monsieur de la Brosse,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> are come to this countrey. A thing so vaine and untrue, that the contrary thereof is knowne to all men of free judgement. Therefore the Queen, willing that the occasions whereby her Majesty was moved so to do, be made patent, and what have been her proceedings since the appointment last made on the Linkes beside <hi>Leith.</hi>

To the effect that the trueth of all things being made manifest, every man may understand how unjustly that a desire to suppresse the liberty of this Realm is laid to her charge; we have thought expedient to make this discourse following. First, although after the said appointment, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the said Congregation, and that not of the meanest sort, hath violently broken the points thereof, and made sundry occasions of new cumber. The same was in a part winked at, and over-looked, in hope that they in time would remember their duty, and abstaine from such evil behaviour, which conversion her Majestie ever sought, rather then any punishment, with such care and solicitude by all means, and in the mean time nothing was provided for her own security. But at last by their frequent Messages to and from <hi>England,</hi>
                                    <note place="margin">
                                       <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was come to the crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the yeere before, by the death of <hi>Mary.</hi>
                                    </note> their intelligence then was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, yet her Majestie trusted the Queen of <hi>England</hi> (let them seek as they please) will do the office of a Christian Princesse, in time of a sworne Peace, through which, force was to her Majestie, seeing so great defection of great personages, <hi>to have recourse to the Law of Nature.</hi> And like as a small Bird, being pursued, will provide some nest, so her Majestie could do no lesse in cases of pursuit, but provide some sure retract for her selfe and her company, and to that effect chose the Town of <hi>Leith,</hi> as a place convenient therefore: because it was her dearest daughters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and no other person could claime Title or Interesse thereto, and also because in former times it had been fortified: About the same time that the seeking support of <hi>England</hi> was made manifest, arrived the Earle of <hi>Arrane,</hi>
                                    <note place="margin">False lying tongue God hath confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee.</note> and adjoyned himselfe to the Congregation, upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promise then the pretended quarrell, or Religion that was to be set up by them in authority, and so to pervert the whole obedience, and as some of the Congregation at the same time had put into their hands, and taken the Castle of <hi>Brochtie,</hi> put forth the keepers thereof. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately came from the said Duke to her Majestie unlooked for, a Writ, beside many others complaining of the fortification of the said Town of <hi>Leith,</hi> in hurt of the ancient inhabitants thereof, brethren of the said Congregation, whereof he then professed himselfe a Member. And albeit that the Bearer of the said Writ was an unmeet Messenger, in a matter of such consequence, yet her Majestie directed to him two persons of good credit and reputation, with answer; Offering, If he would cause amends to be made for that which was committed against the Lawes of the Realme, to do further then could be craved of reason. And to that effect, to draw some conference, which by his fault and his Colleagues took no end; neverthelesse they continually since continue in their doings,<note place="margin">God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his people of that false accusation.</note> usurping the authority, commanding and charging free Boroughs to chuse Provests and officers of their naming, and to assist to them in the purpose they would be at: and that they will not suffer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision to be brought for sustentation of her Majesties houses. A great part have so plainely set aside all reverence and humanitie, whereby every man may know, That it is no matter of Religion, but a plaine usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the authority: and no doubt but simple men of good Zeale in former times, therewith falsly have been deceived. But as to the Queens part (God who knoweth the secrets of all hearts well knoweth,



<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61872:136"/>
and the world shall see by experience) that the fortification of <hi>Leith</hi> was devised for no other purpose, but for recourse to her highnesse and her company, in case they were pursued. Wherefore, as good Subjects that have the feare of God in their hearts, will not suffer themselves by such vaine perswasions to be led away from their due obedience: but will assist in defence of their Soveraigns quarrell, against all such as shall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the same wrongfully. Therefore her Majestie ordaineth the officers of Arms to passe to the Market-Crosses of all the head Burroughs of this Realme, and there by open Proclamation command and charge all and sundry the Lieges thereof, that none of them take in hand to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in arms, nor take part with the said Duke or his assistaries, under the paine of Treason.</p>

We heartily praise God, who moved the heart of the Earle of <hi>Arran</hi> to joyn himself with us his persecuted brethren. But how malicious a lye it is, That we have promised to set him up in Authority, the issue shall declare: God we take to record, That no such thing hath entred into our hearts, neither yet hath the said Earle, neither any to him appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, moved us unto any such matter: which if they should do, yet are we not so slender in judgement, that inconsiderately we would promise that, which after we would repent.

It is not unknown what enemies those two Towns have, and how gladly would some have all good order and policy overthrown in them. The conjectures that the French-men were of minde shortly to have taken the same place, were not obscrure: but whatsoever they pretended, we cannot repent that we (as said is) have prevented the danger; and would God that power had been in the same manner to have foreclosed their enterprise at <hi>Leith:</hi>

                        </note> she was glad to imploy him for her advantage.

He promised in her name, That she would put away her French-men, and would be ruled by the counsell of naturall Scottish-men: when it was reasoned in his contrary, That if she were so minded to do, she could have found Mediatours a great deale more fit for that purpose.

                           <p>MY duty humbly premised: Your Majesties servant, Master <hi>Robert Lockard,</hi> most instantly hath required me and others to whom your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Letters, as he alleadged, were directed, to receive the same in a secret man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to give him answer accordingly; but because some of the number that he required, were, and are of the great Counsell of this Realme, and therefore are solemnely sworne to have nothing to do in a secret manner, neither with your Majestie, nor with any that cometh from you, or from your Counsell. And so they could not receive your Majesties Letters with such conditions as the said Master <hi>Robert</hi> required, therefore thought he good to take backe to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie againe the said Letters close; And yet because, as he reporteth, he hath made to your Majestie some promise in my name, at his request, I am content to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie by my Letter and Subscription, the sum of that which I did communicate

with him. In <hi>Dondie,</hi> after many words betwixt him and me, I said, That albeit divers sinister reports had been made of me, yet did I never declare any evident token of hatred nor enmity against your Majestie. For if it be the office of a true friend to give true and faithfull counsell to them whom he seeth run to destruction for lack of the same, I could not be proved enemy to your Majestie, but rather a friend unfeigned. For what counsell I had given to your Majestie, my Writings, as well my Letter and Addition to the same, now Printed, as divers others which I wrote from S. <hi>Johnston,</hi> may testifie. I further added, That such an enemy was I unto you, that my tongue did both perswade, and obtaine, That your authority and Regiment should be obeyed of us in all things lawfull, till you declare your selfe open enemy to this Common-wealth, as now, alas, ye have done. This I willed him moreover to say to your Majestie, That if ye follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the counsell of flattering men, having no God but this world and their belly, did proceed in your malice against Christ Iesus his Religion, and true Ministers, that ye should do nothing else but accelerate and hasten Gods plague and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon your selfe and those that followeth you. And that ye (if ye did not change your purpose hastily) should bring your selfe in such extreame danger, that when ye would seek remedy it should not be so easie to be found as it had been before. This is the effect and sum of all that I said at that time, and willed him if he pleased to communicate the same to your Majestie. And the same yet againe I notifie unto your Majestie by this my Letter,</p>

To the which it was answered by one of the Preachers, That time should declare whether he or they were deceived, if she should not declare her selfe enemy to the true Religion which they professed, if ever she had the upper hand, then they would be content to confesse, That they had suspected her sincerity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out just cause. But if she should declare her malice no lesse in times comming then she had done before they required that he should be more moderate, then to condemne them whose conscience he knoweth not, and this was the end of his travell for that time. After that he had troubled the conscience of many godly and quiet persons. For he and others who were her hired postes, ceased not to blow in the eares of all men, That the Queen was heavily dealt with, That she required nothing but obedience to her daughter, That she was content that the true Religion should go forward,<note place="margin">Note how ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies prevail upon the world for a time.</note> and that all abuses should be abolished, and by this mean they brought a grudge and division among our selves.

another thing then Religion, and so ceased to assist us certain dayes, after that we were come to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which we did according to the former Diet the 16 day of October.

                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:61872:140"/>This answer received, credit heard, preconceived malice sufficiently espied, consultation was taken what was expedient to be done. And for the first, it was concluded, That the Herald should be stayed, till further determination should be taken.</p>
                     <p>The whole Nobility,<note place="margin">The order of the suspension of the Queen Regent from Authority within <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </note> Barons and Burgesses then present, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to convene in the Tolbuith of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the same one and twentieth day of October, for deliberation of those matters, where the whole cause being exposed by the Lord <hi>Ruthuen,</hi> the question was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>Whether she that so contemptuously refused the most humble request of the borne Councellors of the Realme, being also but a Regent, whose pretences threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the bondage of the whole Common-wealth, ought to be suffered so tyrannically to domineer over them.</hi> And because that this question had not been before disputed in open assembly, it was thought expedient that the judgement of the Preachers should be required; who being instructed in the case, <hi>Iohn Willock,</hi> who before had sustained the burthen of the Church in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> commanded to speak, made discourse as followeth:</p>
                     <p>Affirming,<note place="margin">The discourse of <hi>Iohn Willock.</hi>
                        </note> first, That albeit Magistrates be Gods Ordinance, having of him Power and Authority, yet is not their Power so largely extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that it is bounded and limited by God in his Word.</p>
                     <p>And secondarily, That as subjects are commanded to obey their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, so are the Magistrates commanded to give some duty to their subjects, so that God by his Word hath prescribed the Office of the one and of the other.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That albeit God hath appointed Magistrates his Lieutenants on earth, and hath honoured them with his own Title, calling them Gods, That yet he did never so firmly establish any, but at his pleasure, he seeing just cause, might deprive them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That in deposing of Princes, and those that have been in Authority, God did not alwayes use his immediate power, but sometimes he useth second means, which his wisedome thought good, and Justice approved: As by <hi>Asa,</hi> he removed <hi>Maacha</hi> his owne mother from Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Authority which before she had used. By <hi>Iehu,</hi> he destroyed <hi>Ioram,</hi> and the whole posterity of <hi>Achab.</hi> And by divers others he hath deposed from Authority those whom before he had established by his own Word. And hereupon concluded he, That sith the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent denied her chief duty to the subjects of this Realme, which was, To minister Justice to them indifferently,<note place="margin">The causes.</note> to preserve their Liberties from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of strangers, and to suffer them to have Gods Word freely and openly preached amongst them. Seeing moreover that the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent was an open and obstinate Idolatresse, a vehement maintainer of all Superstition and Idolatry, as also she openly declares the Countrie to be conquest, and no more free. And finally, That she utterly despiseth the counsell and requests of the Nobility: he could see no reason why they the borne Counsellors, Nobility, and Barons of the Realme might not justly deprive her from all Regiment and Authority amongst them.</p>
                     <p>Hereafter was the judgement of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> required,<note place="margin">The judgment of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> in the deposition of the Queen Regent.</note> who approving the sentence of his brother, added, first, That the iniquity of the Queen Regent and disorder, ought in no wise to withdraw neither

                     <p>And thirdly, he required, That no such sentence should be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against her, but that upon known and open repentance, and upon her conversion to the Common-wealth, and submission to the Nobility, place should be granted unto her of regresse to the same honours from the which for just causes she justly might be deprived.</p>
                     <p>The Votes of every man particularly by himself required, and every man commanded to speak as he would answer to God, what his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence judged in that matter, there was none found amongst the whole number, who did not by his tongue consent to her deprivation.

                                 <p>the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Barons and Burgesses convened, to advise upon the affairs of the Common-wealth, and to ayd, support and succour the same, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and lamenting the enterprised destruction of their said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and overthrow of the liberties of their native Countrey, by the means of the Queen Regent, and certain strangers her privie Counsellors, plain contrary to our Soveraign Lord and Ladies mind, and direct against the counsell of the Nobility, to proceed by little and little, even unto the uttermost ruine; So that the urgent necessity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth may no longer suffer delay, and earnestly craveth our sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Seeing therefore that the said Q. Regent (abusing and overpassing our Soveraigne Lord and Ladies Commission given and granted to her) hath in all her proceedings pursued the Barons and Burgesses within this Realme,<note place="margin">The enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties committed by the Queen Regent.</note> with Weapons and Armour of strangers, without any Processe and order of Law, they being our Soveraigne Lord and Ladies true Lieges, and never called nor convinced of any crime by any judgement lawfull. As first, at S. <hi>Iohnston,</hi> in the moneth of May, she assembled her Army against the Towne, and the Inhabitants thereof, never called nor convinced of any crime, onely because they professed the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, conform to his most sacred Word. 2. And likewise in the moneth of June last, without any order or calling going before, invaded the persons of sundry Noble-men and Barons with force of Armes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened at S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> onely for Cause of Religion, as is notoriously known, they never being called nor convinced of any crime. 3. Again, laid Garrisons the same moneth upon the Inhabitants of the said Town, oppressing the liberties of the Queens true Lieges: For fear of which her Garrisons, a great part of the Inhabitants thereof fled from the Towne, and durst not resort again unto their houses and heritages, untill they were restored by Arms; they notwithstanding never being called nor convinced of any crime. 4. Further, at that same time did thrust in



<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61872:141"/>
upon the heads of the Inhabitants of the said Towne, Provest, and Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs, against all order of Election, as lately in this month of September she had done in other Towns of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> and divers other places, in manifest oppression of our Liberties. 5. declaring her evill minde towards the Nobility, Commonalty, and whole Nation, she hath brought in strangers, and daily pretends to bring in greater force of the same, pretending a manifest Conquest of our native rooms and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as the deed it self declareth; in so far, as she having brought in the said strangers without any advise of Councell and Nobility, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their expresse minde sent to her in Writing, hath placed and planted her said strangers in one of the principall Towns and parts of the Realm, sending continually for greater Forces, willing thereby to suppresse the Common-weale, and liberty of our native Countrey, to make us and our posterity slaves to strangers for ever; which, as it is intolerable to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths and free Countreys, so it is very prejudiciall to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lady and her Heirs whatsoever, in case our Soveraigne Lady de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease without Heirs of her Person. And to performe these her wicked enterprises, conceived (as appeareth) of inveterate malice against our whole Countrey and Nation, caused (without any consent or advise of the Councell and Nobility) to coyn lead Money, so base, and of such quantity, that the whole Realme shall be depauperate, and all Traffique with forraigne Nations everted thereby. 6. Again, she so placeth and maintaineth against the pleasure of the Councell of this Realme, a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in one of the greatest Offices of credit in this Realme, that is in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Great Seal thereof,<note place="margin">Her daughter followed the same, for to <hi>Davie</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Great Seal.</note> wherein great perills may be ingendred to the Common-weale, and Liberty thereof. 7. Further, lately sent the Great Seal forth of this Realme by the said stranger, against the advice of the said Councell, to what effect, God knoweth. 8. And hath also by this means altered the old Law and Custome of this our Realme, ever obser-served in the Graces and Pardons granted bo our Soveraigns to all their Lieges, being repentant of their offences committed against their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties, or the Lieges of the Realme. And hath introduced a new captious stile and form of the said Pardons and Remissions, conform to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of <hi>France,</hi> tending thereby to draw the said Lieges of this Realm, by processe of time, into a deceivable snare, and further shall creep in the whole subversion and alteration of the remanent Laws of this Realme, contrary to the Contents of the Appointment of Marriage. 9. And also Peace being accorded amongst the Princes, retaineth the great Army of strangers, after commandment sent by the King of <hi>France</hi> to retire the same, making excuse that they were retained for the suppressing the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Lieges of this Realme; albeit the whole subjects thereof of all estates,<note place="margin">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61872:142"/>
same to sustain the idle bellies of her strangers; through the which, in all parts rose such heavy lamentation and complaint of the Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, accusing the Counsell and Nobility of their sloth, that as the same op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression we doubt not hath entred in before the Justice Seat of God, so hath it moved our hearts to pity and compassion. And for redresse of the same, with other great offences committed against the publike weale of this Realme, we have convened here as said is: and as oftentimes before have most humbly and with all reverence desired and required the said Queen Regent to redresse the said enormities,<note place="margin">
                                       <hi>Note.</hi>
                                    </note> and especially to remove her strangers from the necks of the poor Commonalty, and to desist from enterprising of fortification of Strengths within this Realme, against the expresse will of the Nobility and Councell of the same; yet we being convened the more strong for fear of her strangers, who we saw presume no other thing, but with Arms to pursue our lives and possessions, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought her to remove the fear of the same, and make the Town Patent to all our Soveraigne Lord and Ladies Lieges. The same in no wise would she grant unto, but when some of our company in peaceable manner went to view the Towne, there was both great and small Munition shot forth at them. And seeing therefore that neither accesse was granted to be used, nor yet she would joyn her self to us to consult upon the Affairs of our Common-wealth, as that we be borne Councellors to the same by anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Laws of the Realme: But fearing lest the judgement of the Counsell would reform, as necessity required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the aforesaid enormities, she refuseth all manner of assistance with us, and by force and violence intendeth to suppresse the Liberties of our Common-weale, and of us the favourers of the same. We therefore, so many of the Nobility, Barons, and Provests of our Boroughs, as are touched with the care of the Common-weale (unto the which we acknowledge our selves, not onely borne, but also sworne Protectors and Defenders, against all and whatsoever invaders of the same) and moved by the foresaid proceedings notorious, and with the lamentable complaint of oppression of our Commonalty, our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low members of the same. Perceiving farther, That the present necessity of our Common-weale may suffer no delay, being convened (as said is) presently in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for support of our Common-weal, and ripely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted and advised, taken the fear of God before our eyes, for the causes foresaid, which are notorious, with one consent and common vote.

We took purpose therefore to retire towards the Towne, and that in haste, left that the former Company of the French should either have invaded the Towne before that we could have come to the rescue thereof, or else have cut us off from the entry of the Abbey of <hi>Halyrud-house</hi>; as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly they had done, if that the Laird of <hi>Grange,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Whitlaw,</hi> with a few Horse-men, had not stayed both their Horse-men and Foot-men. The Company which was next us perceiving that we retired, with speed sent forth their skirmishers, to the number of three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, who took us at a disadvantage, before us having the mire of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starrig</hi> betwixt us and them: and we were enclosed by the Park ditch, so that in no wise we could avoid their shot. The Horse-men followed upon our heels, and slue divers. Our own Horse-men over-rode our Foot-men; and so by reason of the narrownesse of the place, there was no resistance made. The Earle of <hi>Arran,</hi> the Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> in great danger, lighted amongst the Foot-men, exhorting them to have some respect to order, and to the safety of their brethren, whom by their fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they exposed to murther, and so were criminall of their death. Captain <hi>Alexander Halyburnetoun,</hi> a man that feared God, tarried with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his Souldiers behinde, and made resistance, till that he was first shot, and then taken; but being known, those cruell murtherers wounded him in divers parts to the death, and yet as it were by the power of God, he was brought in to the Towne, where in few, but yet most plaine words, he gave Confession of his Faith, testifying, That he doubted

He travelled exceedingly to have retained the Lords together, and most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently laid before their eyes the dangers that might ensue their departing from the Towne: but fear and dolour had so seized the hearts of all, that they could admit no consolation. The Earle of <hi>Arran,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Iames</hi> offered to abide, if any reasonable company would abide with them; but men did so steal away, that the wit of man could not stay them: yea, some of the greatest determined plainly, That they would not abide.

The complaints of the brethren within the Towne of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was lamentable and sore: the wicked then began to spue forth the venome which then lurked in their cankred hearts: The godly, as well those that were departed, as the inhabitants of the Town, were so troubled, that some of them would have preferred death to life at Gods pleasure. For avoiding of danger, it was concluded, That they should depart at midnight. The Duke made provision for his Ordnance, and caused it to be sent before, but the rest was left to the care of the Captain of the Castle, who received it, as well that which appertained to the Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> as that of <hi>Dundie.</hi> The despightfull tongues of the wicked rayled upon us, calling us Traytors and Hereticks; every one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked other to cast stones at us: One cryed, Alas if I might see another defie given;<note place="margin">The despight of the Papists of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

<list>
                                          <item>1. In a Prayer.</item>
                                          <item>2. In the ground whereupon their Prayer was founded.</item>
                                          <item>3. And in the lamentable complaints, and the Vow they made unto God.</item>

                                    <p>Their Prayer was, <hi>That God should convert and turne them, That he should make his face to shine upon them, And that he should restore them to their former dignity.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <list>
                                       <head>The Grounds and Foundations of their Prayers were,</head>
                                       <item>1. That God himself had become Pastor and Governour unto them.</item>
                                       <item>2. That he had taken the protection of them into his own hand.</item>
                                       <item>3. That he had chosen his habitation amongst them.</item>
                                       <item>4. That he had delivered them from Bondage and Thraldome.</item>
                                       <item>5. That he had multiplied and blessed them with many notable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</item>

                                       <head>Upon those two parts he gave these Notes.</head>
                                       <item>First, That the felicity of Gods people may not be measured by any externall appearance; for often it is, That the same people to whom God becometh not onely Creator, but Pastor and Protector, is more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely dealt with, then those Nations where very ignorance and contempt of God raigneth.</item>
                                       <item>Secondly, That God never made his acquaintance and league with one people by his Word,<note place="margin">
                                             <hi>Note.</hi>
                                          </note> but that there he had some of his elect, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they suffered for a time in the midst of the wicked, yet in the end they found comfort, and felt in very experience, that Gods promises are not vaine.</item>
                                       <item>Thirdly, That those prayers were dyted unto the people by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, before they came to the uttermost of trouble, to assure them that God, by whose Spirit the Prayer was dyted, would not contemne the same in the midst of their calamities.</item>
                                    </list>
                                    <p>The third part, containing the lamenable complaint, he treated on in <hi>Sterlin,</hi> in presence of the Duke, and of the whole Councell.</p>
                                    <p>In the exposition thereof, he declared wherfore God in wisedom some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times suffered his chosen Flock to be exposed to mockage and dangers, and to appearing destruction; to wit, That they may feel the vehemency of Gods indignation,<note place="margin">Note dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> That they may know how little strength is in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, That they may leave a testimony to the Generations following, as



<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61872:147"/>
well of the malice of the Devill against Gods people, as of the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous work of God in preserving his little flock by farre other means than man can espie.</p>
                                    <p>In explaning these words, <hi>How long shalt thou be angry, O Lord, against the prayer of thy people</hi>; he declared how dolorous and fearfull it was to fight against that temptation, that God turned away his face from our prayers, for that was nothing else than to comprehend and conceive God to bee armed to our destruction: which temptation no flesh can abide nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, unlesse the mighty Spirit of God interpose himself suddenly.</p>
                                    <p>The example he gave, The impaciency of <hi>Saul,</hi> when God would not hear his prayers.</p>
                                    <p>The difference betwixt the Elect and Reprobate in that Temptation, he plainly declared to be, that the Elect sustained by the secret power of Gods Spirit, did still call upon God, albeit he appeared to contemne their prayers: which (said he) is the sacrifice most acceptable to God, and is in a manner even to fight with God, and to overcome him, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did in wrastling with his Angell.</p>
                                    <p>But the Reprobate (said he) being denyed of their requests at Gods hand, do either cease to pray and contemne God, who straightlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to call upon him in the day of adversitie, or else they seek at the Devill, that which they see they cannot obtain by God.</p>
                                    <p n="2">2. In the second part he declared how hard it was to this corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ours not to rejoyce and put confidence in our selves when God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth victory,<note place="margin">
                                          <hi>Note.</hi>
                                       </note> and therefore how necessary it was that man by affliction should be brought to the knowledge of his own infirmitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> least that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puffed up with vain confidence, he make <hi>an Idoll of his owne strength,</hi> as did King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>He did gravely dispute upon the nature of the blinde world, which in all ages had insolently rejoyced when God did chasten his own children, whose glory and honour because the Reprobate can never see, therefore they despi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                          <desc>•</desc>
                                       </gap>e them, and the wondrous works of God in them. And yet (said he) the joy and rejoycing of the world, is but meer sorrow, because the end of it tendeth to sudden destructon, as the riotous banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Baltasar</hi> declareth, applying these heads to the time and persons (he said) if none of Gods children had suffered before us the same injuries that presently we sustaine, these our troubles would appear intollerable, such is our tender delicacie, and selfe-love of our owne flesh. That these things which we lightly passe over in others, we can greatlie complaine of, if they touch our selves.</p>
                                    <p>I doubt not but that some of us have ofter then once read this Psalme, as also that we have read and heard the travell and troubles of our anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers. But which of us, either in reading or hearing their dolours and temptations did so discend into our selves that we felt the bitternesse of their passions? I think none. And therefore hath God brought us to some experience in our own persons.</p>
                                    <p>But yet because the matter may appear obscure, unlesse it be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applyed; I cannot in conscience but use such plainnesse as God

shall grant unto me. Our faces are this day confounded, our enemies triumph, our hearts have quaked for fear, and yet they remain oppressed with sorrow and shame. But what shall we think to be the very cause that God hath thus dejected us;<note place="margin">

                                       </note> if I shall say, Our sins, and former unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse unto God, I speak the truth, but yet I speak more generally then the present necessity requireth: For when the sins of men are rebuked in generall, seldome it is that man descendeth within himself, accusing and condemning in himself that which most displeaseth God; but rather he doubteth that to be a cause, which before God is no cause indeed. For example, The Israelites fighting against the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> were twice discomfited with the losse of 40000 men. They lamented and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed both first and last; but we finde not that they came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their offence and sin which was the cause that they fell by the edge of the sword, but rather they doubted that to have been a cause of their misfortune, which God had commanded, for they asked, Shall we go and fight any more against our brethren the sonnes of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> By which question it is evident, That they supposed that the cause of their overthrow and discomfite was, Because they had lifted the sword against their brethren and naturall Countrey-men: And yet the expresse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God that was given unto them, did deliver them from all crime in that cause. There is no doubt, but that there was some cause in the Israelites that God gave them so over into the hands of these wicked men, against whom he sent them, by his own expresse Commandment, to execute his Judgements. Such as do well mark the History, and the estate of that people, may easily see the cause why God was offended: All the whole people had declined from God,<note place="margin">Let <hi>Scotland</hi> yet take heed.</note> Idolatry was maintained by the common consent of the multitude, and, as the Text saith, <hi>Every man did that which appeared good in his own eyes.</hi> In this mean time the Levite complained of the villany that was done unto himself, and unto his wife, which oppressed by the <hi>Benjamites</hi> of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> died under their filthy lusts: which horrible fact enflamed the hearts of the whole people to take vengeance upon that abomination (and therein they offended) but in this they failed, That they go to execute judgement against the wicked without any repentance, or remorse of conscience of their owne former offences, and defection from God. And farther, Because they were a great multitude, and the other were far inferiour unto them: They trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their own strength, and thought themselves able enough to do their purpose, without any invocation of the Name of God: But after that they had twice proved the vanity of their own strength, they fasted and prayed; and being humbled before God, they received a more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble answer, and assured promise of the Victory. The like may be amongst us, albeit suddenly we do not espie it: And to the end that every man may the better examine himself, I will divide the whole company into two sorts of men. The one are those that from the beginning of this trouble have sustained the common danger with their brethren: The other be these which be joyned to our fellowship. In the one and in the other I fear that just cause shall be found, why God should thus have humbled us. And albeit that this appear strange at the first hearing, yet if



<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61872:148"/>
every man shall examine himself, I speak as that his conscience dyteth him, I doubt not but he shall subscribe to my sentence. Let us begin at our selves who longest hath continued in this Battell. When we were a few number in comparison of our enemies, when we had neither Earle nor Lord (a few excepted) to comfort us, we called upon God, and took him for our Protector, Defence, and onely Refuge. Amongst us was heard no bragging of multitude, nor of our strength nor policy, we did onely sob to God to have respect to the equity of our Cause, and to the cruell pursuit of the tyrannicall enemy. But since that our number had been thus multiplied, and chiefly since the Duke with his friends have been joyned with us, there was nothing heard, but, <hi>This Lord will bring these many hundred Speares; This man hath the credit to perswade this Countrey; If this Earle be ours, no man in such bounds will trouble us.</hi> And thus the best of us all, that before felt Gods potent hand to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, hath of late dayes put Flesh to be our Arme. But wherein yet had the Duke and his friends offended?<note place="margin">Let janglers and inconstant m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                          </gap>n note.</note> It may be, That as we have trusted in them, so have they put too much confidence in their owne strength. But granting it be not so, I see a cause most just, why the Duke and his friends should thus be confounded amongst the rest of their brethren. I have not yet forgotten what was the dolour and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of my owne heart, when at Saint <hi>Iohnston, Cooper-Moure,</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh Craigs,</hi> those cruell murtherers that now hath put us to this dishonour, threatned our present destruction; The Duke and his friends at all three Journeys was to them a great comfort, and unto us a great discouragement: For his name and authority did more astonish us, then did the force of the other; yea, without his assistance, they could not have compelled us to appoint with the Queen upon so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall Conditions. I am certaine, if the Duke hath unfainedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of that his assistance to those murtherers unjustly pursuing us: yea, I am certaine, if he hath repented of the innocent blood of Christs blessed Martyrs which was shed by his fault: But let it be, that so he hath done (as I hear that he hath confessed his offence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords and Brethren of the Congregation) yet I am assured, That neither he,<note place="margin">Le the House of <hi>Hamilton</hi> remember this.</note> neither yet his friends, did feel before this time the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and grief of hearts which we felt, when their blinde fury pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; and therefore hath God justly permitted both them and us to fall into this confusion at once; us, for that we put our trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in man;<note place="margin">

Resteth that both they and we turn to the Eternall our God (who beateth down to death, to the intent that he may raise up again to leave the remembrance of his wonderous deliverance, to the praise of his owne Name) which if we do unfainedly, I no more doubt but that this our dolour, confusion, and fear, shall be turned into joy, honour, and boldnesse, then that I doubt that God gave Victory to the <hi>Israelites</hi> over the <hi>Benjamites,</hi>

Whereupon the Nobility assembled at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and returned answer with diligence; Whereof the French adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they marched to <hi>Linlithquow,</hi> spoiled the Dukes house, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted his lands of <hi>Kinneill,</hi> and after came to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained certaine dayes (the Duke, the Earles of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Glencarn,</hi> with their friends passed to <hi>Glasgow.</hi> The Earle of <hi>Arrane</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames</hi> passed to Saint <hi>Andrews.</hi> For charge was given to the whole No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility Protestants, to keepe their owne bodies, till that God should send them further support.) The French tooke purpose first to assault <hi>Fyfe,</hi> for as it was their great indignation. Their purpose was to have taken and fortified the Towne and Abbey, with the Castle of Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> and so they came to <hi>Culrosse,</hi> after to <hi>Dunfermeling,</hi> and then to <hi>Brunteiland,</hi> where they began to fortifie: but desisted there from, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> upon the occasion as followeth. When certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge came to the Earl of <hi>Arrane</hi> and to Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> That the French were departed from <hi>Sterlin,</hi> they departed also from S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and began to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble their Forces at <hi>Cowper,</hi> and sent their men of War to <hi>Kinghorne,</hi> unto whom there resorted divers of the coast side, of minde to resist rather at the beginning, then when they had destroyed a part of their Townes. But the Lords had given an expresse commandment, That they should hazard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, till that they themselves were present. And for that purpose was sent unto them the Lord <hi>Ruthuen,</hi> a man of great experience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to few in stoutnesse: In his company was the Earle of <hi>Sudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> sent from the Earle of <hi>Huntly,</hi> as he alleadged, to comfort the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their affliction. But others whispered, That his principall Commission was unto the Queen Regent.<note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Sudderland</hi> shot</note> Howsoever it was, he was hurt in the arme by the shot of an Haquebut, for the men of War and the rascall multitude, perceiving certaine Boats of French-men landing, which came from <hi>Leith,</hi> purposed to stop their landing, and so not considering the enemies that approached from <hi>Brunteiland:</hi> unadvisedly they rushed downe to the <hi>Pretticure</hi> (so is that Bay by West <hi>Kinghorne</hi> called) and at the sea coast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the skirmishing. But they never took heed to the enemy that approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by land, till that the horsemen charged them upon the backe, and the whole bands came directly in their faces, and so were they compelled to give back with the losse of six or seven of their men, and with the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of some, amongst whom were two that professed Christ Jesus, one named <hi>Paul Lambert,</hi> a Dutch man, and a French boy, fervent in Religion, and clean of life, whom in despight they hanged over the Steeple of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne.</hi> Thou shalt revenge, O Lord, in thy appointed time. The cause that

in so great a danger there was so small a losse, next unto the mercifull providence of God, was the sudden coming of my Lord <hi>Ruthuen</hi>; for even as our men had given back, he and his Company came to the head of the Bray, and did not onely stay the French-men, but also some of ours brake upon their Horse-men, and so repulsed them, that they did no further hurt to our Foot-men. In that recounter was the Earle of <hi>Sudderland</hi> foresaid shot in the arme, and was carried back to <hi>Cowper.</hi> The French-men took <hi>Kinghorne,</hi> where they lay and wasted the Country about,<note place="margin">Note the French favour to their friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Queen Regent proud of this Victory, burst forth into her blasphemous railing, and said, <hi>Where is now</hi> John Knox <hi>his God? my God is now stronger then his, yea even in Fyfe.</hi> She posted to her friends in <hi>France</hi> newes that thousands of the hereticks were slain, and the rest were fled, and therefore required that some Noble-man of her friends would come and take the glory of that Victory.

                  <p>The Lords of the Congregation offended at the foolishnesse of the rascall multitude, called to themselves the men of War, and remained certaine dayes at <hi>Cowper,</hi> unto whom repaired <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> and in our greatest desperation Preached unto us a most comfortable Sermon: his Text was,<note place="margin">John 6.</note>

He kept not himselfe

These and the like sentences took the said Earle to be spoken in reproach of him, because he kept himself more close and solitary then many men would have wished. After these things, determination was taken, That the Earle of <hi>Arrane,</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> with men of War, and some Companies of Horse-men, should go to <hi>Disert,</hi> and there lie to wait upon the French, to stop them from destroying the Sea-coast, as they intended utterly to have done. The said Earle, and Lord <hi>Iames</hi> did as they were appointed, albeit their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was very small; and yet they did so valiantly, that it passed almost credit; for twenty and one dayes they lay in their clothes, their Boots came never off: They had skirmishing almost every day, yea, some days from morning to night. The French were four thousand Souldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their favourers and faction of the Countrey. The Lords were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver together five hundred Horse-men, with an hundred Souldiers, and yet they held the French so busie, that for every horse was slain to the Congregation, they lost four French Souldiers. <hi>William Kirkcaldie</hi> of <hi>Grainge,</hi> the day after that his house was cast down, sent his defiance to Monsieur <hi>Dosell,</hi> and unto the rest, declaring that to this hour he had used the French favourably, yea he had saved their lives, when that he might have suffered their throats to have been cut; but seeing they had used him with that rigour, let them not look for the like favours in time to come. And unto Monsieur <hi>Dosell</hi> he said, He knew that he should not get him in skirmishing, because he knew he was a very coward: but it might that he should quite him a common either in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or else in <hi>France.</hi> The said <hi>William Kirkcaldie,</hi> and the Master of <hi>Lindsay,</hi> escaped many dangers. The Master had his horse slain under him; and <hi>William</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most betrayed in his house at <hi>Halyards.</hi> But yet they never ceased, for night and day they waited upon the French: They laid themselves in a secret place with some Gentlemen before the day to wait upon the French, who used commonly to issue in Companies to seel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Master struck with his Spear at <hi>la Bartu,</hi> and glasing upon his harnesse, for fear stumbled upon his knees; but recovering suddenly, he fastned his Spear, and bare the

said Captain backward, who because he would not be taken, was slain, and fifty of his Company with him. Those that were in the house, with some others, were saved, and sent to <hi>Dundie</hi> to be kept. This mischance to the French-men,<note place="margin">The slaughter of a French Captain, with his Band.</note> made them to be more circumspect in straying and wandring abroad into the Countrey, and so the poor people gat some relief. To fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the French with Victualls, was appointed Capt. <hi>Culan,</hi> with two ships, who travelled betwixt the South shore and <hi>Kinghorne</hi> for that purpose: For his wages he spoyled <hi>Kinghorne, Kirkcaldie,</hi> and so much of <hi>Disert</hi> as he might. For remedy whereof, were appointed two Ships from <hi>Dundie, Andrew Sands,</hi> a very stout and fervent man in the Cause of Religion, was the principall. This same time arrived <hi>Martickes,</hi> who without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay landed himself, the Coffers, and the principall Gentlemen that were with him, at <hi>Leith,</hi> leaving the rest in the Ships till better opportunity: But the said <hi>Andrew</hi> and his company striking Sayl,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and making as they would cast Ankor hard beside them, boarded them both, and carried them to <hi>Dundie</hi>: in them were gotten some horses, and much harnesse, with some other trifles, but of money we heard nought. Hereat the French offended, avowed the destruction of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundie,</hi> and so upon a Munday in the morning, the thirteenth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> they marched from <hi>Disert,</hi> and passed the water of <hi>Levin,</hi> ever keeping the Coast, by reason of their Ships and Victualls, as said is: about noon they espied Ships (which were seen that morning by us that were upon the land, but were not known) Monsieur <hi>Dosell</hi> affirmed them to be French Ships, and so the Souldiers triumphed, shot their Volley for a salve, and marched forward to <hi>Kingcraig,</hi> fearing no resistance. But shortly after, the English Ships met with Captain <hi>Culen,</hi> and seized upon him and his Ships, which made them a little to muse. Then suddenly came M. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Woode,</hi> who had been upon the Admirall, and assured Monsieur <hi>Dosell</hi> that they were English men,<note place="margin">The arrivall of the English Ships.</note> and that they were the forwarners of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number that followed, who were sent for support of the Congregation. There might have been seen pulling of beards for anger, and might have been heard such despight as cruell men use to spue forth when God bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth their fury.<note place="margin">

And therefore betimes in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they retired towards <hi>Kinghorne,</hi> and made more expedition in one day in returning, then they did in two in marching forward. The storm which had continued neer the space of a moneth, brake in the time of their returning, whereby many thought that they should have been stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till that reasonable company might have been assembled to have foughten with them. And for that purpose did <hi>William Kirkcaldie</hi> cut the Bridge of <hi>Tullibody</hi>:<note place="margin">The Bridge of <hi>Tullibody.</hi>
                     </note> But the French, expert enough in such feats, took down the Roof of a Parish Church, and made a Bridge over the same water called <hi>Donane,</hi> and so they escaped, and went to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and thereafter to <hi>Leith</hi>; yet in their returne they lost divers, amongst whom



<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61872:152"/>
there was one whose miserable end we may rehearse. As the French spoyled the Countrey in their returning, one Captaine or Souldier, we cannot tell, but he had a red Cloke, and a gilt Murriow, entred upon a poor woman that dwelt in the white side, and began to spoyle. The poore woman offered unto him such bread as she had ready prepared, But he in no wise therewith content, would have the Meale, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle salt Beef which the poore woman had to sustain her owne life, and the lives of her poor children; neither could tears, nor pitifull words, mitigate the mercilesse man, but he would have whatsoever he might carry.<note place="margin">Note the death of a plunderer.</note> The poore woman perceiving him so bent, and that he stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe in her Tub, for the taking forth of such stuffe as was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, first coped and turned up his heels, so that his head went downe. And thereafter, whether by her self, or if any other company come to help her, but there he ended his unhappy life, God so punishing his cruell heart, who could not spare a miserable woman in that extremity. <hi>Let all such Souldiers receive such reward, O Lord, seeing that thou onely art the revenger of the oppressed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, because that from this time forward frequent mention will be made of the comfortable support that we in our greatest extremity received by Gods providence from our neighbours of <hi>England,</hi> we thinke it expedient simply to declare by what instruments that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was first moved,<note place="margin">Remark the Scots acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the English help.</note> and by what means it came to passe that the Queen and Councel of <hi>England,</hi> shewed themselves so favourable unto us.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> had fore-warned us by his Letters from <hi>Geneva,</hi> of all dangers that he foresaw to ensue our enterprise; so when he came to <hi>Deipe,</hi> mindefull of the same; and resolving with himself, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy God would please to offer, he took boldnesse to write to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cecil,</hi> Secretary of State in <hi>England,</hi> with whom the said <hi>Iohn</hi> had been before familiarly acquainted, intending thereby to renew acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and so to open further of his minde.

                              </note>AS I have no pleasure with long writing to trouble you (Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) whose minde I know to be taken up with most grave matters, so I minde not greatly to labor by long Preface, to conciliate your favors, which I suppose I have already (howsoever rumors brute the contrary) as the favour it becometh one member of Christs Body to have of another: The contents therfore of my present Letter shall be absolved in 2 points: In the former, I purpose to discharge in few words my conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you: And in the other, sum what must I speak, for my own defence, and in defence of that poor Flock of late assembled in the most godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church and City of the world, <hi>Geneva:</hi> To you, Sir, I say, that as from God you have received, life, wisdom, honours, and the present estate in the which you now stand, so ought you wholly to apply the same to the advancement of his glory, who onely is the author of life, the fountain of wisdom, and who most assuredly doth and wil honor &amp; glorifie them that

with simple hearts do glorifie him; which alas in times past you have not done, but being overcome with common iniquity, you have followed the world, in the way of perdition: for to the suppressing of Christs true Evangel, to the erecting of Idolatry, and to the shedding of the blood of Gods most deare Children; Have you by silence consented and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed this your most horrible defection from the knowne Trueth, and once professed, hath God to this day mercifully spared? Yea, to mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath utterly forgotten, and pardoned the same: He hath not dealt with you as he hath done with others (of like knowledge) whom in his anger (but yet most justly according to their deserts) he did shortly strike after their desertion: But you, guilty in the same offences, hath he fostered and preserved, as it were in his owne bosome, during the time of that most miserable thraldome, of that professed enemy of God, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous <hi>Mary:</hi> And now hath set you at such liberty, as the fury of Gods enemies cannot hurt you, except that willingly against his honour, you take pleasure to conspire with them. As this benefit which you have received is great, so must Gods Justice require of you a thankfull heart; For seeing that his Mercie hath spared you, being Traitour to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie; Seeing further, That amongst your enemies he hath preserved you; And last, seeing, although worthy of hell, he hath promoted you to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity; of you must he require (because he is just) earnest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for your former defection; and heart mindfull of his mercifull providence, and a will so ready to advance his glory, That evidently it may appeare,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Note.</hi>
                              </note> that in vaine you have not received these graces of God; to performance whereof, of necessity it is, That carnall wisdome and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly policie (to the which both, you are bruted too much inclined) give place to Gods simple and naked Trueth: very love compells me to say, That except the Spirit of God purge your heart from that venome, which your eyes have seen to have been destruction to others, that you shall not long escape the reward of dissemblers. Call to minde what your eares heard Proclaimed, in the Chappell of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> when this Verse of the first Psalme was handled, <hi>Not so, O wicked, not so, but as the dust which the winde tosseth, &amp;c.</hi> And consider, that now you travell in the same way which then they did occupie, to speak plainely, now you are in that estate and credit, in the which you shall either comfort the sorrowfull and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for righteousnesse sake, or else you shall molest or oppugne the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God speaking in his Messengers; the Comforters of the afflicted for godlinesse, hath promise of comfort, in their greatest necessities: but the troubles of Gods servants (how contemned that ever they appeare before the world) are threatned to have their Names in execration to the posterities following. The examples of the one and of the other, are not onely evident in Scriptures, but also have been lately manifested in <hi>England.</hi> And this is the conclusion of that, which to your self, I say, except that in the cause of Christs Evangell, you be found simple, sincere, fervent, and unfained, you shall taste of the same cup, which politick heads have drank in before you.</p>
                           <p>The other Point concerning my self, and that poore flock now disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and as I heare say, rudely used, is this; By divers Messengers I



<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61872:153"/>
have requested such Priviledges as Turkes commonly do grant to men of every Nation; to wit, That liberty should be granted to me freely to passe through <hi>England,</hi> to the end that with greater expedition I might repaire towards my owne Countrey, which now beginneth to thirst for Christs Trueth. This request I thought so reasonable, that almost I had entered the Realme, without license demanded; and yet I understand that it hath been so rejected, that the soliciters thereof, did hardly escape im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment; and some of that poore flocke I heare to be so extreamely handled, That those who most rudely have shed the blood of Gods most deare Children findes this day amongst you greater favours,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Note.</hi>
                              </note> then they do; Alas, this appeareth much to repugne to Christian Charity: for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been mine offence, this I fear not to affirme in their cause; That if any that hath suffered exile in those most dolorous dayes of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deserve praise and commendation, for Peace, Concord, sober and quiet living, it is they. And as for me, how criminall that ever I be in Gods presence, for the multitude of my sins; yet before his Justice-seat I have a testimonie of a cleare Conscience, That since my first acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>England,</hi> willingly I never offended person within it, except in open Chaire, to reprove that which God condemneth, can be judged of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: but I have (say you) written a Treasonable Book against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment and Empire of women; If that be my offence, the poore flock is innocent (except such as this day do fastest cry Treason) For Sir (in Gods presence I do write) with none in that company did I consult be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the finishing of the same. Therefore in Christs Name I require, That the blame may be upon me alone. The writing of that Book I will not deny, but to prove it Treasonable, I think it shall be hard; for Sir, No more do I doubt of the Trueth of my Proposition, then that I doubt that this was the voice of God, which first did pronounce this penaltie against women; <hi>In dolour shalt thou beare thy children.</hi> It is bruited, That my book is, or shall be written against, or answered: If so be Sir, I greatly feare, That flatterers shall more hurt then helpe the matter which they would seem to maintaine; for except my errour be plainly shewne and confuted, by better authority then by such Lawes as from yeere to yeere may and do change, I dare not promise silence in so weighty a businesse; lest that in so doing, I shall appeare to betray the Verity which is not subject to the mutabilitie of time. And if any thinke me either enemy to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or yet to the Regiment of her, whom God hath now promoted, they are utterly deceived in me, for the miraculous Work of God, comforting his afflicted by an infirme vessell, I do acknowledge, and I will obey the power of his most potent hand (raising up whom best pleaseth his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to suppresse such as fight against his glory) albeit that both nature, and Gods most perfect Ordinance repugne to such Regiment. More plainly to speak, If Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> shall confesse, That the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary dispensation of Gods great mercy, makes that lawfull unto her, which both nature and Gods Lawes do deny unto all women; then shall none in <hi>England</hi> be more willing to maintaine her lawfull authority then I shall be: But if (Gods wondrous worke set aside) she ground (as God forbid) the justnesse of her Title upon consuetude Lawes and Ordinances



<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61872:153"/>

Alas, Sir, is my offence (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in that time, and in that matter, I had written ten Bookes) so hainous, that I cannot have Licence, by Preaching of Christ Jesus, to refresh those thirsty soules, which long have lacked the Water of Life: No man will I presently accuse, but I greatly feare, That <hi>the Leprous have no gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <head>The first Letter to Sir <hi>William Cecill,</hi> from the Lords of the Congregation.</head>
                           <p>THe contents of a Letter directed by you (right Worshipfull) to Sir <hi>Henry Percie,</hi> was notified unto us by Master <hi>Kirkcaldie</hi> of <hi>Grange</hi> this Sunday the 26 of July:<note place="margin">1559.</note> By the which we perceive that the said Laird of <hi>Grange,</hi> of zeale, and faithfull heart which he beareth to the furtherance of this our great, and before the world, dangerous enterprise, hath travelled with you, as with an unfained favourer of Christs true Religion, and of the libertie of our Countrey, for knowledge of your mindes towards us, in case that we be assaulted by any forraigne invasion, or greater power then we be well able to resist. Your comfortable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this question we have considered, to our joy and comfort, as also your motions,<note place="margin">Note the Quaeres.</note> and what you demand; To wit, What the Protestants within this Realme do purpose; To what end we mean to direct our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; How we will, and how we be able to accomplish the same; What doubts we have of any adversary power; And finally, in case that support should be sent from you, What manner of amity might ensue betwixt these two Realmes,<note place="margin">And Answers.</note> &amp;c. To the which, in briefe, we answer; That our whole and onely purpose (as God knoweth) is to advance the glory of Christ Jesus, the true Preaching of his Gospel within this Realme. To remove superstition, and all sort of externall Idolatry, to bridle to our powers the fury of those that heretofore have cruelly shed the blood of our brethren; and to our uttermost, to maintaine the liberty of this our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from the tyrannie and thraldome of strangers, as God shall assist us. How we be able to accomplish these premises, is to us unknown, onely our hope is good, That he that hath begun this good worke in us, and hath by his power to this houre confounded the faces of our adversaries will performe the same to his glory,<note place="margin">Let the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies say, if their hope be not frustrate.</note> which chiefly we seek in this our enterprise. Because we suppose, That neither our present danger, neither yet the warlike preparation which <hi>France</hi> maketh against us, are hid from you, nor from the counsell, we omit that part. As touching the assurance of a perpetuall amity to stand betwixt these two Realmes: As no earthly thing of us is more desired, so crave we of God to make us the instruments, by which this unnaturall debate which long hath continued betwixt us may once be composed,<note place="margin">Note dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> to the praise of Gods Name, and to the comfort of the faithfull in both Realms.



<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61872:154"/>
And if your wisedoms can foresee and devise the means and assurances how the same may be brought to passe, perswade your selves not onely of our consent and assistance, but also of our constancy, as men can promise, unto our lives end. Yea farther, of charge and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by us to be left to our posterity, That the Amity betwixt us (in God) contracted and begun, may be by them kept inviolate for ever. As for the revolting from you to <hi>France,</hi> which ye seem to fear and suspect at their pleasure, we utterly abhorre that infidelity; for now doth the voyce of God continually sound in our ears, That such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the terrible and reverent Name of God, shall not escape ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Our Confederacy, Amity and League shall not be like the Pactions made by worldly men, for worldly profit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as we require it for Gods Cause, so will we call upon his Name for the observation of the same. Moreover, if we should lack any thing in Temporall commodity, yet should we never have occasion to returne to them: for we now perceive and feel the weight of their yoke, and intend (by Gods grace) to cut away such instruments as by whom this Realme was before abused. True it is, That as yet we have made no mention of any change in Authority, neither yet were we minded to do any such thing, till extreme necessity compelleth us thereto. But seeing it is now more then evident, That <hi>France,</hi> and the Queen Regent here, with her Priests, pretendeth nothing but the suppressing of Christs Gospel, the ruine of us, and the subversion of this poor Realme, committing our innocency to God, and unto the judgement of all godly and wise men, we are determined to seek the next remedy; in which we hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require your counsell and assistance. And thus farre we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprised to make you participant of our purpose, because in the said Letters ye required the said Master <hi>Kirkcaldie</hi> some farther assurance then his owne word or writing, which we doubt not but ye shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive, from more then from us. We dare not hastily make the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, neither of Nobles,<note place="margin">

And thus, after our most humble commendations to the Queenes Majestie (whose Raigne we wish may be prosperous and long, to the glory of God, and comfort of his Church) we heartily commit you to the protection of the Omnipotent.</p>

                              <salute>SIR,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>AFter my humble commendations, please you deliver this other enclosed to the Queen: It containeth a few and simple words of my Confession what I think of her Authority, how it is just, and what may make it odious in Gods presence. I hear that there is one Confutation set forth against the first blast; God grant that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof have no more sought the favours of this present world, no lesse the glory of God, and the stable good of his Countrey, then he who enterprised in that blast to utter his conscience. When I shall have time (which now is somewhat precious unto me) to peruse that work, I will communicate my judgement with you.</p>
                           <p>The time is now, Sir, that all, who either thirst for Christ to raigne in this Isle, or yet the hearts of the Inhabitants be joyned together in love unfained, ought rather to study how the same might be brought to passe, then vainly to travell for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of that, whereof already we have seen the danger, and feel the smart: If the most part of women be wicked, and such as willingly we would not should raigne over us: And if the most godly, and such as have are graces, be yet mortall, we ought to take heed, lest in establishing of one judged godly, and profitable to her Countrey, we make an Interest and Title to many; by whom not onely will the Truth be impugned, but also will the Countrey be brought into bondage. God give you, and other favourers of your Countrey eyes to see, and wisedome to avoid the dangers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</p>
                           <p>By divers Letters I have required license to have visited the North parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but as yet I have received no favourable answer. The longer, Sir, this it be delayed, the lesse comfort will the faithfull there receive; yea, the weaker will the Queens favour be: If I were not an unfained friend to her Majestie, I would instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beg such liberty; which to me, I know, will neither be profitable nor pleasing in the flesh. The common things here, I doubt not you know: some things I have (as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times I have written) which gladly I would communicate, but I minde not to commit them to Paper and Inke; finde therefore the means that I may speake with such a one as you will credit in all things.</p>

                           <p>AS your Majesties displeasure against me, most unjustly conceived, hath been and is to my wretched heart a burden grievous, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most



<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61872:155"/>
intolerable, so is the testimony of a clear conscience to me a stay and uphold, that I sinke not in despair, how vehement soever the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations appear: For in Gods presence, my conscience beareth me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, That maliciously, nor of purpose, I never offended your Majesty, nor your Realme: And therefore, howsoever I be judged of man, I am sure to be absolved of him, who onely knoweth the secrets of hearts. I cannot deny the writing of a Book against the usurped Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and unjust Regiment of Women; neither yet am I minded to recant, or call back any principall Point or Proposition of the same, till truth and verity do further appear. But why that your Majesty, or any such, who unfainedly favour the liberty of <hi>England,</hi> be offended at the Author of such a Work, I can perceive no just occasion: For first, my Book touched not your Majesties Person in speciall, neither is it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to any Liberty of the Realme, if the time of my writing be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently considered. How could I be enemy to your Majesties Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for delivery whereof, I did more studie, and undertake further, then any of those who now accuseth me? And as concerning your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, How could or can I envy that? which most I have wished for, and for which (as my weak memory will suffer) I render thanks unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly to God, to wit, That it hath pleased him of his eternall goodnesse to exalt your head (which sometime was in danger) to the manifestation of his glory, and extirpation of Idolatry. And as for my offence, which I have committed against <hi>England,</hi> either by writing that Book, or by any other work, I will not refuse that moderate and indifferent men judge and discerne betwixt me, and those that accuse me, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether of the parties do most hurt to the Liberty of <hi>England:</hi> I, who affirme that no woman may be exalted above any Realme, to make the Liberty of the same thrall, and subject to a strange, proud, and cruell Nation: Or they, that approve whatsoever pleaseth Princes for the time. If I were as well disposed to accuse, as some of them (to their own shame) have declared themselves, I nothing doubt, but that in few words I should let reasonable men understand, That some that this day lowly crouch and bow to your Majestie, and labour to make me odious in your eyes, did in your adversity neither shew themselves faithfull friends to your Majesty, neither yet so loving and carefull of the native Countrey, as they would be esteemed. But omitting the accusation of others, for my owne purgation, and your Majesties satisfaction, I say, That nothing contained in my book, is or can be prejudiciall to your Majesties just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, providing that you be not found ungrate unto God, ungrate you will be proved in the presence of his Throne (howsoever that flatterers justifie your fact) if you transfer the glory of that honour in which you now stand, to any other thing, then to the dispensation of his mercy, which onely maketh that lawfull to your Majestie, which Nature and Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth to all women, to command and bear rule over men. Neither would I that your Majesty should fear, That this your humiliation before God, should in any case infirm or weaken your Majesties just and lawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; Nay, Madame, such unfained confession of Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits received, will be the establishment of the same, not only to your self,



<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61872:156"/>
but also to your seed and Posterity: Where contrariwise, a proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and elevation of your self, will be the occasion that your Raigne will be unstable, troublesome, and short. God is witnesse, That unfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I both love and reverence you Majestie; yea, I pray that your Raigne may be both prosperous and quiet, and that for the quietnesse which Christs Members, before persecuted, have received under you. But yet if I should flatter your Majesty, I were no friend, but a deceivable tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and therefore in conscience I am compelled to say, That neither the consent of the people, the processe of time, nor multitude of men, can establish a Law which God shall approve; but whatsoever he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by his Eternall Word, that shall be approved, and stay constantly firme; and whatsoever he condemneth, shall be condemned, though all men on earth should travell for the justification of the same. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Madame, the onely way to retain and keep the benefits of God, abundantly of late dayes poured upon you and your Realme, is unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to render unto God, to his mercy, and undeserved grace, the whole glory of this your exaltation, forget your Birth, and all Title which hereupon doth hang; and consider deeply, How for fear of your life you did decline from God, and bow to Idolatry, going to Masse under your sister <hi>Mary</hi> her persecution of Gods Saints: Let it not appear a small offence in your eyes, That you have declined from Christ Jesus, in the day of your Battel: Neither yet would I that you should esteem that mercy to be vulgar and common which you have received, <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath covered your offence, Hath preserved your Person, when you were most unthankfull; And in the end, has exalted and raised you up, not onely from the dust, but also from the ports of death; to rule above his people, for comfort of his Kirk. It appertaineth to you therefore, to ground the justice of your Authority, not on that Law, which from yeer to yeer doth change, but upon the eternall providence of him, who contrary to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary course of Nature,<note place="margin">

                              </note> and without your deserving, hath exalted your head: If thus in Gods presence you humble your self; as in my heart I glorifie God for that rest granted to his afflicted Flock within <hi>England,</hi> under you a weak Instrument; so will I with tongue and pen justifie your Authority and Regiment, as the holy Ghost hath justified the same in <hi>Deborah,</hi> that blessed Mother in <hi>Israel.</hi> But if you neglect (as God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) these things, and shall begin to brag of your Birth, and to build your Authority and your Regiment upon your own Law; flatter you who so listeth, your felicity shall be short. Interpret my words in the best part, as written by him, who is no enemy to your Majestie. By divers Letters I have required to visite your Realme, not to seek my self, neither yet my own ease and benefit: which if you now refuse and deny me, I must remit my cause to God, adding this for conclusion, that commonly it is seen, <hi>That such as refuse the counsel of the faithfull (appear it never so sharp) are compelled to follow the deceit of flatterers to their own perdition.</hi>

Within a day or two after the departing of the said <hi>Alexander,</hi> there came a Letter from Sir <hi>Henry Percie</hi> to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> requiring him to meet him at <hi>Annick</hi> the third day of August, for such affaires as he would not write nor yet communicate with any, but with the said <hi>Iohn</hi> himselfe, while he was preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for the journey (for Secretary <hi>Cecill</hi> had appointed to have met him at <hi>Stampford</hi>) the French-men furiously came forth of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> of purpose to have surprised the Lords being in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as in the second Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is declared, which stayed the journey of the said <hi>Iohn,</hi> till that God had delivered the innocents from that great danger, and then was he sent, having in his company M. <hi>Robert Hamilton,</hi> Minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, directed from the Lords with full Commission and Instructions to decline their whole case and estate wherein they stood. Their passage was from <hi>Pittenweame</hi> by sea, they arrived at <hi>Holy-Iland,</hi> and being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised that Sir <hi>Henry Percie</hi> was absent from the North; They addressed themselves to Sir <hi>Iames Crofts,</hi> then Captain of <hi>Barwick,</hi> and Warden of the East Marches of <hi>England.</hi> They shewed unto him their Credit and Commission; He received them courteously, and comforted them with his faithfull Counsell,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iames Crofts</hi> counsell.</note> which was, That they should travell no further, neither yet should they be seen in publike, and that for divers considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. First, The Queen Regent had her spies in <hi>England.</hi> Secondly, The Queen and the Councell that favoured our faction, would that all things should be secret so long as they might. And last, said he, I think it not expedient, that in such rarity of Preachers, ye two be any long time absent from the Lords of the Congregation. And therefore (said he) ye shall do best to commit to writing your whole minde and Credit, and I shall promise to you upon my honour, to have answer at you, and at the Lords again, before that ye your selves can be at <hi>London.</hi> And where that your Letters cannot expresse all things so fully, as your presence could, I shall supply the same, not onely by my pen, but also by my own presence, to such as will informe the Councell sufficiently of all things. The said <hi>Iohn</hi> and M. <hi>Robert</hi> followed his Councell (for it was faithfull, and proceeded of love at that time) they tarried with him very secretly within the Castle of <hi>Barwick</hi> two dayes. In the which time returned <hi>Alexander Whitlaw</hi> aforesaid, with answer to the Lords, and unto <hi>Iohn Knox.</hi> The tenour of whose Letter was this:

                  <p>Albeit the said <hi>Iohn</hi> received this Letter at <hi>Barwick,</hi> yet would he answer nothing till that he had spoken with the Lords whom he found in <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and unto whom he delivered the answer sent from the Councell of <hi>England</hi> (for <hi>Alexander Whitlaw</hi> took sicknesse betwixt <hi>Barwick</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and was troubled by the Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi> as in the former Booke is declared) the answer sent by Master <hi>Cecill</hi> was so generall, that many amongst us despaired of any comfort to come from that Countrey. And therefore were determined that they would request no further. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> laboured in the contrary, but he could prevaile no further, but that he should have licence and libertie to write as he thought best: And so took he upon him to answer for all, in forme as followeth.

                           <head>Answer to Master <hi>Cecils</hi> writing.</head>
                           <p>TWo causes hindred me (Right Worshipfull) to visit you in any part in <hi>England.</hi> Before this no signification of your minde and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was made unto me, for onely did Sir <hi>Henry Percie</hi> will me to come and speake with him, which conveniently at that time I could not do, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the French-men (which was the second cause of my stay) did then most furiously pursue us, while our company was dispersed, and then durst I not be absent for divers inconveniences; neither did I thinke my presence with you greatly necessary, considering that the matter (which I most desired) was opened and proposed. To the which I would have wished, That a more plaine and especiall answer should have been made. For albeit Master <hi>Whitlaw</hi> by his Credit, Master <hi>Kirkcaldie</hi> by his Letter, and I, both by Letters and by that which I had received from Sir <hi>Iames Crofts,</hi> did perswade your good mindes; yet could not the councell be otherwise perswaded, but that this alteration in <hi>France</hi> had altered your former purpose. It is not unknown what good will we three do beare to <hi>England:</hi> And therefore I wish, That rather your Pen, then our Credit, or any thing written to any of us, should assure the Lords and others, of your good mindes (who are now in number but five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.) Unlesse that money be furnished without delay to pay the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for their service past, and to retaine another thousand foot-men, with three hundred horse-men; till some stay be had in this danger, these Gentle-men will be compelled to leave the fields. I am assured, <hi>as flesh may be of flesh,</hi> That some of them will take a very hard life, before that



<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61872:157"/>
ever they compose, either with the Queen Regent, or with <hi>France:</hi> but this I dare not promise at all, unlesse in they see greater forwardnesse. To support us, will appear excessive; and to break promise with <hi>France,</hi> will appear dangerous. But the losse of expences, in mine opinion, ought not to be esteemed from the first payment, neither yet the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the first appearance.<note place="margin">Note a bragga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doshie.</note> 
                              <hi>France</hi> is most fervent to conquer us, and avoweth, That against us they will spend the Crown (so did mine own ears hear <hi>Butten Court</hi> bragge) But most assuredly I know, That unlesse by us they thought to make an entrie to you,<note place="margin">

They labour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt some of our great men by money (and some of our number are poore, as before I wrote, and cannot serve without support) some they threatned, and against others they have up one party in their owne Countrey. In this mean time, if ye lie by as neutralls, what will be the end, you may easily conjecture. And therefore, Sir, in the bowells of Christ Jesus, I require you to make plain answer, What the Gentlemen here may trust to, and what the Queens Majestie will do, may without long delay be put in execution. I rest in Christ Jesus.</p>

                  <p>Answer with great expedition was returned to this Letter, desiring some men of credit to be sent to the Lords to <hi>Barwicke,</hi> for the receiving of the money for the first support, with promise, That if the Lords of the Congregation meant no otherwise then before they had written, and if they would enter into League with honest Conditions, they should neither lack men nor money to their just Causes. Upon this answer was directed from the Lords to <hi>Barwicke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> Master <hi>Henry Balnaves,</hi> a man of good credit in both the Realmes; who suddenly returned with such a sum of money as served all the publike affairs till <hi>November</hi> next; when <hi>Iohn Cockburne</hi> of <hi>Ormeston,</hi> sent for the second support, and receiving the same, unhappily fell into the hands of the Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> was wounded, taken, and spoyled of a great Sum: upon which mischance, followed all the rest of the troubles before rehearsed. In the second Book preceding, we have declared how Secretary <hi>Leehington</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>England:</hi> But one thing before we have passed by: In that our greatest dejection, this order was taken; That the Duke, the Earle of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> Lord <hi>Boyd,</hi> Lord <hi>Uchiltrie,</hi> and their friends, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine together at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> for comfort of the Countrey, and for giving of answers, as occasion should require; and that the Earle of <hi>Arrane,</hi> the Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Rothesse,</hi> the Master of <hi>Lindsay,</hi> and their adherents, should continue together within <hi>Fyfe</hi> for the same cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that advertisements might go from the one to the other, as need required.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> In the Negotiation of the Secretary <hi>Lethington</hi> with the Queen and Councell of <hi>England</hi> (in the which he travelled with no lesse wisedom and faithfulnesse, then happy successe) many things occurred that required the resolution of the whole Lords.</p>
                  <p>After that the Queen and Councell of <hi>England</hi> had concluded to send their Army to <hi>Scotland</hi> for expelling of the French, the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi>



                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:61872:158"/>
was sent to <hi>Barwick</hi> with full instructions, power and Commission to do in all things concerning the present affaires of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the Queen and Councell in their own persons had power to do. Hereupon the said Duke required such a part of the Lords of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as had power and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the whole, to meet him at such a day and place as pleased them to appoint. This advertisement came first to <hi>Glasgow</hi> by the meanes of the Master of <hi>Maxwell:</hi> Which read and considered by the Lords, conclusion was taken that they would meet at <hi>Carleil,</hi> and that was the procurement of the said Master of <hi>Maxwell</hi> for his ease. Hereupon were Letters directed from the Lords being in <hi>Glasgow,</hi> to Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him with all possible expedition to repaire towards them, for the purpose aforesaid. Which Letters read and advised upon, commandment was given to <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> to make the answer. For so it was appointed at division of the Lords, that he should answer for the part of those that were in <hi>Fyfe</hi>; and M. <hi>Henry Balnaves</hi> for the part of them that abode at <hi>Glasgow.</hi> The said <hi>Iohn</hi> answered as followeth.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>To the Duke, and the other Lords at <hi>Glasgow.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>AFter humble commendation of my service: Albeit I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more then once to Master <hi>Henry Balnaves,</hi> what things have misliked me in your slow proceedings, as well in supporting your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who many dayes have sustained extreame danger in these parts, as in making provision how the enemie might have been annoyed, who lay few in number, nigh to your Quarters in <hi>Sterlin.</hi> And in making like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise provision, how the expectation of our friends, who long have waited for your answer, might have been satisfied. Albeit (I say) that of these things I have before complained, yet, in conscience, I am compelled to signifie unto your Honours, That unlesse of these and other enormities I shall see some redresse, I am assured, That the end shall be such,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Note.</hi>
                           </note> as godly men shall mourne, that a good Cause shall perish for lacke of Wisdome and Diligence. In my last Letters to Master <hi>Henry Balnaves,</hi> I declared, That your especiall friends in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> wonder, that no greater expedition is made, the weight of the matter being considered. If the fault be in the Duke and his friends, I wrote also, That the greatest losse should be his and theirs in the end. And now I cannot cease, both to wonder and lament, That your whole Councell was so destitute of Wisdome and Discretion, as to charge this poore man the <hi>Priour,</hi> to come to you to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to go to <hi>Carleil,</hi> for such affaires as are to be handled. Was there none amongst you who did foresee what inconveniences might ensue his absence from these parts? I cease to speake of the dangers by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Your friends have lyen in your Haven now fifteene dayes past, (what was their former travell it is not unknowne) they have never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived comfort of any man (him onely excepted) more then if they had lyen upon the coast of their mortall enemy. Do ye not consider, That such a company shall need comfort and provision from time to time? Remove him, and who abideth there who carefully will travell in that or any



<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61872:158"/>
other weighty matter in these parts? Did ye not farther consider, That he that had begun to meddle with the Gentlemen, who have declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves back-friends heretofore; and also that order should have been taken for such as have been neutrall; now by reason of his absence, the one shall escape without admonition, and the other shall be at their own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I am assured that the enemy shall not sleep, neither in that, nor in other affairs, to undermine you and your whole Cause, and especially to hurt this part of the Countrey, to revenge their former folly. If none of these former causes should have moved you to have considered that such a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (at such a time) was not meet for him, neither yet for them that must accompany him: yet discreet men would have considered, that the men that have lien in their jacks, and travelled their horses continuall the space of a moneth, required some longer rest, first to themselves, then but especially to their horses, before they had been charged to such a journey, as yet they have not had. The <hi>Priour</hi> may for satisfaction of your unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable mindes, enterprise the purpose; but I am assured he shall not be able to have six honest men in all <hi>Fyfe</hi> to accompany him; and how that either standeth with your Honors, or with his safety, judge ye your selves. But yet wonder it is, that ye did not consider, To what pain and griefe shall ye put our friends of <hi>England,</hi> especially the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and his Councell, whom ye shall cause to travell the most wearisome and troublesome way that is in <hi>England.</hi> In mine opinion, whosoever gave you that counsell, either lacked right judgement in things to be done, or else had too much respect to his own ease, and too small regard to the travell and damage of their brethren. A common cause, requireth a common concurrence, and that every man bear his burden proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But prudent and indifferent men espie the contrary in this cause, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of late dayes; for the weakest are most grievously charged, and they to whom the matter most belongeth, and to whom justly greatest burden is due, are exempted in a manner, both from travell and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. To speak the matter plainly, wise men do wonder, what the Dukes friends do mean, that they are so slack and backward in this cause; In other actions they have been judged stout and forward, and in this, which is the greatest that ever he or they had in hand, they appear desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute both of grace and courage. I am not ignorant that they that are most inward of his counsell,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Note.</hi>
                           </note> are enemies to God, and therefore cannot but be enemies to this Cause. But wonder it is, That he and his other friends should not consider, That the losse of this godly enterprise, shall be the rooting out of them and their posterity from this Realme. Considering, my Lords, That by Gods providence ye are joyned with the Duke in this common Cause, admonish him plainly of the danger to come, will him to beware of the counsell of those that are plainly infected with Superstition,<note place="margin">

                           </note> with Pride, and with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of particular profit: which if he do not at your admonition, he shall smart before he be aware. And if ye cease to put him in minde of his duty, it may be that for your silence ye shall drinke some portion of the plague with him. Take my plain speaking, as proceeding from him that is not your enemy, being also uncertaine,

                  <p>Upon the receit of this Letter, and consultation had hereupon, a new conclusion was taken; to wit, That they would visite the said Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> at <hi>Barwicke</hi> where he was. Thus far we have digressed from the text of our History, to let the Posterity that shall follow understand by what instruments God wrought the familiarity and friendship that after we found in <hi>England.</hi> Now we returne to our former History.</p>

                        <p>We have well considered, and are fully perswaded, in what danger, deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and misery, the long enmity with the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> hath brought our Countrey heretofore: how wealthie and flourishing it shall become, if those two Kingdoms, as they are joyned in one Island by Creation of the World, so they may be knit in a constant and assured friendship. The considerations grounded upon a most infallible Trueth, ought no lesse to have moved our Progenitours and for fathers then us. But the present danger hanging over our heads, by the unjust dealing of those, of whom we have alwayes best deserved, hath caused us to weigh them more earnestly then they did. The misbehaviour of the French <hi>Monsieurs,</hi> I had almost said Monsters, here, hath of late yeers been so great. The oppressions and crueltie of the Souldiers, the tyrannie and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of their Superiours and Rulers, so grievous to the people, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent subversion of our liberty, and conquest of the land, whereat they have by most crafty and subtill means continually pressed, hath been, I say, so intollerable to us all, that at last when we could not obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse by humble suits, and earnest supplications presented to the Queen Dowager, who both for duties sake, and place, she doth occupie, ought to have been most carefull of our state, we have been by very necessitie constrained, not onely to assay our own Forces, but also to implore the Queens Majestie of <hi>Englands</hi> aide and support, which her Majestie hath most willingly granted, upon certain conditions specified in a Treaty past at <hi>Barwick,</hi> betwixt the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Lieutenant to her Majestie, on the one part, and certain our Commissioners on the other part, whereof the Tenour followeth. At <hi>Barwick</hi> the 27 day of February, the yeer of our Lord God 1559 yeers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is appointed, and finally Contracted, betwixt the noble and mighty, <hi>Thomas,</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Earle Marshall of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Lieutenant to the Queens Majestie of the said Realm, in the Name and behalf of her Highnesse on the one part; and the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lord <hi>Iames Stewart, Patrick</hi> Lord <hi>Ruthuen,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Maxwell</hi> of <hi>Terregles,</hi> Knight, <hi>William Maitland</hi> of <hi>Lethington</hi> younger, <hi>Iohn Wischarde</hi> of <hi>Pittarrow,</hi> and Master <hi>Henry Balnaves</hi> of <hi>Halhill</hi>; in name and behalf of the Noble and Mighty <hi>Iames,</hi> Duke of <hi>Chattellarault</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Lords of the Congregation, joyned together in this Cause, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and defence of the ancient Rights and Liberties of their Countrey on the other part, in forme as after followeth: That is to say, That the Queen having sufficiently understood, as well by information sent from the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as by the proceedings of the French, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to conquer the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> suppresse the liberty thereof, and unite the same unto the Crown of <hi>France</hi> perpetually, contrary to the Laws of the said Realm, and the Pacts, Oathes, and Promises of <hi>France.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto most humbly and earnestly required by the said Nobility; for, and in the name of the whole Realm, shall accept the said Realm of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>



                           <pb n="234" facs="tcp:61872:160"/>
the said Nobility and subjects thereof into her Majesties protection and maintenance, onely for preservation of the same in their own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and liberties, and from conquest, during the time that the Marriage shall continue betwixt the Queen of Scots and the French King, and a yeer after: And for expelling out of the same Realme of such as present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and apparently goeth about to practice the said Conquest, her Majesty shall with all speed send into <hi>Scotland</hi> a convenient aide of men of War, both Horse and Foot, to joyn with the power of Scotish men, with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, Munition, and all other Instruments of War meet for that purpose, as well by Sea as by Land, not onely to expell the present Power of the French within that Realme oppressing the same, but also to stop, as far as conveniently may be, all greater Forces of French to enter therein, for the like purpose, and shall continue her Majesties ayd to the said Realme, Nobility, and subjects of the same, unto the time the French (being ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the said Realme) be utterly expelled hence; and shall never trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, compose, nor agree with the French, nor conclude any League with them, except the Scots and the French shall be agreed, that the Realme of <hi>Scotland</hi> may be left in a due freedom by the French; nor shall leave the maintenance of the said Nobility and subjects, whereby they might fall as a prey into their enemies hands, as long as they shall acknowledge their Soveraigne Lady the Queen, and shall endeavour their selves to maintain the liberty of their Countrey, and the State of the Crowne of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And if in case any Forts or Strengths within the Realme be won out of the hands of the French at this present, or at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by her Majesties ayd, the same shall be immediately demolished by the Scotish-men, or delivered to the said Nobility aforesaid, at their option and choice; neither shall the power of <hi>England</hi> fortifie within the ground of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being out of the bounds of <hi>England,</hi> but by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Duke, Nobility, and States of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For the which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and in respect of her Majesties most gentle clemency, and liberall support, the said Nobility, as well such as be joyned, as such as shall hereafter joyn with them already joyned, for the defence of the liberty of that Realme, shall to the uttermost of their power ayd and support her Majesties Army against the French and their partakers, with Horse-men and Foot-men, and with Victualls, by Land and Sea, with all manner of other ayd, to the best of their power, and so shall continue during the time that her Majesties Army shall remain in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1560</note> the yeer of our Lord 1560. the Army of the Land entred into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the conducting whereof was committed to the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> who had in his company the Lord <hi>Scrope,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Crofts,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Percie,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Lake,</hi> with many other Captains and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, having charge some of Foot-men, and some of Horse-men. The Army by Land was esteemed ten thousand men. The Queen Regent past to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and some others of her faction: At <hi>Preston</hi> met them, the Duke, the Earle of <hi>Argyle</hi> (<hi>Huntlie</hi> came not till that the siege was confirmed) Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> and <hi>Menteth,</hi> Lords <hi>Ruthuen, Boyd, Uchiltrie,</hi> with all the Protestants, Gentlemen of the West, <hi>Fyfe, Angus,</hi> and <hi>Mearnes,</hi> so that in few dayes the Army was great. After the deliberation of two dayes had at <hi>Inneresk,</hi> the whole Camp marched forward with Ordnance, and all preparations necessary for the siege, and came to <hi>Lestarrig</hi> the Palme Sunday Even. The French had put themselves in Battell Aray upon the Linkes without <hi>Leith,</hi> and sent forth their skirmishers; who beginning before ten of the clock, continued skirmishing till after four of the clock at afternoon, when there was given upon them a charge by some Horse-men of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and some of <hi>England:</hi> But because the principall Captaine of the Horse-men of <hi>England</hi> was not present, the whole Troops durst not charge, and so was not the overthrow and slaughter of the French so great as it once appeared to have been; for the great Battell was once at the trot; but when it perceived that the great Force of Horse-men stood still, and charged not, they returned, and gave some rescue to their fellows that fled; and so there fell onely in that defeat about three hundred French-men. God would not give the Victory so suddenly, lest that man should glory in his owne strength. The small Victory that was gotten,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> put both the English and Scotish in over-great security, as the issue declared. The French enclosed within the Towne, the English Army began to plant their Pavilions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Lestarrig.</hi> The Ordnance of the Towne, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that which lay upon Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> Steeple, did them great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance; against which place were bent eight Cannons, which shot so continually, and so just, that within few dayes that the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was condemned, and all the Ordnance that was on it discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which made the English-men somewhat more negligent, then it became good men of War to have been: For perceiving that the French made no pursuit without their Walls, they tooke an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they should never issue more, and that made some of the Captaines for pastime go to the Towne. The Souldiers for their ease laid their Armour beside them, and as men without danger, fell to the Dice and Cards; and so upon the Easter Munday, at the very houre of noon, the French issued both upon Horse and Foot, and with great violence entred within the English Trenches,



<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61872:163"/>
slue and put to flight all that was found therein. The Watch was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently kept, and so were the Succours slow and long in coming; For the French, before that any resistance was made unto them, approached hard to the great Ordnance: But then the Horse-men trooped together, and the Foot-men gat themselves in Aray, and so repulsed the French back again to the Town; but the slaughter was great, some say it dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exceeded that which the French received the first day. And this was the fruit of their security and ours, which after was remedied: For the English men most wisely considering themselves not able to besiege the Town round about, devised to make Mounts at divers quarters of it, in the which they and their Ordnance lay in as good strength, as they did within the Town: The common souldiers kept the Trenches, and had the said mountains for their saveguard and refuge, in case of any greater pursuit then they were able to sustain. The patience and stout courage of the English men,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> but principally of the Horse-men, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all praise: For where was it ever heard, That eight thousand (they never exceeded that number that lay in Camp) should besiege four thousand of the most desperate throat-cutters that were to be found in <hi>Europe,</hi> and to lie nigh unto them in daily skirmishing, the space of three moneths and more? The Horse-men night and day kept Watch, and did so valiantly behave themselves, that the French gat no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, from that day back to the day of the assault, whereof we shall shortly hear. In this mean time was this other Band made of all the Nobility, Barons, and Gentlemen professing Christ Jesus in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of divers others that joyned with us, for expelling of the French, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom the Earle of <hi>Huntlie</hi> was a prime man.

The Camp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in all necessary Provision, order was taken for continuation of the Siege; and so the Trenches were drawn as neer the Town as possibly they might. The great Camp removed from <hi>Lestarrig,</hi> to the West side of the water of <hi>Leith</hi>; and so were the Cannons planted for the Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and did shoot at the Southwest wall: But by reason all was earth, the Breach was not made so great upon the day, but that it was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently repaired upon the night: whereof the English-men beginning to be weary, determined to give the Breach an Assault, as that they did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the seventh day of <hi>May,</hi> beginning before the day light, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till it was nigh seven a clock. And albeit that the English and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish with great slaughter of the Souldiers of both were repulsed, yet was there never a sharper assault given by so few hands; for they exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a thousand men, that assaulted the whole two quarters of the Town, and yet they damned the whole Block-house, yea, they once put the French clean off their Walls, and were upon both the East and West Block-house, but they lacked backing, for their Scales lacked six quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the just height; And so while the former were compelled to fight upon the top of the wall, their fellows could not joyn to support them, and so were they by multitude driven back again, when it was once thought that the Town was won. Sir <hi>Iames Crofts</hi> was blamed of many for not doing his duty that day, for he was appointed with a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient number of the most able men, to have assaulted the Northwest quarter upon the Sea side, where at a low water (as at the time of the assault it was) the passage was easie.<note place="margin">Note this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> But neither he nor his approached to their quarter appointed. He had before at the first coming in, spoken with the Queen Regent, at the fair Block-house of the Castle of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh:</hi> Whether she had enchanted him or not, we know not, but by suspition of that day in which he deceived the expectation of many, and so farre as man could judge, was the cause of that great repulse; some ascribed the shortnesse of the Ladders to him; but that omitted which might have proceeded of negligence, his absence from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of his Quarter, was the cause that such French as were appointed there to defend, seeing no pursuer came to the relief of their fellowes, and so they two joyning together, with great slaughter gave the repulse to our Company. The French-mens harlots, of whom the most part were Scotish whores, did no lesse cruelty then did the Souldiers: For besides that they charged their Pieces, and ministred unto them other weapons, some continually cast stones, some carried Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes of burning fire, some brought Timber and other impediments

                  <p>After the Defeat received, the Queen Regent and her faction were fully perswaded that the Siege would rise, and that the English Armie would depart. And so began the Papists wonderously to brag; and yet God did frustrate their expectation: for the Armie concluded to remaine, till new advertisement came from the Queen and Counsell.<note place="margin">The comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Letter of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>

And with expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were sent two thousand fresh men, whereby the Camp greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, began to forget the former discomfiture, and to sustain the daily skirmishing, as they did before: In the which, the French after the day of the assault did ever receive the hurt, and the repulse, as the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of many that came to the <hi>Cole-rake</hi> did witnesse.

life within two houres after. The other was <hi>Alexander Lockart,</hi> brother to the Laird of <hi>Bar,</hi> who rashly discovering himselfe in the Trenches, was shot in the head, and immediately thereafter departed this life. While the Siege thus continued, a sudden fire chanced in <hi>Leith,</hi> which devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many houses, and much Victuall, and so began God to fight for us, as the Lord <hi>Erskin</hi> in plaine words said to the Queen Regent; Madame (quoth he) I can see no more,<note place="margin">

                     </note> but seeing that men may not expell unjust possessours forth of this land, God himselfe would do it; For your fire is not kindled by man. Which words offended the Queen Regent not a little (whose sicknesse daily increasing) great craft she used, That <hi>Monsieur Dosell</hi> might have been permitted to have spoken with her, belike she would have bidden him fare-well, (for their old familiaritie was great) but that denied, she Writ, as it had been to her Chyrurgeon and Apothecarie, shewing her sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and requiring some Drogs. The Letter being presented to the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> he espied the craft, for few Lines being written above, and so much White-Paper left, he said, Drogs are abundant and fresher in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> then they can be in <hi>Leith.</hi> There lurketh here some other mysterie, and so he began to try, and by holding the Paper to the fire, he perceiveth some writing appear, and so began he to read; but what it was no other man can tell, for immediately he burnt the Bill, and said to the Messenger; Albeit I have been her Secretary, yet tell her, I shall keep her councell; But say to her, Such Wares will not sell till a new Market. The answer received, she was nothing content, and then travelled she earnestly, That she might speak with the Earles <hi>Argyle, Glencarne, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,</hi> and with the Lord <hi>Iames.</hi> After deliberation it was thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that they should speak with her, but not all together, lest that some part of the <hi>Guisians</hi> practice had lurked under the colour of such friendship.<note place="margin">Let the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now make use of these words of this dying Queen.</note> 
                     <hi>Her regrate was unto them all, That she had behaved her selfe so foolishly, as that she had compelled them to seek the support of others, then of their own Soveraigne, and said, That she sore repented, that ever it came to that extremitie: but she was not the wight, but the wicked counsell of her friends on the one part, and the Earle of</hi> Huntley <hi>on the other: for if he had not been, she would have fully agreed with them at their Commoning at</hi> Preston: They gave unto her both the Councell and the Comfort which they could in that extremitie, and willed her to send for some godly learned man, of whom she might receive instruction, for these igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Papists that were about her, understood nothing of the Mysterie of our redemption. Upon their motion was <hi>Iohn Willock</hi> sent for, with whom she talked a reasonable space, and who did plainely shew unto her as well the vertue and strength of the death of Jesus Christ, as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and abomination of that Idoll the Masse: <hi>She did openly confesse, That there was no salvation, but in and by the death of Iesus Christ</hi>; but of the Masse we heard not her Confession.

                              <p>O Eternall and everlasting God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath not onely commanded us to Pray, and promised to hear us; but also willest us to magnifie thy mercies, and to glorifie thy Name, when thou shewest thy selfe pitifull, and favourable unto us, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when thou deliverest us from desperate dangers: for so did thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Abraham, David, Iehosaphat,</hi> and <hi>Ezechias,</hi> yea, the whole people of Israel omitted not the same, when thou by thy mighty hand didst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their enemies, and didst deliver them from feare and danger of death intended. We ought not, nor can we forget, O Lord, in how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable estate stood this poore Countrey, and we the just inhabitants of the same, not many dayes past; When Idolatry was maintained; When cruell strangers did bear rule; When Virgins were defloured, Matrones corrupted, Mens Wives violently and villanously oppressed, The blood of innocents shed without mercy. And finally, when the unjust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of proud tyrants were obeyed as Law. Out of these mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (O Lord) could neither our wit, policie nor strength deliver us, yea, thou didst shew to us how vain was the help of man, where thy blessing giveth not victory. In these our anguishes, O Lord, we sobbed unto thee, we cried for thy help, and we reclaimed thy Name, as thy troubled flock persecuted for thy Trueths sake. Mercifully hast thou heard us (O Lord) mercifully, we say, because that neither in us, neither yet in our confederates was there any cause why that thou shouldst have given unto us so joyfull and sudden a deliverance. For neither of us both cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do wickedly, even in the midst of our greatest troubles, and yet hast thou looked upon us so pitifully, as that we had given unto thee most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience. For thou hast disappointed the counsels of the craftie; Thou hast bridled the rage of the cruell; and thou hast of thy mercy set this our perishing Realm, at a reasonable liberty. Oh give us hearts (thou Lord, that onely givest all good gifts) with reverence and fear to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thy wondrous works late wrought in our eyes. Let not the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the same unthankfully to slip from our wavering mindes. We grant and acknowledge, O Lord, That whatsoever we have received, shall fall into oblivion with us, and so turn to our condemnation; unlesse thou by the power of thy Spirit keep and retain us in recent and perpetuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the same. We beseech thee therefore, O father of mercies, that as of thy undeserved grace, thou hast partly removed our darknesse; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Idolatry; and taken from above our heads the devouring sword of mercilesse strangers, that so it would please thee to proceed with us in this thy grace begun. And albeit that in us there is nothing that may move thy Majestie, to shew us this favour; yet for Christ Jesus, thy onely welbeloved Sons sake, whose Name we bear, and whose Doctrine we professe; we beseech thee never to suffer us to forsake or deny this Verity which now we professe. But seeing that thou hast mercifully heard us, and hast caused thy Veritie to triumph in us; so we crave of thee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the end, that thy godly Name may be glorified in us thy creatures.

Confound thou the Counsell of those, that goe about to break that most godly League contracted in thy Name, and retaine thou us so firmly together by the power of thy holy Spirit, that Sathan have never power to set us again at variance nor discord. Give us thy grace to live in that Christian charitie, which thy Sonne our Lord Jesus hath so earnestly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the members of his body, that other Nations provoked by our example, may set aside all ungodly warre, contention and strife, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to live in tranquilitie and peace, as it becometh the Sheepe of thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and the people that daily look for our finall deliverance by the coming again of our Lord Jesus.

And first, seeing that God of his great mercy hath by the light of his Word manifested to no small number of this Realme, That the Doctrine of the Romane Church, received by the said Clergie, and maintained through their tyrannie by fire and sword, contained in it selfe many pestiferous errours, which cannot but bring damnation to the souls of such as therewith shall be infected; such as are the Doctrine of Transubstantiation; of the Adoration of Christs Body, under the form of Bread, as they terme it; of the Merits of Works, and Justification that they alleadge commeth thereby; together with the Doctrine of the Papisticall Indulgences, Purgatory, Pilgrimage, and Praying to Saints departed, which all either repugne to the plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or else have no ground in the Doctrine of our Master Jesus Christ, his Prophets and Apostles.</p>

But such hath been the rage of Sathan against us, and against Christ Iesus his Eternall Verity lately now again borne amongst us, that to this day no time hath been granted unto us, to clear our consciences, as most gladly we would have done: For how we have been tossed a whole yeer past, the most part of <hi>Europe</hi> (as we do suppose) doth understand. But seeing that of the infinite goodnesse of our God (who never suffereth his afflicted utterly to be confounded) above expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have we obtained some rest and liberty, we could not but set forth this briefe

and plain Confession of such Doctrine as is proposed unto us, and as we believe and professe; partly for satisfaction of our Brethren, whose hearts, we doubt not, have been, and yet are, wounded by the despightfull rayling of such as yet have not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to speak well: And partly for stopping the mouths of impudent blasphemers, who boldly condemne that which they neither heard nor understood: Not that we judge that the cankred malice of such is able to be cured by this simple Confession; No, we know that the sweet savour of the Gospel is and shall be death unto the sons of perdition. But we have chief respect to our weak and infirme Brethren, to whom we would communicate the bottom of our hearts, lest that they be troubled or carried away by diversity of rumours which Sathan spreadeth against us, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating of this our most godly enterprise; Protesting, That if any man will note in this our Confession any Articles or sentence repugning to Gods holy Word, that it would please him of his gentlenesse, and for Christian charities sake, admonish us of the same in writing; and we upon our Honours and fidelity do promise unto him satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from the mouth of God (that is, from his holy Scriptures) or else Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of that which he shall prove to be amisse. For God we take to Record in our consciences, That from our hearts we abhorre all Sects of Heresie, and all teachers of erroneous doctrine; And that with all humility we embrace the purity of Christs Gospel, which is the onely food of our soules; and therefore so precious unto us, that we are determined to suffer the extremest of worldly danger, rather then that we will suffer our selves to be defrauded of the same. For hereof we are most certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, That whosoever denieth Christ Iesus, or is ashamed of him in presence of men, shall be denied before the Father, and before his holy Angels. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the assistance of the mighty Spirit of the same our Lord Iesus, we firmly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to abide to the end in the confession of this our Faith.</p>

So far then as the Councell proveth the Determination and Commandment, that it giveth by the plain Word of God, so far do we reverence and imbrace the same. But if men under the name of a Councell pretend to forge unto us new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our Faith, or to make Constitutions repugning to the Word of God,<note place="margin">Act. 15.1, &amp;c.</note> then utterly we may refuse the same, as the Doctrine of Devils, which draweth our souls from the voice of our onely God, to follow the Doctrines and Constitutions of men. The cause then why Generall Councells convened,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15. Heb. 3.2. 1 Cor. 14.40.</note> was neither to make any perpetuall Law (which God before had not made) neither yet to forge new Articles of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, neither to give the Word of God authority, much lesse to make that to be his Word, or yet the true interpretation of the same, which was not before by his holy Will expressed in his Word. But the cause of Councells (we mean of such as merited the name of Councels) was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Confutation of Heresies, and for giving publike Confession of their Faith to the posterities following, which both they did by the authority of Gods written Word, and not by any opinion or prerogative that they could not erre, by reason of their generall assembly. And this we judge to have been the chiefe cause of Generall Councells. The other was for good policie and Order to be constituted and observed in the Church, in which (as in the house of God) it becometh all things to be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and in order: not that we think that one Policie, and one Order in Ceremonies can be appointed for all ages, times, and places; for as Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies (such as men have devised) are but temporall, so may, and ought they to be changed, when they rather foster superstition, then that they edifie the Church using the same.</p>

And also, That in the Supper rightly used, Christ Jesus is so joyned with us, that he becometh the very nourishment and food of our soules.

                                 <p>THat Sacraments be rightly ministred, we judge two things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site: The one, that they be ministred by lawfull Ministers, whom we affirme to be onely they that are appointed to the Preaching of the Word, or unto whose mouthes God hath put some Sermon of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they being men of lawfull choosing thereto by some Church. The other, That they be ministred in such elements, and in such sort as God hath appointed. Else we affirme, That they cease to be right Sacraments of Christ Jesus. And therefore it is, that we flee the societie with the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Church, in participation of their Sacraments; First, because their Ministers are no Ministers of Jesus Christ (yea,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.26, &amp;c Mar. 14.22, &amp;c Luk. 22.19, &amp;c 1 Cor. 11.24.</note> which is more horrible) they suffer women, whom the holy Ghost will not suffer to teach in the Congregation, to Baptize. And secondly, because they have so adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, both the one Sacrament and the other, with their own inventions, that no part of Christs action abideth in the originall purity, for Oyl, Salt, Spittle, and such like in Baptisme, are but mens inventions, Adoration, Veneration, bearing through Streets and Townes, and keeping of bread in Boxes, are prophanation of Christs Sacraments, and no use of the same: For Christ Jesus said, <hi>Take and eat, &amp;c. Do ye this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> By which words and charge he sanctified Bread and Wine to be the Sacrament of his Body and Blood; to the end, that one should be eaten, and that all should drink of the other, and not that they should be kept to be worshipped and honoured as God, as the blinde Papists have done heretofore, who also have committed Sacriledge, stealing from the people one part of the Sacrament; to wit, The blessed Cup. Moreover, that the Sacraments be rightly used, it is required, That the end and cause why the Sacraments were instituted, be understood and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, as well of the Minister as the Receivers: for if the opinion be changed in the Receiver, the right use ceaseth: which is most evident by the rejection of the sacrifices (as also if the teacher teach false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) which were odious and abhominable unto God (albeit they were his own ordinances) because that wicked men used them to another

Some of our Ministers were present, standing upon their feet, ready to have answered, in case any would have defended Papistry, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned our affirmatives. But while that no objection was made, there was a day appointed for concurrence in that and other Heads. Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession was read every Article by it self over again, as they were written in order, and the voice of every man was required accordingly. Of the Temporall State, onely gave their voice on the contrary, the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> the Lords <hi>Simmerwaile</hi> and <hi>Borthwicke:</hi> And yet for their disassenting, they produced no better reason, but, We will believe as our Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. The Bishops (Papisticall we mean) spake nothing. The rest of the whole three States by their publike Votes, affirmed the Doctrine; and the rather, Because that fain the Bishops would, but durst say nothing on the contrary;<note place="margin">The Earle Marshall his pious voyce in Parliament.</note> for this was the Vote of the Earle Marshall; <hi>It is long since I have had some favour unto the Truth, and since that I have had a suspicion of the Papisticall Religion. But I praise my God, who this day hath fully resolved me in the one and the other: For seeing that the Bishops, who for their learning can, and for their zeal that they should bear to the Verity, would, as I suppose, have gainsaid any thing that directly repugneth to the Verity of God. Seeing, I say, the Bishops here present speak nothing in the contrary of the Doctrine propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I cannot but hold it for the very Truth of God, and the contrary to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Doctrine. And therefore so far as in me lieth, I approve the one, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the other: And do farther ask of God, That not onely I, but also all my posterity, may enjoy the comfort of the Doctrine that this day our ears have heard. And yet more I must Vote, as it were by way of Protestation, That if any person Ecclesiasticall shall after this oppose themselves to this our Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that they that have no place nor credit; considering that they having long advertisement, and full knowledge of this our Confession, none is now found

authority a great blow, and yet amend themselves nothing. For in whose default we pray you was the Queen absent from this Realm? We think they will not be so shamelesse as that they will blame the Protestants thereof. Her person was absent, and that to no small grief of our hearts: But were not the States of her Realm assembled in her name? Yea, had they not her full power and Commission, yea, the Commission and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of her head the King of <hi>France,</hi> to convocate that Parliament, and to do all things that may be done in lawfull Parliament?<note place="margin">Note this I pray you for these dayes sake.</note> Even as if our Soveraigns had been there in proper persons: If they will limit the power of Princes to the places onely where their bodily presence is, it will be thought strange; for so not onely shall Kings be compelled to content them with one Realme, but also with one Citie: For the bodily presence of Kings can no more be in divers cities at one instant, then that they can be in divers Realms. Hitherto we have understood, that wheresoever the great Councellers of the King with his power and Commission are assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to do any thing at his just commandment, That there is the Kings sufficient presence and authority, wheresoever his own body be living at freedome and liberty; which if the Papists deny, we will finde faults with them, and with the Princes whom they have abused, that more will annoy them, then any thing that we can lose by the insufficiencie of that Parliament: Which neverthelesse we are bold to affirme to have been more lawfull and more free, then any Parliament that they are able to produce this hundred yeeres before it, or yet any that hath ensued since it was, (he meanes untill 1566. when this Book was written) for in it the voices of men were free, and given in conscience, in others they were bought, or given at the devotion of the misled Prince. All things in it concluded, are able to abide the triall, and not to be consumed at the proofe of the fire: of others the godly may justly call in doubt things determined. To the Sword and Scepter, nor yet to the absence of some Lords, we answer nothing. For our adversaries know well enough that the one is rather a pompe, and vaine-glorious ceremonie, then a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall point of necessitie required to a lawfull Parliament: And the absence of some prejudges not the powers of the present duely assembled: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, that due advertisement be made unto them.

The cause we have before declared, some was licentious, some had greedily griped the possessions of the Church; and others thought that they would not lack their part of Christs Coat, yea, and that before that ever he was Crucified, as by the Preachers they were oft rebuked.

The principall comfort remained with the Preachers,<note place="margin">Note this for our dayes.</note> for they assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us in Gods Name that God would performe in all perfection that worke in our hands. The beginning whereof he had so mightily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, because it was not ours, but his own. And therefore exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us, That we should constantly proceed to reform all abuses, and to plant the Ministery of the Church, as by Gods word we might justifie it; and then commit the successe of all to our God,<note place="margin">Let this teach us to seek God.</note> in whose power the disposition of Kingdoms standeth. And so we began to do, for troubles appearing, made us give eare to the admonitions of Gods servants. And while that we had scarcely begun again to implore the help of our God, and to shew some signes of our obedience unto his Messengers, and holy Word, Lo the mighty hand of God from above sent unto us a wonderfull and most joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deliverance:<note place="margin">The death of the yong King of <hi>France</hi> hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to our Queen.</note> For unhappy <hi>Francis,</hi> husband to our Soveraigne, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly perished of a rotten eare. But because the death of that young man was not onely the cause of joy to us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but also by it were the faithfull in <hi>France</hi> delivered as it were from the present death.

                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:61872:182"/>These cruell and conjured enemies of God and of all godlinesse, the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and their faction, who then at their owne appetite plaid the Tyrants in <hi>France,</hi> had determined the destruction of all that professed the true knowledge of Jesus Christ within that Realme. What tyrannie late before they had used at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyse,</hi> the History of <hi>France</hi> doth witnesse: now in <hi>Orleance</hi> in the moneth of November, conveaned the King, unhappy <hi>Francis,</hi> the Queen our Soveraigne, and the Queen mother of the King, the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> with all his faction: The King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> his brother.</p>
                  <p>So that great was the confluence of the Nobilitie, but greater was the assembly of the murtherers, for there was not a Hang-man in all <hi>France</hi> which was not there. The prisons were full of the true servants of God: The King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condie</hi> were consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Prisoners. The Sheriffe of <hi>Orleance,</hi> a man fearing God, was taken, and so were many others of the Towne. Briefly, there was none that professed God or godlinesse within that Towne, that looked not for the extremity, for the Walles and Gates were night and day kept with the Garisons of the Guysians, miserable men were daily brought in, to suffer judgement, but none was suffered to depart forth, but at the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Tyrants.</p>
                  <p>And so they proceeded till the tenth or twelfth of December, when that they thought time to put their bloody councell in execution, and for that purpose conclusion was taken, That the King should depart out of the Towne, and lie at a certaine place; which was done to this intent, That there should no suite be made to the King for the safetie of any mans life, whom they thought worthy of death. And so was the Kings house in <hi>Orleance</hi> broken up, his beds, cofers, and tapistrie sent away, his owne bootes put on, he sitting at the Masse immediately hereafter to have depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so their tyrannie to have begun.</p>
                  <p>When all things, we say, were in this readinesse to shed the blood of innocents, the eternall, our God, <hi>who ever watcheth for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his owne,</hi> began to worke, and suddenly did put his own work in execution, for as the said King sat at Masse, he was suddenly stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with an Aposthume, in that deaf ear that never would hear the Trueth of God, and so was he carried to a void and empty house, laid upon a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liase unto such time as a Cannaby was set up unto him, where he lay till the fifteenth day of December,<note place="margin">15. December 1560.</note> in the yeere of God 1560. When his glory perished, and the pride of his stubborne heart vanished in smoke; And so was the snare broken; The Tyrants disappointed of their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; Those that was appointed to death, raised, as it were, out of their graves; And we, who by our foolishnesse had made our selves slaves to strangers, were restored againe to freedome and libertie of a free Realme.</p>

And indeed the following Kings of <hi>France</hi> unto this day, hath found this true by their infortunate and unexpected ends.</p>
                  <p>The death of this King made great alteration in <hi>France, England</hi> and <hi>Scotland; France</hi> was erected in some esperance that the tyranny of the <hi>Guisians</hi> should no longer raigne above them, because God at unawares had broken the staffe whereupon they leaned; but alas, they were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: For the simplicity of some was so abused, that against the Lawes of the Realm, to the Queen mother was committed the Regiment, which lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up as well the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> as the cruell Cardinall, for a season. The Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the Councell, remitted our Ambassadours. The pride of the Papists of <hi>Scotland</hi> began to be abated, and some that ever had shewn themselves enemies unto us, began to think, and plainly to speak (amongst whom the old Sheriff of <hi>Ayre</hi> was one) That they perceived God to fight for us. The Earle of <hi>Arrane</hi> having suffered repulse in his designe to marry the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> he began to fancie unto himselfe that the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> bare unto him some favour: And so he wrote unto her, and sent for credit a Ring, which the said Queen our Soveraign knew well enough. The Letter and Ring were both presented to the Queen, and by her received: Such answer was returned to the said Earle, after the which he made no further pursuit in that matter: And yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse he did bear it heavily in heart, and more heavily then his friends would have wished; for grief he was troubled in his understanding.</p>
                  <p>The certainty of the death foresaid was signified unto us both by Sea and Land. By Sea received <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> (who then had great intelligence both with the Churches abroad, and some of the Court of <hi>France</hi>) That the King was mortally sick, and could not well escape death. Which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters received that same day at afternoon he passed to the Duke to his own lodging at the Church of <hi>Field,</hi> with whom he found the Lord <hi>Iames</hi> in conference alone: The Earle of <hi>Arrane</hi> was in <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> to whom he opened such news as he had received, and willed them to be of good comfort; for, said he, the advertiser hath never deceived me: It is the
same Gentleman that first gave us knowledge of the slaughter of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France</hi>; and shewed unto them the Letter, but would not expresse the mans name. While they were reasoning in divers purposes, and he comforting them: For while (we say) they three were familiarly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together, there came a messenger from the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> forth of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> assuring him of the death of the K. of <hi>France.</hi> Which noysed abroad, a generall Convention of the Nobility was appointed to be holden at

                     <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the fifteenth day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> following, in the which the Book of discipline was perused newly over againe, for some pretended igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by reason that they had not heard it. In that assembly was Master <hi>Alexander Anderson</hi> Subprincipall, and Under-Master of one of the Schools of <hi>Aberdein,</hi> a man more subtill and craftie than either learned or godly, called, who refused to dispute anent his faith, abusing a place of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to cloak his ignorance. It was answered unto him, That <hi>Tertullian</hi> should not prejudge the Authoritie of the Holy Ghost, who by the mouth of <hi>Peter</hi> commandeth us to give reason of our faith to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that requireth the same of us; It was farther answered, that we neither required him, neither yet any man to dispute in any point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was grounded upon Gods Word, and fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in his holy Scriptures, for all that we beleeved without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie. But we required of him, as of the rest of Papists, that they would suffer their Doctrine, Constitutions, and Ceremonies to come to triall. And principally, that the Masse and the opinion thereof by them taught unto the people,<note place="margin">Note this well</note> might be laid to the square rule of Gods Word, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right Institution of Jesus Christ, That they might understand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that their Preachers offended, or not, in that, that they affirmed. The Action of the Masse to be expresly repugning unto the last Supper of the Lord Jesus, The sayer of it to commit horrible blasphemie in usurping up-him the Office of Christ, The hearers to commit damnable Idolatry, and the opinion of it conceived to be a derogation, and as it were a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulling of Christs death. While the said Master <hi>Alexander</hi> denied, that the Priest took upon him Christs office, to offer for sin, as he alleaged, a Masse book was produced, and in the beginning of the Canon were these words read, <hi>Suscipe Sancta Trinitas hanc oblationem quam ego indignus pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor offero tibi vivo Deo &amp; vero, pro peccatis meis, pro peccatis totius Ecclesiae vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorum &amp; mortuum.</hi> Now said the reasoner, if to off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if a vile Knave, whom ye call Priest, proudly taketh the same upon him, let your own Books witnesse. The said Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> answered, Christ offered the propitiatory, and that could none do but he; but we offer the remembrance.<note place="margin">

In God the Father there falleth no Oblivion: And if ye will shift and say, that ye offer it not as God, were forgetfull, but as willing to apply Christs merits to his Church. We demand of you, What power &amp; commandment have ye so to do? We know that our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Christ Jesus commanded his Apostles to do that which he did <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him,</hi> But plain it is, that <hi>Christ took bread, gave thanks, brake bread, and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take ye, eate ye, this is my body which is broken for you, do this in remembrance of me, &amp;c.</hi> Here we finde a commandment, to take,

The said Master <hi>Alexander</hi> being more then astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would have shifted; but then the Lords willed him to answer directly, whereto he answered, That he was better seen in Philosophie, then in Theologie.<note place="margin">Note <hi>Lesley</hi> his answer.</note> Then was commanded M. <hi>Iohn Leslie</hi> (who then was Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Une,</hi> and now Abbot of <hi>Londors,</hi> and after was made Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi>) to answer to the former Argument; and he with great gravity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to answer, <hi>If our Master have nothing to say to it, I have nothing; for I know nothing but the Cannon Law: And the greatest reason that ever I could finde there, is,</hi> Nolumus <hi>and</hi> Volumus, <hi>and yet we understand that now</hi>

                  <p>Thus much we thought good to insert here, because that some Papists are not ashamed now to affirm, That they with their reasons could never be heard, but that all we did, we did by meer force; when that the whole Realme knoweth, That we ever required them to speak their judgements freely, not onely promising unto them protection and defence, but also that we should subscribe with them, if they by Gods Scriptures could confute us, and by the same Word establish their assertions. <hi>But who can correct the leasings of such as in all things shew them the sons of the Father of all lies.

There was a Law made against fornicators and adulterers, that the one and the other should be Carted thorow the Towns, and so banished, till that their repentance was offered and received. And albeit this was not the severity of Gods Law, especially against adulterers, yet was it a great bridle to the malefactors, whereat the wicked did wonderously storme. It chanced that one <hi>Sanderson</hi> a Fletcher or Boutcher, was depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to have put away his lawfull wife (under colour that he was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully parted after the manner of the Papisticall Religion) and had taken to him another in his house.

But the rascall multitude enflamed by some ungodly Crafts-men, made insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, brake the Cart, boasted and threatned the Officers, and took away the malefactor. This was the beginning of farther evils, as we shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hear.

occasion that they that same night made a mutiny; kept the Gates of the Towne, and intended to have pursued some men within their owne houses; But that upon the restitution of their Swords and Ensigne, was stayed. And yet they ceased not to molest, as well the Inhabitants of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as divers Countrey-men, taking from them money, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning some with farther injuries: Wherewith the Magistrates of the Town highly offended, took more diligent heed to such as resorted to the Town, and so apprehended one of the principall of that disorder, named <hi>Balon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Some say his name is <hi>Killone.</hi>
                     </note> a Shoo-maker, whom they put to an Assizes; and being convinced (he could not be absolved, for he was the chief man that spoyled <hi>Iohn Mubray</hi> of ten Crowns of the Sun) they thought to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted Judgement upon him, and so erected a Gibbet beneath the Crosse. (Whether it came by Paction with the Provest and some other, or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation of the Crafts-men, who ever have been bent too much to maintain such vanity and riotousnesse, we fully know not) but sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there did arise a tumult, the Tolbuith was broken up, and not onely the said <hi>Balon,</hi> who before was condemned, was violently taken forth, but also all other malefactors were set at freedome, the Gibbet was pulled downe, and despightfully broken. And thereafter, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, and some of the Councell, assembled to the Clerks Chamber for consultation. The whole rascall banded together, with some knowne and honest Crafts-men, and intended invasion on the said Chamber; which perceived, the Provest, and such as were in his company, past to the Tolbuith, suspecting nothing that they would have been so enraged, to make new pursuit, after that they had obtained their intent: But they were suddenly deceived; for from the Castle hill they came with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and with stones, Guns, and such other Weapons as they had, and began to assault the said Tolbuith, ran at the door of it, till that partly by stones cast from above, and partly by a Pistoll shot by <hi>Robert Norwell,</hi> (which hurt one <hi>Tuedy</hi>) they were repulsed from the door. But yet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed they not to cast and shoot in at the windows, threatning death to all that were within. And in very deed the malice of the Crafts-men, who were suspected to be the occasion of that tumult, bare no good will to divers of those that were with the Provest. The Arguments that the Crafts-men were the causes of that uprore, besides their first disorder that they had used before, in taking <hi>Sandersone</hi> from the execution of punishment, are two. The former, <hi>Archibald Deware, Patricke Shaugzie,</hi> with other six Deacons, came to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> and willed him to solicite the Provest and the Towne to delay the execution. Who did answer, That he had so oft solicited in their favours, that his own conscience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused him, That they used his labours for no other end, but to be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron to their impiety; for he had before made intercession for <hi>William Harlaw, Iohn Frissell,</hi> and others that were convinced of the former tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult: They proudly said, That if it was not stayed, both he and the Bayliffs should repent it. Who answered, He would not hurt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for the fear of any man: And so they departed; and the tumult, as said is, immediately thereafter did arise. The second Argument is; The tumult continued from two at afternoon, till after eight at night.



<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61872:187"/>
The Crafts-men were required to assemble themselves together for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Provest; but they past to their <hi>four hours penie,</hi> or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons Pinte, and in their jesting, said, <hi>They will be Magistrates alone, let them rule the multitude alone.</hi> And so, contrary to the Oath which they had made, they denied their assistance, counsell, &amp; comfort to the Provest and Bayliffs, which are arguments very probable that the said tumult rose by their procurement. The end thereof was, That the Provest and Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs were compelled to give their hands writs, that they should never pursue any of those that were of that tumult, for any crime that was done in that behalf. And this was proclaimed at the Crosse, after nine of the clock at night; and so was that trouble quieted: But the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vowed, That they would not spare it, nor forget it; and so a great number of that faction were absent from the Towne, till the arrivall of the Queen. The whole multitude were holden excommunicate, and were admitted to no participation of the Sacraments, untill such time as they satisfied the Magistrates, and made humble suit unto the Church. Of the death of the Queen Regent, we have heard before spoken; but of her Buriall was nothing heard. And it may appear, That such matters are unworthy of remembrance: And if all things should be rightly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we shall perceive Gods just Judgements, how secret soever that they be. Before we heard the barbarous inhumanity that was used at <hi>Leith</hi> by the French, who exposed the naked carkasses of the slain, as it were in a spectacle despighting God. We have heard that the Queen Regent rejoyced at the sight, but her joy was suddenly turned into sorrow, as we have heard.

                     <hi>That any Superstitious Rites should be used within that Realm, which God of his mercy began to repugne.</hi> And so conclusion was taken, That her Buriall should be deferred till farther advertisement;<note place="margin">

And for answer to your demand (quoth she) of my Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I do remember all these things that you have recited unto me: And I would the Queen my good sister should think that I do deferre the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute answer in this matter, and performing thereof, untill such time as I might have the advises of the Nobles and States of mine own Realme, which I trust shall not be long a doing, for I intend to make my voyage thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shortly.<note place="margin">Faire words to no purpose.</note> And though this matter (quoth she) doth touch me principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet doeth it also touch the Nobles and States of my Realm too: and therefore it shall be meet that I use their advises therein.

I do intend (quoth she) to send <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Dosell</hi> to the Queen your Mistresse my good sister, who shall declare

that unto her from me, that I trust shall suffice her.

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Yea, Madame (quoth I) in those things that be not against his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.

And though I be young, and not well learned, yet I have heard this matter oft dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by my Uncle the Cardinall, with some that thought they could say somewhat in the matter; and I found therein no great reason to change my opinion (neither yet did the high Priest, when Christ Jesus did reason in his presence. But what was the Cardinall compelled to confesse at <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie?</hi>) Madame (quoth I) if you will judge well in that matter, you must be conversant in the Scriptures, which are the Touch-stone to try the right from the wrong. Peradventure you are so partially affected to your Uncles arguments, that you could not indifferently consider the other party: Yet this I assure you, Madam (quoth I) your Uncle the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, in conference with me about these matters, hath confessed, That there be great errours and abuses come into the Church, and great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Priests and Clergie,<note place="margin">Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own disorder.</note> in so much that he desired and wished that there might be a Reformation of the one, and of the other. I have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heard him say the like (quoth she.) Then I said, Well, I trust God will inspire all you that be Princes, that there may be some good order taken in this matter, so as there may be one Unity in Religion thorow all Christendom. God grant (quoth she) but for my part you may perceive I am none of those that will change my Religion every yeer. And, as I told you in the beginning, I mean to constrain none of my subjects, but would wish that they were all as I am; and I trust they shall have no support to constrain me. I will send Monsieur <hi>Dosell</hi> (quoth she) to you before he go, to know whether ye will any thing in <hi>England.</hi> I pray you so order your self in this matter betwixt the Queen my good sister and me, that there may be perfect and assured Amity betwixt us; for I know (quoth she) Ministers may do much good and harm.

                        <p>RIght Trusty, and Right entirely Beloved Cousins, We greet you. We doubt not, but as our meaning is, and hath alwayes been, since our Raigne, in the sight of Almighty God straight and direct towards the advancement of his Honour, and Truth in Religion; and consequently, to procure Peace, and maintain Concord betwixt both these Realms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>; So also our outward acts have well declared the same to the world, and especially to you, being our neighbours, who have tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and proved in these, our friendship and earnest good will, more then we think any of your antecessors have ever received from hence; yea, more then a great number of your selves could well have hoped for of us, all former examples being well weighed and considered. And this we have to rejoyce of, and so may ye be glad, That where in the beginning of the troubles in that Countrey, and of our succours meant for you, the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or rather the malice of divers, both in that Realme and in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys was such, both to deprive both us in the yeelding, and you in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our ayd,<note place="margin">Note this false lye, and see how it answers to the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of these dayes.</note> that we were noted to have meant the surprise of that Realm, by depriving of your Soveraigne the Queen of her Crown; and you, or the greatest part of you, to have intended by our succour the like; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prefer some other to the Crown, or else to make of that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie a Common-weale; matters very slanderous and false. But the end and determination, yea, the whole course and processe of the action on both our parts have manifested, both to the slanderers, and to all others, That nothing was more meant and prosecuted, then to establish your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne the Queen, our Cousin and Sister in her State and Crowne, the possession whereof was in the hands of strangers. And although no words could then well satisfie the malicious, yet our deeds do declare, That no other



<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61872:191"/>
thing was sought, but the restitution of that Realme to the ancient Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and as it were to redeem it from Captivity. Of these our purposes and deeds,<note place="margin">The Peace and Contract at <hi>Leith.</hi>
                           </note> there remaineth among other arguments good testimony, by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Treaty and Accord made the last yeer at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners sent from us, and from your Queen, with full Authority in writing under both our Hands, and the great Seals of both our Realms, in such manner as other Princes our Progenitors have always used. By which Treaty and Accord, either of us have faithfully accorded with other, to keep Peace and Amity betwixt our selves, our Countreys and subjects. And in the same also a good Accord is made, not onely of certain things happened betwixt us, but also of some differences betwixt the Ministers of the late French King your Soveraigns husband and you the States of that Realm, for the alteration of Laws and Customs of that Countrey attempted by them. Upon which Accord there made and concluded, hath hitherto followed, as you know, surety to your Soveraignes State, quietnesse to your selves, and a better Peace betwixt both Realms, then ever was heard of in any time past. Neverthelesse how it happeneth we know not (we can, for she in her conceit thinketh her selfe Queen of both) That your Soveraigne either not knowing in this part her owne felicity, or else dangerously seduced by perverse Counsell,<note place="margin">Many Princes little regarded that.</note> whereof we are most sorry; being of late at sundry times required by us, according to her Bond with us, signed with her own Hand, and sealed with the great Seal of that Realme, and allowed by you, being the States of the same, to ratifie the said Treaty, in like manner as we by writing have done, and are ready to deliver it to her, who maketh such delatory answers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as what we shall judge thereof, we perceive by her answer, That it is fit for us to require of you: For although she hath alwayes answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed since the death of her husband, That in this matter she would first understand the mindes of certain of you, before that she would make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. And so having now of long time suspended our expectation, in the end, notwithstanding that she hath had conference both by Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and by some of your selves, being with her, yet she still delayed it, alleadging to our Ambassadour in <hi>France</hi> (who said that this Treaty was made by your consents) it was not by consent of you all; and so would have us to forbear, untill she shall returne into that her Countrey. And now seeing this her answer depended, as it should seem by her words, upon your opinions, we cannot but plainly let you all understand, That this manner of answer, without some more fruit, cannot long content us: We have meant well to our sister your Queen in time of offence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us by her We did plainly, without dissimulation, charge her in her own doubtfull state: while strangers possessed her Realme, we stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it from danger. And now, having promised to keep good Peace with her, and with you her subjects, we have observed it; and shall be sorry if either she or you shall give us contrary cause.<note place="margin">All power is not then in the Prince, if the States have any, as they have.</note> In a matter so profitable to both the Realmes, we think it strange that your Queene hath no better advice: And therefore we do require you all, being the States of that Realme, upon whom the burden resteth, to consider this matter deeply,<note place="margin">Note this,</note> and to make us answer, whereunto we may trust. And if

you shall think meet she shall thus leave the Peace imperfect, by breaking of her solemne promise, contrary to the order of all Princes, we shall be well content to accept your answer, and shall be as carelesse to see the Peace, as ye shall give us cause; And doubt not, by the grace of God, but whosoever of you shall incline thereto, shall soonest repent. You must be content with our plain writing. And on the other side, if you continue all in one minde, to have the Peace inviolably kept, and shall so by your advice procure the Queen to ratifie it, we also plainly promise you, That we will also continue our good disposition to keep the same in such good termes as now it is: And in so doing, the honour of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God shall be duely sought and promoted in both Realms, The Queen your Soveraigne shall enjoy her State with your surety, and your selves possesse that which ye have with tranquility; to the encrease of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Posterities, which by the frequent Wars heretofore your ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors never had long in one state. To conclude, we require you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise us of what minde you be, specially if you all continue in that minde, that you mean to have the Peace betwixt both the Realmes perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually kept: And if you shall forbear any longer to advertise us, ye shall give us some occasion of doubt, whereof more hurt may grow then good. <hi>From, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:61872:197"/>
my simple Answers: And first, (said he) if to teach the Word of God in sincerity, if to rebuke Idolatry, and to will a people to worship God, according to his Word, be to raise Subjects against their Princes, then cannot I bee excused; for it hath pleased God of his mercy, to make me one (amongst many) to disclose unto this Realme the vanitie of the Papisticall Religion, and the deceit, pride, and tyranny of that <hi>Romane</hi> Antichrist:<note place="margin">Let this be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diligently.</note> But Madame, if the true knowledge of God and his right worshipping be the chief cause which must move men to obey their just Princesse from their heart, (as it is most certain that they are) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in can I be reprehended?<note place="margin">Let the Prince note this.</note> I thinke, and am surely perswaded, that your Majestie has had, and presently hath as unfained obedience of such as professe Christ Jesus within this Realm, as ever your Father or Progenitours had of those that were called Bishops: And touching that Booke that seemeth so highly to offend your Majestie, it is most certaine, that if I wrote it, I am content that all the learned of the world judge of it: I heare that an Englishman hath written against it, but I have not read him; if hee hath sufficiently confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my reasons, and established his contrary Propositions, with as evident testimonies, as I have done mine; I shall not bee obstinate but shall confesse mine errour and ignorance. But to this houre I have thought, and yet thinkes my selfe alone more able to sustaine the things affirmed in that my Work, than any ten in Europe shall be able to confute it.</p>
                  <p>You thinke (said shee) that I have no just Authoritie: Please your Majestie, (said he) that learned men in all ages have had their judgements free, and most commonly disagreeing from the Common judgement of the world;<note place="margin">Let this wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But (said shee) you speake of women in generall; most true it is Madame, (said the other;) and yet plainly appeareth to me, that wisedome should perswade your Majestie never to raise trouble



<pb n="312" facs="tcp:61872:198"/>
for that which this day hath not troubled your Majestie, neither in person, nor in anxietie. For of late yeeres many things which before were holden Stable have been called in doubt; yea, they have been plainely impugned. But yet, Madame, I am assured, That neither Protestant nor Papist, shall be able to prove, That any such Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was at any time moved, in publike or in private. Now, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, said he, if I had intended to trouble your State, because you are a woman; I might have chosen a time more convenient for that purpose then I can do now, when your own presence is within the Realme.</p>
                  <p>But now, Madame, shortly to answer to the other two accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I heartily praise my God, through Jesus Christ, that Satan, the enemy of mankinde, and the wicked of the World, have no other crimes to lay to my charge, then such as the very World it selfe knoweth to be most false and vaine. For in <hi>England</hi> I was resident onely the space of five yeeres. The places were <hi>Barwick,</hi> where I abode two yeeres; So long in <hi>New-castle</hi>; And a yeere in <hi>London.</hi> Now,<note place="margin">Note this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</note> Madame, if in any of these places, during the time that I was there, any man shall be able to prove, That there was either Battell, Sedition, or Mutinie, I shall confesse, That I my selfe was the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour, and shedder of the blood. I am not ashamed further to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, That God so blessed my weake labours then in <hi>Barwick</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then commonly used to be slaughter, by reason of quarrells that used to arise amongst Souldiers) there was also great quietnesse, all the time that I remained there, as there is this day in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And where they slander me of Magick, Necromancie, or of any other Art forbidden of God, I have witnesse (besides mine owne conscience) all the Congregations that ever heard me, what I speak, both against such acts, and against those that use such impietie: But seeing the wicked of the world said, That my Master the Lord Jesus was possessed with <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> I must patiently beare; Albeit that I, wretched sinner, be unjustly accused, of those that never delighted in the Veritie.</p>

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61872:198"/>
been upon the face of the earth? <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellows were subjects to <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar,</hi> and unto <hi>Darius,</hi> and yet (Madame) they would not be of their Religion, neither of the one, nor of the other; For the three Children said, <hi>We make it knowne to thee, O King, That we will not worship thy Gods.</hi> And <hi>Daniel</hi> did pray publikely unto his God, against the expresse Commandment of the King: And so, Madame, ye may perceive that Subjects are not bound to the Religion of their Princes, albeit they are commanded to give them obedience. Yea, (quoth she) none of these men raised their Sword against their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Yet Madame (quoth he) ye cannot deny but they resisted: For those that obey not the Commandments given, in some sort resist. But yet (said she) they resisted not by the Sword. God (said she) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame) had not given them the power and the meanes. Thinke you (said she) That Subjects, having power, may resist their Princes? If Princes do exceed their Bounds (quoth he) Madame, and doe against that wherefore they should be obeyed, there is no doubt but they may be resisted, even by Power: For there is neither greater Honour, nor greater Obedience to be given to Kings and Princes, then God hath commadned to be given to Father and Mother: But so it is, That the Father may be stricken with a Phrenzie, in the which he would slay his owne Children;<note place="margin">Note this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</note> Now, Madame, if the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren arise, joyn themselves together, apprehend the Father, take the Sword or other Weapon from him, and finally, binde his hands, and keepe him in Prison till that his Phrensie be over-past, Thinke ye (Madame) that the children do any wrong? Or thinke ye, Madame, that God will be offended with them that have stayed their Father from committing wickednesse. It is even so (said he) Madame, with Princes that would murther the children of God, that are subject unto them.<note place="margin">Blinde zeal, what it is.</note> Their blinde zeale is nothing but a very mad phrenzie; and therefore to take the sword from them, to binde their hands,<note place="margin">When this was written there was no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Maries</hi> imprisonment.</note> and to cast them into prison, till that they be brought to a more sober minde, is no disobedience against Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but just obedience, because that it agreeth with the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>At these words the Queene stood, as it were amazed, more then a quarter of an houre; her countenance altered, so that the Lord <hi>Iames</hi> began to entreat her, and to demand, What hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you, Madame? At length she said, Well, then I perceive that my Subjects shall not onely obey you, and not me; And shall do what they list, and not what I command, and so must I be subject unto them, and not they to me. God forbid (answered he) that ever I take upon me to command any to obey me, or yet to set Subjects at liberty, to do whatsoever please them; but my travell is, That both Princes and Subjects obey GOD. And thinke not (said he) Madame, that wrong was done unto you, when you are willed to be subject unto GOD, for



<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61872:199"/>
it is he that subjects the people under Princes, and causes obedience to be given unto them; yea, God craves of Kings, That they be, as it were, Foster-Fathers to the Church, and commands Queens to be Nourishers unto his People. And this subjection (Madame) unto God, and to his troubled Church, is the greatest dignity that flesh can get upon the face of the earth, for it shall carry them to everlasting glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Queens Church.</note>Yea (quoth she) but ye are not the Church that I will nourish; I will defend the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for I think it is the true Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Your will (quoth he) Madame, is no reason, neither doth your thought make that Romane Harlot to be the Immaculate Spouse of Jesus Christ. And wonder not, Madame, that I call <hi>Rome</hi> an Harlot; for that Church is altogether polluted with all kinde of Spirituall Fornication, as well in Doctrine, as in Manners: yea, Madam, I offer my selfe further to prove, That the Church of the Jewes, who crucified Jesus Christ, when that they manifestly denied the Sonne of God, was not so farre degenerated from the Ordinances and Statutes which God gave by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> unto his People, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is declined, and more then five hundred yeers hath declined from the Purity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which the Apostles taught and planted.<note place="margin">Strong Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, called conscience.</note> My conscience (said she) is not so. Conscience, Madame (said he) requires knowledge; and I fear that of right knowledge you have but little. But (said she) I have both heard and read. So, Madame (said he) did the Jewes that cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Christ Jesus, reade both the Law and the Prophets, and heard the same interpreted, after their manner. Have ye heard (said he) any teach, but such as the Pope and his Cardinalls have allowed? And you may be assured,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Question.</hi>
                     </note> That such will speak nothing to offend their owne state. Ye interpret the Scriptures (said she) in one manner, and they in another; Whom shall I believe, and who shall be Judge? Believe (said he) God, that plainly speaketh in his Word: And further then the Word teacheth you, ye shall neither believe the one nor the other. The Word of God is plain in it self; And if there appear any obscurity in one place, the holy Ghost, which is never contrarious to himself, explains the same more clearly in other places: So that there can remaine no doubt, but unto such as obstinately will remaine ignorant. And now, Madame, (said he) to take one of the chief Points which this day is in controversie betwixt the Papists and us, for example. The Papists alleadge, and boldly have affirmed, That the Masse is the Ordinance of God, and the Institution of Jesus Christ, and a Sacrifice for the quick and the dead. We deny both the one and the other, and affirme, That the Masse, as it is now used, is nothing but the Invention of man; and therefore it is an Abomination before God, and no Sacrifice that ever God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Now (Madame) who shall judge betwixt us, two thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending? It is not reason that either of the persons be further believed, then they are able to prove by insuspect witnessing: Let them lay downe the Book of God, and by the plain words prove their affirmatives, and we shall give unto them the play granted. But so long as they are bold to affirme, and yet do prove nothing, we must say, That albeit all the



<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61872:199"/>
world believe them, yet believe they not God, but do receive the lyes of men for the Truth of God. What our Master Christ Jesus did, we know by his Evangelists: What the Priests do at the Masse, the world seeth. Now doth not the Word of God plainly assure us, That Christ Jesus neither said, nor yet commanded Masse to be said at his last Supper, seeing that no such thing as the Masse is made mention of within the whole Scriptures. You are over-hard for me (said the Queen) but if they were here whom I have heard, they would answer you. Madame, (said the other) would to God that the learnedest Papist in <hi>Europe,</hi> and he that you would best believe were present with your Majestie to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain the argument; and that ye would abide patiently to hear the matter reasoned to the end; for then I doubt not, Madame, but that you should hear the vanity of the Papisticall Religion, and what small ground it hath within the Word of God. Well (said she) ye may perchance get that sooner then you believe. Assuredly (said the other) if ever I get that in my self, I get it sooner then I believe; for the ignorant Papist cannot patiently reason, and the learned and crafty Papist will never come in your audience (Madame) to have the ground of their Religion searched out; for they know they are not able to maintain any argument, except by fire and sword, and their own Laws be judges. So say you (quoth the Queen) and I believe it hath been to this day. (Quoth he) for how oft have the Papists in this and in other Realmes, been required to come to conference, and yet could it never be obtained, unlesse themselves were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for Judges: and therefore I must yet say again, That they dare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dispute, but where themselves are both judges and party. And when you shall let me see the contrary, I shall grant my self to be deceived in that Point.

Hope, Adam Fullartoun, &amp;c.</hi> Bayliffs, caused proclaim according to the former Statutes of the Town, That no Adulterer nor Fornicator, no noted Drunkard, no Masse-monger, no obstinate Papist that corrupted the people, such as Priests, Friers, and others of that sort, should be found within 41 hours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, under the Pains contained in the Statutes: Which blowne in the Queens ears, there began pride and maliciousnesse to shew it selfe; for without further cogitation of the cause, was the Provest and Bayliffes charged to Ward in the Castle, and immediately was Commandment given, That other Provests and Bayliffs should be elected.</p>
                  <p>Some gainstood for a while: The new Election alleadged, That the Provest and Bayliffs whom they had chosen, and to whom they had given their Oath, had committed no offence; therefore that justly they might be deprived. But while Charge was doubled upon Charge, and no man found to oppose himself to impiety, the misled Queens Letter and wicked will is obeyed, as just Law. And so was M. <hi>Thomas Makalan</hi> chosen Provest for the other. The man, no doubt, was both discreet, and sufficient for that Charge; but the deposition of the other was against all Law. God be mercifull to some of our owne, for they were not all blamelesse, that the Queens unreasonable will was so far obeyed.</p>
                  <p>A contrary Proclamation was publikely made, That the Town should be patent to all the Queens Lieges: And so Murtherers, Adulterers, Theeves (Whores,<note place="margin">Yet in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament holden 1563. there is an expresse Act for punishing of Adultery by death.

But Secretary <hi>Lethington,</hi> alleadging, That there stood much in the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, said, That he should write: But that was onely to drive time, as the trueth declared it selfe. The Queenes partie urged, <hi>That the Queen should have her Religion free in her own Chappell, to do, she and her houshold, what they list.</hi> The Ministers affirmed, and Voted the contrary; adding, <hi>That her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty should be their thraldome, ere it be long.</hi> But neither could reason nor threatning move the affections of such as were creeping in Credit, and so did the Votes of the Lords prevaile against the Ministers.</p>
                  <p>For the punishment of Theft and Reafe, which had encreased upon the border: and in the South from the Queenes arrivall, was the Lord <hi>Iames</hi> made Lieutenant, some suspected that such honour and charge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the same heart and counsell that <hi>Saul</hi> made <hi>David</hi> Captain against the Philistines; but God assisted and bowed the hearts of men, both to feare and obey him; yea, the Lord <hi>Bothwell</hi> himselfe at that time assisted him, but he had remission for <hi>Liddisdall,</hi> except that execution was there made in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for <hi>her twenty eight of one clan, and other,</hi> were hanged at that Justice Court, bribes, budds, or sollicitation, saved not the guilty, if he might be apprehended.

of <hi>Hallyrud-house,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Coldingham</hi> kept the Watch by course; Skouts were set forth, and Sentinels, upon pain of death, were commanded to keep their Stations. And yet they feared where there was no fear, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet could ever any appearance or suspition of such things be tried. Shortly after the returning of the Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> there came from the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>Peter Mewtes,</hi> with Commission to require the Ratification of the Peace made at <hi>Leith.</hi> Her answer was, even such as we have heard before; That she behoved to advise, and then she should answer. In presence of her Councell she kept her selfe grave; for under the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weed and apparell she could dissemble in full perfection: but how soon that ever the French people had her alone, they told her, That since she came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> she saw nothing there but gravity, which repugned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to her breeding, for she was brought up in joviality, so tearmed she her Dancing, and other things thereto belonging.</p>
                  <p>The generall Assembly of the Church approached, holden in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, after the Queens arrivall, in the which began the rulers of the Court to draw themselves apart from the Societie of their brethren, and began to strive and grudge, That any thing should be consulted upon, without their advices, Master <hi>Iohn Wood,</hi> who before had shewed himselfe very fervent in the Cause of God, and forward in giving of his councell in all doubtfull matters, refused to assist the Assembly again, whereof many did wonder;<note place="margin">Division be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lords and the Ministers.</note> The Courtiers drew unto them some of the Lords, and would not conveane with their Brethren, as before they were accustomed, but kept themselves in the Abbey; The principall Commissioners of the Church, the Superintendents, and some Ministers, past unto them, where they were assembled in the Abbots Lodging within <hi>Hallyrud-house,</hi> both the parties began to open their griefes; The Lords complained, That the Ministers drew the Gentlemen into secret, and held Councell without their knowledge: The Ministers denied, That they had done any thing in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, otherwise then the common Order commanded them; And accused the Lords (the flatterers of the Queen we meane) that they kept not the Convention with their Brethren; considering, That they knew the Order, and that the same was appointed by their own advice, as the Book of Discipline subscribed with the most part of their own hands would wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; some began to deny, That ever they knew such a thing as the Book of Discipline: And called also in doubt, Whether it was expedient, that such Assemblies should be or not: for gladly would the Queen and her secret Councell have had all Assemblies of the godly discharged;<note place="margin">The Queen fain would have had all Assemblies discharged.</note> The reasoning was sharpe and quicke on either side: The Queens faction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, That it was suspicious to Princes, that Subjects should assemble themselves, and keep Conventions without their knowledge. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That without knowledge of the Princes, the Church did nothing, for the Princes perfectly understood, That within this Realme was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church; and that they had their Orders and appointed times of Convention. And so without knowledge of the Princes, they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Yea (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) the Queen knew, and knoweth well enough; But the Question is, Whether that the Queen alloweth such Conventions: It was answered, If the Libertie of the Church should stand upon the

In the which, the judgements and gravitie of many may occurre, to correct or represse the follies or errours of a few. Hereunto consented the most part, as well of the Nobility as of the Barrons, and willed the reasoners for the Queen to be sent to her Majestie, if that she stood in suspition of any thing that was to be handled in their assemblies, that it would please her Majestie to send such as he would appoint, to hear whatsoever was propounded or reasoned.</p>
                  <p>Hereafter was the Book of Discipline proposed, and desired to have been ratified by the Queens Majestie, but it was stopped, and the Question demanded, How many of those that subscribed to that Book would be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto it?<note place="margin">Note this dil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One, to wit <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> answered, Albeit ye think that scoffe proper, yet as it is most untrue, so it is most improper:<note place="margin">Note this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</note> That Book was read in publike audience; and by the space of divers dayes, the hearers thereof were resolved, as all that here sit know well enough, and you your selves cannot deny; So that no man was required to subscribe that which he understood not: Stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, said one, that Booke will not be obtained: Let God (said the other) require the lack and want which this poor Common-wealth shall have of the things therein contained, from the hands of such as stop the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Borrows</hi> perceiving that the Book of discipline was refused, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto the Councill certain Articles, requiring Idolatry to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, their Churches to be planted with true Ministers, and some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain propositions to be made for them, according to equitie and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for unto that time the most part of the Ministers, had lived upon the benevolence of men; for many had into their owne hands the profits that the Bishops, and others of that Sect had before abused, and so some part was bestowed upon the Ministers.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:61872:202"/>But when the Bishops began to gripe again to that, which most unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they called their own: for the Earle of <hi>Arrane</hi> was discharged of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dumfermling,</hi> wherewith before by vertue of a Factory and Commission, he had intromitted and medled: And so were many others. Therefore the Barons required, That order might be taken for the Ministers, or else they would no more cause Rents to be paid unto any, that formerly belonged to the Church-men, nor suffer any thing to be collected for the use of any whosoever, after the Queenes arrivall, then that they did before; for they verily supposed, that the Queens Majestie would keep promise made to them, which was, Not to alter their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which could not remain without Ministers; and Ministers could not live without provision: And therefore they heartily desired the Councell to provide some convenient order in that behalf. This somewhat moved the Queens flatterers, for the Rod of impiety was not then strengthened in her and their hands. And so began they to practise how they might please the Queen, and yet seem somewhat to satisfie the faithfull; And so devised they, That the Church-men should have intromission and medling with the two parts of their Benefices; and that the third part should be gathered by such men as thereto should be appointed for such uses; As in these subsequent Acts are more fully expressed.</p>

                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:61872:204"/>The Lords of secret Councell that were present at the Voting and making of the aforesaid Acts, were <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>Chattellarault, George</hi> Earle of <hi>Huntley, Archibald</hi> Earle of <hi>Argyle, William</hi> Earle <hi>Mershall, Iohn</hi> Earle <hi>Atholl, William</hi> Earle of <hi>Montrosse, Iames</hi> Earle <hi>Morton, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> Earle of <hi>Glencarne, Iames</hi> Commendator of Saint <hi>Andrews, Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Erskin,</hi> The Treasurer, The Justice Clerke, The Steward and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller.</p>
                  <p>For the first Acts, the Earle of <hi>Huntley</hi> said jestingly, <hi>Good morrow, my Lords of the two parts.</hi> The whole Rentals being gathered, the sum of the third, according to their own calculation, was found to extend to, &amp;c. The Ministers even in the beginning of publike Sermons opposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to such corruption, for they foresaw the purposes of the Devill, and clearly understood the Butt whereat the Queene and her flatterers Shot.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> his judgement of the thirds.</note> And so in the chaire of <hi>Edinburgh Iohn Knox</hi> said, <hi>Well, if the end of this Order, pretended to be taken for sustentation of the Ministers, be happy, my judgement failes me; for I am assured, That the Spirit of God is not the Authour of it, for first I see two parts freely given to the Devill, and the third must be divided between God and the Devill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, said he, beare witnesse to me, that this day I said it, Ere it be long the Devill shall have three parts of the third; and judge you then, what Gods portion will be. This was an unsavory saying in the eares of many; Some were not ashamed to affirme, <hi>That the Ministers being sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Queen will not get at the yeers end, to buy her a paire of new shoes.</hi> And this was Secretary <hi>Lethington.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were appointed to modifie the Ministers stipends, The Earle of <hi>Argyle, Murray,</hi> and <hi>Morton, Lethington,</hi> Justice <hi>Clarke,</hi> and Clerke of the Register. The Laird of <hi>Pittaro,</hi> was appointed to pay the Ministers Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, according to their Modification:<note place="margin">Let this be noted.</note> Who would have thought that when <hi>Ioseph</hi> ruled <hi>Egypt,</hi> that his brethren should have travelled for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and have returned with empty Sacks unto their families; men would rather have thought that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Pose, Treasure, and Gilnells should rather have been diminished then that the houshold of <hi>Iacob</hi> should stand in danger to starve for hunger.</p>
                  <p>But so busie and circumspect were the Modificators (because it was a new Office the terme must also be new) that the Ministers should not be over-wanton; That a hundred <note n="*" place="margin">That is, five old pieces.</note> Marks was sufficient to a single man, being a common Minister: Three hundred Marks was the highest that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to any, except the Superintendents, and a few others; shortly, Whether it was the ingratitude of their own hearts, or the care that they had to enrich the Queene, we know not: But the poore Ministers, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Exhorters, cryed out to the heaven (as their complaints in all assemblies do witnesse) That neither were they able to live upon the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends appointed, neither could they get payment of that small thing that was appointed, so faine would the Controllers have played the good Vallet,<note place="margin">A proverb up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pittaro,</hi> Controller.</note> and have satisfied the Queen, or else their own profit: <hi>The good Laird of</hi> Pittaro <hi>was an earnest Professour of Christ, but the great Devill receive the Controller,</hi> for he and his Collectours are become greedy factors. To put an end to this unpleasing matter; When the brethren complained

of their poverty; it was disdainfully answered of some, There are many Lairds that have not so much to spend, when men did reason, that the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Ministers craved of them, books, quietnesse, study, and travell to edifie the Church of Christ Jesus, when many Lairds were waiting upon their worldly businesse; and therefore that the stipends of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who had no other industry, but to live upon that which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, ought not to be mollified according to the living of other common men, who might and did daily augment their Rents by some other industry. When such reasons were laid before them, they got none other answer, but, The Queen can spare no greater Sums; Oft was it cryed out in their ears, <hi>O happy servants of the Devill, and miserable servants of Iesus Christ, if after this life there were nor Hell nor Heaven:</hi> For to the servants of the Devill, these dumbe Dogs, and horrid Bishops; To one of those idle bellies, I say, ten thousand was not enough, but to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ, that painfully preach his Evangell, a hundreth will suffice; how can that be sustained?</p>
                  <p>One day in reasoning of this matter, the Secretary burst out in a piece of his collor, and said, The Ministers have thus much payed unto them by year, who ever yet said to the Queen, Grand mercies for it? was there ever a Minister that gave thanks to God for her Majesties liberalitie towards them? One singled, and answered, Assuredly, I think, that such as receive any thing <hi>gratis</hi> of the Queen, are unthankfull if they acknowledge it not, both in heart and minde: But whether the Ministers be of that rank, or not, I greatly doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>gratis</hi> I am sure they receive nothing, and whether they receive any at all from the Queen,<note place="margin">The right that Princes have to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church.</note> wise men may reason; I am assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that neither third nor two parts ever appertained to any of her Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors within this Realm these thousand years last past, neither yet hath the Queens Flatterers better title to that which she usurpes, be it in-giving to others, or taken it to her self, then the souldiers who crucified Jesus Christ had to divide his Garments amongst them. And if the truth may be spoken, she hath not so good Title as they had, for such spoile ought to be the reward of such men. And in that point the Souldiers were more gentle than the Queenes Flatterers, for they parted not the Garments of our Saviour, till that he himself was hung upon the Crosse; but her Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers do part the spoil whilest that poor Christ is yet preaching amongst you. But the wisedome of our God taketh tryall of us by this meanes, knowing well enough what the Court faction have purposed to do: Let the Papists, who have the two parts, some that have their thirds free, and some that have gotten Abbeys, and few Lands, thanke the Queen, and King, <hi>Placebo Domine,</hi> the poore Preachers will not yet flatter, for feeding of their bellies.

In the which, if hereafter you shall be found fainter then you have been formerly, it will be said, That your Wife hath changed your nature. The greatnesse of the Bankquet, and the vanitie used thereat, offended many Godly; There began the Masking, which from yeer to yeer, hath continued since. Master <hi>Randolph,</hi> Agent for the Queen of <hi>England</hi> was then, and sometime after in no small esteem with our Queen: For his Mistris sake, she did drink to him in a Cup of Gold, which he possessed with great joy, more for the favour of the giver, then of the gift, and value thereof, and yet it was honourable.

                  <p>These Supplications was presented by divers Gentlemen; the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers of the Court at first stormed, and asked who durst avow it?

Cardinalls commonly use, as the Mask and Dancing of <hi>Orleans</hi> can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; wherein virgins and mens wives were made common to King <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Charles</hi> the Cardinall, and to their Courtiers and Pages, as common women in <hi>Bordells</hi> are unto their Companions. The manner was thus: At the entry of King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in the Town of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, Virgins,<note place="margin">The Mask of <hi>Orleance.</hi>
                     </note> and mens wives were commanded to present themselves in the Kings Palace to dance: And they obeyed; for commonly the French Nation <hi>is not very hard to be entreated to vanity.</hi> After Fidling and Fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> had espied his prey, he said to the King, <hi>Sire le premiere est a vous, &amp; fault queje soy le second:</hi> that is, <hi>Sir, the first choyce is yours, and I must be the second.</hi> And so the King got the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, that he had his first Election. But because Cardinalls are companions to Kings, the Cardinall had the next. And thereafter the Torches were put out, and every man commanded to provide for himself the best he might. What cry there was of husbands for their wives, and wives for their husbands, of ancient matrons for their daughters, of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins for their friends, for some honest men to defend their pudicity, <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> will remember more Kings dayes then one. This horrible villany, a fruit of the Cardinalls good Catholike Religion, we shortly touch, to let the world understand, what subjects may look for of such Magistrates; for such Pastime to them is Jollity. It had been good for our Queene, that she had been brought up in better company, both for her credit, and for the course of her life: And it may be, that her excellent naturall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duements had been better employed for her reputation and happinesse, then they were to her great misfortune, and to the grief of those that wished her truely well. But punishment of that enormity, and fearfull attempt, we could get none. Yea, more and more they presumed to do violence, and frequented nightly Masking, and began to bear the matter very heavily. At length the Dukes friends began to assemble in the night time on the calsay or street. The Abbot of <hi>Kylwinning,</hi> who then was joyned to the Church, and so, as we understand, yet abideth, was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall man at the beginning. To him repaired many faithfull, and amongst others, came <hi>Andrew Stewart,</hi> Lord <hi>Uchiltrie,</hi> a man rather borne to make peace, then to brag upon the calsey, he demanded the quarrell: And being informed of the former enormity, said, <hi>Nay, such impiety shall not be suffered, so long as God shall assist us: The Victory that God hath in his owne mercy given us, we will by his grace maintaine.</hi> And so he commanded his son <hi>Andrew Stewart,</hi> then Master, and his servants, to put themselves in order,<note place="margin">The <hi>Hamiltons</hi> against <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and the Marquesse.</note> and to bring forth their spears and long weapons; and so did others. The word came to the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> and his son, that the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were upon the street: vows was made, that the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> should be driven, not onely out of the Town, but also out of the Countrey. Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Coldingham</hi> married the E. <hi>Bothwels</hi> sister (a sufficient woman for such a man) Alliance drew Lord <hi>Robert,</hi> and so they joyned with the E. <hi>Bothwell.</hi> But the stoutnes of the Marq. <hi>le Beuf</hi> (<hi>d'Albuff</hi> they call him, is most to be commended; for in his Chalmer in the Abbey, he start to an Halbert, and ten men were scarce able to hold him that night, and the danger was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Crosse and Tron; and so he was a long quarter of a mile from the shot &amp; sklenting of Bolts. The M. of <hi>Maxw.</hi> (after L. <hi>Herreis</hi> gave declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to the Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> That if he stirred forth of his Lodging, he, and all that assist him, should resist him in the face. Whose words did somewhat beat down that blast. The Earles of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Huntley</hi> being in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, where the Marquesse was, came with their company sent from the Queen, to stay that tumult; as they did, for <hi>Bothwell</hi> and his were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded under pain of Treason, to keep their lodgings.</p>
                  <p>It was whispered by many, That the Earle of <hi>Murray's</hi> displeasure was as much sought, as any hatred that the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> did bear against the Earle of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> or yet he against them. And in very deed, either had the Duke very false servants, or else by <hi>Huntley</hi> and the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> the Earle of <hi>Murray's</hi> death was oftener conspired then once; the suspition whereof burst forth so far, that upon a day the said Earle being upon horse to have come to the Sermon, was charged by one of the Dukes own servants, to turn and abide with the Queen. The fame whereof spread over all: What ground it had, we cannot say; but shortly after, the Duke, and some of the Lords, remained at <hi>Glasgow</hi>; their conclusion was not known. The Earle of <hi>Arrane</hi> came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> lay. The Queen and the Court were departed to <hi>Fyfe,</hi> and remained sometimes in S. <hi>Androes,</hi> and sometimes in <hi>Falkland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> by means of <hi>Iames Barron</hi> Burgesse, and then Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> desired to speak with <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> secretly; which the said <hi>Iohn</hi> gladly granted, and spake with him upon a night, first in the said <hi>Iames</hi> his lodging,<note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Bothwells</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> 1562.</note> and after in his own Study: The sum of all their conference and communication was; The said Lord lamented his inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate life; and especially, That he was provoked by the enticements of the Queen Regent, to do that which he sore repented, as well against the Laird of <hi>Ormestoun,</hi> whose blood was spilt, albeit not by his faults: But his chief grief was, That he had misbehaved himself toward the Earle of <hi>Arrane,</hi> whose favour he was most willing to redeem, if possible it were that so he might: For (said he) if I might have my Lord <hi>Arranes</hi> favour, I would aye wait upon the Court with a Page and a few servants, to spare my expence; where now I am compelled to keep for my own safety a number of wicked and unprofitable men, to the utter destruction of my state that is left. To which the said <hi>Iohn</hi> answered, My Lord, would to God that in me were Counsell and Judgement, that might comfort and relieve you; for albeit that to this hour it hath not happened to me to speak with your Lordship face to face, yet have I born a good minde to your house; and have been sorry at my heart of the trouble that I have heard you to be involved in; for (my Lord) my great Grandfather, Grandfather, and Father, have served your Lordships Predecessors, and some of them have died under their standers; and this is a part of the Obligation of our Scotish kindenesse:<note place="margin">Note the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement.</note> but this is not the chiefe; But as God hath made me his publike Messenger of glad Tydings, so it is my earnest desire that all men may embrace it, which perfectly they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, so long as there remaineth in them rankor, malice, or envie: I am sorry that you have given occasion unto men to be offended with you: But more sorrowfull, That you have offended the Majesty of God; wherefore he often punisheth the other sins of man: And therefore my



<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61872:207"/>
counsell is, That you begin at God, with whom if you enter into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reconciliation, I doubt not but he shall bow the hearts of men to forget all offences.<note place="margin">Note dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> And as for me, if you will continue in godlinesse, your Lordship shall command me as boldly, as any that serves your Lordship. The said Lord desired him that he would trie the Earle of <hi>Arrans</hi> minde, If he would be content to accept him in his favour: Which he promised to do. And so earnestly he travelled in the matter; and it was once brought to such an end, as all the faithfull praised God for such agreement: The greatest stay stood upon the satisfaction of the Laird of <hi>Ormestoune,</hi> (who beside his former hurt, as is before declared, was even at that time of the coming, pursued by the said Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and his son Master <hi>Alexander Cockburne</hi> was taken by him, and carried by him to <hi>Berwicke,</hi> but courteously enough sent back again. The new trouble so greatly displeased <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> that he almost gave over fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther travelling for amity: But yet upon excuse of the said Earle, and upon declaration of his minde, he re-entred into labour, and so brought it to passe, that the Laird of <hi>Ormestoun</hi> referred his satisfaction in all things to the Judgement of the Earles of <hi>Arrane</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> to whom the said Earle submitted himselfe in that Head: And thereupon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his hand writing; and so was conveyed by vertue of his friends, to the Lodging of the Church of <hi>Field,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reconciliation betwixt the Earle of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Bothwell.</hi>
                     </note> where the Earle of <hi>Arrane</hi> was with his friends, and the said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> with him, to beare witnesse and testification of the end of the Agreement. As the Earle of <hi>Bothwell</hi> entred the Chamber, and would have done those Honours that friends had appointed, Master <hi>Gabriel Hamilton,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Kilwinning,</hi> and the Laird of <hi>Richardton,</hi> were the chief friends that communed, the said Earle of <hi>Arrane</hi> gently past unto him, embraced him, and said, If the hearts be upright, few Ceremonies will serve, and content me. The said <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> in audience of them both, and of their friends, said, Now, my Lords, God hath brought you together by the labour of simple men, in respect of such as would have travelled therein: I know my labours are already taken in evill part; but because I have the testimony of a good conscience before God, That whatsoever I have done, it is in his fear, for the profit of you both, for the hurt of none, and for the tranquility of this Realm: Seeing therefore that my conscience beareth witnesse to me what I have sought, and do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually seek, I the more patiently bear the misreports, and wrongfull judgements of men. And now I leave you in Peace, and desire you who are the friends, to study that Amity may encrease, all former ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred forget. The friends on either party embraced other; and the two Earles departed to a window, and talked by themselves a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able space. And thereafter the Earle of <hi>Bothwell</hi> departed for that night, and upon the next day in the morning returned with some of his honest friends, and came to the Sermon with the said Earle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at many rejoyced. But God had another work to work, then the eyes of men could espie. The Thursday next they dined together; and thereafter the said Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and Master <hi>Gabriel Hamilton,</hi> rode to the Duke, who then was in <hi>Enmell:</hi> what communication was betwixt

them, it is not certainly knowne; but by the report which the said Earle of <hi>Arrane</hi> made to the Queen, and unto the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> by his writings, for upon the third day after their Reconciliation, the Sermon being ended, the said Earle of <hi>Arrane</hi> came to the house of the said <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> and brought with him Master <hi>Richard Strange,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Guthrie,</hi> to whom he opened the grief of his minde before that <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was called; for he was busie, as commonly he used to be after his Sermon, in directing of writings: Which ended, the said Earle called the three together, and said, I am reasonably betrayed, and with these words began to weep. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> demanded, My Lord, Who hath betrayed you? One <hi>Iudas</hi> or other (said he) I know it is but my life that is sought; I regard it not. The other said, My Lord, I understand no such dark manner of speech; if I shall give you any answer, you must speak more plainly. Well (said he) I take you three to witnesse, That I open this unto you, and I write it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queen: An act of Treason is laid to my Charge. The Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> hath showne to me in Councell, That he shall take the Queen and put her in my hands, in the Castle of <hi>Dumbartane</hi>; And that he shall slay the Earle of <hi>Murray, Lethinton,</hi> and others that now mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guide her, and so shall he and I rule all. But I know this is devised to accuse me of Treason; for I know he will informe the Queen of it: But I take you to witnesse, That I open it here unto you: And I will passe incontinent, and write to the Queens Majesty, and unto my Brother the Earle of <hi>Murray. Iohn Knox</hi> demanded, Did you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (my Lord) to any part of that Treason? He answered, No. Then (said he) in my judgement his words,<note place="margin">Note dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> although they were spoken, can never be Treason to you; for the performance of the Fact depends upon your will, whereunto ye say ye have disassented; and so shall that purpose vanish and die of it selfe, unlesse that you waken it; For it is not to be supposed, That he will accuse you of that, which he himselfe hath devised, and whereunto you would not consent. Oh (said he) you understand not what craft is used against me: It is Treason to conceale Treason. My Lord (said he) Treason must import consent and determination, which I hear on neither of your parts: And therefore (my Lord) in my judgement, it will be more sure, and more Honourable unto you, to depend upon your your Innocency, and to abide the unjust accusation of any other (if any follow thereof) as I thinke there shall not) then to accuse, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after so late reconciliation. I know (said he) That he will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Combate unto me, but that would not be suffered in <hi>France:</hi> But I will do that which I have purposed. And so he departed, and took with him to his Lodging the said Master <hi>Alexander Guthrie,</hi> and Master <hi>Richard Strange,</hi> from whence was written and endited a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Queens Majestie, according to the former purpose: which Letter was directed with all diligence unto her Majesty, who then was in <hi>Falkland.</hi> The Earle himselfe rode after to <hi>Kinneill</hi> to his Father the Duke; but how he was used, we have but the common bruit. But from thence he wrote a Letter with his owne hand in



<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61872:208"/>
Cyphers to the Earle of <hi>Murry,</hi> complaining of his rigorous handling and entertainment by his owne father and friends. And assured fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That he feared his life, in case he got not sudden rescue. But thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he remained not, but broke the Chamber wherein he was put, and with great pain passed to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and from thence was conveyed to the Haly-yards, where he was kept till that the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> came unto him, and conveyed him to the Queen, then being in <hi>Falkland,</hi> who then was sufficiently instructed in the whole matter; and upon suspition conceived, had caused to apprehend Master <hi>Gawan Hamilton</hi> and the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> aforesaid, who knowing nothing of the former advertisements, came to <hi>Falkland,</hi> which augmented the former suspition. But yet the Letters of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> made all things to be used more circumspectly, for he did plainly forewarne the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> that he espyed the Earle of <hi>Arran</hi> to be stricken with phrensie, and therefore willed not over great credit to be given unto his words and inventions. And as he advertised, so it came to passe forthwith in few dayes, his sicknesse increased, he talked of wondrous signes that he saw in heaven; he alleaged that he was bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he would have been in the Queens Bed, and affirmed that he was her husband; and finally, in all things he behaved himself so foolishly, that his phrensie could not be hid.</p>
                  <p>And yet were the Earl <hi>Bothwell</hi> and Master <hi>Gawan</hi> Abbot of <hi>Kilming</hi> kept in the Castle of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> and convent before the Councill with the Earl <hi>Arran,</hi> who ever stood firm, that the Earl of <hi>Bothwell</hi> proposed to him such things as he advertised the Queens Majestie of; but stiffely denyed that his father, the said Abbot, or his friends knew any thing therof, either yet that they intended any violence against him; but alleaged that he was inchanted, so to think and write. Whereat the Queen, highly offended, committed him to prison, with the other two, first in the Castle of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi>; and thereafter caused them to be conveyed to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh; Iames Stewart</hi> of <hi>Cardonhall,</hi> called Captain <hi>Iames,</hi> was evill bruited for the rigorous entertainment that he shewed to the said Earle in his sicknesse, being appointed Keeper unto him.</p>
                  <p>To consult upon these occasions the whole Counsell was assembled at Saint <hi>Andewes,</hi> the eighteenth of <hi>April</hi> 1562. years; in which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that in consideration of the former suspition, the Duke should ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Queen the Castle of <hi>Dunbartan</hi> the custody thereof was granted unto him by appointment, till that lawfull succession should be seene of the Queens body: But Will prevailed against Reason and promise, and so was the Castle delivered to Captain <hi>Anstruther,</hi> as having power from the Queen and Councill to receive it.</p>
                  <p>Things ordered in <hi>Fyfe,</hi> the Queen returned to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and then began mirth to grow hot, for her friends began to triumph in <hi>France:</hi> The certainty hereof came to the ears of <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> for there were some that then told him from time to time the state of things, and amongst others he was assured, That the Queen had been merry, excessively dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing till after midnight, because that she had received Letters, that pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was begun again in <hi>France,</hi> and that her Uncles were beginning to stirre their taile, and to trouble the whole Realme of <hi>France,</hi> upon occasion

And of dancing (Madame) I said, That albeit in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures I found no praise of it, and in prophane Writers, that it is termed the gesture rather of those that are Mad, and in phrensie, then of sober men; yet do I not utterly condemn it, providing that two vices be avoyded; the former, That the principall Vocation of those that use that exercise, be not neglected for the pleasure of Dancing.

                  <p>The Queen looked about to some of the Reporters, and said, Your words are sharpe enough as you have spoken them, but yet they were told me in another manner; I know (said she) that my Uncles and you are not of one Religion, and therefore I cannot blame you to have no good opinion of them; but if you hear any thing of my self that mislikes you, come to my self and tell me, and I shall hear you.

                           <salute>To the Queens Majesty, and her most honorable Privy Councell. The Superintendents and Ministers of the Evangell of Christ Iesus within this Realme, together with the Commissioners of the whole Churches, desire Grace and Peace, from the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, with the Spirit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Iudgement.</salute>

                        <p>HAving in minde that the fearfull sentence pronounced against the Watch-men that see the Sword of Gods punishment approach, and do not in plain words forewarn the people, yea, the Princes and Rulers, that they repent, we cannot but signifie unto your Highnesse, and to your Councell, That the state of this Realme is such for this present, that unlesse redresse and remedy be shortly provided, Gods hands cannot long spare in his anger, to strike the Head and the Tayle; the inobedient Prince,<note place="margin">

                           </note> and sinfull People: For as God is unchangeable and true, so must he punish, in these our dayes the grievous sins which before, we reade, he hath punished in all Ages, after that he hath long called for repentance, and none is showne. And that your Majesty and Councell may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what are the things we desire to be reformed, we will begin at that which we know assuredly to be the Fountain and Spring of all other evils that now abound in this Realme: To wit:</p>
                        <p>That Idoll and base service of God, the Masse, the fountain, we call, of all Impiety, not onely because many take boldnesse to sin, by reason of that opinion which they have conceived of that Idoll, to wit, That by vertue of it they get remission of their sins; But also because that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this colour of the Masse, are Whores, Adulterers, Drunkards, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers of God,<note place="margin">This causeth the Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But supposing that the Masse was occasion of no such evils, yet in it self it is so odious in Gods presence, that we cannot cease with all instance to desire the removing of the same, as well from your selfe, as from all others within this Realm; Taking Heaven and earth, yea, your own Consciences to record, That the obstinate maintenance of that Idol, shall in the end be to you, destruction of soul and body, if you do not repent.</p>
                        <p>If your Majesty demand, Why that now we are more earnest, then we have been heretofore? We answer (our former silence no wayes excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) Because we finde our selves frustrate of our hope and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which was, That in processe of time your Majesties heart should have been mollified, so farre, as ye would have heard the publike Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine taught within this Realme; by the which, our further hope was, That Gods holy Spirit should so have moved your heart, that you would have suffered your Religion (which before God is nothing but abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vanity) to be tryed by the true Touch-stone, the written Word



<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61872:211"/>
of God; And that your Majesty finding it to have no ground nor foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the same, should have given that glory unto God: that you would have preferred his Truth to your own preconceived vain opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of what antiquity that ever it hath been, whereof we in part now discharged,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Note.</hi>
                           </note> can no longer keep silence, unlesse we would make our selves criminall before God of your blood, perishing in your own iniquity; for we plainly admonish you of the danger to come.</p>
                        <p>The second thing that we require, is, Punishment of horrible vices, such as are Adultery, Fornication, open Whoredome, Blasphemy, Contempt of God, of his Word and Sacraments; Which in this Realme do even so abound, that sin is reputed to be no sin. And therefore, as we see the present signes of Gods wrath now manifestly appear, so do we forewarn, that he will strike ere it be long, if his Law without punishment be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thus manifestly to be contemned. If any object, That punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be commanded to be executed without a Parliament; we answer,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Note.</hi>
                           </note> That the Eternall God in his Parliament, hath pronounced death to be the punishment of Adultery, and for Blaspheming: whose Act if we put not in execution (seeing that Kings are but his Lievtenants, having no power to give life, where he commands death) as that he will repute you, and all others that foster vice, patrons of Impiety, so will he not fail to punish you, for neglecting the execution of his judgements.</p>
                        <p>Our third request concerning the poor, who be of three sorts: The poor labourers of the ground, the poor desolate Beggers, Orphans, Widows and Strangers,<note place="margin">Note d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>een, or to any other. As for the very indigent and poor, to whom God commands a sustentation to be provided of the Tenths, they are so despised,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Note.</hi>
                           </note> that it is a wonder that Sun giveth heat and light to the earth, where Gods Name is so frequently called upon, and no mercy (according to his Commandment) showne to his Creatures. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the Ministers, their Livings are so appointed, that the most part shall live but a Beggers life: And all cometh of that impiety, that the idle bellies of Christs enemies, must be fed in their former delicacy. We dare not conceal from your Majestie, and honours our conscience, which is this, That neither by the Law of God, neither yet by any just Law of man, is due unto them, who now most cruelly do exact of the poor and rich, the two parts of their Benefices, as they call them. And therefore we most humbly require, That some other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be taken with them, that they be not set up againe to empire above the people of God; for we fear that such usurpation of their former state, will be neither in the end pleasant to themselves, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to them that would place them in that Tyranny. If any think that a competent Living is to be assigned to them, we repugne not, provided



<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61872:211"/>
that the Labourers of the ground be not oppressed, the poor be not utterly neglected, and the Ministers of the Word so hardly used, as now they are. And finally, That those idle bellies, who by Law can crave nothing, shall confesse, that they receive their sustentation and maintenance, not of debt, but of benevolence. Our humble request is therefore, That in every Parish some part of the Tythes may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the sustentation and maintenance of the poor within the same: And likewise that some publike relief may be provided for the poor within Burroughs, that Collectors may be appointed to gather; And that strict Accounts may be taken, as well for their Recepts, as of the disbursements. The further consideration to be had of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, we in some part remit to your wisedoms, and to their particular complaints.</p>
                        <p>Our fourth Petition is for the Mause-Yards and Gleebs justly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the Ministers, without the which it is impossible unto them quietly to serve their Charges; and therefore we desire that order be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without delay.</p>
                        <p>Our fifth concerns the disobedience of certain wicked persons, who not onely trouble, and have troubled Ministers in their Functions, but also disobey the Superintendents in their Visitation: wherefore we humbly crave remedy; which we doubt, not so much for the feare that we and our Ministers have of the Papists, but for the love that we bear to the common tranquility. For this we cannot hide from your Majesty and Councell, That if the Papists thinke to triumph where they may, and to do what they list, where there is not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty able to resist them: that some will thinke, That the godly must begin where they left, who heretofore have borne all rhings patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in hope that the Lawes should have bridled the wicked;<note place="margin">Note this for our times.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of if they be frustrate (albeit that nothing is more odious to them then Tumults, and domestick Discord) yet will men attempt the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, before that in their owne eyes they behold the house of God demolished, which with travell and danger God hath within this Realm erected by them.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, we desire, That such as receive release of their Thirds, be compelled to sustain the Ministers within their Bounds, or else we forewarne your Majesty and Councell, that we feare, That the people shall retain the whole in their hands, untill such time as their Ministers be sufficiently provided.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, we desire the Churches to be repayred, according to an Act set forth by the Lords of the Secret Councell, before your Majesties Arrivall into this Countrey: That J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>dges be appointed to heare the causes of Divorcement; for the Church can no longer sustain the burden, especially, because there is no punishment for the offenders: That sayers and hearers of Masses, prophaners of the Sacraments; such as have entred into Benefices by the Popes Bulls, and such other trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors of the Law made at your Majesties Arrivall within this Realme, may be severely punished; for else men will think there is no truth meant in making of such Laws.</p>
                        <p>

                           <pb n="340" facs="tcp:61872:212"/>Eighthly, We most humbly desire of your Majesty and your honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Councell, a resolute answer to every one of these Heads afore-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that the same being known, we may somewhat satisfie such as be grievously offended at manifest iniquity now maintained at, oppression, under pretext of Law, done against the poore, and at the rebellious disobedience of many wicked persons, against Gods Word, and holy Ordinance.</p>
                        <p>God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, so rule your hearts, and direct your Majesty and Councels judgements by the judgement and illumination of his holy Spirit, that you may answer so, as your offences may be absolved in the presence of that righteous Judge, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; and then we doubt not but your selves shall finde felicity, and this poor Realme, that hath long been oppressed by wicked men, shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy tranquility and rest, with the true knowledge of God.</p>

                  <p>These things read in publike Assembly as aforesaid, were approved of all: And some wished that more sharpnesse had been used, because that the time so repuired. But the Minions of the Court, and Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Lethington</hi> above others, could not abide such hard spoken words; for whoever shall write (said he) to a Prince, That God would strike the head and the tayle; That if Papists do what they list, men would begin where they left:<note place="margin">Note this for our times.</note> But above all others, that was most offensive That the Queen was accused, as that she would raise up Papists and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistry again; To put that in the people heads, was no lesse then Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: yea, Oathes was made, That she never meaned such thing. To whom it was answered,<note place="margin">An answer to <hi>Lethington.</hi>
                     </note> That the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> used such manner of speaking; And it was no doubt but that he was acquainted in the Court, for it was supposed that he was of the Kings Stock: but howsoever it was, his words make manifest that he spake to the Court, and to the Courtiers, to Judges, Ladies, Princes and Priests; and yet, saith he, <hi>The Lord shall cut away the head and the tayle, &amp;c.</hi> And so said the first wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I finde that such phrase was once used before us: And if this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, that we say, Men must begin where they left, in case the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists do as they do, we would desire you to teach us, not so much how we shall speak, but rather what we shall do, when our Ministers are stricken, our Superintendents disobeyed, and a plain Rebellion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed against all good Orders. Complain, said <hi>Lethington.</hi> To whom? said the other. To the Queen, said he. How long shall we do so? quoth the other. Till that you get remedy, said the Justice Clerke: Give me their names, and I shall give you Letters. If the Sheep, said one, shall complain to the Wolfe, That the Wolfs whelps have devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Lambs, the Complainer may stand in danger, but the offender we fear,<note place="margin">Note this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> shall have leave to hunt after his prey. Such Comparisons (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) are very unsavoury; for I am assured, That the Queen will not erect nor maintaine Papistry. Let your assurance (said the other) serve your selfe, but it cannot assure us; for her manifest



<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61872:212"/>
proceedings speaketh the contrary. After such cautious reasoning on both sides, the pluralitie concluded, That the supplication as it was conceived, should be presented, unlesse that the Secretary would make one more fit to the present necessitie; he promised to keep the substance of ours, but he would use other termes, and aske things in a more gentle manner. The first Writer answered, That he served the Churches at their commandment, and was content, That in his ditement, men should use the libertie that best pleased them; providing, That he were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to subscribe to the flattery of such, as more regarded the persons of men, then the simple truth of God: And so was this former suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation given to be reformed, as <hi>Lethingtons</hi> wisedome thought best. And in very deed, he framed it so, That when it was delivered by the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents of <hi>Lothain</hi> and <hi>Fyfe.</hi> And when the Queen had read somewhat of it, she said, Here are many faire words, I cannot tell what the hearts are; And so for our painted Oratory we were termed by the next name, Flatterers and dissemblers; but for that Session, the Church received no other answer.</p>
                  <p>Short after the Convention of the Church, chanced that unhappy persuite which <hi>Iohn Gordon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn Gordonne</hi> and <hi>Ogilvie.</hi>
                     </note> Laird of <hi>Finlater,</hi> made upon the Lord <hi>Ogilvie,</hi> who was evill hurt, and was for a long time mitilate; The occasion was for certain Lands, and Rights, which old <hi>Finlater</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the Lord, which he was pursuing by Law, and was in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to obtain his purpose; whereat, the said <hi>Iohn,</hi> and his servants were offended, and therefore made the said pursuite, upon a Saterday, at night, betwixt nine and ten. The friends of the said Lord, were either not with him, or else not willing to fight that night, for they took stroakes, but gave few that left markes.</p>
                  <p>The said <hi>Iohn</hi> was taken and put in the <hi>Tolbuith,</hi> where he ramained certain dayes, and then broke the Prison: Some judged, at his Fathers commandment; for he was making preparation for the Queens coming to the North, as we will after heare.</p>
                  <p>The enterview and meeting of the two Queens delayed till the next yeer. Our Soveraign took purpose to visite the North, and departed from <hi>Sterlin</hi> in the moneth of <hi>August</hi>; whether there was any paction and confederacy betwixt the Papists of the South, and the Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi> and his Papists in the North (or to speak more plainly) betwixt the Queen her Self, and <hi>Huntly:</hi> We cannot certainly affirme, But the suspitions were wondrous vehement, that there was no good will borne to the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> nor yet to such as depended upon him, at that time. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story we shall faithfully declare, and so leave the judgement free to the Readers.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Iohn Gordon</hi> broke the Prison, we have already heard, who immediately repaired to his Father <hi>George,</hi> Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi>; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Queens coming, made great provision in <hi>Strabogie,</hi> and in other parts, as it were to receive the Queen. At <hi>Aberdeine,</hi> the Queen and Court, remained certaine dayes to deliberate upon the Affaires of the Countrey, where some began to smell, that the Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi> was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately gathering men, as hereafter shall be declared.</p>

                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:61872:213"/>Whilest things was so working in the North, the Earle of <hi>Bothwell</hi> broke his prison, and came forth of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the eight and twentieth day of <hi>August</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bothwell</hi> brake the ward or prison.</note> some say he broke the Stancheours of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; others whispered, that he got easie passage by the gates: one thing is certain, to wit, The Queen was little offended at his escaping. There passed with him a servant of the Captains, named <hi>Iames Porterfield.</hi> The said Earle shewed himself not very much afraid, for his common residence was in <hi>Louthain.</hi> The Bishop of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> and Abbot of <hi>Crosrainell</hi> kept secret convention that same time in <hi>Paislay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note another wavering of the <hi>Hamiltons.</hi>
                     </note> to whom resorted divers Papists; yea, the said Bishop spake to the Duke, unto whom also came the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> from the Earle of <hi>Huntly,</hi> requiring him to stirre his hands in the South, as he should do in the North, and so it should not be <hi>Knox</hi> crying and preaching that should stay that purpose: The Bishop, be he never so close, could not altogether hide his minde, but at his own Table said, The Queen is gone into the North, belike to seek disobedience, she may perchance finde the thing she seeks. It was constantly affirmed, That the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> and the said Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> spake together, but of their purpose we heard no mention.</p>
                  <p>That same year, and in that same instant time, were appointed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners by the Generall Assembly, to <hi>Carrick</hi> and <hi>Cunningham</hi>; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>George Hay,</hi> who with great profit preached the space of a moneth in all the Churches of <hi>Carrick.</hi> To <hi>Kyle</hi> and to the parts of <hi>Galloway</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> who besides the doctrine of the Evangell, shewne to the common people, forewarned some of the Nobilitie and Barrows, of the dangers that he feared, and that were appearing shortly to follow; and exhorted them to put themselves in such order, as that they might be able to serve the authoritie, and yet not to suffer the enemies of Gods truth to have the upper hand: Whereupon a great part of the <hi>Barons</hi> and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>Kyle, Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Carrick,</hi> professing the true doctrine of the Evangell, assembled at <hi>Ayre</hi>; and after the exhortation made, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had, subscribed this Bond, the Tenour whereof followeth:</p>

By which meanes was the South parts kept in reasonable quietnesse during the time that the troubles were a brewing in the North; and yet the Bishop and the Abbot of <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raynell</hi> did what in them lay to have raised some trouble; for, besides the fearfull bruits that they spearced abroad, sometime that the Queen was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, sometimes that the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> and all his were slain, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that the Queen had given her self to the Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi>; besides such bruits the Bishop to break the Countrey of <hi>Kyle,</hi> where quietnesse then was greatest, raised the <hi>Crawfords,</hi> against the <hi>Reides,</hi> for the payment of the Bishops Paschfynes; but that was pacified by the labor of indifferent men, who favoured peace. The Abbot of <hi>Cosrainell</hi> required disputation of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> for maintenance of the <hi>Masse,</hi> which was granted unto him; and the dispute held in <hi>Mayboll</hi> three dayes: The Abbot had the advantage that he required, to wit, he took in hand to prove, That <hi>Melchisedec</hi> offered Bread and Wine unto God; which was the ground that the <hi>Masse</hi> was built upon



<pb n="344" facs="tcp:61872:214"/>
to be a Sacrifice, &amp;c. But in the work of three dayes there could no proofe be produced for <hi>Melchizedecks</hi> Oblation; as in the disputation, (which was afterwards Printed) clearly may appeare. The Papists looked for a revolt, and therefore they would have some brag of reasoning; the Abbot further presented himself to the Pulpit, but the voyce of Master <hi>George Hay</hi> so affrayed him, that after once he was wearied o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> that exercise.</p>
                  <p>After that the Queene was somewhat satisfied of hunting, and other pastimes, she came to <hi>Aberdein,</hi> where the Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi> met her, and his Ladies, with no small Train, who remained in Court, and was suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have the greatest credite, departed with the Queen to <hi>Buchan,</hi> met her againe at <hi>Rothemay,</hi> looking that shee should have passed with him to <hi>Strabogy</hi>; but in the journey certain word came to her, that <hi>Iohn Gordon</hi> had broken promise in not re-entring in ward; for his Father the Earle had promised, that he should enter againe within the Castle of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and there abide the Queens pleasure; but whether with his Fathers know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and consent, or without the same, we know not; but he refused to enter: which so offended the Queen, that she would not go to <hi>Strabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> but passed thorow <hi>Straithla</hi> to <hi>Innernesse,</hi> where the Castle thereof was denyed unto her; the Captaine was commanded to keep it, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for relief; for so had <hi>Iohn Gordon</hi> promised; but being thereof fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, the Castle was rendred, and the Captain called; <hi>Gordon</hi> was executed upon the place, the rest were condemned, and the hands of some bound, but escaped.</p>
                  <p>This was the beginning of further trouble, for the Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi> thereat offended, began to assemble his Folkes, and spared not to speak that he would be revenged; But alwayes his Wife bare a faire counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Queen; and it is verily supposed, that no other harme then the Queen her self could easily have stood content with, was meaned unto her own person. But the whole matter lay upon the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Lethington</hi> and the Laird of <hi>Pittaro</hi>; yet the Queene began to be afraid, and by Proclamation, caused to warn <hi>Sterling</hi> Shire, <hi>Fyfe, Anguis, Mernes,</hi> and <hi>Stratherne,</hi> charging all substantiall men to be in <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein</hi> the fifth day of <hi>October,</hi> there to remaine the space of twenty dayes; In her return from <hi>Innernesse</hi> she required the Castle of <hi>Finlater,</hi> which was likewise denyed, and so was <hi>Anchndowne</hi>; which more angred the Queen. The Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi> was charged to cause deliver the said house, under the pain of Treason; to shew some obedience, he caused the Keyes of both to be presented by his servant Master <hi>Thomas Keir</hi>; But before had the Queen sent young Captaine <hi>Stewart,</hi> son to <hi>Iames,</hi> (who to this day hath neither been stout, happy, nor true) with sixscore to lye about the places of <hi>Finlater.</hi> They lodged in <hi>Culan,</hi> not farre distant from the said place. But upon a night <hi>Iohn Gordon</hi> came with a company of Horsemen, took the Captain, slew certain of the Souldiers, and disarmed the rest.</p>
                  <p>This fact done (as the Queen alleaged) under trust, so inflamed her, that all hope of reconciliation was past; and so the Earl of <hi>Huntly</hi> was charged under the pain of putting him to the Horn, to present himselfe, and the said <hi>Iohn</hi> before the Queen and Councill within six dayes; which charge he

                     </note> he was sought at his Place of <hi>Stragobie,</hi> but escaped. The evil encreased, for the Earle assembled his fellowes out of all parts of the North: He marched forwards towards <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diene,</hi> and upon the two and twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> 1562. came to the Lough of <hi>Skeine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Army was judged to be seven or eight hundred men. The Queens Army, both in number and man-hood, far surmounting his, and yet he took no fear; for he was assured of the most part of them which were with the Queen; as the issue did witnesse: Within the Town they stood in great fear, and therefore it was concluded, That they would assayle the uttermost upon the fields. The <hi>Forbesses, Hayes,</hi> and <hi>Lesleyes</hi> took the Vant-guard, and promised to fight with the said Earle, without any other help. They passed forth of the Towne before ten hours in the morning; they put themselves in aray, but they approached not the enemy, till that the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> and his Company were come to the fields, and that was after two after noon; for he was appointed with his Company, onely to have beholded the Battell: but all things turned otherwise then the most part of men supposed.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Huntley</hi> was the night before determined to have retired himselfe and his Company: But that morning he could not be wakened, before it was ten hours; and when he was upon his feet, his spirits failed him, by reason of his corpulency, so that rightly, a long time he could do nothing: Some of his friends fearing the danger, left him. When that he looked upon both the Companies, he said, This great Company that approacheth neerest to us, will do us no harme, they are our friends: I onely feare that small Company that stands on the hill side, they are our enemies: But we are enough for them, if God be with us. And when he had thus spoken, he fell upon his knees, and made his Prayer in this form:</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Note and observe, good Reader, he confesseth that he hath beene a blood-thirsty man; and that he had been the cause of the shedding of much innocent blood; but yet would he have had Victory: And what was that else, but to have had power to have shedded more, and then would he have satisfied God for altogether; wherein is expressed the nature of hypocrites,<note place="margin">

danger espied, the Laird of <hi>Pittarrow</hi> (a man both stout, and of a ready wit) with the Master, after Lord <hi>Lyndsey,</hi> and Tutor of <hi>Pitcur,</hi> said, <hi>Let us cast down Spears to the foremost, and let them not come in amongst us; for there is no doubt but this flying is but Treachery:</hi> And so they did, so that they that fled of <hi>Huntley</hi> seeing the Vaunt-guard flie, said unto his Company, <hi>Our friends are honest men, they have kept promise; Let us now encounter the rest.</hi> And so he and his, as sure of Victory, marched forward. The Secretary in few words, made a vehement Oration; and they willed every man to call upon his God, to remember his duty, and not to fear the multitude: And in the end concluded thus: <hi>O Lord, thou that rulest the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the earth,</hi>

And, O Lord, if thou knowest our innocency, maintain thou and preserve us, for thy great mercies sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shortly after the speaking of these and the like words, the former Rank rejoyced; for <hi>Huntlies</hi> Company made great haste: They were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed by the Master of <hi>Lyndsay</hi>; and the Companies of <hi>Fyfe</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> some of them that had fled, returned, and followed the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> but gave no stroke, till that <hi>Huntlies</hi> Company gave back. In the Front there was slain eighteen or four and twenty men; and in the flying there fell 100. There were taken 100. and the rest were spared: The Earl him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was taken alive; his two sons, <hi>Iohn</hi> aforesaid, and <hi>Adam Gordon,</hi> were taken with him. The Earle, immediately after his taking, departed this life, without any wound, or yet appearance of any stroke, whereof death might have ensued: And so, because it was late, he was cast over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart or upon a payre of Creilles, and so was carried to <hi>Aberdeine,</hi> and was laid in the Tolbuith thereof, that that which his wives Witches had given, might be fulfilled; who all affirmed (as the most part say) That same night he should be in the Towne of <hi>Aberdeine,</hi> without any wound upon his body. When his Lady got knowledge thereof, she blamed her principall Witch, called <hi>Iannett</hi>; but she stoutly defended her selfe (as the devill can do) and affirmed, That she gave a true answer, albeit she spake not all the truth; for she knew that he should be there dead, but that could not profit my Lady. She was angry and sorry for a season: But the devill, the Masse, and Witches, have all great credit with her this day, the twelfth of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1566. as they had seven yeers agoe.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> sent a Message unto the Queen, of the marvellous Victory; and humbly prayed her to shew that obedience to God, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to convene with them, to give thanks unto God for his notable deliverance. She glomed and frowned both at the Message, and at the Request, and scarcely would give a good word, or blythe and merry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to any that she knew earnest favourers of the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> whose prosperity was, and yet is a very venome to her boldned heart: For many dayes she bare no better countenance; whereby it might have been easily espied, That she rejoyced not greatly of the successe of



<pb n="347" facs="tcp:61872:215"/>
that matter; And albeit she caused to execute <hi>Iohn Gordon,</hi> and divers others, yet it was the destruction of others that she sought.</p>
                  <p>Upon the morrow after the discomfiture, the Lady <hi>Forbesse,</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man both wise, and fearing God, came, amongst many others, to visite the Corps of the said Earle; and seeing him lie upon the cold stones, having onely upon him a Doublet of Canvas, a payre of Scotch gray Hose,<note place="margin">The Lady <hi>Forbesse</hi> her words.</note> and him covered with an Arras work. She said, <hi>What stability shall we judge to be in this world? There lieth he that yesterday in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was esteemed the wisest, the richest, and man of greatest power that was within Scotland.</hi> And in very deed she lyed not; for in mans opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, under a Prince, there was not such a one these three hundred yeers in this Realme produced:<note place="margin">Let others that yet live mark this.</note> But felicity and worldly wisedom so blinded him, that in the end he perished in them, as shall all those that despight God, and trust in themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn Gordon,</hi> at his death, confessed many horrible things, devised by his father, by his brother, and by himself. There were Letters found in the Earles pocket, that disclosed the Treason of the Earle of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> and of divers others. Master <hi>Thomas Keir,</hi> who before was the whole Councellor of the said Earle, disclosed whatsoever he understood might hurt the <hi>Gordons</hi> and their friends, and so Treason plainly disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; which was, That the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> should have been murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Stragobie</hi>; the Queen should have been taken, and kept at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the said Earle of <hi>Huntley.</hi> These things, we say, revealed, the Queen left the North, and came to <hi>Dundie,</hi> Saint <hi>Iohnston, Sterlin,</hi> and then to <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> The Earle of <hi>Huntleys</hi> body was carryed about in a Boat, and laid without Buriall in the Abbey of <hi>Halyrud-house,</hi> till the day of his Forefaltor, as after shall be declared. The Duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> his son in Law, because that the Queen had straitly commanded him so to do, if that he repaired within his bounds. Before that he delivered him, the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> laboured at the Queens hands for the safety of his life, which hardly was granted; and so was he delivered within the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the eight and twentieth day of <hi>November.</hi> 1562. where he remained till the eighth day of <hi>February</hi>; when he was put to an Assise, accused and convinced of Treason; but was restored againe; first, to the Castle aforesaid, and thereafter was transported to <hi>Dumbar,</hi> where he remained priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner till the moneth of <hi>August,</hi> in the yeer of God 1565. as we will after hear.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the troubles were hot in <hi>France,</hi> and the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and outward familiarity betwixt the two Queens was great; <hi>Lethington</hi> was directed with large Commission, both to the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> and to the <hi>Guisians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Marriage of our Queen was in all mens mouthes; some would have the Infant of <hi>Spaine,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>What <hi>Lethingtons</hi> Credit was, we know not; but shortly after there began much to be talked of the Earle of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and of his son



<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61872:216"/>
the Lord <hi>Darley.</hi> It was said that <hi>Lethington</hi> spake to the Lady <hi>Margaret Dowglas</hi>; And that <hi>Robert Melvill</hi> received a horse to the Secretaries use from the Earle of <hi>Lenox,</hi> or from his wife. Howsoever it was, Master <hi>Fouller</hi> servant to the said Earle, came with Letters to the Queene, by which, License was permitted to the Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> to come to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to travell in his lawfull businesse. That same day the Queens Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense was granted, the Secretary said, This day I have taken upon me the deadly hatred of all the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> within <hi>Scotland,</hi> and have done unto them no lesse displeasure, then if I had cut their throats. The Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who before had broken Ward, fearing apprehension or taking, prepared to passe to <hi>France</hi>; but by storm of Weather was driven into <hi>England,</hi> where he was stayed, and was offered to have been rendred by the Queen of <hi>England:</hi> But our Queens answer was, That he was no Rebell, and therefore she requested that he should have liberty to passe whither he pleased. And thereto <hi>Lethington</hi> helped not a little, for he travelled to have friends in every faction of the Court. And so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the said Earle Lincense to passe to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Winter after the death of the Earle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for the most part at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The Preachers were wondrous vehement in reprehension of all manner of Vice, which then began to abound; and especially Avarice, Oppression of the poore, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, Ryotous Cheer, Banquetting, immoderate Dancing, and Whoredome, that thereof ensues. Whereat the Courtiers began to storme and to pick quarrells against the Preachers,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> alleadging that all their Preaching was turned to Rayling;<note place="margin">The Preachers railed upon the Courtiers.</note> whereunto one of them gave answer as followeth; It comes to our eares that we are called Raylers, whereof albeit we wonder, yet we are not ashamed, seeing that the most worthy servants of God that before us have travelled in this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, have so been stiled: But unto you do I say, That the same God,<note place="margin">The Preachers Admonition after the Earle of <hi>Huntlies</hi> death.</note> who from the beginning hath punished the Contempt of his Word, and hath poured forth his Vengeance upon such proud mockers, shall not spare you; yea, he shall not spare you before the eyes of this same wicked Generation, for the pleasure whereof ye despise all whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Admonitions: Have you not seen greater then any of you sitting where presently ye sit,<note place="margin">Meaning of <hi>Huntley.</hi>
                     </note> pick his nayles, and pull down his Bonnet over his eyes, when Idolatry, Witchcraft, Murther, Oppression, and such Vices, were rebuked: Was not this his common talke? When these Knaves have rayled their fill, then will they hold their peace: Have ye not heard it affirmed to his owne face, That God should revenge that his Blasphemie, even in the eyes of such as were witnesse to his iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Then was the Earle of <hi>Huntley</hi> accused by you, as the maintainer of Idolatry, and onely hinderer of all good Orders; him hath God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, even according to the threatnings that his and your ears heard, and by your hands hath God executed his Judgements: But what amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be espied in you? Idolatry was never in greater quiet, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and vertuous men were never in more contempt; Vice was



<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61872:216"/>
never more bold, nor punishment lesse feared. And yet who guides the Queene and Court; who but the Protestants. O horrible slanderers of God, and of his holy Evangell; Better it were unto you, plainely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">The end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their words to be true.</note> then thus to expose his blessed Evangell to Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: if God punisheth not you, That this same age shall see and behold your punishment, the spirit of righteous judgement guides me not.</p>
                  <p>This vehemency provoked the hatred, not onely of the Courtiers, but also of divers others against the Speaker, which was <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>; for such as be in credit, never lack flatterers. <hi>Their Brethren of the Court were irreverendly handled.</hi> What was that, but to raise the hearts of the people against them; They did what they could. Such speaking would cause them to do lesse.<note place="margin">The defence of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</note> And this was the fruit that the Preachers gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their just reprehensions; The generall Assembly of the Church held on the 25 of <hi>December,</hi> 1562. approached. In the which, great complaints were made; That Churches lacked Ministers; That Ministers lacked their Stipends; That wicked men were permitted to be Schoole-Masters; and so to infect the youth amongst them, whom one Master <hi>Robert Cunning</hi> Schoole-master in <hi>Aberbrothoke,</hi> was complained upon by the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> and sentence pronounced against him. It was further complained, That Idolatry was erected in divers parts of the Realm: For redresse hereof, some thought best, That a new supplication should be presented to the Queen; others demanded, what answer was received of the former. The superintendent of <hi>Lowthian</hi> confessed the delivery of it; but (said he) I received no answer. It was answered for the part of the Queene, (for her supposts were ever there) that it was well known to the whole Realm, what troubles had occurred since the last Assembly; and therefore, That they should not wonder, albeit that the Queen had not answered, but betwixt that and the Parliament, which was appointed to be in <hi>May,</hi> they doubted not but such order should be taken,<note place="margin">The Queens practise.</note> as all men should have occasion to stand content. This satisfied for that time the whole Assembly. And this was the practice of the Queene, and of her Councell, with faire words to drive time, as before we have said.</p>
                  <p>The Assembly notwithstanding proceeded forward in establishing of such orders, as whereby vice might be punished, and vertue might be maintained, And because there was a great slander risen upon <hi>Paul Meffane</hi> of whom mention is made in the second Booke of the Historie, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions and charge was given unto <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> Minister of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and unto certain of the Elders of the Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to passe to the Town of <hi>Iedwart,</hi> where the slander was raised, and to be found there,<note place="margin">The tryall of <hi>Pauls Meffanes</hi> fact.</note> the third of <hi>Ianuary</hi> next, was the tryall to be taken of the slander raised, and to hear the Articles and complaint of the said <hi>Paul</hi>: and after the tryall, to report the truth to the Session of the Church of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>; To whom with the assistance of the superintendent of <hi>Lowthian</hi> Commission was given to discerne therein. The tryall and examination of that crime was difficile, the slander was universall in that Towne and Country; the servant woman of the said <hi>Paul,</hi> had betwixt that and <hi>Christmas</hi> left his House, she had borne a child, no father to it could she

finde, but alleaged her self to have been suppressed late in an Evening; the said <hi>Paul</hi> constantly affirmed himself innocent, and would have given his publike purgation; but because his Accusators had taken on them to prove ther accusation that was denyed, many witnesses were produced, of whom some deposed so clearly, that the Commissioners suspected, that they had been suborned, and therefore they required to have inspection of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where some said they saw, and some said they heard them in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of iniquitie. The sight and consideration of the place augmented greatly the suspition; but one thing was most suspitious of all other, for the Wife of the sad <hi>Paul</hi> (an ancient Matron) was absent from him the space of eight or nine weeks in <hi>Dundie</hi>; which time (or at least a great part thereof) they suspected, and he lay nightly in one house without other company then a Childe of seven or eight yeers of age. The Judges, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these suspitions, having a good opinion of the honestie and godlinesse of the man, travelled what they could (conscience not hurt) to purge him of the slander: But God, who would not that such a Villanie should be cloaked and concealed within his Kirk, otherwayes had decreed, for he brought the brother of the guilty woman to the Towne, having no minde of such matters, who being produced by the Accusators, as one that was privy to the fact; and knew the veritie of all circumstances; this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we say, (which could not be suspected) being produced, made the matter so plain and clear, that all suspition was removed; for he it was that conveyde the woman away, he it was that caused the Childe to be baptised, alleaging it to be his own; he it was that carried frequent message betwixt them, and from <hi>Paul</hi> carryed money and clothes divers times: How soon that ever the said <hi>Paul</hi> saw that man produced, as Witnesse, he withdrew himselfe and left the Town, by that means plainly taking upon him the Crime; And so the Commissioners with full information, returned to <hi>Dundie,</hi> and notified the same unto the Kirke, who caused publikely to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the said <hi>Paul</hi> to hear the sentence pronounced; who not appearing in the end, for his odious Crime and contumacy, was publikely excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and was deprived of all functions within the Kirke of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so left the Realme. For two causes we insert this horrible fact, and the order kept in punishing of the same; the former to forewarn such as travell in that Vocation, that according to the admonition of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Such as stand, take heed lest they fall.</hi> No man in the beginning of the Evangell, was judged more fervent and more upright; and yet we have heard how far Sathan has prevailed against him; God grant that we may hear of his repentance; neither yet should this fall do any thing to prejudice the Authoritie of the Doctrine which he taught, for the Doctrine of God hath its authority of no creature, but hath the assurance of God himselfe, how weak or imperfect soever the Instruments be by whom it pleaseth God to publish the same. The treason of <hi>Iudas,</hi> the Adultery of <hi>David,</hi> and abnegation of <hi>Peter</hi> did derogate nothing from the glory of Christs Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, nor yet the Doctrine which before they had taught; but declared the one to be a Reprobate, and the other to be Instruments in whom mercy must surmount judgement. The other cause is, that the World may see what difference there is betwixt the uprightnesse of the Kirke of God, and

The other at the first made promise so to doe; but after calling to minde the judgement of GOD pronounced against the shedders of innocent blood, and also that none should die without the testimonie of two or three witnesses, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fell upon his knees before the Queen, and said, Madame, I beseech your Majestie cause not me to take the blood of this man upon me; Your Majestie hath used him so familiarlie before, that you have offended all your Nobilitie; and now if he shall be secretly slain at your owne commandment, what shall the world judge of it? I shall bring him to the presence of Justice, and let him suffer by Law according to his deserving. Oh, said the Queene, you shall not let him speake. I shall doe (said he) Madame, what in me lyeth, to give your Majestie content. Poor <hi>Chattelet</hi> was brought back from <hi>Kingorne</hi> to Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> examined, put to an Assize, and so beheaded the two and twentieth day of <hi>February, Anno Dom.</hi> 1562.

And so did God according to the threatning of the Law punish the Idolatry of our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Rulers, and our ingratitude that suffered them to defile the Land with that abomination again, that God so potently had purged by the power of his Word; for the riotous Feasting and excessive Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting used in City and Countrey, wheresoever that the prophane Court repaired, provoked God to strike the Staffe of Bread, and to give his maledictions upon the fruits of the earth.

                  <p>The Brethren universally offended, and espying that the Queene by Proclamation did but delude them, determined to put to their own hands, and to punish for example of others; and so some Priests in the West-Land were apprehended; Intimation made unto others, as to the Abbot of <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragnell,</hi> the Parson of <hi>Sangohar,</hi> and such, that they should neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to the Queene nor Counsell, but should execute the punishment that God has appointed to Idolaters in his Law, by such means as they might, where ever they should be apprehended.</p>
                  <p>The Queen stormed at such freedom of speaking, but she could not amend it, for the Spirit of God, of boldnesse, and of wisdome had not left the most part of such as God had made Instruments in the beginning, they were of one minde to maintaine the truth, and to suppresse Idolatry, particularities had not divided them; and therefore could not the Devill working in the Court, and in Papists, do then what they would; and therefore the Court began to invent a new craft; The Queen advised, to send for <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> to come to her where she lay,<note place="margin">

take my Sword in their hand. The Sword of Justice (quoth he) Madame, is Gods, and is given to Princes and Rulers for one end: which if they transgresse, sparing the wicked, and oppressing the Innocents. They that in the fear of God execute Judgement where God hath commanded, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not God, although Kings do it not; neither yet sin they that bridle Kings to strike innocent men in their rage: The examples are evident; for <hi>Samuel</hi> spared not to slay <hi>Agag,</hi> the fat and delicate King of <hi>Amelek,</hi> whom King <hi>Saul</hi> had saved: Neither spared <hi>Elias, Iezabels</hi> false Prophets, and <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, albeit that King <hi>Achab</hi> was present: <hi>Phineas</hi> was no Magistrate, and yet feared he not to strike <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi,</hi> in the very act of filthy Fornication. And so, Madame, your Majesty may see that others then chief Magistrates may lawfully punish, and have punished the vice and crimes that God commands to be punished: For Power by Act of Parliament is given to all Judges within their own bounds, to search the Masse-mongers, or hearers of the same, and to punish them according to the Law.<note place="margin">Note dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> And therefore it shall be profitable to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to consider what is the thing your Majesties subjects look to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of your Majesty; and what it is you ought to do unto them by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Contract. They are bound to obey you; and that not, but in God ye are bound to keep Laws unto them: Ye crave of them service, They crave of you Protection and Defence against wicked doers. Now, Madame, if ye shall deny your Duty unto them, who especially crave that ye punish Malefactors; Think ye to receive full Obedience of them? I fear, Madame, ye shall not. Herewith she being somewhat offended, past to her Supper. The said <hi>Iohn</hi> left her, and informed the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> of the whole reasoning, and so departed, of finall purpose to have returned to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> without any further communication with the Queen: But before the Sun rising on the morne were two directed (<hi>Wat Melvill</hi> was the one) to him, commanding him not to depart, whilst he had spoken with the Queens Majesty; which he did, and met her at the Hawking by West <hi>Kinros.</hi> Whether it was the nights sleepe, or a deep dissimulation locked in her brest, that made her to forget the former anger, wise men may doubt; But thereof she never moved word, but began divers other purposes, such as the offering of a Ring to her by the Lord <hi>Ruthuen,</hi> whom (said she) I cannot love (for I know him to use Enchantment; and yet he is one of my Privy Councell.

He is one (said the other) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, that is put in Election. If ye knew him (said she) as well as I do, ye would never promote him to that Office, nor yet to any other within your Kirk.

And she began to make a long discourse of her Sister, the Lady <hi>Argile,</hi> how that she was not so circumspect in all things, as she wished her to be; and yet said she, my Lord, her husband whom I love, useth her not in many things so honestly, and so godlily, as I thinke ye your self would require: Madam said he, I have been troubled with that matter before, and once I put an end to it (and that was before your Majesties arrivall) that both she and her friends, seemed fully to stand content; and she her self pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised before her friends, That she would never complain to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, till that I should first understand the controversie by her own mouth, or else by one assured Messenger: I now have heard nothing of her part; and therefore, I think there is nothing but concord: Well said the Queen, it is worse then ye beleeve; but do this much for my sake, as once again to put them at Unitie; and if she behave not her self, so as she ought to do, she shall finde no favour of me; but in any wise said she, let my Lord know, That I have requested you in this matter; For I would be very sorry to offend him in that, or in any other thing. And now said she, as touching our reasoning yesternight, I promise to do as ye required. I shall cause to summon all offenders, and yee shall know that I shall minister Justice. I am assured then said he, That ye shall please God, and enjoy rest and tranquilitie within your Realm, which to your Majesty is more profitable, then all the Popes power can be.

                        <p>THe Lord <hi>cometh, and shall not tarry.</hi> After commendation of my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto your Lordship: If I had known of your Lordships sudden departing, the last time it chanced me to see and speak with you, I had opened unto you some of my grief: But supposing that your Lordship should have remained still with the Queen, I delayed at that time to utter any part of that which now my conscience compelleth me to do. Your behaviour towards your wife is very offensive unto many godly: Her complaint is grievous, That ye altogether withdraw your conversation from her: If so, ye have great need to look well to your own state; for albeit that ye within your self felt no more repugnancie then any flesh this day on the earth, yet by promise made before God, are ye debtour unto her in all due benevolence. But if that ye burne on the one side, (albeit ye do no worse) and she in your default on the other, ye are not onely men sworn before God, but also doth what in you lieth, to kindle against your self his wrath and heavie displeasure. The words are sharp, and God is witnesse in dolour of heart I write them: But because they are true, and pronounced by God himself, I dare not but admonish you, perceiving you, as it were sleeping in sin. The proud stubbornnesse whereof your Lordship oft complained, will nothing excuse you before God; for if ye be not able to convince her of any fault, ye ought to bear with her imperfections, as that ye would she should bear with you likewise. In the bowells of Christ Jesus, I exhort you, my Lord, to have respect of your own salvation, and not to abuse the lenity and long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of God; for that is a fearfull treasure that ye heap up upon your own head, while that he calleth you to repentance, and ye obstinately continue in your own impiety; for impiety it is, that ye abstract your comfort and company from your lawfull wife. I write nothing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of her misbehaviour towards your Lordship in any sort; but I say, If ye be not able to convince her of any fault committed since your last reconciliation, which was in my presence, that ye can never be excused before God, of this rude and strange usage of your wife. And if by you such impiety be committed as is bruted, then, before God, and unto your owne conscience, I say, That every moment of that filthy pleasure, shall turne to you, in a yeers displeasure; yea, it shall be the occasion and cause of everlasting damnation, unlesse speedily ye repent: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye cannot, except ye desist from that impiety. Call to minde, my Lord, That the servant knowing his masters will, and doing the contrary, shall be plagued with many plagues. Sin, my Lord, is sweet in drinking; but in digesting, more bitter then the gall. The Eternall move your heart earnestly to consider how fearfull a thing it is, ever to have God to be enemy. In the end, I pray your Lordship not to be absent from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the 19 of this instant, for such causes as I will not write. Thus much onely I warne your Lordship, that it will not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the common quietnesse of this Realme, that the Papists brag,

                  <p>THis Letter was not well accepted of the said Earle, and yet did he utter no part of his displeasure in publike, but contrarily shewed himself most familiar with the said <hi>Iohn Knox:</hi> He kept the Diet, and sate in Judgement himself, where the Bishop, and the rest of the Papists, were accused as after follows.</p>
                  <p>The Summons were directed against the Masse-mongers with expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the straitest forme: The day was appointed, the 19 of <hi>May,</hi> a day onely before the Parliament of Popes Knights appeared. The Bishop of Saint <hi>Androes,</hi> the Prior of <hi>Quinthorne,</hi> the Parson of <hi>Sangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair, William Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Camskeneth, Iohn Gordon</hi> of <hi>Barskuch,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others. The Protestants convened whole, to crave for Justice. The Queen asked counsell of the Bishop of <hi>Rosse,</hi> and of the old Laird of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> (for the younger was absent, and so the Protestants had fewer friends) who affirmed, That she must see her Laws kept, or else she would get no obedience: and so was preparations made for their accusations. The Bishop,<note place="margin">The Clergie did pretend to be free from all Jurisdiction, save the Popes.</note> and his band of the exempted sort, made nice to enter before the Earle of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who sate in Judgement; but at last he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to enter within the Barre. A merry man, who now sleeps with the Lord, <hi>Robert Horwell,</hi> instead of the Bishops Crosse, bore before him a Steel Hammer: Whereat the Bishop and his Band were not a little offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because the Bishops priviledges were not then currant in <hi>Scotland</hi> (which day God grant our posterity may see of longer continuance then we possessed it.) The Bishop and his fellows, after much ado, and long drift of time, came in the Queens will, and were committed to Ward, some to one place, and some to another. The Lady <hi>Arskine</hi> got the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops for her part. All this was done of a most deep craft, to abuse the simplicity of the Protestants, that they should not presse the Queen with any other thing concerning the matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>At that Parliament, which began within two dayes thereafter, she ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Protestants whatsoever she desired; for this was the reason of many,<note place="margin">The judgment of some.</note> We see what the Queen hath done, the like of this was never heard within this Realme; we will bear with the Queen, we doubt not but all shall be well. Others were of contrary judgement, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spake things, as after they came to passe; to wit, That nothing was meant but deceit; and that the Queen, how soon that ever the Parliament was past, should set the Papists at freedome: And therefore willed the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility not to be abused. But because many had their private businesse to be handled at that Parliament, the common Cause was the lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>

                     <pb n="358" facs="tcp:61872:221"/>This Letter and discharge was so pleasing to the Flatterers of the said Earle, that they triumphed of it, and were glad to have gotten their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; for some envyed, that so great familiaritie was betwixt them; and therefore from the time they got once that occasion to separate, they ceased not to cast Oyle in the burning Flame, which ceased not to burne, till that God by water of affliction began to slacken it, as we shall after heare.

                  <p>The Act of Oblivion passed, because some of the Lords had entresse; but the Acts against adulterie, and for the Manses and Gleibes, were so modified, that no Law, and such a Law might stand <hi>in eodem predicamento</hi>; To speak plain, no Law and such Acts were both alike: The Acts are in Print, let wise men read, and then accuse us, if without cause we complain.</p>

There is not one of you against whom death and destruction was threatned, perished in that danger; and how many of your enemies hath God plagued before your eyes; shall this be the thankfulnesse that ye shall render unto your God? To betray his Cause when ye have it in your own hands, to establish it as you please?

And if they will say, That it was no Parliament, we must, and will say, and also prove, That that Parliament was also as lawfull as ever any that passed before it within this Realme.

                  <p>These words and this manner of speaking was judged intollerable, Papists and Protestants were both offended; yea, his most familiars disdained him for that speaking, <hi>Placeboes</hi> and Flatterers posted to the Court, to give advertisement, That <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> had spoken against the Queens Marriage. The Provest of <hi>Glencludan, Douglas</hi> by sirname, of <hi>Drumlangrig,</hi> was the man that gave the charge, That the said <hi>Iohn</hi> should present himselfe before the Queen, which he did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Dinner.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Queen in a vehement fume began to crie out, That never Prince was used as she was; I have (said she) born with you in all your rigorous manner of speaking, both against my selfe, and against my Uncles; yea, I have sought your favours by all possible means; I offered unto you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and audience whensoever it pleased you to admonish me; and yet I cannot be quit of you; I Vow to God I shall be once reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and with these words scarce could <hi>Marnocke,</hi> one of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, get Handkirchiefs to hold her Eyes drie, for the Tears and the howling, besides womanly weeping stayed her Speech. The said <hi>Iohn</hi> did patiently abide all this fume, and at opportunitie answered; True it is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, your Majesty and I have been at divers controversies, into the which



<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61872:222"/>
I never perceived your Majestie to be offended at me; but when it shall please God to deliver you from that bondage of darknesse and errour, wherein ye have been nourished for the lack of true doctrine; your Majestie will finde the libertie of my tongue nothing offensive; without the preaching-place (Madame) I thinke few have occasion to be offended at me; and there (Madame) I am not Master of my selfe, but must obey him who commands me to speak plaine, and to flatter no flesh upon the face of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>But what have you to do (said she) with my marriage?</p>
                  <p>If it please your Majestie (said he) patiently to hear me, I shall shew the truth in plaine words. I grant your Majestie offered unto me more then ever I required, but my answer was then as it is now, That God hath not sent me to awaite upon the Courts of Princes, or upon the Chamber of Ladies, but I am sent to preach the Evangell of Jesus Christ, to such as please to hear; it hath two points, <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>Faith:</hi> Now (Madame) in preaching repentance, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity it is that the sinnes of men be noted, that they may know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they offend.<note place="margin">Let this serve for our times.</note> But so it is that the most part of your Nobilitie, are so addicted to your affections, that neither Gods Word, nor yet their Common-wealth are rightly regarded; and therefore it becometh me to speake, that they may know their dutie.</p>
                  <p>What have you to do (said she) with my marriage, or what are you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Common-wealth?</p>
                  <p>A subject, borne within the same, (said hee) Madame; and albeit I be neither Earle, Lord, nor Barron within it, yet hath God made me, (how abject that ever I be in your eyes) a profitable and usefull Member within the same; Yea, Madame, to me it appertaineth no lesse to forewarne of such things as may hurt it, if I foresee them, then it doth to any one of the Nobility; for both my Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Office craveth plainnesse of me: and therefore (Madame) to your selfe I say, that which I spake in publick, Whensoever the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of this Realme shall be content, and consent that you be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to an unlawfull husband, they doe as much as in them lieth, to renounce Christ,<note place="margin">Let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists judge this day 1567.</note> to banish the truth, to betray the freedome of this Realme, and perchance shall in the end doe small comfort to your selfe.</p>
                  <p>At these words howling was heard, and teares might have beene seene in greater abundance then the matter required: <hi>Iohn Arskin</hi> of <hi>Dun,</hi> a man of meeke and gentle spirit, stood beside, and did what he could to mittigate the anger, and gave unto her many pleasant words, Of her Bounty, of her Excellencie, and how that all the Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> would be glad to seek her favours; but all that was to cast Oyl into the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire. The said <hi>Iohn</hi> stood still, without any alteration of countenance for a long time, while that the Queen gave place to her in ordinate passions; and in the end he said, Madame, in Gods presence I speak, I never delighted in the weeping of any of Gods Creatures, yea, I can scarcely well abide the teares of mine own Boyes, when my own hands corrects them; much lesse can I rejoyce in your Majesties weeping; but seeing I have offered



<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61872:222"/>
unto you no just occasion to be offended, but have spoken the truth, as my Vocation craves of me: I must sustaine your Majesties teares, rather then I dare hurt my conscience, or betray the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth by silence. Herewith was the Queene more offended, and commanded the said <hi>Iohn</hi> to passe forth of the Cabinet, and to abide further of her pleasure in the Chamber.</p>
                  <p>The Laird of <hi>Dun</hi> tarried, and Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Coldinghame</hi> came into the Cabinet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so they remained with her neere the space of one houre. The said <hi>Iohn</hi> stood in the Chamber, as one whom men had never seene (so were all afraid) except that the Lord <hi>Uchil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie</hi> bare him company; And therefore began he to make discourse with the Ladies who were there sitting in all their gorgeous appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell: Which when he espied,<note place="margin">Note Women.</note> he merrily said, Fair Ladies, How pleasant were this life of yours, if it should ever abide; and then in the end that we might passe to Heaven with this geare: But fie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that knave, Death, that will come whether we will or not; and when he hath laid on the Arrest, then foule wormes will be busie with this flesh, be it never so faire and so tender. And the silly soule, I fear, shall be so feeble, that it can neither carry with it Gold, Garnishing, Targating, Pearle, nor precious Stones. And by such and the like discourse entertained he the Ladies, and past the time, till that the Laird of <hi>Dun</hi> willed him to depart to his house, till new advertisement.</p>
                  <p>The Queen would have had the sentiment of the Lords of the Articles, if that such manner of speaking deserved not punishment. But shee was counselled to desist; And so that storme quieted in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but never in the heart.</p>
                  <p>Short after the Parliament, <hi>Lethington</hi> returned from his Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> GOD in the <hi>February</hi> before had stricken that bloodie Tyrant the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>; which somewhat brake the heat of our Queene for a season: But short after the returning of <hi>Lethington,</hi> Pride and Malice began to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves againe. The Queene set at liberty the Bishop of Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes,</hi> and the rest of the Papists that before were put in prison for violating of the Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lethington</hi> at his returning, shewed himselfe not a little of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that any brute should have beene raised of the Queenes Marriage with the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>; for he took upon him to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, That any such thing had never entered into her heart: But how true that was, we shall hereafter heare. The end of his acquaintance and complaint was, To discredit <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> who had affirmed, That such a Marriage was both proposed, and upon the part of the Queen, by the Cardinall accepted. <hi>Lethington</hi> in his absence had run into a very evil brute among the Nobility, for



<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61872:223"/>
too much serving the Queens affections against the Common-wealth: And therefore had he, as one that lacked not worldly wisedome, made provision both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>; for in <hi>England</hi> he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled for the Freedome of the Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and by that means obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed promise of his favour: He had there also taken order for the home coming of the Earle of <hi>Lenox,</hi> as we shall after hear. In <hi>Scotland</hi> he joyned with the Earle of <hi>Atholl</hi>; him he promoted, and set forward in Court; and so began the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> to be defaced: And yet to the said Earle, <hi>Lethington</hi> at all times shewed a fair countenance.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lethingtons</hi> practice.</note> The rest of that Summer, the Queen spent in her Progresse thorow the West Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where in all Towns and Gentlemens places, she had her Masse; which coming to the ears of <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> he began that forme of prayer which ordinarily he saith after thanks-giving at his Table: (1.) <hi>Deliver us, O Lord, from the bondage of Idolatry.</hi> (2.) <hi>Preserve and keep us from the tyranny of strangers.</hi> (3.) <hi>Continue us in Peace and Concord amongst our selves, if they good pleasure be, O Lord, for a season.</hi> Whilst that divers of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars of the said <hi>Iohn</hi> asked of him, Why he prayed for quietnesse to continue for a season, and not rather absolutely, that we should continue in quietnesse: His answer was, <hi>That he durst not pray, but in faith; and faith in Gods Word assured him, That constant quietnesse would not continue in that Realme, wherein Idolatry had been suppressed, and then was permitted to be erected againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the West Countrey, the Queen past into <hi>Argyle</hi> to the Hunting, and after returned to <hi>Sterlin.</hi> The Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> the Lord <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Halyrud-house,</hi> and Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Coldingham,</hi> past to the Northlands, where Justice Courts were holden.<note place="margin">Note diligently</note> Theeves and Murtherers were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: Two Witches were burnt; the eldest was so blinded with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, that she affirmed, That no Judge had power over her. The same time Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Coldingham</hi> departed this life in <hi>Innernes:</hi> It was affirmed, That he commanded such as were beside him to say to the Queen, That unlesse she left her Idolatry, God would not fail to plague her: He asked God mercy that he had so far born with her in her impiety, and had maintained her in the same; and that no one thing did him more grief, then that he had flattered, fostered, and maintained in her fury against God and his servants.<note place="margin">The last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Queen.</note> And in very deed, great cause had he to have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his wickednesse: For besides all his other infirmities, he in the end, for the Queens pleasure, became enemy to vertue, and all vertuous men, and a patron to impiety, to the uttermost of his power; yea, his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome was so kindled against God and his Word, that in his rage he burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth these words; <hi>Do I see the Queens Majesty so troubled with the rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these knaves? I shall leave the best of them sticked in the Pulpit.</hi> What further villany came forth of his stinking throat and mouth, modesty will not suffer us to write: whereof if he had grace unfainedly to repent, it is no small document of Gods mercies: But however God wrought with him, the Queen regarded his words as winde, or else thought them to have been forged by others, and not to have proceeded from himself; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed plainly, They were invented by the Laird of <hi>Pittarrow,</hi> and Master <hi>Iohn Wood,</hi> both whom she hated, because they flattered her not in her

dancing, and other things. One thing in plain words she spoke. That God took alwayes from her those persons in whom she had greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and that she repented. But of farther sins no mention.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Queen lay at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> with her Idolatry in her Chappell in the Palace of <hi>Halyrud-house,</hi> were left certain <hi>Duntiberis,</hi> and others of the French Menzie, who raised up their Masse more publikely then they had done at any time before: For upon the same Sundayes that the Church of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> had the Ministration of the Lords Table, the Papists in a great number went to the Abbey to their Abomination: Which understood, divers of the Brethren being sore offended, consulted how to redresse that enormity: And so were appointed certain of the most zealous, and most upright in Religion, to wait upon the Abbey, that they might note such persons as resorted to the Masse; and perceiving a great number to enter into the Chappell, some of the Brethren thrust in also: Whereat the Priest and French Dames being afraid, made the Showt to be sent to the Town; and Madame <hi>Baylie,</hi> Mistris to the Queens <hi>Dountibures</hi> (for maids that Court would not then well bear) posted on with all diligence to the Comptroller the Laird of <hi>Pittarrow,</hi> who then was in Saint <hi>Geills</hi> Church at the Sermon, and cryed for his assistance, to save her life, and to save the Queens Palace: Who, with greater haste then need required, obeyed her desire, and took with him the Provest and Baylies, and a great part of the faithfull; but when they came where the fear was bruted to have been, they found all things in quiet, except the tumult they brought with themselves, and peaceable men talking to the Papists, forbidding them to transgresse the Laws. True it is, a zealous brother, named <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Cranston,</hi> past into the Chappell, and finding the Altar covered, and the Priest ready to go to his abominable Masse, said, <hi>The Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is not here; How dare you then be so malapert, as openly to do against the Law?</hi> No further was done or said, and yet brute hereof was posted to the Queen (with such information as the Papists could give: Which found such credit as their hearts could have wished for) which was so haynous a crime in her eyes, that satisfaction for that sin was there none, without blood; And therefore without delay were summoned <hi>Androe Armstrong,</hi> and <hi>Patrick Cranston</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to finde surety to under-lie the Law; for fore-thought Fellony, having made violent invasion into the Queens Palace, and for spoliation of the same. These Letters divulgate, and the extremity feared, the few Brethren that were within the Towne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted upon the next remedy, and in the end concluded, That <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> (to whom the charge was given to make advertisements, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever danger should appear) should write to the Brethren in all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, giving information as the matter stood, and requiring their assistance, which he did, in manner as here ensueth.</p>

And because that upon the Sunday before (the Queen being absent) there resorted to that Idoll a rascall multitude, having openly the least devillish Ceremony (yea, even the conjuring of their accursed water) that ever they had in the time of greatest blindenesse: But because (I say) our said Brethren past, and that in most quiet manner, to note such abusers, these fearfull Summons are directed against them, to make, no doubt, a preparation upon a few, that a doore may be opened to execute cruelty upon a greater multitude. And if so it come to passe, God, no doubt, hath justly recompenced our former negligence and ingratitude towards him and his benefits, in our owne bosomes. God gave us a most notable Victory of his and our enemies: he brake their strength, and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their counsells; he left us at freedome, and purged the Realme, for the most part, of open Idolatry; To the end that we, ever mindefull of so wondrous a deliverance, should have kept this Realme cleane from such vile filthinesse, and damnable Idolatry. But we, alas, preferring the pleasure of flesh and blood, to the Pleasure and Commandment of God, have suffered that Idoll the Masse publikely to be erected againe: And therefore justly suffers he us now to fall in that danger, That to look to an Idolater going to his Idolatry, shall be reputed a crime little inferiour to Treason; God grant that we fall not farther. And

now I, whom God of his mercy, hath made one amongst many, to travell in setting forward his true Religion within this Realme, seeing the same in danger of ruine, cannot but in conscience crave of you, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of all states, that have professed the truth, your presence, comfort, and assistance at the said day in the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> even as ye tender the advancement of Gods glory, the safety of your brethren, and your own assurance; together with the preservation of the Church, in these appearing dangers: It may be (perchance) that perswasions be made to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and that ye may be informed, that either your assembly is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, or else that it will offend the upper Powers, and my good hope is that neither flattery nor fear shall make you so farre to decline from Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">Bond to a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall defence in the cause of Religion.</note> as that against your publike promise, and solemne Band, you will leave your Brethren in so just a cause; and albeit there were no great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet cannot our Assembly be unprofitable, for many things requiring consultation, which cannot be had unlesse the wisest and godliest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene. And thus doubting nothing of the assistance of our God, if that we uniformly seek his glory, I cease farther to trouble you, committing you heartily to the protection of the Eternall.</p>

                  <p>THe Brethren advertised by this Letter, prepared themselves, so many as was thought expedient for every Towne and Province, to keep the day appointed; but by the means of some false brethren, the Letter came to the hands of the Queene, and the manner was this, It was read in the Towne of <hi>Ayre,</hi> where was present Master <hi>Robert Cunningham,</hi> stiled Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The said Master <hi>Henry</hi> being Enemy to all that unfainedly professed the Lord Jesus, but chiefly to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> for the libertie of his Tongue, for he had affirmed,<note place="margin">Note Pastors.</note> as ever still he doth affirme, That a Bishop that receives profit and feeds not the Flock, (even by his owne labours) is both a Thiefe and a Murtherer: The said Master <hi>Henry</hi> (we say) thinking himselfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie that he had found so good occasion to trouble him, whose life he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, posted the said Letter, with his counsell, to the Queen, who then lay in <hi>Sterlin.</hi> The lettet being read, it was concluded by the Councell of the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> that is, by the most secret Councell. That it imported Treason; whereof the Queen did not a little rejoyce, for she thought once to be avenged of that her great Enemy. It was concluded, that the Nobilitie should be written for; that the condemnation should have the greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, the day was appointed, about the midst of <hi>December</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was kept of the whole Councell, and of divers others, such as the Master of <hi>Maxwell,</hi> the old Laird of <hi>Lethington,</hi> and the said President.</p>

                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:61872:225"/>In the meane time the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> returned from the North, to whom Secretary <hi>Lethington</hi> opened the matter, as best pleased him. The Master of <hi>Maxwell</hi> (after made Lord <hi>Heris</hi>) gave unto the said <hi>Iohn</hi> as it were a discharge of the familiaritie which before was great betwixt them,<note place="margin">The Master of <hi>Maxwells</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> and their reasoning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> unlesse that he would satisfie the Queen at her own will. The answer of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was, that he knew no offence done by him to the Queens Majestie, and therefore he knew not what satisfaction to make. No offence, (said he) Have you not written Letters, desiring the brethren from all parts to convene, to <hi>Andro Armstrong</hi> and <hi>Patrick Cranstons?</hi> That I grant, (said the other) but therein I acknowledge no offence done by me. No offence (said he) to convocate the Queens Leidges. Not for a just cause (said the other) for greater things were reputed no offence within these two yeers. The time (said he) is now other, for then our Soveraigne was absent, and now she is present. It is neither the absence nor the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Queen (said he) that rules my conscience, but God plainly speaking in his Word; what was lawfull to me the last yeer, is yet lawfull, because my God is unchangeable.</p>
                  <p>Well (said the Master) I have given you my counsell, doe as you list, but I think you shall repent it if you bow not unto the Queen.</p>
                  <p>I understand not (said he) what you meane; I never made my selfe an adverse partie unto the Queens Majestie, except in the point of Religion, and thereunto I think you will not desire me to bow.</p>
                  <p>Well (said he) you are wise enough, but you will not finde that men will beare with you in times to come, as they have done in times by past.</p>
                  <p>If God stand my friend, (said the other) as I am assured he of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will, so long as I depend upon his promise, and preferre his glory to my life and worldly profit, I little regard how men behave themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, neither yet know I wherinto any one man hath born with me in times by-past, unlesse it be, that of my mouth they have heard the Word of God, which in time to come if they refuse, my heart will be perfect, and for a season I will lament; but the incommodity will be their owne. And after these words (hereunto the Laird of <hi>Lochinvar</hi> was witnesse) they departed, but unto this day, the seventeenth day of <hi>December,</hi> 1571. yea, never in this life met they in such familiarity as before.</p>
                  <p>The bruit of the accusation of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> being devulgate, Master <hi>Iohn Spence</hi> of <hi>Condie</hi> Advocate, a man of gentle nature, and one that professed the doctrine of the Evangell, came as it were in secret to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the cause of that great bruite; to whom the said <hi>Iohn</hi> was plain in all things, and shewed unto him the double of the Letter; which heard and considered, he said, I thank God, I came unto you with a fearfull and sorrowfull heart, fearing that you had done such a Crime as Lawes might have punished, which would have been no small trouble to the heart of all such as have received the Word of life which you have preached; but I depart greatly rejoyced, as well because I see your own comfort, even in the midst of the troubles, as that I clearly understand, that you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no such Crime as you are bruited with; you will be accused (said he) but God will assist you; and so he departed.</p>

                     <pb n="367" facs="tcp:61872:225"/>The Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> and the Secretary sent for the said <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Clerk of the Registers house, and began to lament that he had so highly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Queens Majestie,<note place="margin">Before they disdained not to come to his own house.</note> for the which they feared should come a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to him, if the businesse were not wisely foreseen; they shew what pains and travel they had taken to mittigate her anger, but they could finde nothing but extremity, unlesse that he himself would confesse his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and put him in her Majesties will. To which Heads the said <hi>Iohn</hi> answered, as follows:</p>

                        <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> his answer.</note> (said he) I have learned not to crie Conjuration and Treason at every thing that the godlesse multitude doth condemn, nether yet to fear the things that they fear; I have the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of a good conscience, that I have given no occasion to the Queens Majestie to be offended with me, for I have done nothing but my duty, and so whatsoever shall thereof ensue, my good hope is, that my God will give me patience to bear it; but to confesse an offence where my Conscience witnesseth there is none, far be it from me. How can it be defended (said <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi>) have you not made a Convocation of the Queens Leiges? If I have not (said he) a just defence for my fact, let me smart for it. Let us hear (said they) your defences, for we would be glad that you might be found inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.

At these words they seemed both offended, and so the Secretary departed, but the said Earle remained still, and would have entred into further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the state of the Court with the said <hi>Iohn</hi>; who answered, My Lord, <hi>I</hi> understand more then <hi>I</hi> would of the state of the Court, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not needfull that your Lordship trouble me with the recounting thereof;<note place="margin">This was the first time the Earle <hi>Murray</hi> spake with <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> after the Parliament</note> if you stand in good case, <hi>I</hi> am content, and if you do not, as <hi>I</hi> fear you do not already, or else you shall not do it ere it be long, blame not me, you have the Councellors whom you have chosen, my weak judgement both they and you despised: <hi>I</hi> can do nothing but behold the end, which I pray God it be other then my troubled heart feareth.</p>

The Brethren of the Town followed in such number, that the inner Close was full, and all the Staires, even to the Chamber door where the Queen and Counsell sate, who had been reasoning amongst themselves before, but had not fully satisfied the Secretaries minde. And so was the Queen retired to her Cabbinet, and the Lords were talking one with another, as occasion served. But upon the entry of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> they were desired to take their places, as they did, sitting as Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors one against another.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, according to his dignity, began the one side, upon the other side sate the Earle of <hi>Argile,</hi> and consequently followed the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Mershall,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruthven,</hi> the common Officers, <hi>Pittaro</hi> then Controller, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice <hi>Clerk,</hi> with Master <hi>Iohn Spence</hi> of <hi>Condie</hi> Advocate, and divers

others stood by; removed from the Table, sate old <hi>Lethington</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Secretary, Master <hi>Henry Sinclare</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rosse,</hi> and Master <hi>Iames Makgill</hi> Clerke of the Register.</p>
                  <p>Things thus put in Order the Queen came forth, and that with no little worldly pompe, was placed in a Chaire having two faithfull Supporters, the Master of <hi>Maxwell</hi> upon the one Torre, and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Lethington</hi> upon the other Torre of the Chaire, whereon hee waited diligently; at the time of the Accusation, sometime the one was speaking in her Eare, and sometime the other: Her pompe lacked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an womanly gravitie; for when she saw <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> standing at the other end of the Table bare-headed; at the first she smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and after gave a guaf of laughter; whereunto her <hi>Placebo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> gave their <hi>Plaudite,</hi> assenting with like countenance.</p>
                  <p>This is a good beginning (she said) but know you whereat I laugh? Yon man caused me to crie, and shed never a Tear himself; I will see if I can cause him to grieve. At that word the Secretary whispered her in the Eare, and she him again, and with that gave him a Letter; after the inspection whereof, he directed his visage and speech to <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> in this manner.</p>
                  <p>The Queens Majesty is informed, That you have travelled to raise a Tumult of her Subjects against her; and for Certification thereof, there is presented to her your owne Letter, subscribed in your name: Yet because her Majesty will do nothing without good advertisement, she hath convened you before this part of the Nobilitie, that they may witnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and her.</p>
                  <p>Let him acknowledge (said she) his owne hand-writing, and then shall we judge of the Contents of the Letter; and so was the Lettet sent from hand to hand to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> who taking inspection of it, said, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this to be my hand-writing; and also I remember, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited a Letter in the month of <hi>October,</hi> giving signification to the Brethren in divers Quarters, of such things as displeased me; and so good opinion have I of the fidelity of the Scribes, that willingly they would not adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate my originall; albeit that I left divers blanks subscribed with them. And so I acknowledge both the Hand-writing, and the Dictatement.</p>
                  <p>You have done more (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) then I would have done. Charity (said the other) is not suspitious. Well, well, (said the Queen) read your own Letter, and then answer to such things as shall be demanded of you. I shall do the best I can (said the other) and so with a loud voice he began to reade, as before is expressed. After that the Letter was read, it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented again to M. <hi>Iohn Spence</hi> her Advocate; for the Queen commanded him to accuse, as he did, but very gently. After (we say) that the Letter was read, the Queen beholding the whole Table, said, Heard you ever (my Lords) a more dispightfull and Treasonable Letter? While that no man gave answer, <hi>Lethington</hi> addressed himself to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> and said, M. <hi>Knox,</hi> are you not sorry from your heart, and do you not repent that such a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath passed your Pen, and from you hath come to the knowledge of others? <hi>I. Knox</hi> answered, My Lord Secretary, before I repent I must be taught of my offence. Offence, (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) if there were no



<pb n="369" facs="tcp:61872:226"/>
more but the vocation of the Queenes Leiges, the offence cannot be denyed. Remember your selfe (my Lord) said the other, there is a difference betwixt a lawfull Vocation and an unlawfull: If I have been guilty in this, I have oft offended since I came last in <hi>Scotland</hi>; for what Vocation of Brethren hath ever been this day, unto which my Pen hath not served? and before this no man laid it to my charge as a crime. Then was then, and now is now (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) we have no need of such Vocation, as sometimes we have had. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> answered, The time that hath been, is even now before my eyes; for I see the poor Flock in no lesse danger, then it hath been at any time before, except that the devill hath gotten a Vizard upon his face:<note place="margin">Note this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> Before he came in with his own face, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by open Tyranny, seeking the destruction of all that refused Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; and then, I think, you will confesse the Brethren lawfully assembled themselves for defence of their lives: And now the devill comes, under the cloke of Justice, to do that which God would not suffer him to do by strength. What is this (said the Queen) methinks you trifle with him: Who gave you Authority to make Convocation of my Lieges? Is not that Treason? No, Madame (said the Lord <hi>Rnthuen</hi>) for he makes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the people, to hear Prayer and Sermon, almost dayly: And what ever your Majestie or others thinke thereof, we think it no Treason. Hold your peace (said the Queen) let him answer for himself. I began Madame (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) to reason with the Secretary (whom I take to be a better Dialectationer then your Majestie is) That all Convocation is not lawfull: And now my Lord <hi>Ruthuen</hi> hath given the instance; which if your Majestie will deny, I shall make my selfe ready for the proof. I will say nothing (said the Queen) against your Religion, nor against your convening to your Sermons: But what Authority have you to Convocate my subjects when you will, without any Commandment? I have no pleasure (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) to decline from my former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; And yet, Madame, to satisfie your Majesties two questions, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That at my will I never convened four persons in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but at the Order that the Brethren hath appointed, I have given divers Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements, and great multitudes have assembled thereupon. And if your Majestie complaineth, That this was done without your Majesties Commandment; I answer, So hath all that God hath blessed within this Realme, from the beginning of this action: And therefore, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I must be convinced by a just Law, that I have done against the Duty of Gods Messenger, in writing of this Letter, before that I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be sorry, or yet repent for the doing of it, as my Lord Secretary would perswade me; for what I have done, I have done at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Generall Church of this Realme. And therefore I thinke I have done no wrong. You shall not escape so (said the Queene) Is it not Treason, my Lords, to accuse a Prince of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I thinke there are Acts of Parliament to be found, against such Whisperers. This was granted to be true of many: But wherein (said Master <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) can I be accused? Reade this part of your Letter (said the Queene) which began, This fearfull Summons is directed against them (to wit, the Brethren aforesaid) to make,



<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61872:227"/>
no doubt, a preparation upon a few, that a door may be opened to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute cruelty upon a greater multitude. Lord (said the Queen) What say you to that? While many doubted what the said <hi>Iohn</hi> should answer, he said unto the Queen, Is it lawfull for me, Madame, to answer for my self? Or shall I be condemned before I be heard? Say what you can (said she) for I thinke you have enough ado. I will first then desire (said he) of your Majestie,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> Madame, and of this Honourable audience, Whether if your Majestie knows not that the obstinate Papists are deadly enemies to all that professe the Evangel of Jesus Christ; And that they most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire the extirpation of all them, and of the true Doctrine that is taught within this Realme?<note place="margin">As the Irish Papists have done to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> The Queen held her peace; but all the Lords with common consent and voyce, said, God forbid that either the life of the faithfull, or yet the staying of the Doctrine, stood in the power of the Papists; for just experience hath taught us what cruelty is in their hearts. I must proceed then (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) seeing that I perceive that all will grant, That it were a barbarous cruelty to destroy such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as professed the Evangell of Jesus Christ within this Realme, which oftner then once or twice they attempted to do by force, as things done of late dayes do testifie: Whereof they being (by Gods providence) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, have invented more crafty and dangerous practices, to wit, To make the Prince party,<note place="margin">Let this be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this day.</note> under colour of Law; and so, what they could not do by open force, they shall performe by crafty deceit: For who thinks (my Lords) That the insatiable cruelty of the Papists (within this Realme, I mean) shall end in the murthering of those two, now unjustly summoned, and more unjustly to be accused? I thinke no man of judgement can so esteem, but rather the direct contrary; that is, By this few number, they intend to prepare a way to their bloody en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise against the whole. And therefore (Madame) cast up when you list, the Acts of your Parliaments, I have offended nothing against them; For I accuse not in my Letter your Majestie, nor yet your nature, of cruelty: But I affirm yet again, That the pestilent Papists, who have enflamed your Majestie without cause against these poore men at this present, are the sons of the devill, and therefore must obey the desires of their father, who hath beene a Murtherer from the beginning. You forget your selfe (said one) you are not in the Pulpit. I am in the place (said the other) where I am commanded in my conscience to speak the truth; and therefore the truth I speak, impugne it who so lists: And hereunto I adde (Madame) that honest, meeke and gentle natures (in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) by wicked and corrupt Councellors, may be changed and altered to the direct contrary. Example we have of <hi>Nero,</hi> whom in the beginning of his Empire we finde,<note place="margin">Let the world judge what ensued.</note> having some naturall shame; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that his flatterers had encouraged him in all impiety, alleadging that nothing was either unhonest, or yet unlawfull in his Person, who was Emperour above others: When he had drunken of this Cup (I say) to what enormies he fell, the Histories beare witnesse. And now, Madame, to speak plain, Papists have your Majesties ear patent at all times; assure your Majestie, they are dangerous Councellors, and that your Mother found. As this was said, <hi>Lethington</hi> singled, and



<pb n="371" facs="tcp:61872:227"/>
spake secretly to the Queene in her eare, What it was, that the Table heard not: But immediately she addressed her visage and speech to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> and said, Well, you speak fair enough here, before my Lords, but the last time I spake with you secretly, you caused me to weep many tears, and said to me stubbornly, Ye cared not for my weeping. Madame, (said the other) because now the second time your Majesty hath burthened me with that crime, I must answer, lest for my silence I be holden guilty: If your Majestie be ripely remembred, the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> yet living to testifie the truth, was present at that time, whereof your Majesty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth. Your Majesty accused me, That I had irreverently spoken of you in the Pulpit. That I denied. You said, What had I to do to speak of your Marriage? What was I, that I should meddle with such matters? I answered, As touching Nature, I was a worm of this earth; and yet a subject to this Common-wealth: But as touching the Office wherein it hath pleased God to place me,<note place="margin">Note Pastors.</note> I was a Watch-men both over the Realme, and over the Church of God gathered within the same; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof, I was bound in conscience to blow the Trumpet publikely, so oft as ever I saw any appearance of danger, either of the one, or of the other. But so it was, that a certaine brute affirmed, That a Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique of Marriage was betwixt your Majestie and the Spanish <hi>Allia.</hi> Whereunto I said, That if your Nobility and State did agree, unlesse that both you and your husband should be straitly bound, that neither of you might hurt the Common-wealth, nor yet the poor Church of God within the same; in that case I should pronounce, That the consenters were troublers of the Common-wealth, and enemies unto God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Truth planted within the same. At these words, I grant, your Majestie stormed, and burst forth in an unreasonable weeping: what miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation the Laird of <hi>Dun</hi> would have made, I suppose your Majesty hath not forgot: But while that nothing was able to stay your weeping, I was compelled to say, I take God to witnesse, I never took pleasure to see your Majestie make such regret; But seeing I have offered to your Majestie no such occasion, I must rather suffer your Majestie to take your own pleasure, then I dare conceale the truth, and so both betray the Church, and the Common-wealth. These were the most extreme words I spake that day. After that the Secretary had conferred with the Queen, he said, Master <hi>Knox,</hi> you may returne to your house for this night. I thank God and the Queens Majesty (said the other.) And (Madame) I pray God to purge your heart from Papistry, and to preserve you from the counsell of flatterers; for how pleasant that ere they appear to your ear, and corrupt affections for the time, experience hath taught us in what perplexity they have brought famous Princes. <hi>Lethington,</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Maxwell,</hi> were that night the two stoups of her Chayre. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> being departed, the Tables of the Lords, and others that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, were demanded every one their voyce, If <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> had not offended the Queens Majestie? The Lords voted uniformly, That they could finde no offence (the Queen was past to her Cabinet.) The flatterers of the Court (and principally <hi>Lethington</hi>) raged. The Queen was brought again, and placed in the Chayre: And they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded



<pb n="372" facs="tcp:61872:228"/>
to vote over again: Which thing highly offended the whole Nobility, and began to speak in open audience, What? shall the Laird of <hi>Lethington</hi> have power to controll us? Or shall the presence of a woman cause us to offend God, and to condemne an innocent against our consciences, for the pleasure of any creature? And so the whole Nobility absolved <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> againe,<note place="margin">Note diligently</note> and praised God for his modestie, and for his plain and sensible answers. Yet before the end, one thing is to be noted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, That amongst so many <hi>Placeboes</hi> (we mean the flatterers of the Court) there was not one that plainly durst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the said poore man, that was accused; God ruling their tongues, that sometimes ruled the tongue of <hi>Balaam,</hi> when gladly he would have cursed Gods people.</p>
                  <p>This perceived, the Queen began to upbraid Master <hi>Henry Sinclare,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rosse,</hi> and said (hearing his vote to agree with the rest) Trouble not the barne, I pray you, trouble him not, for he is newly wakened out of his sleep; Why should not the old fool follow them that past before him? The Bishop answered coldly, Your Majesty may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, That it is neither affection to the man, nor love to his Profession, that moved me to absolve him, but the simple truth (which plainly appears in his defence) drawes me hereunto, albeit that others would have condemned him and it. This being said, the Lords and whole Assistants arose and departed. That night was neither dancing nor fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Court, for our Soveraigne was disappointed of her purpose; which was, To have had <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> in her will, by voice of her Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> absolved by the greatest part of the Nobility, from the crime intended against him, even in the presence of the Queen, she raged, and her <hi>Placeboes</hi> stormed: And so began new assaults to be made at the hands of the said <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> to confesse an offence, and to put him in the Queens will, and she should promise, That his greatest punishment should be, But to go within the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and immediately to returne to his own house: He answered, God forbid that my confession should condemne these Noble-men, who in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and in displeasure of the Queen,<note place="margin">Note the craft of the Court.</note> have absolved me; And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am assured, ye will not in earnest desire me to confesse an offence, unlesse that therewith you would desire me to cease from Preaching: For how can I exhort others to Peace, and Christian quietnesse, if I confesse my self an author and mover of sedition.</p>
                  <p>The generall Assembly of the Church approached, which began the five and twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> 1563. But the just Petitions of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and Commissioners of Churches, wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But then the whole Assembly said, If the Queen will not, we must; for both third and two parts are rigorously taken from us, and from our Tenants. If others (said one) will follow my counsell, the Guard and the Papists shall complaine, as long as our Ministers have done. At these words, the former sharpnesse was coloured, and the Speaker alleadged, That hee meant not of all Ministers:

                     <hi>Christopher Goodman</hi> answered, My Lord Secretary, if you can shew me what just Title either the Queene hath to the Third, or the Papists to the two parts, then I think I should resolve you whether she were Debtor to Ministers within <hi>Burgh,</hi> or not: But thereto he received this check for answer; <hi>Ne sit Peregrinus curiosus in aliena Republica</hi>; that is, <hi>Let not a Stranger be curious in a strange Common-wealth.</hi> The man of God answered, Albeit I be a Stranger in your policy, yet so am I not in the Church of God; and therefore the care doth no lesse appertain to me in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then if I were in the middest of <hi>England.</hi>

                     </note> Many wondred at the silence of <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> for in all these quick reasonings he opened not his mouth; the cause thereof he himself expressed in these words:</p>

The danger that appeared to me in my Accusation was not so fearfull, as the words that came to my Ears were dolorous to my heart; for these words were plainly spoken, and that by some Protestants, What can the <hi>Pope</hi> do more, then to send forth his Letters, and require them to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let me have your judgements therefore whether I have usurped any power to my self; or if I have obeyed your commandment.</p>
                  <p>The Flatterers of the Court (amongst whom the Justice <hi>Clerk</hi> then not the least) began to storme, and said, shall we be compelled to justifie the rash judgements of men; My Lord (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) you shall speak your pleasure for the present, of you I crave nothing, but the if Church that is here present, do not either absolve me, or else condemne me, never shall I in publike or in private, as a publike Minister, open my mouth in doctrine or reasoning.</p>
                  <p>After long contention the said <hi>Iohn</hi> being removed, the whole Church found, that a charge was given unto him, To advertise the Brethren in all Quarters, as oft as ever danger appeared; and therefore avowed that fact not to be his onely,<note place="margin">Remark false brethren.</note> but the fact of the whole assembly. Thereat were the Queens Claw-backs more enraged then ever they were, for some of them had promised the Queen to get the said <hi>Iohn</hi> convinced, both by the Councell, and by the Church; and being frustrate of both, she and they thought themselves not a little disappointed.</p>

as Monsters; the Guard, and the Affairs of the Kitchin were so gripping, that the Minsters stipends could not be had; and yet at the Assembly last past, solemne promise was made in the Queens Name, by the mouth of Secretary <hi>Lethington,</hi> in the audience of the Nobilitie, and of the whole Assembly, who affirmed that he had commandment of her Highnesse, to promise full content unto all the Ministers within the Realme, and of such Order to be kept in all times to come, that the whole body of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants should have occasion to stand content; The Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the same, with many other faire promises given by writing, by <hi>Lethington</hi> himself; as in the Register of the Acts of the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly may be seene; but how that or yet any other thing promised in her name, to the Church of God, was observed, the world can witnesse.</p>
                  <p>The Ministers perceiving all things to tend to ruine, discharged their consciences in publike and in private, but they received for their labour hatred and indignation; and amongst others, that worthy servant of God Master <hi>Iohn Craig,</hi> speaking against the manifold corruption that then (without shame or fear declared it self, said, Sometimes was Hypocrites known by their noted habits, and we had men to be Monks, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be Nuns; but now all things are so changed, that we cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Earle from the Abbot, nor the Nunne from him that would be esteemed the Nobleman; so that we have gotten a new order of Monkes and Nunnes; But, said he, seeing you are not ashamed of that unjust profit,<note place="margin">

And so that was the second time that he had given defiance unto the servants of God.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon arose whisperings and complaints, although the Flatterers of the Court, complaining that men were not charitably handled, might not since be reproved in generall, albeit men were not specially taxed, that all the world might know of whom the Preacher speakes; whereunto was this answer made, Let men be ashamed publikely to offend, and the Ministers shall abstain from specialities; but so long as Protestants are not ashamed manifestly to do against the Evangell of Jesus Christ, so long cannot the Ministers of God cease to crie, that God would be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon such abusers of his holy Word.</p>
                  <p>Thus had the servants of God a double battaile, fighting upon the one side against the Idolatry and the rest of the abominations mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Court; and upon the other part, against the unthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of such as sometimes would have been esteemed the chief Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Church within the Realme.

                  <p>O Lord, how long shal the wicked prevail against the just? how long wilt thou suffer thy Self and thy blessed Evangell to be despised of men?

                  <p>The generall assembly holden in <hi>Iune,</hi> 1564. approached, unto the which a great part of the Nobilitie (of those that are called Protestants) conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, some for assistance of the Ministers, and some to accuse them, as we

shall after hear. A little before these troubles, which Sathan raised in the Body of the Church, began one <hi>David</hi> an Italian, to be great in the Court; the Queen used him for Secretary, for things that appertained to her secret affairs, or elsewhere: great men made suit unto him, and their suits were the better heard: But of his beginning and progresse, we delay now further to speak, and refer it unto another fitter occasion of time and place, because that his end will require the description of the whole. The first day of the generall Assembly, neither the Courtiers; nor the Lords that depended upon the Court, presented themselves in Session with their Brethren; whereat many wondred. One ancient and honourable man, the Laird of <hi>Lundie,</hi> said, Nay, I wonder not at their absence; but I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that at our last Assembly they drew themselves apart, and joyned not with us, but drew from us some of our Ministers, and willed them to conclude such things as were never proposed to the publike Assembly, very prejudiciall to the Liberty of the Church; and therefore my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, That they shall be informed of this offence, which the whole Brethren have conceived of their former Fact; Humbly requiring, That if they be Brethren, that they would assist their Brethren with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and counsell, for we had never greater need: And if they be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fall back from us, it were better we knew it now, then afterwards. Thereto agreed the whole Assembly, and gave Commission to certaine Brethren, to signifie the mindes of the Assembly unto the Lords; which was done that same afternoon. The Courtiers at the first seemed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle offended, that they should be as it were suspected of defection; yet neverthelesse upon the morning they joyned with the Assembly, and came unto it; but they drew themselves (like as they did before) apart, and entred into the inner Councell-House. They were the Duke, the Earls of <hi>Argyle, Murray, Mortoune, Glencarne, Mershall,</hi> Lord <hi>Rosse,</hi> the Master of <hi>Maxwell,</hi> Secretary <hi>Lethington,</hi> the Justice Clerk, the Clerk of the Register, and the Laird of <hi>Pittarrow</hi> Comptroller.</p>
                  <p>After a little consultation, they directed a Messenger, M. <hi>George Hay,</hi> the Minister of the Court, requiring the Superintendents, and some of the learned Ministers, to confer with them. The Assembly answered, They convened to deliberate upon the common affairs of the Church, and therefore that they could not lack their Superintendents, and chiefe Ministers, whose judgements were so necessary, that the rest should sit (as it were) idle, without them; And therefore willed them, as oft before, That if they acknowledged themselves Members of the Church, that they would joyn with their Brethren, and propose in publike such things as they pleased, and so they should have the assistance of the whole, in all things that might stand with Gods Commandment: But to send from themselves a portion of their company, they understood, That thereof hurt and slander might arise, rather then any profit or comfort to the Church; for they feared that all men should not stand content with the conclusion, where the conference and reasonings were heard but of a few.</p>

                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:61872:231"/>This answer was not given without cause; for no small travell was made, to have drawn some Ministers to the faction of the Courtiers, and to have sustained their Arguments and Opinions: But when it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the most politick amongst them, That they could not travell by that means, they prepared the matter in other termes, purging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, That they never meant to divide themselves from the Society of their Brethren, but because they had certain Heads to confer with certain Ministers. But the Assembly did still reply, That secret Conference would they not admit, in those Heads that should be concluded by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Voice. The Lords promised, That no Conclusion should be taken, neither yet Vote required, till that both the Propositions and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons should be heard and considered by the whole Body; and upon that condition were directed unto them, with expresse charge, To conclude nothing, without the knowledge and advise of the Assembly, The Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> Superintendent of <hi>Angus,</hi> the Superintendents of <hi>Lothain</hi> and <hi>Fyfe,</hi> Master <hi>Iohn Row,</hi> Master <hi>Iohn Craig, William Christieson,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>David Lyndsay,</hi> Ministers; with the Rector of Saint <hi>Androes,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>George Hay,</hi> the Superintendent of <hi>Glasgow:</hi> Master <hi>Iohn Willock</hi> was Moderator, and <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> waited upon the Scribe; And so were they appointed to sit with the Brethren: And yet because the principall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint touched <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> he was also called for.</p>

Secondly, How necessary a thing it is, That the Queens Majestie by all good Offices of the part of the Church (so spake he) and of the Ministers principally should be retained in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant opinion, that they unfainedly favoured her advancement, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her subjects to have a good opinion of her. And last, How danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a thing it is, That the Ministers should be noted one to disagree from another in form of Prayer for her Majestie: And in these two last Heads (said he) we desire you all to be circumspect: But especially, we most crave of you our Brother <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> to moderate your selfe, as well in form of praying for the Queens Majesty, as in Doctrine that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, touching her State and Obedience: Neither shall ye take this (said he) as spoken to your reproach, <hi>quia mens pulchra, interdum in corpore pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chro</hi>; But because that others, by your example, may imitate the like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, albeit not with the same discretion and foresight; and what opinion that may engender in the peoples heads, wise men may foresee.</p>

                           <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> his answer.</note>The said <hi>Iohn</hi> prepared himself for answer as follows: If such as fear God, have occasion to praise him, because that Idolatry is maintained, the servants of God despised, wicked men placed again in Honour and Authority (Master <hi>Henry Sinclare</hi> was of short time before, made Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who before durst not have sitten in Judgement) And finally, if we ought to praise God, because that vice and impiety over-floweth the whole Realm, without punishment, then we have occasion to rejoyce and praise God: But if these and the like, use to provoke Gods vengeance against Realms and Nations, then in my judgement, the godly within



<pb n="379" facs="tcp:61872:231"/>
                        <hi>Scotland</hi> ought to lament and mourn, and so to prevent Gods Judgements, lest that he finding all in a like security, strike in his hot indignation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, perchance, at such as think they offend not.</p>
                     <p>That is one Head (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) whereunto you and I never agreed; for how are you able to prove, That God ever struck or plagued any Nation or People for the iniquity of their Prince, if that they themselves lived godlily? I looked (said he) my Lord, to have audience till that I had absolved the other two parts: But seeing it pleaseth your Lordship to cut me off before the midst, I will answer to your question. The Scripture of God teacheth me, That <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iuda</hi> were punished for the sins of <hi>Manasses.</hi> And if you alleadge, That they were punished because they were wicked, and offended with their King, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their King was wicked; I answer, That albeit the Spirit of God makes for me, saying in expresse words, <hi>For the sins of Manasses,</hi> yet will I not be so obstinate, as to lay the whole sin, and plagues that thereof ensued, upon the King, and utterly absolve the people; but I will grant withall, That the whole people offended with their King; but how, and in what fashion, I fear that ye and I shall not agree: I doubt not but the great multitude accompanied him in all the abomination that he did; for Idolatry and false Religion, hath ever been, and will be, pleasing to the most part of men: But to affirm, That all <hi>Iudah</hi> committed really the acts of his impiety, is but to affirm that which neither hath certainty, nor yet appearance of any truth; for who can think it to be possible, That all those of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should so shortly turn to Idolatry, considering the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Reformation lately before had, in the dayes of <hi>Hezekias:</hi> But yet (sayes the Text) <hi>Manasses made Iuda, and all the inhabitants of Ierusalem to erre.</hi> True it is, the one part (as I have said) willingly followed him in his Idolatry, the other suffered him to defile <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Temple of God with all abominations, and so were they criminall of his sin; the one by act and deed, the other by suffering and permission, even as <hi>Scotland</hi> is this day guilty of the Queens Idolatry; and ye, my Lords, in speciall, above others. Well (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) that is the chief Head wherein we never agreed; but of that we shall speak hereafter: What will ye say as touching the moving of the people to have a good opinion of the Queens Majesty, and as concerning obedience to be given to her Authority? as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the form of Prayer which ye commonly use? My Lord (saith he) more earnestly to move the people, or yet otherwise to pray, then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have done,<note place="margin">Note diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> a good conscience will not suffer me; for he who knows the secrets of hearts, knows, That privately and publikely I have called to God for her conversion, and have willed the people to do the same, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them the dangerous state wherein not onely she her self stands, but also the whole Realm, by reason of her indurate blindnesse. That is (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) wherein we finde the greatest fault, your extremity against her Masse in particular, passeth measure; ye call her a slave to Sathan; ye affirm that Gods vengeance hangs over the Realm, by reason of her impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety: And what is this else, but to raise up the hearts of the poeple against her Majesty, and against them that serve her. Then there was heard an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of the rest of the flatterers, that such extremity could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.

The Master of <hi>Maxwell</hi> said in plain words, If I were in the Queens Majesties place, I would not suffer such things as I hear. If the words of Preachers (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) shall be alwayes wrested in the worst part,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Maxwells</hi> words in the Assembly.</note> then will it be hard to speak any thing so circumspectly (providing that the truth be spoken) which shall not escape the censure of the calumniator. The most vehement (as ye speak) and most excessive manner of Prayer that I use in publike, is this: <hi>O Lord, if thy good pleasure be, purge the heart of the Queens Majestie from the venome of Idolatry,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>and deliver her from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and thraldom of Satan, into the which she hath been brought up, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, for the lack of true Doctrine; and let her see, by the illumination of thy holy Spirit, That there is no means to please thee, but by Iesus Christ thy only Son; and that Iesus Christ cannot be found, but in thy holy Word; nor yet received, but as it prescribes, which is, To renounce our own wisedom, and preconceived opinion, and worship thee as it commands; that in so doing, she may avoid the eternall damnation which is ordained for all obstinate and impenitent to thee; and that this poor Realm may also escape that plague and vengeance which inevitably followeth Idolatry, maintained against thy manifest Word, and the light thereof.</hi> This (said he) is the form of common Prayer, as your selves can witnesse: Now what is worthy of reprehension in it, I would hear. There are three things in it (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) that never liked me; and the first is, Ye pray for the Queens Majesty with a condition, saying, <hi>Illuminate her heart, if thy good pleasure be</hi>; Wherein it may appear, That ye doubt of her conversion; Where have ye the example of such Prayer? Wheresoever the examples are (said the other) I am assured of the Rule, which is this, If we shall ask any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Will, he shall grant us: And our Master Christ Jesus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to pray unto our Father, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> But (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) Where ever finde ye any of the Prophets so to have prayed? It sufficeth me (said the other) my Lord, that the Master and Teacher both of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, hath taught me so to pray. But in so doing (said <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi>) ye put a doubt in the peoples heads of her conversion. Not I (said the other) but her own obstinate rebellion, causeth more then me to doubt of her conversion. Wherein (said he) rebells she against God? In all the actions of her life (said M. <hi>Knox</hi>) but in these two Heads especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; The former is, That she will not hear the Preaching of the blessed Evangel of Jesus Christ.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Note.</hi>
                        </note> 2. That she maintaineth that Idol the Masse. She thinks not that rebellion (said <hi>Lethington.</hi>) So thought they (said the other) that sometimes offered their children unto <hi>Molech</hi>; and yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God affirms, That they offered them unto devils, and not unto God: And this day the Turks think they have a better Religion then the Papists have; and yet I think ye will excuse neither of both from committing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against God; neither yet can ye do the Queen, unlesse ye will make God to be partiall. But (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) Why pray ye not for her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moving any doubt? Because (said the other) I have learned to pray in faith; now faith (ye know) depends upon the Word of God; and so it is that the Word teacheth me, That prayer profiteth the sons and daughters of Gods Election; of which number if she be one or not, I have just cause to doubt; and therefore I pray that God would illuminate her heart, if his good pleasure be so to do: But yet (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) ye can produce



<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61872:232"/>
the example of none that so hath prayed before you. Thereto I have already answered (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) But yet for further declaration, I will demand a question, which is this, Whether ye think that the Apostles prayed themselves, as they commanded others to pray, or not? who doubts of that, said the company that were present. Well then, said <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> I am assured, that <hi>Peter</hi> said these words to <hi>Simon Magus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent therefore of this thy wickednesse, and pray God, That if it be possible, the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> Here we may cleerly see, That <hi>Peter</hi> joynes a condition with his Commandment, That <hi>Simon</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and pray; to wit, If it were possible that his sin might be forgiven, for he was not ignorant, that some sinnes are unto death, and so without all hope of repentance, or remission. And think ye not (my Lord <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> said he) but that same doubt may touch my heart; as touching the Queens conversion, that then touched the heart of the Apostle; I would never (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) heare you, or any other call that in doubt: But your will (said the other) is no assurance to my conscience. And to speak freely, My Lord, I wonder if yee your self doubt not of the Queens conversion; for more evident signes of Induration have appeared, and do appear in her, then <hi>Peter</hi> outwardly could have espyed in <hi>Simon Magus</hi>; for albeit sometimes, he was a Sorcerer, yet joyned he with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, beleeved, and was baptized. And albeit, That the venome of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice remained in his heart, and that he would have bought the holy Ghost; yet, when he heard the fearfull threatnings of God pronounced against him, he trembled; desired the assistance of the Prayers of the Apostles; and so humbled himself, so farre as the judgement of man could peirce, like a true penitent; and yet we see that <hi>Peter</hi> doubts of his conversion; Why then may not all the godly, justly doubt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Queen, who hath used Idolatry, which is also most odious in the sight of the most jealous God, and still continues in the same; yet she despises all threatnings, and refuseth all godly admonitions. Why say ye, That she refuseth admonition, (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) she will gladly hear any man: But what obedience (said the other) to God or to his word ensues of all that is spoken unto her, or when shall she be seen to give her presence to the publike Preaching; I think never (said <hi>Lething<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>) so long as she is thus used. And so long (said the other) yee, and all others must be content, that I pray so, as I may be assured to be heard of my God; that is, That his good will may be done, either in making her comfortable to his Church; or if that he hath appointed her to be a scourge to the same, That we may have patience, and she may be brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Well, (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) Let us come to the second head? Where finde ye, that the Scriptures calls any the bond slaves of Satan, or that the Prophets of God spake of Kings and Princes, so irreverently. The Scripture, said <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> saith, That by nature wee are all the sonnes of wrath: Our Master Christ affirmes, That such as doe sinne, are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to sinne, and that it is the onely Sonne of God that sets men at freedome; now what difference there is betwixt the sonnes of wrath, the servants of sinne, &amp;c. And the slaves of Satan, I understand not, except I be taught; And if the sharpnesse of the terme offend you, I

have not invented that phrase of speech, but have learned it out of Gods Scriptures; for these words I finde spoken unto <hi>Paul, Behold I send thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gentiles, to open their eyes, that they may turne from darknesse unto light, and from the power of Sathan unto God.</hi> Mark the words, my Lord, and stirre not at the speaking of the holy Ghost. And the same Apostle writing to his Scholler <hi>Timothius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note> sayes, <hi>Instruct with meeknesse those that are contrary minded, if that God at any time will give them repentance, that they may know the truth, and come to amendment out of the snare of the Devill, which are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him at his will.</hi> If your Lordship do rightly consider these sentences, you shall not onely finde my words to be the words of the holy Ghost, but also the condition which I use to adde, to have the assurance of Gods Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>But they speak nothing against Kings in Scripture in speciall (said <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi>) and your continuall crying is, The Queens Idolatry, The Queens <hi>Masse</hi> will provoke Gods vengeance.</p>
                     <p>In the former sentence (said the other) I hear not Kings and Queens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but all unfaithfull are pronounced to stand in one rank, and to be in bondage to one Tyrant the Devill. But beleeve me, my Lord, you little regard the state wherein they stand, when you would have them so flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the danger thereof should neither be knowne, neither yet declared to the people.</p>
                     <p>Where will you finde (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) that any of the Prophets did so use Kings, Queens, Rulers or Magistrates.</p>
                     <p>In more places then one, (said the other;) <hi>Ahab</hi> was a King, and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel</hi> a Queen, and yet what the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> said to the one, and to the other I suppose you are not ignorant.</p>
                     <p>That was not cried out before the people, (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) to make them odious unto their subjects.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Elias</hi> said, <hi>Doggs shall lick the blood of Ahab,</hi> (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) <hi>and eate the flesh of Iezabell,</hi> the Scriptures assures me; but that it was whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in their Eares, or in a Corner, I read not; but the plain contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me, which is, that both the people and the Court understood well enough what the Prophet had promised; for so witnessed <hi>Iehu</hi> after that Gods vengeance had stricken <hi>Iezabell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These were singular motions of the Spirit of God (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) and appertaineth nothing to our age.</p>
                     <p>Then hath the Scripture (said the other) deceived me, for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth me, that <hi>whatsoever is written within the holy Scriptures, the same is written for our instruction</hi>; And my Master saith, <hi>That every learned Scribe brings forth of his Treasure, both things old and things new</hi>; and the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> affirmes, <hi>That every Realme or Citie that likewise offends,</hi> (as then did <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) <hi>should likewise be punished.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why then, that the facts of ancient Prophets, and the fearfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, executed before us, upon the disobedient, appertain not unto our age, I neither see, nor yet can understand.</p>
                     <p>But now to put an end to this Head, my Lord, (saith he) the Prophets of God have not spared to rebuke Kings,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The most part of this reasoning, Secretary <hi>Lethington</hi> leaned upon the Master of <hi>Maxwells</hi> Breast, who said, I am almost weary, I would some other would reason in the chief head, which is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched.</p>
                     <p>Then the Earle of <hi>Mortoune,</hi> Chancellor, commanded Master <hi>George Hay</hi> to reason against <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> in the head of obedience due to Magistrates, who began so to doe; Unto whom <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> said, Brother, that ye shall reason in my contrary, I am well content, because I know you to be both a man of learning, and of modesty; but that you shall oppose your selfe unto the Trueth, whereof I suppose your owne conscience is no lesse perswaded,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The said Master <hi>George</hi> answered, That I will not oppose my selfe unto you, as one willing to impugne or confute that Head of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which not onely yee, but many others; yea, and my selfe have affirmed, farre be it from me, for so should I be found contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my selfe; for my Lord Secretary knows, my judgement in that Head.</p>

Well (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) I am somewhat better provided in this last Head, then I was in the other two: Master <hi>Knox,</hi> said he, yesterday we heard your Judgement upon the thirteenth to the <hi>Romanes</hi>; we heard the minde of the Apostle well opened; we heard the causes why God hath established powers upon the earth; we heard of the necessitie that mankinde hath of the same; and wee heard the dutie of Magistrates sufficiently declared; But in two things I was offended, as I thinke some other more of my Lords that were present: which was, Ye made difference betwixt the Ordinance of God, and the persons that were placed in Authoritie: And ye affirmed, That men might refuse the persons, and yet not offend against Gods Ordinance; This is one, the other yee had no time to explaine; but this me thought ye meant, That Subjects were not bound to obey their Princes, if they command unlawfull things, but that they might refuse their Princes; and that they were not ever bound to suffer.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>My Lord said he, The plaine words of the Apostle makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and the facts of many approved by God, prove my affirmative. First the Apostle affirmes, That the powers are ordained of God, for the preservation of quiet and peaceable men, and for the punishment of malefactors; whereof it is plaine, That the Ordinance of God and the power given unto man, is one thing, and the person clad with the Authoritie, is another; For Gods Ordinance is the conservation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, The punishment of vice, and the maintenance of vertue, which in it self, is holy, just, constant, stable, and perpetuall; but men clad with the Authoritie, are commonly prophane and unjust; yee, they are mutable, transitory, and subject to corruption, as God threateneth by his Prophet <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 82.</note> saying, <hi>I have said yee are gods, and every one of you the sonnes of the most high; but yee shall dye as man, and the Princes shall fall like others.</hi> Here I am assured, That the persons, yee soule and body are threatned with death; I think that so ye will not affirm, is the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the Ordinance, and the Power, wherewith God endeued such persons; for (as I have said) it is holy, so is the permanent will of God. And now, my Lord, that the Prince may be resisted, and yet the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God not violated: It is evident that the people resisted <hi>Saul,</hi> when he had sworn by the living God that <hi>Ionathan</hi> should die;<note place="margin">Note this.</note> The people (I say) swore in the contrary, and delivered <hi>Ionathan,</hi> so that a hair of his head fell not: Now <hi>Saul</hi> was the Anoynted Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:61872:234"/>
were his subjects, and yet they resisted him, that they made him no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then men sworn. I doubt (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) That in so doing, the people did well. The Spirit of God (said the other) accuses them not of any crime, but rather praises them, and condemnes the King, as well for his foolish vow and Law made without God, as for his cruell minde, that so severely would have punished an innocent man: But herein will I not stand; this that followeth shall confirme the former. This same <hi>Saul</hi> commanded <hi>Abimelech</hi> and the Priests of the Lord to be slain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had committed Treason (as he alleadged) for intercommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with <hi>David:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 22.</note> His Guard, and principall servants, would not obey his unjust commandment; But <hi>Doeg</hi> the flatterer put the Kings cruelty in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. I will not ask your judgement, Whether that the servants of the King, in not obeying his Commandment, resisted the Ordinance of God, or not; or, Whether <hi>Doeg,</hi> in murthering the Priests, gave obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a just Authority: For I have the Spirit of God, speaking by the mouth of <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Note this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> for assurance, as well of the one, as of the other; for he in his 52. <hi>Psalme,</hi> condemnes that fact, as a most cruell murther; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That God would punish, not onely the commander, but also the mercilesse executer: And therefore I conclude, That they who gainstood his commandment, resisted not the Ordinance of God. And now (my Lord) to answer to the place of the Apostle, who affirms, That such as resist the Power, resist the Ordinance of God; I say, That the power in that place is not to be understood of unjust commandment of men, but of the just power wherewith God hath armed his Magistrates and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, to punish sin, and maintain vertue. And if any man should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise to take from the hands of the faithfull Judge a murtherer and adulterer, or any malefactor that deserved death, this same resisteth Gods Ordinance, and procureth to himself vengeance and damnation, because that he stayed Gods Sword from striking. But so it is, if men in the fear of God oppose themselves to the fury and blinde rage of Princes; for so they resist not God, but the devill, who abuses the Sword and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God. I understand sufficiently (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) what ye mean; unto the one part I will not oppose my self, but I doubt of the other; for if the Queen would command me to slay <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> because she is offended at him, I would not obey her: But if she would command others to do it, or yet by colour of Justice take his life from him, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell if I be bound to defend him against the Queen and her Officers. With protestation (said the other) That the auditors think not that I speak in favour of my self, I say, my Lord, That if ye be perswaded of my innocency, and if God have given unto you such power and credit as might deliver me, and yet suffered me to perish, that in so doing, ye should be criminall and guilty of my blood. Prove that, and win the play (said <hi>Lethington.</hi>) Well, my Lord (said the other) remember your promise, and I will be short in my probation: The Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> was apprehended by the Priests and Prophets (who were a part of the Authority within <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) and by the multitude of the people, and this sentence was pronounced against him, <hi>Thou shalt die the death; for thou hast said, This house shall be like</hi> Siloh, <hi>and this City shall be desolate,



<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61872:235"/>
without any Inhabitant, &amp;c.</hi> The Princes hearing the uprore, came from the Kings house, and sate down in Judgement in the entry of the new Gate of the Lords House; And there the Priests and Prophets, before the Princes, and before all the people, intented their Accusation in these words; <hi>This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this City, and your eares have heard. Ieremiah</hi> answered, That whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had spoken, proceeded from God; and therefore said he; <hi>As for me, behold, I am in your hands, do with me as ye thinke good and right; But know ye for certaine, That if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon your soules, and upon this Citie, and upon the inhabitants thereof: For of a truth, the Lord hath sent me unto you to speake all these words.</hi> Now, my Lord, if the Princes and the whole people should have been guilty of the Prophets blood, How shall ye, or others, be judged innocent before God, if ye shall suffer the blood of such as have not deserved their blood to be shed, when ye may save it. The causes were nothing alike (said <hi>Lethington.</hi>) And I would learn (said the other) wherein the dissimilitude stands. First (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) the King had not condemned him to death; And next, The false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Priests, and the People, accused him without a cause, and therefore they could not be guilty of his blood. Neither of these (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) fights against my argument; For albeit the King was neither present, nor yet had condemned him, yet were the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and chiefe Councellors there sitting in Judgement, who represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kings Authority, hearing the accusation laid unto the charge of the Prophet; And therefore he forewarns them of the danger, as before is said; to wit, That in case he should be condemned, and so put to death, That the King, the Councell, and the whole City of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> should be guilty of his blood, because that he had committed no crime worthy of death: And if ye thinke that they all should have been criminall, onely because that they all accused him, the plain Text witnesseth the contrary; for the Princes defended him, and so (no doubt) did a great part of the People; and yet he boldly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That they should be all guilty of his blood,<note place="margin">God craves of us, That we should oppose our selves to iniquity.</note> if he should be put to death. And the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> gives a reason, Why all are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of common corruption, Because (saith he) <hi>I sought a man amongst them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the Land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none; Therefore have I poured forth my indignation upon them.</hi> Hereof, my Lord, (said he) it is plain, That God craves, not onely that man should do no iniquity in his owne person; but also that he oppose himself to all iniquity, so farre as in him lieth. Then will ye (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) make subjects to controll their Princes and Rulers. And what harme (said the other) should the Common-wealth receive, if the corrupt affections of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Rulers were moderated, and so bridled by the wisedome and discretion of godly subjects, that they should do no wrong, nor no violence to any man. All this reasoning (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) is out of the purpose; For we reason as if the Queen should become such an enemy to our Religion, that she should persecute it, and put innocent



<pb n="387" facs="tcp:61872:235"/>
men to death; while I am assured, she never thought, nor never will do; For if I should see her begin at that end, yea, if I should suspect any such thing in her, I should be as farre forward in that argument, as ye, or any other within the Realme: But there is no such thing; Our Question is, Whether that ye may suppresse the Queens Masse; or, Whether that her Idolatry shall be laid to our charge. What ye may (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) by force, I dispute not: But what ye may and ought to do by Gods expresse Commandment, that I can tell Idolatry ought not onely to be suppressed, but the Idolater also ought to die the death: But by whom? By the people of God (said the other) for the Commandment was given to <hi>Israel,</hi> as ye may reade, <hi>Heare Israel,,</hi> (sayes the Lord) <hi>the Statutes and the Ordinances of the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, a Commandment is given, that if it be heard that Idolatry is committed in any one City, inquisition shall be taken; and if it be found true, That then the whole Body of the People arise and destroy that City, sparing in it neither man, woman, nor childe. But there is no Commandment (said the Secretary) given to punish their King. If he be an Idolater, I finde no priviledge granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Kings (said the other) by God, more then unto the people, to offend Gods Majestie. I grant (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) but yet the people may not be judges to their King to punish him, albeit he be an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. God (said the other) is the Universall Judge, as well unto the King, as to the People: So that what his Word commands to be punished in the one, is not to be absolved in the other. We agree in that (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) But the people may not execute Gods Judgements, but mst leave it unto himselfe, who will either punish it by Death, by Warre, by Imprisonment, or by some other kinde of his Plagues.</p>
                     <p>I know (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) the last part of the reason to be true: But for the first, That the people, yea, or a part of the people, may not execute Gods Judgements against their King, being an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor: I am assured ye have no other Warrant, except your own imaginations, and the opinion of such as more fear to offend their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then God.</p>
                     <p>Why say ye so (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) I have the judgement of the most famous men in <hi>Europe,</hi> and of such as ye your selfe will confesse both godly and learned.</p>
                     <p>And with that he called for his Papers, which produced by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Maitland,</hi> he bagan to reade with great gravity the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Luther, Melancthon,</hi> the mindes of <hi>Bucer, Musculus,</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> how Christians should behave themselves in time of Persecution; yea, the Book of <hi>Baruc</hi> was not omitted, with this conclusion, The ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of those things (said he) hath cost me more travell then I thinke this seven yeers in reading Commentaries.</p>
                     <p>The more pity (said the other) and yet what you have profited your own cause, let others judge. But as for my argument, I am assured you have infirmed it in nothing; for your first two witnesses speak against the Anabaptists, who deny that Christians should be



<pb n="388" facs="tcp:61872:236"/>
subject to Magistrates; or yet that it is lawfull for a Christian to be a Magistrate: whose opinion, I no lesse abhor, then ye do, or any other that liveth. The others speak of Christians subject to Tyrants and Infidels, so dispersed, that they have no other force, but onely to sob unto God for deliverance; that such (indeed) should hazard any further then these godly men wills them, I cannot hastily be of counsell: But my argument hath another ground; for I speak of a people assembled in one Body of a Common-wealth, unto whom God hath given suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent force, not onely to resist, but also to suppresse all kinde of open Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: And such a people yet again I affirme, are bound to keep their Land clean and unpolluted. And that this my division shall not appear strange unto you, ye shall understand that God required one thing of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of his Seed, when he and they were strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi>; and another thing required he of them, when they were delivered from the Bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Let this be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for our times.</note> and the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> granted unto them: The first, and during the time of their Bondage, God craved no more, but that <hi>Abraham</hi> should not defile himselfe with their Idolatry; neither was he, nor his Posterity commanded to destroy the Idolls that were in <hi>Canaan,</hi> or in <hi>Egypt:</hi> But when God gave unto them possession of the Land, he gave unto them this strait Commandment, <hi>Beware that thou make not League or Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie with the inhabitants of this Land: give not thy sonnes unto their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor yet give thy daughters unto their sonnes, &amp;c. But this ye shall do unto them, Cut down their Groves, destroy their Images, breake downe their Altars, and leave thou no kinde of remembrance of these Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Inhabitants of the Land used before; for thou art a holy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto the Lord thy God; defile not thy selfe therefore with their gods, &amp;c.</hi> To this Commandment, I say, are ye, my Lords, and all such as have professed the Lord within this Realme, bound; for God hath wrought no lesse miraculously upon you, both Spiritually and Corporally, then he did unto the Carnall Seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> For in what state your Bodies, and this poor Realme were, within these seven yeers, your selves cannot be ignorant; you, and it were both in the Bondage of a strange Nation, and what Tyrants did raigne over your consciences, God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance may yet again let you feel, because that ye do not rightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and esteeme the benefits received, when our poore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that were before us, gave up their bodies to the flames of fire, for the Testimony of Gods Truth. And when scarcely could be found ten in a Country that rightly knew God, it had been foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to have craved, either of the Nobility, or of the mean Subjects, the suppressing of Idolatry; for that had been nothing, but to have exposed the simple Sheep in a prey to the Wolves: But since that God hath multiplyed knowledge, yea, and hath given the victory to his Truth, even in the hands of his servants, if yee suffer the Land again to be defiled,<note place="margin">Whether this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath come to passe or not, let the world judge.</note> yee, and your Princes shall both drinke the cup of Gods indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The Queen, for her obstinate abiding in manifest Idolatry, in this great light of the Evangell of Jesus Christ; And ye, for your permission and maintaining her in the same. (<hi>Lethington</hi> said,) In that point we will never agree.</p>
                     <p>

                        <pb n="389" facs="tcp:61872:236"/>And where finde ye (I pray you) that ever any of the Prophets, or of the Apostles, taught such Doctrine, That the people should be plagued for the Idolatry of the Prince; or yet, That the Subjects might suppresse the Idolatry of the Rulers, or them for the same. What was the Commission given unto the Apostles? My Lord, (said he) we know it was to preach, and plant the Evangell of Jesus Christ where darknesse before had Dominion; And therefore it behoved them to let them see the light, before that they should will them, to put their hands to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Idolatry: What precepts the Apostles gave unto the faithfull in particular, other then that they commanded, all to fly from Idolatry, I will not affirme: But I finde two things which the faithfull did; The one was, They assisted their Preachers, even against the Rulers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates; The other was, They suppressed Idolatry, wheresoever God gave unto them force; asking no leave of the Emperour, nor of his Deputies. Read the <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Histories, and ye shall finde examples sufficient? And as to the Doctrine of the Prophets, we know they were Interpreters of the Law of God; and we know, They spake as well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings, as unto the People. I read that neither of both would heare them; and therefore came the plague of God upon both; but that they flattered the Kings, more then they did the people, I cannot be perswaded. Now Gods Law pronounces death (as before I have said) to Idolaters without exception of persons.<note place="margin">Note this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> Now, how the Prophets could rightly interpret the Law, and shew the cause of Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ever they threatned, should fall for Idolatry, and for the rest of the abhominations that did accompany it (for it is never alone, <hi>but still corrupt Religion brings with it, a filthy, and corrupt life.</hi>) How (I say) the Prophets could reprove the Vice, and not shew the people their duty, I understand not; And therefore, I constantly beleeve, That the Doctrine of the Prophets was so sensible, That the Kings understood their own abhominations; and the people understood, what they ought to have done in punishing and repressing them. But because that the most part of the People was no lesse Rebellious unto God, then were their Princes; Therefore the one, and the other, conjured against God, and against his servants. And yet my Lord, The facts of some Prophets are so evident, That thereby we may collect what Doctrine they taught; For it were no small absurdity to affirme, that their facts did repugne to their Doctrine. I think (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) ye meane of the History of <hi>Iehu,</hi> What will yee prove thereby? The chief head (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) that ye deny, to wit, That the Prophets never taught, that it appertained to the people to punish the Idolatry of their Kings: The contrary whereof I affirme; and for the probation, I am ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the fact of a Prophet. For ye know my Lord (said he) that <hi>Elizeus,</hi> sent one of the children of the Prophets to annoint <hi>Iehu,</hi> who gave him a commandment to destroy the house of his Master <hi>Achab</hi> for the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try committed by him; and for the innocent blood that <hi>Iezabell</hi> his wicked Wife had shed. While he obeyed and put in full execution (for the which) God promised unto him, the stability of the Kingdome, unto the fourth Generation.</p>
                     <p>

                        <pb n="390" facs="tcp:61872:237"/>Now (said he) here is the fact of a Prophet, that proves, that Subjects were commanded to execute Gods judgements upon their King and Prince. There is enough (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) to be answered thereto; For <hi>Iehu</hi> was a King before he put any thing in execution. And besides, That the fact is extraordinary, and ought not to be Imitate: My Lord (said the other) he was a meere Subject, and no King, when the Prophets ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant came unto him; yea, and albeit that his fellow Captaines hearing of the Message, blew the Trumpet, and said, <hi>Iehu</hi> is King; yet I doubt not, but <hi>Iezabel</hi> both thought, and said, that he was a Traytor; and so did many others that were in <hi>Israel,</hi> and in <hi>Samaria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as touching, That ye alleadge, that the fact was extraordinary, and is not to be imitate: I say, That it had the ground of Gods ordinary judgement, which commandeth the Idolater to dye the death. And therefore, I yet againe affirme, That it is to be Imitate of all those that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres the true Honour of the true Worship and Glory of God, to the affection of flesh, and wicked Princes. We are not bound (said <hi>Lething<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>) to follow extraordinary examples, unlesse we have the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment and assurance. I grant (said the other) if the example repugne to the Law; As if an avaritious and deceitfull man would borrow Silver, Rayment, or other necessaries from his Neighbour, and withhold the same; alleadging, that so he might do, and not offend God; because the <hi>Israelites</hi> at their departure forth of <hi>Egypt,</hi> did so to the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> The example served to no purpose, unlesse that they could produce the like cause,<note place="margin">

                        </note> and the like commandment that the <hi>Israelites</hi> had; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their fact repugned to this Commandment of God, <hi>Thou shalt not steale</hi>: But where the example agrees with the Law, and is, as it were the execution of Gods judgement, expressed within the same; I say, That the example approved of God, stands to us in place of a Commandment; For as God in his Nature, is constant and immutable, so can he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne in the Ages subsequent, that which he hath approved in his servants before us; but in his servants before us, he by his own word confounds all such as crave further approbation of Gods will, then is already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed within his Scriptures; For <hi>Abraham</hi> said, They have <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, whom if they will not beleeve, neither will they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, albeit that any of the dead should rise. Even so (I say) my Lord, that such as will not be taught what they ought to do by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God once given, and once put in practise, will not beleeve nor obey, albeit, that God should send Angels from Heaven to instruct that Doctrine.</p>

                     <p>It shall be free for you (said the other) to doubt as you please, but where I finde execution according to Gods Law, and God himselfe not to accuse the doers, I dare not doubt of the equity of their cause. And farther it appeareth to me, that God gave sufficient approbation and allowance of their fact, for he blessed them with victory, peace and prosperity the space of fiftie two yeers after.</p>
                     <p>But prosperity (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) does not alwayes prove that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the facts of men.</p>
                     <p>Yes, (said the other) when the facts of men agree with the Law of God, and are rewarded according to his owne promise expressed in his Law; I say, that the prosperitie succeeding the fact, is a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible assurance that God hath approved that fact. Now so it is That God hath pronounced in his Law, That when the people shall exterminat and destroy such as decline from him, that hee will blesse them and multiplie them,<note place="margin">Deut. 13. 2 Paral. 26.</note> as he hath promised unto their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                        </note> and plaine it is the people slew their King; and like plain it is, that God blessed them: Therefore yet againe conclude I, that God himselfe approved their fact, and so farre as it was done according to his commandement, it was blessed according to his promise.</p>

                     <p>That the High Priest was the figure of Christ (said the other) I grant, but that he was not a subject, that I deny; for I am assured, that he in his Priesthood had no Prerogative above those that passed before him; now so it is, that <hi>Aaron</hi> was subject to <hi>Moses,</hi> and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him his Lord; <hi>Samuel</hi> being both P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you say, we have no such priests this day, I might answer, That neither have we such Kings this day as then were annointed by Gods commandment, and sate upon the seate of <hi>David,</hi> and were no lesse the figure of Christ Jesus in their just administration, then were the Priests in their appointed Office; and such kings (I am assured) we have not now no more then wee have such Priests; for Christ Jesus being annointed in our nature of God his Father, both King, Priest and Prophet, hath put end to all externall unction. And yet I thinke you will not say that God hath now diminished his graces from those whom he appoints Ambassadours betwixt him and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then he doth from Kings and Princes; and therefore why the servants of Jesus Christ may not also justly withstand Kings and Princes that this day no lesse offend Gods Majestie then <hi>Uzziah</hi> did, I see not; unlesse that ye will not say, that we in the brightnesse of the Evangell, are not so straitly bound to regard Gods glory, nor his Commandments, as were the Fathers who lived under the dark sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Well (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) I will dip no farther in that Head; but how resisted the Priests the King, they onely spake unto him, without further violence intended.</p>
                     <p>That they withstood him (said the other) the Text assures me, but that they did nothing but speak, I cannot understand; for the plain Text affirms the contrary, to wit, That they caused him hastily to depart from the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, yea, and that he was compelled to depart; which manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (I am assured) in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, importeth more then exhorting, or commanding by word.</p>
                     <p>They did that (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) after he was espyed to be leprous.</p>
                     <p>They withstood him before, (said the other) but yet their last fact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms my proposition so evidently, that such as will oppose themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, must needs oppose themselves unto God; for my assertion is, That Kings have no priviledge more then hath the people to offend Gods Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, and if so they do, they are no more exempted from the punishment of the Law, then is any other subject; yea, and that subjects may not onely lawfully oppose themselves to their Kings, whensoever they do any thing that expresly oppugnes Gods Commandment, but also that they may execute judgement upon them, according to Gods Law; so that if the King be a Murtherer, Adulterer, or an Idolater, he should suffer



<pb n="393" facs="tcp:61872:238"/>
according to Gods Law, not as a King, but as an offender: And that the people may put Gods Law in execution, this History cleerly proveth; for how soon that the Leprosie appeared in his forehead, he was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compelled to depart out of the Sanctuary, but also he was removed from all publike society and administration of the Kingdom, and was compelled to dwell in a house apart, even as the Law commanded; and gat no greater priviledge in that case, then any other of the people should have done: And this was executed by the people; for it was no doubt but more were witnesses of his Leprosie then the Priests alone; but we finde none oppose themselves to the sentence of God pronounced in his Law against the Leprosie: And therefore yet again I say, That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to execute Gods Law, even against their Princes, when that their open crimes by Gods Laws deserve punishment; but especially, when they are such as may infect the rest of the multitude. And now, my Lords, (said he) I will reason no longer, for I have spoken longer then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                     <p>And yet (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) I cannot tell what shall be the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>Albeit ye cannot (said the other) yet I am assured what I have proved; to wit,
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>That subjects have delivered an innocent from the hands of their King, and therefore offended not God.</hi>

                           <item>2. <hi>That subjects have refused to strike innocents, when a King commanded, and in so doing, denied no just Obedience.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. <hi>That such as strook at the commandment of the King, were before God reputed mutherers.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>4. <hi>That God hath not onely of a subject made a King, but also he armed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects against their naturall King, and commanded them to take vengeance upon them, according to his Law.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>5. <hi>And lastly, That Gods people hath executed Gods Law against their King, having no further regard to him in that behalf, then if he had been the most simple subject within the Realme.</hi>

                     <p>And therefore, albeit ye will not understand what should be concluded, yet I am assured, That not onely may Gods people, but also, That they are bound to do the same, where the like crimes are committed, and when he gives to them the like power.</p>
                     <p>Well (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) I think ye shall not have many learned men of your opinion.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, (said the other) the Truth ceaseth not to be Truth, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, That men must either know it, or gainstand it. And yet (said he) I praise God, I lack not the consent and approbation of Gods servants in that Head. And with that he presented unto the Secretary

the Apologie of <hi>Magdeburgh,</hi> and willed him to reade the names of the Ministers, who had subscribed the defence of the Town to be a most just defence; and therewith added, That to resist a misled King, is not to resist God, nor yet his Ordinance, &amp;c. Who when he had read, he stouped and said, <hi>Homines obscuri.</hi> The other answered, <hi>Dei tamen servi.</hi> And <hi>Lethington</hi> arose, and said, My Lords, ye have heard the reasons upon both parts; it becomes you now to decide, and to put an order unto Preachers, that they be uniform in Doctrine. May we (think ye) take the Queens Masse from her?</p>
                     <p>While that some began to give, as it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Votes (for some were appointed, as it were, leaders of the rest) <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> said; My Lords, I suppose you will not do contrary to your Lordships promise made to the whole Assembly, which was, That nothing should be voted in secret, till that first all matters should be debated in publike, and that then the Votes of the whole Assembly should put end to the controversie. Now have I onely sustained the argument, and have rather shewn my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in most simple manner, then that I have insisted upon the force and vehemency of any one argument: And therefore I for my part utterly disassent from all voting, untill the whole Assembly have heard the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and the Reasons of both parties; for I unfainedly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, That many in that company are more able to sustain the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then I am.</p>
                     <p>Think ye it reasonable (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) That such a multitude as are now convened, should reason and vote in such heads and matters that concerns the Queens Majesties own Person and Affairs.</p>
                     <p>I think (said the other) That whatsoever should binde the multitude, the multitude should hear it; unlesse they have resigned their power to Commissioners, which they have not done, so far as I understand; for my Lord Justice Clerk heard them with one voyce say, That in no wise would they consent that any thing there should be voted or concluded.</p>
                     <p>I cannot tell (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) if my Lords that be here present, and that bear the burthen of such matters, should be bound to their will: What say ye, my Lords, (said he) will ye vote in this matter, or will ye not vote?</p>
                     <p>After long reasoning, some that were made for the purpose, said, Why may not the Lords vote, and then shew unto the Church whatsoever is done?</p>
                     <p>That appears to me (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) not onely a backward order, but a tyranny usurped upon the Church: But for me, do as ye list (said he) for as I reason, so I wrote; yet protesting as before, That I disassent from all voting, till that the whole Assembly understand as well the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions as the reasons.</p>
                     <p>Well (said <hi>Lethington</hi>) that cannot be done now, for too much time is spent; And therefore, my Lord Chancellor (said he) ask ye the votes, and take ever, one of the Ministers, and one of us.</p>

first, my conscience is this, That if the Queen oppose her self to our Religion (which is the onely true Religion) that in that case the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and States of this Realme, professors of the true Doctrine, may justly oppose themselves to her: But as concerning her Masse, I know it is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, but I am not yet resolved, Whether by violence we may take it from her, or not. The Superintendent of <hi>Fyfe</hi> said, That same is my conscience: And so affirmed some of the Nobility. But others voted frankly, and said, That as the Masse is abominable, so it is just and right that it should be suppressed; And that in so doing, men did no more hurt to the Queens Majesty, then they that should by force take from her a poysoned cup, when she were a going to drink in it.

                     <p>This Conclusion (my Lords) I heard sustained and concluded, as I have said, in a most notable Auditory. The sustainer was a learned man, Master <hi>Thomas de Finola,</hi> Rector of the University, a man famous in that Countrey: Master <hi>Vincentins de Placentia</hi> affirmed the Conclusion to be most true and certain, agreeable both with the Law of God and man. The occasion of this disputation and conclusion, was a certain disorder and tyranny that was attempted by the Popes Governours, who began to make Innovations in the Countrie against the Laws that were before esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, alleadging themselves not to be subject to such Laws, by reason that they were not instituted by the People, but by the Pope, who was King of that Countrey: And therefore they having full Commission and Authority of the Pope, may alter and change Statutes and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Countrey, without any consent of the people. Against this usurped Tyranny, the learned and the people opposed themselves: And when that all reasons which the Popes Governours could alleadge were

heard and consulted, the Pope himself was fain to take up the matter, and to promise, not onely to keep the Liberty of the people, but also that he should neither abrogate any Law nor Statute, neither yet make any new Law, without their owne consent: And therefore, my Lord, (said he) my Vote and my Conscience is, That Princes are not onely bound to keep Laws and Promises to their subjects;<note place="margin">Note dil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gently</note> But also, That in case they fail, they justly may be bridled: For the Band betwixt the Prince and the People is reciprocall.</p>
                     <p>Then start up a claw-back of that corrupt Court, and said, Ye wot not what ye say; for ye tell us what was done in <hi>Bononia</hi>; we are a Kingdom, and they are a Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, (said he) my judgement is, That every Kingdom is, or at least should be a Common-wealth, albeit that every Common-wealth be not a Kingdom; And therefore I think that in a Kingdom no lesse diligence ought to be taken that Laws ought not to be violated, then they ought to be in a Common-wealth, because that the tyranny of Princes who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in a Kingdom, is more hurtfull to the subjects, then is the mis-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of those that from yeer to yeer are changed, in free Common-wealths: But yet, my Lord, to assure you, and all others, that Head was disputed to the uttermost; and then in the end was concluded, That they spake not of such things as were done in divers Kingdoms and Nations, by Tyrannie and negligence of people: But we conclude (said they) what ought to be done in all Kingdoms and Common-wealths, according to the Law of God, and unto the just Laws of man: And if by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the people, by the tyranny of Princes, contrary Laws have been made, yet may that same people, or their posterity, justly crave all things to be reformed according to the originall institution of Kings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths; and such as will not so do,<note place="margin">Note deligently</note> deserve to eat the fruit of their own foolishnesse.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>Iames Markgow,</hi> then Clerk of the Register, perceiving the Votes to be different, and hearing the bold plainnesse of the foresaid servant of God, said, I remember that this same question was long debated on before in my house; and there, by reason we were not all of one minde, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That M. <hi>Knox</hi> in all our names, should have written to M. <hi>Calvin,</hi> for his jugement in the controversie. Nay, (said M. <hi>Knox</hi>) my Lord Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary would not consent that I should write, alleadging, That the greatest weight of the answer stood in the Narrative; and therefore promised, that he would write, and that I should see it: But when divers times I required him to remember his promise, I found nothing but delay. Whereunto the Secretary answered, True it is, I promised to write; and true it is, That M. <hi>Knox</hi> required me so to do; but when I had ripely advised, and deeply considered the weight of the matter, I found more doubts then I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And this is one, amongst others; How durst I, being a subject, and the Queens Majesties Secretary, take upon me to seek resolution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies depending betwixt her Highnesse and her subjects, without her own knowledge and consent.</p>
                     <p>Then was an acclamation of the claw-backs of the Court, as if <hi>Apollo</hi> had given his Responce: It was wisely and faithfully done.</p>
                     <p>

                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:61872:240"/>Well (said <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>) let worldly men praise worldly wisdome so highly as they please, I am assured, that by such shifts Idolatry is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the truth of Jesus Christ is betrayed, whereof God one day will be avenged.</p>
                     <p>At the and at the like sharpnesse were many offended, the Voting ceased, and every Faction began to speak as affection moved; then <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> in the end was commanded yet to write to Master <hi>Calvin,</hi> and to the learned in other Churches, to know their judgement in that Question; which he refused, shewing his Reason, I my self am not onely full resolved in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but also I have heard their judgements, in this and all other things that I have affirmed within this Realme, of the most godly and most learned that he knew in <hi>Europe</hi>; I came not to this Realme without their Resolution; and for my assurance I have the hand-writing of many: And therefore if I should now move the said Questions again, what should I do other, but either shew mine own ignorance and forgetfulnesse, or else inconstancy: And therefore it may please you to pardon me, in that I write not. But I will teach you the surer way, which is, That you write and complain upon me, That I teach publikely, and affirme constantly such doctrine which offends you; and so shall you know their plain mindes, and whether that they and I agree in judgement, or not.</p>
                     <p>Divers said the offer was good, but no man was found that would be the Secretary, and so did that Assembly and long reasoning break up; After the which time the Ministers (that were called precise) were holden as Monsters of all the Courtiers. In all that time the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> was so frame and strange to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> that neither by word nor writ was there any Communication betwixt them, &amp;c.</p>

There were some Articles given in by the Church, especially for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of the Masse universally, and for punishment of vice; but there was little thing granted, save that it was Statute, That scandalous livers should be punished first by prison, and then publikely shewne unto the people with ignominy; but the same was not put in execution. In the end of this moneth of <hi>December,</hi> the generall Assembly of the Church was held at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> many things were ordained for setling of the affaires of the Church.</p>

At this time was granted by an Act of Parliament, the confirmation of the Fewes of Church Lands, at the desire of divers Lords, whereof the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> was chief. During the Queens absence, the Papists of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> went down to the Chappell to hear Masse; and seeing there was no punishment, they waxed more bold: some of them thinking thereby to please the Queen, upon a certain Sunday in <hi>February</hi> they made an Evensong of their own, setting two Priests on the one side of the Quire, and one or two on the other side, with <hi>Sandy Stevin,</hi> Menstrall (Baptizing their children, and making Marriages) who within eight dayes after convinced of Blasphemy, alleadging, That he would give no more credit to the New Testament, then to a <hi>Tale of Robin-Hood,</hi> except it were confirmed by the Doctors of the Church.

                  <p>About the 20 of this moneth arrived at <hi>Edinburgh, Henry Stewart,</hi> Lord <hi>Darley</hi>; from thence he past to <hi>Fyfe:</hi> And in the Place of <hi>Weemes</hi> he was admitted to kisse the Queens hand; whom she liked so well, that she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him before all others; As shall hereafter, God willing, be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Soon after, in the Moneth of <hi>March,</hi> the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> arrived out of <hi>France</hi>; whereat the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> was highly offended, because of the evil report made to him of the Lord <hi>Bothwell</hi>; And passing immediately to the Queens Majestie, demanded of her if it was her will, or by her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that he was come home; and seeing he was his deadly enemy, either he or the other should leave the Countrey, and therefore desired that he might have Justice. Her answer was, That seeing the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> was a Noble-man, and had done her service, she could not hate him: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse she would do nothing that might be prejudiciall to the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> but desired that the matter might be taken away: within few days she caused summon the Earl <hi>Bothwell,</hi> to answer to the course of Law the 2 of <hi>May,</hi> for the Conspiracy which the Earl of <hi>Arrane</hi> had alleadged two

yeers before, and for the breaking of the Ward of the Castle. In the mean while there was nothing in the Court, but Banquetting, Balling, and Dancing, and other such pleasures as were meet to provoke the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered appetite; and all for the entertainment of the Queens Cousin from <hi>England,</hi> the Lord <hi>Darley,</hi> to whom she did shew all the expressions imaginable of love and kindenesse.</p>
                  <p>Within few dayes, the Queen being at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> order was given to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Lethington</hi> to passe to the Queen of <hi>England:</hi> The chief point of his Message was, to declare to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> That the Queen was minded to marry her Cousin the Lord <hi>Darley</hi>; and the rather, because he was so neer of Blood to both Queens: For by his mother, he was Cousin German to the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> also of neer kindred, and of the same name by his father: His mother was Cousin German to the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> Here mark Gods providence; King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth having lost his two sons, did declare his resolution to make the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> his Heir of the Crown; but he prevented by sudden death, that designe ceased: Then come the Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> with intenion to marry King <hi>Iames</hi> his Widow; but that failed also: He marries <hi>Mary Dowglas,</hi> and his son marrieth <hi>Mary,</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth his daughter: And so the Kings desire is fulfilled, to wit, The Crown continueth in the Name and in the Family. The Queen of <hi>England,</hi> neverthelesse, shewed her self nothing pleased therewith, but rather declared, That she would in no wise suffer her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to make such Contracts or Alliance that might be prejudiciall to her, and for the same purpose sent a Post to the Queen with Letters, wherein she complained greatly of the mind of our Mistris, seeing the great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on she bare to her, intending to declare her Heretrix of her Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> providing onely that she would use her counsell in Marriage; but she could not approve her Marriage with the Lord <hi>Darley,</hi> although he was their neer Cousin by Birth, since he was below the Rank of the Queen by Condition, being but a private subject. At the same time she wrote to the Earle of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and to his son, commanding them to repair both into <hi>England.</hi> Some write, That all this was but counterfeit by the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; and from her heart she was glad of the Marriage; for by that means the Succession of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was secured, the Lord <hi>Darley</hi> being the right Heir after the Queen of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizab.</hi> was not angry to see her married to one of inferiour Rank, for by that means she thought the Scots Queen would be lesse proud. During this time, there were certain Letters directed to the Brethren of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to <hi>Dundie, Fyfe, Angus</hi> and <hi>Mernes,</hi> and other places, from the Brethren of <hi>Kyle,</hi> and other places in the West Countrey, desiring the professors of the Evangel in all places, to remember what the Eternall God had wrought, and how potently he had abolished all kinde of Idolatry and superstition, and placed his Word in this Realm; so that no man could say otherwise, but it was the Work of God; who also had delivered this Countrey from the bondage and tyranny of strangers: Neverthelesse by our slothfulnesse, we have suffered that Idol the Masse, not onely to be planted again, but to encrease so, that the maintainers thereof are like, by all appearance, to get the upper hand, which would be the occasion of our destruction: And



<pb n="404" facs="tcp:61872:243"/>
for that the Papists purposed to set up their Idol at <hi>Easter</hi> following, in all places; which was to be imputed to the slothfulnesse, and want of godly zeal of the Professors: Therefore they admonished the Brethren to strive to avert the evil in time, &amp; not to suffer such wickednesse to continue and encrease, lest that Gods heavie wrath come upon us unawares like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming fire. By these Letters many Brethren were animated, and their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits wakened, minding to provide as God should give them grace: And first of all, by the advice of the most learned in <hi>Edinb.</hi> there was a Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, and given to the Queens Majestie by the Superintendent of <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> containing in effect. That the Church in generall of the Realme had divers times most humbly craved of her Majesty, That committers of Adultery should be punished according to the Law of God,<note place="margin">At this time an Italian, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Davie,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in great familiarity with the Queen, so that there was nothing done without him.</note> and the Acts of Parliament, neverthelesse they continued in their wickednes; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists of obstinate malice pretended nothing else, but to erect and set up their Idolatry and Superstition; and especially at <hi>Easter</hi> day following they intended to put the same in practice, which the Brethren and Professors of the Evangel could not suffer; Therefore wished her Majestie to take heed of the matter.</p>
                  <p>This Supplication the Secretary received of the hands of the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents of <hi>Lowthian</hi> and <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and told them, in the Queenes Name, That there should be such provision made, as should serve to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: And for the same purpose, the Queens Majestie writ to all such places as were suspected, especially to the Bishop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> and <hi>Aberdeine</hi> (as was said) not to use any Masse; And that they should not do any such thing as was feared by the Protestants, or convene any Councell, and thereto commanded them. Now the Communion was administred in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the first day of <hi>April,</hi> 1565. At which time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was neer <hi>Easter,</hi> the Papists used to meet at their Masse: And as some of the Brethren were diligent to search such things, they having with them one of the Bayliffs, took one Sir <hi>Iames Carvet</hi> riding hard, as he had now ended the saying of the Masse, and conveyed him, together with the Master of the house, and one or two more of the assistants, to the Tolbuith, and immediately revested him with all his Garments upon him, and so carried him to the Market-Crosse, where they set him on high, binding the Chalice in his hand, and himself fast tyed to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aid Crosse, where he tarried the space of one hour; During which time, the boyes served him with his <hi>Easter</hi> egges. The next day following, the said <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> with his assistants, were accused and convinced by an Assize, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Act of Parliament: And albeit for the same offence he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved death, yet for all punishment, he was set upon the Market-Crosse for the space of three or four hours, the hang-man standing by, and keeping him, the boyes and others were busie with egges casting; and some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists there were, that stopped as far as they could: And as the preasse of people encreased about the Crosse, there appeared to have beene some tumult. The Provest, <hi>Archibald Dowglas,</hi> came with some Halberdiers, and carried the Priest safe againe to the Tolbuith. The Queen being advertised, and having received sinister information that the Priest was dead, suddenly thought to have used and inflicted some extreme



<pb n="405" facs="tcp:61872:243"/>
punishment, for she thought that all this was done in contempt of her, and of her Religion; and it was affirmed, That the Towne should have beene sacked, and a great number executed to death; she sent to such as she plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, commanding them to come to her at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> suddenly with their whole Forces; and in the mean time she sent her Advocate Master <hi>Spence</hi> of <hi>Condie</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to take a sure triall of the matter. The Provest and Councell wrote to the Queen the truth of the matter as it was, desiring her Majestie to take the same in good part, and not to give credit to false reports; and therewith sent to her Majestie the Processe and enrolment of the Court of the Priest Conviet. Thus the Queens Majesty being informed of the truth by her said Advocate, sent againe and stayed the said meeting of men, and sent to the Town a grave Letter, whereof the Copie followeth.</p>

                     <pb n="406" facs="tcp:61872:244"/>BY this manner of writing and high threatning, may be perceived how grievously the Queens Majestie would have been offended if the said <hi>Tarbot</hi> and <hi>Masse-monger</hi> had been handled according to his demerite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely a Papist Idolater, but a manifest Whoremaster, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fighter and blasphemer; neverthelesse within few dayes the Queen charged the Provest and Bailiffs to set him at libertie, commanding them further, That no man should trouble nor molest him in any sort for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cause, and soon after rewarded him with a Benefice, and likewise his Assisters <hi>Iohn Low</hi> and <hi>Iohn Kennedie</hi> set at libertie in the same manner. At this <hi>Easter</hi>-Tyde in <hi>Sterlin</hi> the Queen made her domestick servants use Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisticall Rites and Ceremonies, and more, she perswaded others by faire means to do the same, and threatned those that were most constant at the Earle of <hi>Cassels</hi> House. Upon the second day of <hi>May</hi> 1565. conveened at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> with his friends in great numbers to keepe the day of Law against the Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who being called, appeared not, onely the Laird of <hi>Rickerton</hi> protested, That the personall absence of the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> should not be prejudiciall to him, by reason that for just fear, which might happen in the heart of any man, since he had so potent an enemy as the Lord of <hi>Murray,</hi> who, next the Queens Majesty was of greatest estimation and Authority of any man within this Realm, to whom assisted at this present day of Law, seven or eight hundred men, which Force he could not resist, and therefore had absented himself; which Protestation being made, those that had been Sureties for his appearance, were Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed. The said Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> a few dayes after past into <hi>France,</hi> after he had been in <hi>Liddesdale,</hi> where suspecting almost every man, he was not in great assurance of his life, notwithstanding he was not put to the Horne, for the Queen continually bore a great favour towards him, and kept him to be a Souldier, as appeared within lesse then half a year; for she would not suffer the Lord <hi>Morton,</hi> nor my Lord <hi>Ariskin,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Murrayes</hi> great friends to keep the day; There assisted my Lord of <hi>Murray,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Argyle, Glencarne,</hi> and <hi>Crawford,</hi> with great numbers, and many Lords and Barons, who for the most part conveened the same Afternoon to Treat and Consult for the maintaining of Religion; where some Articles were devised, and delivered to the Lord of <hi>Murray</hi> to be presented to the Queens Majestie and privie Councell, which Articles were enlarged at the generall assembly following, as shall be declared. In the meane time, as they were informed in Court of this great Assembly of people in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> they were affraid, for naturally the Queen-hated and suspected all such Conventions as were not in her own presence, and devised by her self. The chief Counsellors in the Court, were the Earls of <hi>Lenox</hi> and <hi>Athole.</hi> The Queen writ incontinent for all the Lords to come to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> so soone as she was advertised that they had Treated in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> of Religion; She Writ likewise for the superintendants and other learned men who went thither, and being there they caused to keep the Ports or Gates, and make good Watch about the Towne. The speciall cause of this Convention was to give to the Lord <hi>Darley</hi> Title of Honour openly and solemnly, with consent of the Nobles, before the marriage. The fourth day of <hi>May</hi>



                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:61872:244"/>
the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> came to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where he was well received by the Queens Majestie, as appeared, and immediately, as he past with her to my Lord <hi>Darleys</hi> Chamber, they presented to him a Contract, containing in effect, That forasmuch, as, or since, the Queen had contracted Marriage with the Lord <hi>Darley,</hi> and that therefore sundry Lords of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had under-written, ratified and approved the same, and obliged themselves to grant unto him in full Parliament the Crowne <hi>Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,</hi> (by a new Court Solecisme in Policie, the Crowne for the second time is sirnamed <hi>Matrimoniall</hi>; (before, when the Queen was first married, it was so called also) to serve and obey him and her as their Lawfull Soveraignes. The Queen desired my Lord <hi>Murray</hi> to subscribe, as many others had done before; which hee refused to do, Because (said he) it is required necessarily that the whole Nobility be present, at least the principall, and such as he himself was posteriour unto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that so grave a matter should be advised and concluded.</p>
                  <p>The Queens Majesty no wayes content with this Answer, insisted still upon him, saying, The greatest part of the Nobilitie were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and content with the matter, wished him to be so much a <hi>Stewart,</hi> as to consent to the keeping of the Crown in the Family, and the sirname, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Fathers Will and desire, as was said of him a little before his death: But he still refused for the causes above written.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Lords were assembled, an Ambassadour from <hi>England</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med sir <hi>Nicholas Throckmorton</hi> arrived at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and in his company the Laird of <hi>Lethington</hi>; the Ambassadour was at the Castle Gate or ever they were aware; and as he stood there in the Entry, he was desired to passe to his Lodgings. The next day he had audience of the Queen, and was graciously received according to the dignity of his Message. The whole summe of this his Message was, to shew and declare to the Queene, how highly the Queene his Mistris was offended with this precipitated Marriage, and wondred what had moved her to take a man of inferiour rank and condition, to her selfe: And therefore disswaded her therefrom. And specially desiring her most earnestly to send home her Subjects the Earle of <hi>Lennox</hi> and the Lord <hi>Darley</hi>: But all in vaine for the matter was well farre proceeded. In her heart Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was not angry at this marriage; first, because if Q. <hi>Mary</hi> had married a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Prince, it had been an accesse to her Greatnesse, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently she had been more redoubted by the other; next both <hi>Harry</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were alike and in equall degree of Consanguinitie unto her, the father of <hi>Mary</hi> and the mother of <hi>Harry</hi> being Children to her fathers sister.</p>
                  <p>With many fair words the Queen let the Ambassadour depart, promising to do all she could to satisfie the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; and for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose she would send an Ambassador to her.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time the Queens marriage with the Lord <hi>Darley,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> seeing the other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles consent, gave his, which before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.</note> was prepared and propounded in Councell, and the chief of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, such as the Duke, the Earles of <hi>Argyle, Murray, Glencarne,</hi> with the rest, granted freely to the same, providing that they might have the Religion established in Parliament, by the Queene, and the



<pb n="408" facs="tcp:61872:245"/>
Idolatrous <hi>Masse</hi> and Superstition abolished, shortly it was concluded, That they should convene again to Saint <hi>Iohnstoun,</hi> where the Queen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to take a finall order for Religion. The day was appointed, to wit, the last of <hi>May</hi> at <hi>Perth,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Argile</hi> came too late. The Queens Majestie communed with the Lords, who were very plain with her, saying, Except the <hi>Masse</hi> were abolished, there should be no quietnesse in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The twelfth day of <hi>May</hi> the Lord <hi>Darley</hi> was Belted, (that is, Created) Earle of <hi>Rosse,</hi> with great solemnity, a Belt or Girdle being tyed about his waste or middle; and albeit all kinde of provision was made to make him Duke of <hi>Rothesay,</hi> yet at that time it came not to effect, albeit the Crown and Robe-Royall were prepared to him for the same. For the entertainment of this Triumph there were many Knights made, to the number of 14. The next day, which was the 13 of <hi>May,</hi> the Queen called for the Super-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, by name <hi>Iohn Willock, Iohn Winram,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Spotswood,</hi> whom she cherished with fair words, assuring them that she desired nothing more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly then the glory of God and satisfying of mens consciences, and the good of the Common-wealth; and albeit she was not perswaded in any Religion but in that wherein she was brought up, yet she promised to them that she would hear Conference and Disputation in the Scriptures: And likewise she would be content to hear publike preaching, but alwayes out of the mouth of such as pleased her Majestie; and above all others she said she would gladly hear the Superintendant of <hi>Angus</hi> (for he was a milde and sweet natur'd man) with true honesty and uprightnesse. Sir <hi>Ariskin</hi> of <hi>Dun.</hi> Soon after the Queen past to Saint <hi>Iohnstons,</hi> after that she had direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Master <hi>Iohn Hay</hi> Prior of <hi>Monimusk</hi> to passe to <hi>England,</hi> who sped at the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> hand even as sir <hi>Nicholas Throckmorton</hi> did in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Before the day, which was appointed for the meeting at Saint <hi>Iohnston,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Murray</hi> most carefull of the maintenance of Religion, sent to all the principall Churches, advertising them of the matter, and desiring them to advise, and send the most able men in Learning and Reputation, to keep the day; but their craft and dissimulation appeared, for the Dean of <hi>Restalrigge</hi> who lately arrived out of <hi>France,</hi> with others, such as Mr. <hi>Iohn Lesley</hi> Parson of <hi>Vure,</hi> afterward Bishop of <hi>Rosse,</hi> caused the Queen to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that thing whereof she was easily perswaded, to wit, That there ought to be given to all men libertie of conscience, and for this purpose to shun or put off the first day appointed; The Queen writ to the Nobility, that because she was informed that there was great meetings out of every Shire and Town in great number; and then the other partie (so termed she the Papists) were minded together to the said Convention, which should apparently make trouble or sedition, rather then any other thing; therefore she thought it expedient, and willed them to stay the said meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to deferre the same till such a day that she should appoint with advice of her Councell. At this time there was a Parliament proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be held at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the twentieth day of <hi>Iuly.</hi> By this Letter, some of the Protestants having best judgement, thought themselves sufficiently warned of the Inconveniences and troubles to come. Now her Councell at this time, was onely the Earles of <hi>Lenox</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thole,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> but chiefely <hi>David Rizio</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> ruled all;



<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61872:245"/>
yet the Earle of <hi>Rosse</hi> already in greatest credit and familiarity. These Letters were sent out to the Lords about the eight and twentieth day of <hi>May</hi>; and within twelve dayes thereafter, she directed new Missives to the chief of the Nobility, desiring or, commanding them, to come to Saint <hi>Iohnston</hi> the three and twentieth day of <hi>Iune</hi> following, to consult upon such things as concerned Religion, and other things as her Majesty should propose; Which day, was even the day before that the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly should have been held in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> This last Letter uttered the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the former; so that the Protestants thought themselues sufficiently warned. Always as the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> was passing to Saint <hi>Iohnston</hi> to have kept the said day, he chanced to fall sick of the Fluxes in <hi>Lochlevin,</hi> where he remained till the Queen came forth of Saint <hi>Iohnston</hi> to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> where the generall Assembly of the whole Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was held, the four and twentieth day of <hi>Iuly.</hi> The Earls of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne</hi> assisted the Church with a great company of Lords, Barons, and others: It was there ordered and concluded, That certain Gentlemen, as Commissioners from the Church National, should passe to the Queens Majesty, with certain Articles, to the number of six, desiring her most humbly to ratifie and approve the same in Parliament. And because the said Articles are of great weight, and worthy of memory, I thought good to insert the same word by word.</p>

The next day, ere they were aware, the Queen departed to <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately they followed; And after they had gotten audience, they desired the Queens Majestie most humbly to give their dispatch. She answered, That her Councell was not there present, but she intended to be in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> within eight dayes, and there they should receive their answer. At the same time, as the generall Assembly was holden in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren perceiving the Papists to brag, and trouble like to be, they assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselves at Saint <hi>Leonard Cragg,</hi> where they concluded they would defend themselves; and for the same purpose, elected eight persons of the most able, two of every Quarter, to see that the Brethren should be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy armed.</p>

should be reasoned in her presence; which for the gravity of the same, there could nothing be concluded at that time, albeit the Queens Majestie had heard more in that matter, then ever she did before: But within eight dayes thereafter, she understood that a great part of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility should be present in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where they should have a finall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.

                                 <hi>TO the first, Desiring the Masse to be suppressed and abolished, as well in the Head, as in the Members, with punishment against the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veners; As also, the Religion professed to be established by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it was answered, first for her Majesties part,</hi> That her Highnesse is no way yet perswaded in the said Religion, nor yet that any impiety is in the Masse; and therefore believeth, That her loving subjects will not presse her to receive any Religion against her conscience, which should be unto her a continuall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by remorse of conscience, and therewith a perpetuall unquietnesse. And to deale plainly with her Subjects, her Majesty neither will, nor may leave the Religion wherein she hath been nourished and brought up; and believeth the same to be well grounded; Knowing, besides the grudge of conscience that she should receive, upon the change of her owne Religion, That she should lose the friendship of the King of <hi>France,</hi> the married <hi>Allia</hi> of this Realme, and of other great Princes her Friends and Confederates, who would take the same in evil part, and of whom she may look for their great support in all her neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities; And having no assured consideration that may countervaile the same, she will be loth to put in hazard all her friends at an instant, praying all her loving subjects, seeing they have had experience of her goodnesse, that she hath neither in times past, nor yet intends hereafter, to presse the conscience of any, but that they may worship God in such sort, as they are perswaded in their conscience to be best, That they will also not presse her conscience. As to the establishing of Religion in the Body of the Realme, they themselves know, as appears by their Articles, That the same cannot be done onely by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of her Majestie, but requires necessarily the consent of the States in Parliament, and therefore so soon as the Parliament holds, those things which the States agree upon amongst themselves, her Majestie shall consent unto the same; and in the mean time shall make sure, That no man be troubled for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <hi>To the second Article, it is answered,</hi> That her Majestie thinks it no wayes reasonable, that she should defraud her self of so great a part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the Crowne, as to put the Patronage of Benefices forth of her own hands; for her owne necessity, in bearing of her Port and common Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, will require the retention thereof, and that in a good part, in her owne

hands: Neverthelesse her Majestie is well pleased, That consideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had of her owne necessity; And what may be sufficient for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable sustentation of the Ministers, a speciall Assignation be made to them in places most commodious and meet: With which her Majesty shall not meddle, but suffer the same to come to them.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>To the third Article it is answered,</hi> That her Majestie shall do therein as shall be agreed by the States in Parliament.</p>

                  <p>As the Queens Majestie came from Saint <hi>Iohnston,</hi> over <hi>Forth</hi> to the <hi>Callender,</hi> she was conveyed to the Water side of <hi>Forth</hi> with two hundred Spears: For at that time it was bruted, That there was some lying in wait at the Path of <hi>Dron.</hi> In the mean time the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> was in <hi>Locklevin,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Argyle</hi> with him. Now in the Callender the Lord <hi>Levingston</hi> had desired the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie to be Witnesse to the Christning of a childe; For his Lady was lately delivered and brought to Bed: And when the Minister made the Sermon and Exhortation concerning Baptisme, the Queens Majestie came in the end, and said to the Lord <hi>Levingston,</hi> That she would shew him that favour that she had not done to any other before; that is, That she would give her presence to the Protestant Sermon, which was reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great matter.</p>
                  <p>The Queen being in the <hi>Callender,</hi> was informed both by word and Letters by false Brethren, That a great part of the Protestants of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> had lately convened upon Saint <hi>Leonards Craigs,</hi> and there made a Conspiration against her; And had chosen for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, certain Captains to governe the rest; And without any Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or perfect notice taken in the Case, she sent to the Provest and Bayliffs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> commanding them to take and apprehend <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Guthrie, Alexander Clerke, Gilbert Lawder,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Slater,</hi> and put them in prison in the Castle.</p>
                  <p>This new and unaccustomed fashion of proceeding seemed to be very strange: And because the said four persons were not apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, she sent the next day a Charge to the Provest and Bayliffs, and to her owne great Treasurer, to passe to the houses of the said foure men, and likewise to their Booths or Shops, and there to take Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of all their Goods and Chattells; And commanded the said Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer to take the Keyes of the said Houses and Booths, together with the said Inventory; which was executed in effect, especially upon the said <hi>Alexander Guthrie</hi> his wife, he being then common Clerke, and one of the greatest in estimation within the Towne; his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were shut out of their house, and compelled to seek some other lodging in the Town.</p>
                  <p>By this manner of proceeding, the hearts of all men of spirit and judgement were wonderfully abashed and wounded, seeing and perceiving



<pb n="413" facs="tcp:61872:247"/>
these things so furiously handled upon sinister and wrong Information, men never called to their answer, nor heard, nor any triall taken therein. Immediatly thereafter as she came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> she called to counsell such as pleased her Majestie, and there complains of the said matter, alleadging it to be a Conspiracy and manifest Treason. And another matter likewise was complained upon, That the Earle of <hi>Argile</hi> (as the Queen was surely informed) was riding with a great Army to invade the Earle of <hi>Athole</hi> and his Lands. For the first matter it was concluded by the Councell, That diligent inquisition should be made in the matter, and to that purpose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Queens Advocates M. <hi>Iohn Spence</hi> of <hi>Condie,</hi> and M. <hi>Robert Crichton</hi> to examine such as they would; and when the said Advocates had called before them, and examined a sufficient number, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions subscribed and delivered to the Queen, there was nothing found worthy of death nor Treason; at length the said four persons were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to answer at Law.</p>
                  <p>For the matter, That the Queens Majesty should send to the Earles of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi> and <hi>Athole</hi> some of her Councell or familiar servants to take order touching it. And when the Secretary, the Justice <hi>Clarke</hi> and Lord of Saint <hi>Colme</hi> had past to the said Earle of <hi>Argyle,</hi> they found no such thing; but in <hi>Athole</hi> there was great fear come of a sudden fray; for after many Proclamations, the <hi>Fire-Crosse</hi> (which they made use of in lieu of <hi>Beacons</hi>) was raised in <hi>Athole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as the day of the Parliament approached, the Lords pretending to consult before, what should be done, as well in Religion, as for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, the fifteenth day of <hi>Iuly</hi> there conveened at <hi>Sterlin</hi> the Duke, the Earles of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Murray, Rothes,</hi> and other Lords and Barons, and as they were devising and consulting, the Queens Majesty taking their meeting in evill part, sent her Advocates Master <hi>Iohn Spence</hi> and Master <hi>Crichton</hi> to them at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> requiring the cause of their meeting; they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That the speciall occasion of their meeting was for the cause of Religion and the assurance thereof, according as they had lately written to the Queens Majesty in <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aton</hi> from the town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they desiring then to prorogate the day.</p>
                  <p>Finally, when the said Advocates could by no means perswade them to come to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they returned again to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and declared to the Queens Majestie according as they had found.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Parliament was prorogated at the Queens Majesties command to the first of <hi>September</hi> next after following; for it was thought, That the least part and principall of the chiefe Nobility being absent, there could no Parliament be holden: at the same time the Queens Majestie perceiving that the matter was already come to a maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ripenesse, so that the mindes and secrecy of mens hearts must needs be disclosed, she wrote to a great number of Lords, Barons, Gentlmen, and others that were nearest in Fife, <hi>Angus Lowthian, Mers Tevimdale, Perth, Lithgow Clidsdall,</hi> and others to resort to her, in this forme of words hereafter following.</p>

                  <p>THere was likewise Proclamation made in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> That the Queen minded not the trouble, nor alter the Religion; and also Proclamations made in the Shires above mentioned, for the same purpose, That all Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders and other Gentlemen should resort (in the aforesaid manner) to <hi>Edinbronth,</hi> where the Earle of <hi>Rosse</hi> was made Duke of <hi>Rothesay,</hi> with great triumph, the 23 day of <hi>Iuly.</hi> The same afternoon the Queen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained grievously upon the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> in open audience of all the Lords and Barons; and the same day the Bans of the Earle of <hi>Rosse,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Rothesay,</hi> and the Queens Marriage were proclaimed. About this time the Lord <hi>Arskin</hi> was made Earle of <hi>Marre.</hi> In the mean time there were divers Messages sent from the Queens Majestie to the Lord of <hi>Murray,</hi> first, Master <hi>Robert Crichton</hi> to perswade him by all meanes possible to come and resort to the Queens Majestie: his answer was, That he would be glad to come to her self, according to his bounden duty; yet for as much as such persons as were most privie in her company, were his capitall enemies, who also had conspired his death, he could no wayes come so long as they were in Court.</p>
                  <p>Soon after my Lord <hi>Erskin</hi> and the Master <hi>Maxwell</hi> past to him to S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> rather suffered and permitted by the Queen, then sent by her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; after them the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> who was sent by the means of the Earl of <hi>Mar,</hi> but all this did not prevail with him; and when all hope of his coming was past, an Herald was sent to him, charging him to come to the Queens Majesty, and answer to such things as should be laid to his charge within eight and fourty hours next after the Charge, under pain of Rebellion; and because he appeared not the next day after the eight and forty hours, he was denounced Rebell, and put to the Horne. The same order they used against the Earle of <hi>Argyle,</hi> for the Queen said she would serve him

and the rest with the same measure they had mete to others, meaning the said <hi>Argyle.</hi>

                  <p>In the mean while, as the fire was well kindled, and enflamed, all means and wayes were sought, to stir up enemies against the chief Protestants that had been lately at <hi>Sterlin</hi>; for the Earle of <hi>Athole</hi> was ready bent against the Earle of <hi>Argyle:</hi> the Lord <hi>Lindsay</hi> against the Earle <hi>Rothesse</hi> in <hi>Fyfe,</hi> they being both Protestants; for they had contended now a long time for the Heir-ship of <hi>Fyfe:</hi> And that no such thing should be left undone, the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> who now had remained neer three yeers in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in <hi>Dumbar,</hi> was, after some little travell of his friends, received by the Queen; and being thus received into favour, was restored first to the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Gordon,</hi> and soon after to the Earldom of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and to all his Lands, Honours and Dignities, that he might be a bar and a party in the North to the Earle of <hi>Murray.</hi>

                  <p>The next day following, at six hours in the morning, they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the Chappell Royall of <hi>Halyrud-house,</hi> by the Dean of <hi>Lestarrig</hi>; the Queen being all clothed in Mourning: But immediately, as the Queen went to Masse, the King went not with her, but to his Pastime. During the space of three or four dayes, there was nothing but Balling and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and Banqueting.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Earle <hi>Rothesse,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Grange,</hi> the Tutor <hi>Pitcur,</hi> with some Gentlemen of <hi>Fyfe,</hi> were put to the <hi>Horne,</hi> for none appearance; And immediately the Swash, Tabron, and Drums, were stricken or beaten, for men of War to serve the King and Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, and to take their Pay. This sudden alteration, and hasty creation of Kings, moved the hearts of a great number.</p>
                  <p>Now amongst the people there were divers brutes; for some alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the cause of this alteration was not for Religion, but rather for hatred, envie of sudden promotion or dignity, or such worldly causes: But they that considered the progresse of the matter, according as is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore declared, thought the principall cause to be onely for Religion.</p>
                  <p>In this mean time, the Lords past to <hi>Argyle,</hi> taking apparantly little care of the trouble that was to come: Howbeit they sent into <hi>England</hi> M. <hi>Nicolas Elphinston</hi> for support, who brought some Moneys in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to the sum of ten thousand pounds <hi>sterlin.</hi> There came one forth of <hi>England</hi> to the Queen, who got Presence the seventh of <hi>August</hi> in <hi>Haly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rud-house.</hi> He was not well, &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earles <hi>Argile, Murray, Glencarne, Rothesse,</hi> the Lord <hi>Boyd,</hi> and <hi>Ochiltrie,</hi> with divers Barons and Gentlemen of <hi>Fife</hi> and <hi>Kyle,</hi> where they concluded to be in readinesse with their whole Forces the four and twentieth day of <hi>August.</hi> But the King and Queene with great ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity prevented them, for their Majesties sent thorow <hi>Lowthian, Fife, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Stratherne, Tividaile</hi> and <hi>Chiddisdaile</hi> and other Shires, making their Proclamations in this manner, That forasmuch as certaine Rebels, who (under colour of Religion) intended nothing but the trouble and subversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Common-wealth,<note place="margin">Note this for our time.</note> were to convene with such, as they might perswade to assist them; therefore they charged all manner of men under pain of Life, Lands, and Goods, to resort and meet their Majesties at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgow</hi> the 24 day of <hi>August.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Proclamation was made in <hi>Lowthian</hi> the third pay of the said moneth. Upon Sunday the ninteenth of <hi>August,</hi> the King came to the high Kirke of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> made the Sermon; his Text was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the six and twentieth Chapter of <hi>Esayas</hi> his Prophesie, about the thirteenth Verse, where in the words of the Prophet, he said, <hi>O Lord our God,</hi>

                     <hi>other Lords then thou have ruled over us.</hi> Whereupon he tooke occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to speake of the government of wicked Princes, who for the sinnes of the people are sent as Tyrants and scourges to plague them: And amongst other things he said, That God sets in that room (for the offences and ingratitude of the people) Boyes and women. And so other words which appeared bitter in the Kings ears, as, That God justly punished <hi>Ahab</hi> and his Posterity, because he would not take order with that Harlot <hi>Iezabel.</hi> And because he had tarried an hour and more, longer then the time appointed, the King (sitting in a Throne made for that purpose) was so moved at this Sermon, that he would not Dine; and being troubled, with great fury he past in the afternoon to the <hi>Hawking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Immediately <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was commanded to come to the Councell, where in the Secretaries Chamber were convened the Earle of <hi>Athole,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruthven,</hi> the Secretary, the Justice <hi>Clarke,</hi> with the Advocate. There passed along with the Minister a great number of the most apparent men of the Towne. When he was called, the Secretary declared, That the Kings Majestie was offended with some words spoken in the Sermon, (especially such as are above rehearsed) desiring him to abstaine from preaching for fifteen or twenty dayes, and let Master <hi>Craig</hi> supply the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In answering he said more then he had preached, for he added, That as the King had (to pleasure the Queen) gone to <hi>Masse,</hi> and dishonoured the Lord God, so should God in his justice make her an Instrument of his ruine; and so it fell out in a very short time: but the Queen being incensed with these words, fell out in Tears, and to please her <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> must abstain from preaching for a time.</note>He answered, That he had spoken nothing but according to his Text, and if the Church would command him either to speake or abstain, he would obey so far as the Word of God would permit him.</p>
                  <p>Within four dayes after, the King and Queen sent to the Councell of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> commanding them to depose <hi>Archibald Dowglas,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Laird <hi>Craigmiller</hi> for their Provest, which was presently obeyed.</p>

The next day after their arrivall to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the Lords came to <hi>Paisley,</hi> where they remained that night, being in company about one thousand horses. On the morrow they came to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> keeping the high passage from <hi>Paisley</hi> hard by <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where the King and Queen easily might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them. The night following, which was the <hi>penult</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> they remained in <hi>Hamilton</hi> with their Company; but for divers respects mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, they thought it not expedient to tarry; especially, because the Earle of <hi>Argyle</hi> was not come; for his Diet was not afore the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>September</hi> following, to have been at <hi>Hamilton.</hi> Finally, they took purpose to come to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the which they did the next day. And albeit <hi>Alexander Areskin,</hi> Captain under the Lord his brother, caused to shoot forth of the Castle two Shot of Cannon, they being neer the Towne; And likewise that the Laird <hi>Craigmiller</hi> Provest, did his endeavour to hold the Lords forth of the Towne, in causing the common Bells to be rung, for the convening of the Towne, to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect aforesaid, yet they entred easily at the West Port or Gate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any molestation or impediment, being in number, as they esteemed themselves, one thousand three hundred Horses. Immediately they dispatched Messengers Southward and Northward to assist them; but all in vain: And immediately after they were in their Lodgings, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to strike or beat the Drum, desiring all such men as would receive Wages for the defence of the Glory of God, That they should resort the day following to the Church, where they should receive good Pay: But they profited little that way; neither could they in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> get any comfort or support, for none or few resorted unto them; yet they got more rest and sleep when they were at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> then they had done in five or six nights before.</p>
                  <p>The Noble-men of this Company were, The Duke, The Earles <hi>Murray, Glencarne,</hi> and <hi>Rothesse</hi>; The Lords <hi>Boyd</hi> and <hi>Uchiltrie</hi>; The Lairds of <hi>Grange, Cunningham-head, Balcomie,</hi> and <hi>Lavers</hi>; The T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They had written twice, almost to the same effect, to the King and Queens Majesties, after their passing from <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; for the



<pb n="418" facs="tcp:61872:250"/>
Laird of <hi>Preston</hi> presented a Letter to the King and Queens Majestie, and was therefore imprisoned, but soon after released; neverthelesse they got no answer. The same day that they departed out of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the King and Queens Majesties issued out of <hi>Glasgow</hi> in the morning betimes: And passing towards <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Army met their Majesties neer the Bridge of <hi>Cadder:</hi> As they mustered, the Master of <hi>Maxwell</hi> sate downe upon his knees, and made a long Oration to the Queen, declaring what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure she had done to them, and ever laid the whole burden upon the Earle <hi>Murray.</hi> Soon after, they marched forward in Battell aray: The Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> took the Van-guard, the Earle of <hi>Mortoun</hi> the middle Battell, and the King and Queen the Reere: The whole number were about five thousand men, whereof the greatest part were in the Van-guard.</p>
                  <p>As the King and Queens Majesties were within three miles of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> they were advertised that the Lords were departed in the morning; but where they pretended to be that night, it was uncertain: Alwayes soon after their returne to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the King and Queen were certainly adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, That they were past to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; and therefore caused immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to warne the whole Army to passe with them to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the next day; who early in the morning, long before the Sun was risen, began to march: But there arose such a vehement Tempest of winde and raine from the West, as the like had not been seen before in a long time; so that a little brook, turned incontinent into a great River; and the raging storme being in their face, with great difficulty went they forward: And albeit the most part waxed weary, yet the Queens courage encreased man-like so much, that she was ever with the foremost. There was divers persons drowned that day in the water of <hi>Carren</hi>; and amongst others, the Kings Master, a notable Papist, who for the zeal he bare to the Masse, carried about his neck a round god of bread, well closed in a Case, which alwayes could not serve him.</p>
                  <p>Before the end of <hi>August,</hi> there came a post to the Queens Majestie, sent by <hi>Alexander Areskin,</hi> who declared, That the Lords were in the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where there was a multitude of innocent persons, and therefore desired to know if he should shoot. She commanded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent that he should return again to the said <hi>Alexander,</hi> and command him, in her name, That he should shoot so long as he had either Powder or Bullet, and not spare for any body.</p>
                  <p>At night, the King and Queen came well wet to the <hi>Callender,</hi> where they remained that night, and about eight hours at night, the first of <hi>September,</hi> the Post came again to the Castle, and reported the Queenes Command to <hi>Alexander Areskin,</hi> who incontinently caused to shoot six or seven shot of Cannon, whereof the marks appeared, having respect to no reason, but onely to the Queens Command.</p>
                  <p>The Lords perceiving that they could get no support in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> nor Souldiers for money, albeit they had travelled all that they could;



<pb n="419" facs="tcp:61872:250"/>
and being advertised of the Queens returning with her whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they took purpose to depart: And so the next day betimes, long before day, they departed with their whole Company, and came to <hi>Lanrik,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> where the Master of <hi>Maxwell</hi> came to them, with his Uncle the La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> sent two of the Councell of the Town to make their excuse.</p>
                  <p>The next day the King and Queen past to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and sent to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and caused a Proclamation to be made, commanding all men to returne to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where having remained three or four dayes: And understanding that the Lords were past to <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> they returned to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Fyfe</hi>; And in their passage, caused to take in Castle <hi>Campbell,</hi> which was delivered without impediment to the Lord of <hi>Sanquhar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before the King and Queen went out of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> there came from <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> two Ensignes of Foot-men, to convey them into <hi>Fyfe.</hi> In the mean time the Burroughs were taxed in great Sums unaccustomed, for the payment of these Souldiers: Farther, there was raised divers Troops of Horse-men, to the number of five or six hundred Horse. The Souldiers had taken two poor men that had received the Lords wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; which two men being accused and convinced of, at the Queens Command, were hanged at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the third day after the Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting.</p>
                  <p>At this time, M. <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> Parson of <hi>Flesk,</hi> had gotten all the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Court. The third day after the Queens coming to <hi>Fyfe,</hi> the whole Barons and Lairds of <hi>Fyfe,</hi> convoyed her Majestie, till she came to S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> where the said Lairds and Barons, especially the Protestants, were commanded to subscribe to a Band, containing in effect, That they obliged themselves to defend the King and Queens Persons, against Englishmen and Rebells: And in case they should come to <hi>Fyfe,</hi> they should resist them to their utmost power; Which Charge every man obeyed.</p>
                  <p>The second night after the Queens coming to S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> she sent a Band or Troop of Horse-men, and another of Foot, to <hi>Lundie,</hi> and at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night took out the Laird, being a man of 80 yeers old: Then they past to <hi>Fawside,</hi> and took likewise <hi>Thomas Scot,</hi> and brought him to Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes,</hi> where they, with the Laird of <hi>Bavard,</hi> and some others, were commanded to prison.

                  <p>In the mean time the houses of the Earles of <hi>Murray, Rothesse,</hi> and the houses of divers Gentlemen, were given in keeping to such as the Queen pleased, after that their children and servants had been cast out.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:61872:251"/>At the same time the Duke, the Earls of <hi>Glencarne</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> the Lords <hi>Boyd</hi> and <hi>Uchiltrie,</hi> with the Lord of <hi>Cunningham-head,</hi> and the rest, were charged to come and present themselves in S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and Queens Majesties, to answer to such things as should be laid to their charge, within six dayes, under the pain of Rebellion: And the day being expired, and they not appearing, were denounced Rebells, and put to the Horne.</p>
                  <p>As the Queen remained in Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Dundie,</hi> being sore afraid, because of some evil report made of them to the Queen, as if they had troubled the Queen, in seeking men of War, and suffered some to be raised in their Town for the Lords; for there was nothing done in <hi>Dundie,</hi> but it was revealed to the Queen; especially that the Minister had received a Letter from the Lords, and delivered the same to the Brethren, perswading them to assist the Lords; which being granted by the Minister, the Queen remitted it. After great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and supplication made by some Noble-men, at length, the King and Queen being in the Town, they agreed for two thousand marks, five or six of the principall left out, with some others, that were put to their shift. After the King and Queen had remained two nights in the Towne of <hi>Dundie,</hi> they came to S. <hi>Andrews</hi>; and soon after, they came over <hi>Forth,</hi> and so to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> During this time, the Master of <hi>Maxwell</hi> wrote to the King and Queen, making offers for and in the name of the Lords.</p>
                  <p>The next day after the King and Queens coming to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> there was a Proclamation made at the Market-Crosse: And because the same is very notable, I thought good to insert it here word by word, albeit it be somewhat long.</p>

Now for the preservation of our good Subjects, whose case were to be pitied, if they blindely should suffer themselves to be induced and trapped in so dangerous a snare, it hath pleased the goodnesse of God, by the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their own mouthes and writings to us, to discover the poyson that before lay hid in their hearts, albeit to all persons of cleer judgment the same was evident enough before:<note place="margin">Note how this agrees with our times.</note> For what other thing [<hi>is this, but to dissolve the whole Policy, and in a manner to invert the very order</hi>] might move the principal raisers of this tumult to put themselves in Arms against us so unnaturally, upon whom we had bestowed so many benefits; But that the great honor we did them, they being thereof unworthy, made them mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know themselves; and their ambition could not be satisfied with heaping riches upon riches, &amp; honor upon honor, unlesse they retain in their hands

But this could not the multitude have perceived, if God (for disclosing their Hypocrisie) had not compelled them to utter their unreasonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to Governe; for now by Letters sent from themselves to us, which make plain profession, that the establishing of Religion will not content them,<note place="margin">Let this be conferred with our times.</note> but we must be forced to govern by Councell, such, as it shall please them to appoint us; a thing so farre beyond all measure, that we thinke the onely mention of so unreasonable a demand is sufficient to make their nearest Kinsfolks their most mortall enemies, and all men to run on them without further scruple, that are zealous to have their native Countrey to remain still in the state of a Kingdome: For what other thing is this, but to dissolve the whole policie, and (in a manner) to invert the very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, to make the Prince obey, and Subjects command. The like was never demanded by any of our most Noble Progenitors hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yea, not of Governours and Regents; but the Prince and such as have filled their place chose their Councell of such as they thought most fit for the purpose. When we our selves were of lesse age, and at our first returning into this our Realme, we had free choice of our Councell at our pleasure, and now when we are at our full maturity, shall we be brought back to the state of Pupills, and be put under Tutory? So long as some of them bore the whole sway with us, this matter was never called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; but now when they cannot be longer permitted to do and undoe all at their pleasure, they will put a Bridle into our mouthes, and give us a Councell chosen after their fantasie. This is the quarrell of Religion they made you beleeve they had in hand, This is the quarrell for which they would have you hazzard your Lands,<note place="margin">Note diligenly</note> Lives and goods, in the company of a certain number of Rebels against your naturall Prince.

It was uncertain whether their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties intended to passe from <hi>Sterlin</hi> or not, and I beleeve the principall men knew not well at that time; for a report was, That by reason the Castles of <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Draffen</hi> were kept Fortified and Victualled at the Dukes command, that they would passe to siege the said houses, &amp; give them some shot of a Canon; others said, They would passe towards my L. of <hi>Argile,</hi> who had his people alwayes armed, whereof his neighbours were afraid, especially the Inhabitants of <hi>Athole</hi> and <hi>Lenox</hi>; but at length it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that they should passe to <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> as shall be declared.</p>
                  <p>During this time there were Propositions made continually to the King and Queen, by the Lords, desiring alwayes their Majesties most humbly to receive them into their hands: Their Articles tended continually to these two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> To abolish the <hi>Masse,</hi> root out Idolatry, and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the true Religion, And that they and the affaires of the Realm should be governed by the advice and counsell of the true Nobility of the same; offering themselves and their cause to be tried by the Lawes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Yet nothing could be accepted nor taken in good part, albeit the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Maxwell</hi> laboured by all meanes to redresse the matter, who also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the Lords most honourably in <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> for he had the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that Countrey. But he himself incurred the Queens wrath so, that he was summoned to present himself and appear before the King and Queens Majesties, after the same form that the rest of the Lords were charged with, and also commanded to give over the House of <hi>Lochmab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi> and the Castle which he had in keeping for the Queen. And albeit he obeyed not, yet was he not put to the Horne, as the rest. Neverthelesse there was no man that doubted of his good will and partaking with the Lords, who in the mean time sent <hi>Robert Melvin</hi> to the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and declared their state to her Majesty, desiring support.</p>
                  <p>Now the chief care and solicitude that was in the Court, was, By what means they might come to have money, for notwithstanding this great preparation for warre, and eminent appearance of trouble, yet were they destitute of the sinewes of Warre; albeit the Treasurers, and now Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller, to wit, the Laird of <hi>Tilbardin,</hi> had disbursed many thousands; yet there was no appearance of payment of souldiers, nor scarcely how the King and Queens Houses and pompous Trains should be upholden; there

was about 600. Horsmen, besides the Guard and 3. Ensignes of footmen. The charge of the whole would amount to 1000. l. <hi>ster.</hi> every moneth; a thing surpassing the usuall manner of <hi>Scotland.</hi> At this time arrived the Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who was welcome, and graciously received by the Queen, and immediately placed in Councell, and made Lieutenant of the West and middle Marches. Now as every one of the Barons compounded to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from this meeting; the E. of <hi>Athole</hi> demanded of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 200. l. <hi>ster.</hi> but they refused to pay it; notwithstanding <hi>Octo.</hi> 27. there was a certain number of the principall and rich persons of the Town warned by a Macer to passe to the Palace of <hi>Hallyrudhouse</hi> to the King and Queen, who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them by their own mouthes, speaking that they had use for money, and therefore knowing them to be honest men and the inhabitants of the best Citie in their Countrey, they must needs charge them; and for securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they should have other men bound for pledges, or any Hand therefore. The sum that they desired was 1000 l. <hi>sterl.</hi> and no lesse. They being asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, made no answer; but Parson <hi>Flisk</hi> standing by, said, That seeing the King and Queens Majesties desired them so civilly, in a thing most lawfull in their necessitie, they did shew themselves not honest to keepe silence and give no answer to their Majesties, for that must needs be had of them which was required; and if they would not, they should be constrained by the Laws,<note place="margin">So was the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>London</hi> for warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Scotland,</hi> vexed for the leavie of mony</note> which they would not abide; for some of them had deserved hanging (said he) because they had lent large summs of money to the King and Queens enemies, and Rebels; and therefore they must shortly suffer great punishment. Soon after they were called in one by one, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how much they would lend? some made this excuse, and some that, by reason there were that offered to lend money; amongst whom there was one offered to lend 20 l. To him the Earle of <hi>Athole</hi> said, Thou art worthy to be hanged that speakest of 20 l. seeing the Princes charge thee so easily. Finally, they were all imprisoned, and souldiers set over them, having their Muskets ready charged, and their Match lighted, even in the house with them, where they remained all that night, and the next day till night; and then being changed from one prison to another, there were six chosen out and sent in the night to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> convoyed with Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketteers round about them, as if they had been Murtherers or most vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. At length (the third day) by means of the Laird of <hi>Craigmiller</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, and some others, the summe was made more easie, to wit, a 1000 Marks <hi>sterling,</hi> to be paid immediately, and to have the superioritie of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin</hi> in Pledge (to wit) upon condition of Redemption. And besides the said summe of 1000 Marks <hi>sterlin</hi> they paid 1000 l. <hi>sterl.</hi> For the meeting at <hi>Dumfreis</hi> at the day appointed, for electing the officers, the Queen sent in a Ticket such as she would have them to chuse for Provest, Bailiffs, and Councell, whereof there was a number of Papists, the rest not worthy. Of the number given in by the Queen, they named such as should rule for that year; Notwithstanding without free Election, the Laird <hi>Craigmiller,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Provest, who shewed himself most willing to set forward Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to punish vice, and to maintain the Common-wealth. All this time the Ministers cried out against the <hi>Masse</hi> and such Idolatry, for it was more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by the Queen then before.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="424" facs="tcp:61872:253"/>The first day of <hi>October</hi> met in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the Superintendant of <hi>Lothian,</hi> with all the Ministers under his charge, according to their ordinary custome; for every Superintendant used to convene the whole Ministery, and there it was complained on, That they could get no payment of their stipends, not only about the City, but thorow the whole Realm. Therefore after reasoning and consultation taken, they framed a supplication directed to the King and Queen, and immediately presented the same to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties by M. <hi>Iohn Spottswood</hi> Superintendant of <hi>Lothian,</hi> and Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> Minister of <hi>Leith</hi>; it contained in effect, That forasmuch as it had pleased the King and Queens Majesties (with advice of the Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell) to grant unto the Ministers of the Word their stipends to be taken of the Thirds of the Benefices, which Stipends are now detained from the said Ministers by reason of the troubles and changing of the Comptroller, whereby they are not able to live; and therefore most humbly craved the King and Queens Majesty to cause them to be paid. Their answer was, That they would cause order to be taken therin to their contentment. Soon after the Lord <hi>Gordion</hi> came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and left the most part of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Sterlin</hi> with his carriage; the King and Queen for hope of his good service to be done, restored him to his Fathers place, to the Earledome of <hi>Hintley,</hi> the Lands and Heritage thereof. <hi>October</hi> 8. the King and Queene marched forth of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> towards <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> and as they passed from the Pallace of <hi>Hallyrud-house</hi> all men were warned with Jack and Spear. The first night they came to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and the next to <hi>Craford</hi>; the day after the Lairds of <hi>Drunlaurick</hi> and <hi>Lochinvar,</hi> met the Queen, albeit they had been with the Lords familiar enough. The Lords perceiving, that all hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation was past, they rode to <hi>Ednam,</hi> where they remained till the Queen came to <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> and then they past to <hi>Carlile.</hi> Now the Master of <hi>Maxwell,</hi> who had entertained the Lords familiarly, and subscribed with them, and had spoken as highly against their enemies as any of themselves, and had received large mony by that means, to wit, 1000. l. to raise a Band or Troup of Horsmen; and that the same day the King and Queen came to <hi>Dumfreis</hi>; the third day after their coming he came to them, conveyed by the Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> with divers other Noblemen. At length the Earles of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thole</hi> and <hi>Hintley</hi> were Sureties for him, and all things past remitted, upon condition, that he should be a faithfull and obedient subject hereafter. The same day they made Musters, the next day the Army was dispersed, being about 18000. men; the King and Queen past to <hi>Lothinaben,</hi> where the Master of <hi>Maxwell</hi> gave a Banquet, and then forthwith marched to <hi>Tueddall,</hi> so to <hi>Peblis,</hi> and then to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The best and chief part of the Nobility of this Realme, who also were the principall Instruments of the Reformation of Religion, and therefore were called the Lords of the Congregation, in manner above rehearsed, were banished and chased into <hi>England</hi>; they were courteously received and entertained by the Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> Lieutenant,<note place="margin">Note diligently</note> upon the Borders of <hi>England.</hi> Soon after the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> took Post towards <hi>London,</hi> leaving the rest of the Lords at <hi>Newcastle</hi>; every man supposed that the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> should have been graciously received of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and that he should have gotten support according to his hearts desire; but farre



<pb n="425" facs="tcp:61872:253"/>
beyond his expectation, he could get no audience of the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> But by means of the French Ambassadour, called Monsieur <hi>de Four,</hi> his true friend, he obtained audience. The Queen, with a fair counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, demanded, How he, being a Rebell to her sister of <hi>Scotland,</hi> durst take the boldnesse upon him to come within her Realm? These and the like words got he, instead of the good and courteous entertainment expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.

                  </p>
                  <p>After the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> his departure from the Court,<note place="margin">Here mark ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deep dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation, or a great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</note> the Queen sent them some ayd, and writ unto the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: Whether she had promised it in private to the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> or whether she repented her of the harsh reception of the Earle of <hi>Murray.</hi>

                  <p>At this time <hi>David Rizio</hi> Italian, began to be higher exalted, insomuch as there was no matter or thing of importance done without his advice. And during this time, the faithfull within this Realme were in great fear, looking for nothing but great trouble and persecution to be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Yet Supplications and Intercessions were made thorowout all the Congregations, especially for such as were afficted and banished, That it would please God to give them patience, comfort, and constancy; and this especially was done at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> used to call them that were banished, The best part of the Nobility, Chiefe Members of the Congregation: Whereof the Courtiers being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised, they took occasion to revile and bewray his sayings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging, He prayed for the Rebels, and desired the people to pray for them likewise. The Laird of <hi>Lethington</hi> chief Secretary, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the King and Queens Majesties and Councell, confessed that he heard the Sermons, and said, There was nothing at that time spoken by the Minister, whereat any man need to be offended: And further, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared plainly, That by the Scripture it was lawfull to pray for all men.</p>
                  <p>In the end of <hi>November,</hi> the Lords with their complices, were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appear the fourth day of <hi>February,</hi> for Treason, and <hi>laese Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie:</hi> But in the mean time, such of the Nobility as had professed the Evangell of Christ, and had communicate with the Brethren at the Lords Table, were ever longer the more suspected by the Queen, who began to declare her self in the Months of <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> to be maintainer of the Papists; for at her pleasure, the Earles of <hi>Lenox,



<pb n="426" facs="tcp:61872:254"/>
Athole,</hi> and <hi>Cassels,</hi> with divers others, without any dissimulation known, went to the Masse openly in her Chappell: Yet neverthelesse the Earles of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Bothwell</hi> went not to Masse, albeit they were in great favour with the Queen. As for the King, he past his time in Hunting and Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and such other pleasures as were agreeable to his appetite, having in his company Gentlemen willing to satisfie his will and affections.</p>
                  <p>About this time, in the beginning of as the Court remained at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the banished Lords by all means possible, by writings and their friends, made suit and means to the King and Queens Majesties, to be received into favour.</p>
                  <p>At this time the Abbot of <hi>Kylwinning</hi> came from <hi>Newcastle</hi> to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and after he had gotten audience of the King and Queen, with great difficulty he got Pardon for the Duke, and his friends and servants, upon this Condition, That he should passe into <hi>France</hi>; which he did soon after.</p>
                  <p>The five and twentieth of December convened in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the Churches within this Realme for the generall assemblie, There assisted to them the Earles of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Marre,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Lethington,</hi> with some Barons and Gentlemen. The principall things that were agreed and concluded, were, That foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Masse, with such Idolatry, and Papisticall Ceremonies, were still maintained, expresly against the Act of Parliament, and the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations made at the Queens Arrivall; And that the Queen had promised that she would hear Conference and Disputation; That the Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore offered to prove by the Word of God, That the Doctrine preached within this Realme was according to the Scriptures; and that the Masse, with all the Papisticall Doctrine, was but the invention of men, and meer Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That by reason of the change of the Comptroller, who had put in new Collectors, forbidding them to deliver any thing to the Ministry, and by these means the Ministry was like to decay and fail, contrary to the Ordinance made in the yeer of God 1562. in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and support of the Ministery. During this time, as the Papists flocked to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for making Court, some of them that had been Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as black <hi>Abercrommy</hi> and <hi>Roger,</hi> presented supplication to the Queens Majesty, desiring in effect, That they might be permitted to preach; which was easily granted. The noyse was further, That they offered Disputation: For as the Court stood, they thought they had a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage already, by reason they knew the King to be of their Religion, as well as the Queen, with some part of the Nobility, who with the King after declared themselves openly: And especially the Queen was govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Earls of <hi>Lenox</hi> and <hi>Athole</hi>; but in matters most weighty, and of greatest importance, by <hi>David Rizio</hi> the Italian afore mentioned, who went under the name of the French Secretary; by whose means, all grave matters, of what weight soever, must passe; providing always, That his hands were anoynted. In the mean time he was a manifest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Evangell, and therefore a greater enemy to the banished Lords. And at this time, the principall Lords that waited at Court were divided in opinions; For the Earle of <hi>Morton</hi> Chancellor, with the Earle of



<pb n="427" facs="tcp:61872:254"/>
                     <hi>Marr,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Lethington,</hi> were on the one part; and the Earles of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Bothwell</hi> on the other part, so that a certain drynesse was amongst them; neverthelesse, by means of the Earle of <hi>Athole,</hi> they were reconciled. Now as there was preparation made by the Papists for Christmas, the Queen being then at Masse, the King came publikely, and bare company; and the Friers Preached the dayes following, alwayes using another stile then they had done seven yeers before, during which time they had not Preached publikely: they were so little esteemed, that they continued not long in Preaching.</p>
                  <p>At the same time convened in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the generall Assembly of the Ministers, and Commissioners of the Churches Reformed within this Realme: There assisted them of the Nobility, the Earles of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Marr,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lindsay,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Lethington,</hi> with others. The chief things that were concluded in this Assembly, were, That for the avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the plagues and scourges of God which appeared to come upon the people for their sins and ingratitude, there should be proclaimed by the Ministers a publike Fast, to be Universally observed thorowout all the Reformed Churches; which manner of Fasting was soon after devised by <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> at the Command of the Church, and put in Print, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs not here to be recited in this place.<note place="margin">At the end of this Book you shall finde this.</note> What followed upon the said Fast, shall be plainly, God willing, declared. The second thing that was ordained in this Assembly, was, concerning the Ministers, who for want of payment of their stipends, were like to perish, or else to leave their Ministry: wherefore it was found necessary, That supplication should be made to the King and Queens Majesties; And for the same purpose, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain uumber of the most able men were elected to go to their Majesties aforesaid, to lament and bemone their case; Which persons had Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to propose some other things, as shall be declared. The names of them that past from the Church to the King and Queens Majesties, were, M. <hi>Iohn Spotswood,</hi> Superintendent of <hi>Lowthian; Iohn Winrame,</hi> Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent of <hi>Fyfe</hi>; M. <hi>Iohn Row,</hi> Minister of <hi>Perth</hi>; M. <hi>David Lyndsay,</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of <hi>Leith,</hi> who easily obtained audience of the King and Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties: And after their reverence done, M. <hi>Iohn Row,</hi> in name of the rest, opened the matter, lamenting &amp; bewailing the miserable state of the poor Ministers, who by publike command had been reasonably satisfied three yeers or more, by vertue of the Act made with advice of the honorable Privie Councell, for the taking up of the Thirds of the Benefices, which was especially made in their favours: Neverthelesse the Laird of <hi>Tillibar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> new Comptroller, would answer them nothing: Wherefore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought their Majesties for relief. Secondly, seeing that in all Supplications made to the King and Queens Majesties by the Church at all times, they desired most earnestly that all Idolatry and superstition, and especially the Masse, should be rooted out and abolished quite out of this Realme; And that in the last generall Assembly of the Church, by their Commissioners, they had most earnestly desired the same; And that their answer was then, That they knew no impediment in the Masse; therefore the Assembly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, That it might please their Highnesses to hear Disputation, to the end that such as now pretend to Preach in the Chappell Royall, and maintain



<pb n="428" facs="tcp:61872:255"/>
such errours; the Truth being tryed by disputation, that they might be known to be abusers, submitting themselves alwayes to the Word of God written in the Scriptures. To this it was answered by the Queen, That she was alwayes minded that the Ministers should be paid their Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; and if there was any fault therein, the same came by some of their own sort, meaning the Comptroller <hi>Pittarow,</hi> who had the handling of the Thirds: Alwayes by the advice of her Councell she should cause such order to be taken therein, that none should have occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. As to the second, She would not jeopard her Religion upon such as were there present; for she knew well enough that the Protestants were more learned.</p>
                  <p>The Ministers and Commissioners of Churches perceiving nothing but delay, and driving off time, in the old manner, went home every one to their own Churches, waiting upon the good providence of God, continually making Supplication unto Almighty God, that it would please him of his mercy to remove the apparant plague. And in the mean time the Queen was busied with Banqueting about with some of the Lords of the Session of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and after with all men of Law, having continually in her company <hi>David Rizio,</hi> who sate at Table neer to her self, sometimes more privately then became a man of his Condition, for his over-great familiarity was already supected; and it was thought, That by his advice alone the Queens sharpnesse and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity towards the Lords was maintained.</p>
                  <p>In the end of <hi>Ianuary</hi> arrived an Ambassadour from <hi>France,</hi> named Monsieur <hi>Rambullet,</hi> having with him about fourty Horse in Trayn, who came thorow <hi>England:</hi> He brought with him the Order of the Cockle from the King of <hi>France,</hi> to the King, who received the same at the Masse, in the Chappell of the Palace of <hi>Halyrud-house.</hi> There assisted the Earles of <hi>Lenox, Athole,</hi> and <hi>Eglington,</hi> with divers such other Papists as would please the Queen, who three dayes after caused the Herald to convene in Councell, and reasoned what Armes should be given to the King; some thought he should have the Armes of <hi>Scotland</hi>; some others said, Seeing it was not concluded in Parliament that he should have the Crown Matrimoniall, he could have Armes but onely as Duke of <hi>Rothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi> Earle of <hi>Rosse, &amp;c.</hi> The Queen bade give him onely his due; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was perceived her love waxed cold towards him. Finally, his Arms were left blank; and the Queen caused put her own name before her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in all Wrets; and thereafter she caused to leave out his name whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And because formerly he had signed every thing of any moment, she caused to make a Seale like the Kings, and gave it to <hi>David Rizio,</hi> who made use of it by the Queens Command, alleadging, That the King being at his Pastime, could not alwayes be present.</p>
                  <p>About the same time the Earle of <hi>Glencarne</hi> came from <hi>Barwicke</hi> to his owne Countrey. Soon after, the Earle of <hi>Bothwell</hi> was married unto the Earle of <hi>Huntley</hi> his sister. The Queene desired that the Marriage might be made in the Chappell at the Masse; which the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> would in no wise grant. Upon Sunday the third day of <hi>March,</hi> began the Fasting at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The seventh day of <hi>March,</hi> the



<pb n="429" facs="tcp:61872:255"/>
Queen came from the Pallace of <hi>Hallirud-house</hi> to the Town in wondrous gorgious apparell, albeit the number of Lords and Train was not very great. In the mean time the King accompanied with seven or eight horse, went to the <hi>Leith</hi> to passe his time there, for hee was not like to get the Crown Matrimoniall.</p>
                  <p>In the Tolbooth was devised and named the Heads of the Articles that were drawn against the banished Lords; Upon the morrow and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday following, there was great reasoning concerning the Attainder; some alleadged, That the Summons was was not well Libelled or Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; others thought the matter of Treason was not sufficiently proved; and indeed they were still seeking proof, for there was no other way but the Queen would have them all attainted albeit the time was very short; the twelfth day of <hi>March</hi> should have been the day, which was the Tuesday following.</p>
                  <p>Now the matter was stayed by a marvellous Tragedy, for by the Lords (upon the Saturday before, which was the ninth of <hi>March,</hi> about Supper-time) <hi>David Rizio</hi> the <hi>Italian,</hi> named the <hi>French Secretary,</hi> was slain in the Gallery below Stairs (the King staying in the room with the Queen, told her, That the Designe was onely to take order with that Villain) after that he had been taken violently from the Queens presence, who requested most earnestly for the saving of his life; which act was done by the Earle of <hi>Morton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruthven,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lindsay</hi> the Master of <hi>Ruthven,</hi> with divers other Gentlemen. They first purposed to have hanged him, and had provided Cords for the same purpose; but the great haste which they had, moved them to dispatch him with Whingers or Daggers, wherewith they gave him three and fifty strokes. They sent away and put forth all such persons as they suspected.</p>
                  <p>The Earles <hi>Bothwell</hi> and <hi>Hnntley</hi> hearing the noise and clamour, came suddenly to the Close, intending to have made work, if they had had a partie strong enough; but the Earle <hi>Morton</hi> commanded them to passe to their Chamber, or else they should doe worse: At the which words they retyred immediately, and so past forth at a back Window, they two alone, and with great fear came forth of the Towne to <hi>Edmistone,</hi> on foot, and from thence to <hi>Crichton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>David Rizio</hi> was so foolish, that not onely he had drawne unto him the managing of all Affaires, the King set aside, but also his Equipage and Train did surpasse the Kings; and at the Parliament that was to be, he was ordained to be Chancellour; which made the Lords conspire against him: They made a Bond to stand to the Religion and Liberties of the Countreys, and to free themselves of the slavery of the Villain <hi>David Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zio:</hi> The King and his father subscribed to the Bond, for they durst not trust the Kings word without his Signet.</p>
                  <p>There was a <hi>French</hi> Priest (called <hi>Iohn Daniot</hi>) who advised <hi>David Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zio</hi> to make his fortune, and be gone, for the <hi>Scots</hi> would not suffer him long. His answer was, That the <hi>Scots</hi> would bragg but not fight; then he advised him to beware of the Bastard. To this he answered, That the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard should never live in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in his time; (he meant the Earle <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>) but it happened, that one <hi>George Dowlas</hi> Bastard son to the Earle of



<pb n="430" facs="tcp:61872:256"/>
                     <hi>Angus</hi> gave him the first stroke. The Queen when she heard he was dead, left weeping, and declared she would study revenge, which she did.</p>
                  <p>Immediatly it was noised in the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> that there was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed within the Kings Palace, wherefore the Provest caused to Ring the common Bell, or, <hi>Sonner le toksain,</hi> (as the <hi>French</hi> speaks) and straightway past to the Palace, having about four or five hundred men in warlike manner; and as they stood in the utter Court, the King called to the Provest, commanding him to passe home with his company, saying, The Queen and he were merry. But the Provest desired to hear the Queen speak her self; Whereunto it was answered by the King, Provest, know you not that I am King? I command you to passe home to your houses; and immediately they retired.</p>
                  <p>The next day (which was the second Sunday of our Fast in <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) there was a Proclamation made in the Kings Name, subscribed with his hand, That all Bishops, Abbots, and other Papists should avoid and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Town; which Proclamation was indeed observed, for they had a <hi>Flea in their Hose.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were Letters sent forth in the Kings Name, and subscribed with his hand, to the Provest and Bailiffs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Bailiffs of <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Cannogate,</hi> commanding them to be ready in Armour to assist the King and his Company, and likewise other private writings directed to divers Lords and Gentlemen, to come with all expedition.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Queen being above measure enraged, offended and troubled, as the issue of the matter declared, sometime railing upon the King, and sometime crying out at the Windows, desired her servants to set her at libertie; for she was highly offended and troubled.</p>
                  <p>This same tenth of <hi>March</hi> the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> with the rest of the Lords and Noblemen that were with him, having received the Kings Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (for after the Bond, above named, was Subscribed, the King Wrote unto the banished Lords, to return into their Countrey, being one of the Articles of the said Bond) came at night to the Abbey, being also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed by the Lord <hi>Hume</hi> and a great company of the borderers, to the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And first, after he had presented himself to the King, the Queen was informed of his sudden coming, and therefore sent unto him, commanding him to come to her; and he obeying, went to her, who with a singular gravitie received him, after that he had made his purgation, and declared the over-great affection which he bore conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to her Majestie. The Earles of <hi>Athole, Cathnes</hi> and <hi>Sutherland</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the Town, with the Bishops, upon the Munday, the third day after the slaughter of <hi>David Rizio.</hi> The Earles of <hi>Lenox, Murray, Morton,</hi> and <hi>Rothes,</hi> Lords <hi>Ruthven, Lindsay, Boyd,</hi> and <hi>Ocheltrie,</hi> sitting in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, desired the Queen, That forasmuch as the thing which was done could not be undone, that she would (for avoiding of greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) forget the same, and take it as good service, seeing there were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noblemen restored. The Queen dissembling her displeasure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, gave good words, neverthelesse she desired, That all persons armed or otherwise (being within the Palace at that time) should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, leaving the Palace void of all, saving onely her domestick servants.



<pb n="431" facs="tcp:61872:256"/>
The Lords being perswaded by the uxorious King, and and the facile Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> condescended to her desire, who finally the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, two hours before day, past to <hi>Seaton,</hi> and then to <hi>Dumbar,</hi> having in her company the simple King, who was allured by her sugred words; from <hi>Dumbar</hi> immediately were sent Pursuivants with Letters thorowout the Countrey; and especially Letters to the Noble-men and Barons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to come to <hi>Dumbar,</hi> to assist the King and Queen within five dayes: In the mean time the Lords being informed of the sudden departure, they were astonished, and knew not what were best for them to do: But because it was the self-same day (to wit, the twelfth day of <hi>March</hi>) that they were summoned unto; therefore having good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, they past to the Tolbooth, which was richly hung with Tapistry, and orned (but not for them) and set themselves, making Protestations, the Earle of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> and some others, being present. The Earle of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who was written for by the King, came to <hi>Lithgow</hi>; and being informed of the matter, he remained there.</p>
                  <p>After this manner above specified, to wit, by the death of <hi>David Rizio,</hi> the Noble-men were relieved of their trouble, and restored to their places and rooms: And likewise the Church Reformed, and all that professed the Evangell within this Realm, after Fasting and Prayer, was delivered and freed from the apparant dangers which were like to have fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; For if the Parliament had taken effect, and proceeded, it was thought by all men of the best judgement, That the true Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion should have been wrackt, and Popery erected; and for the same purpose, there were certain Woodden Altars made, to the number of twelve, found ready in the Chappell of the Palace of <hi>Halyrud-house,</hi> which should have been erected in Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> his Church.</p>
                  <p>The Earles <hi>Bothwell</hi> and <hi>Huntley</hi> being informed of the King and Queenes sudden departure forth of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> came to <hi>Dumbar,</hi> where they were most graciously received by the Queens Majesty; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting with them and the Master of <hi>Maxwell,</hi> together with Parson <hi>Owin,</hi> and Parson <hi>Fliske,</hi> chief Councellors, what was best to be done, and how she should be revenged upon the murtherers. At first they did intend to go forward, and leaving no manner of cruelty unpractised, putting to death all such as were suspected: This was the opinion of such as would obey their Queens rage and fury for their own advantage; But in the end they concluded, That she should come to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> with all the force and power she could make, and there proceed to Justice: And for the same purpose, she caused to summon, by open Proclamation, all persons of defence, and all Noble-men and Gentlemen, to come to her in <hi>Dumbar</hi> incontinent. In the mean time, the Captains laboured by all means to take up and enroll men and women. The Earles of <hi>Morton, Murray, Glencarne, Rothesse,</hi> with the rest that were in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> being informed of the Queens fury and anger towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters of the slaughter, and perceiving they were not able to make any Party, thought it best to give place to her fury for a time; for they were divided in opinions, and finally, departed out of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> upon <hi>Sunday</hi> the seventeenth of <hi>March,</hi> every one a severall way; for the Queens



<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61872:257"/>
Majesty was now bent onely against the slayers of <hi>David Rizio</hi>; and to the purpose she might be the better revenged upon them, she intended to give pardon to all such as before had been attainted, for whatsoever crime.</p>
                  <p>The eighteenth day of <hi>March,</hi> the King and Queen came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> having in their company horse and foot, to the number of 8000 men; whereof there were four Companies of Foot-men of War. The Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> went out to meet them, for fear of War. And finally, coming within the Town, in most awfull manner they caused to place their men of War within the Town, and likewise certain Field-Pieces against their Lodging, which was in the middle of the Town, over against the Salt Trove: Now a little before the Queenes entrance into the Towne, all that knew of her cruell pretence and hatred towards them, fled here and there; And amongst others, Master <hi>Iames Magill</hi> the Clerk Register, the Justice Clerk, and the common Clerk of the Towne: The chief Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Lethington</hi> was gone before; likewise <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> past West to <hi>Kyle:</hi> The men of War likewise kept the Ports or Gates. Within five days after their entry, there was a Proclamation made at the Market-Crosse, for the purgation of the King from the aforesaid slaughter; which made all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding men laugh at the passages of things, since the King not onely had given his consent, but also had subscribed the Bond afore-named; and the businesse was done in his name, and for his Honour, if he had had wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to know it. After this Proclamation, the King lost his credit among all men, and so his friends, by this his inconstancy and weaknesse.</p>
                  <p>And in the mean time the men of War committed great outrages in breaking up doors, thrusting themselves into every house: And albeit the number of them were not great, yet the whole Town was too little for them. Soon after, the King and Queen past to the Castle, and caused to warne all such as had absented themselves, by open Proclamation, to appear before their Majesties and the Privy Councell within six dayes, under pain of Rebellion; which practice was devised in the Earle of <hi>Huntleys</hi> case, before the Battell of <hi>Corrichy:</hi> And because they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, they were denounced Rebells, and put to the Horne, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately thereafter, their Escheats given or taken up by the Treasurer. There was a certain number of the Towns-men charged to enter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves prisoners in the Tolbooth, and with them were put in certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen: Where, after they had remained eight dayes, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed down to the Palace by the men of War, and then kept by them eight dayes more: And of that number was <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> Sheriff deput<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The names of those two were <hi>Io. Mobray</hi> Merchant, and <hi>Will. Harlow</hi> Sadler. About the same time, notwithstanding all this hurli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burly, the Ministers of the Church, and professors of Religion ceased not; for the people, they convened to publike prayers &amp; preaching with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; yea, a great number of Noble-men assisted likewise. The E. <hi>Bothwell</hi>



                     <pb n="433" facs="tcp:61872:257"/>
had now, of all men, greatest accesse and familiarity with the Queen, so that nothing of any great importance was done without him; for he shewed favour to such as liked him; and amongst others, to the Lairds of <hi>Ormeston, Hawton,</hi> and <hi>Calder,</hi> who was so reconciled unto him, that by his favour they were relieved of great trouble.</p>
                  <p>The Earles of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> at the Queens Command, past to <hi>Argyle,</hi> where, after they had remained about a Moneth, they were sent for by the Queene; and coming to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they were received by the Queene into the Castle, and banquetted, the Earles of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Bothwell</hi> being present.</p>
                  <p>At this time the King grew to be contemned and disesteemed, so that scarcely any Honour was done to him; and his Father likewise.</p>
                  <p>About <hi>Easter</hi> the King past to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where he was Shriven, after the Papist manner: And in the meane time, at the Palace of <hi>Halyrud-house,</hi> in the Chappell, there resorted a great number to the Masse, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Queen remained still in the Castle, with her Priests of the Chappell Royall, where they used Ceremonies after the Popish manner.</p>
                  <p>At the same time departed this life Master <hi>Iohn Sinclar,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rosse,</hi> and Dean of <hi>Lestarrig,</hi> of whom hath been oft mention, President of the Colledge of Justice, called the Session; who also succeeded in the said Office and Dignity after the decease of his brother Master <hi>Iohn Sinclar,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rosse,</hi> Dean of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> who departed this life at <hi>Paris,</hi> about a yeer before: They were both learned in the Laws, and given to maintain the Popish Religion, and therefore great enemies to the Protestants. A little before died Master <hi>Abrabam Crithton,</hi> who had been President likewise now in their rooms.</p>
                  <p>The Queen placed such as she pleased, and had done her service (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes very unfit) The Patrimony of the Kirk, Bishopricks, Abbeyes, and such other Benefices, were disposed by the Queen to Courtiers, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Flatterers. The Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> whom the Queen preferred above all others, after the decease of <hi>David Rizio,</hi> had for his part <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosse, Hadington,</hi> and <hi>New Bottell</hi>; likewise the Castle of <hi>Dumbar</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him, with the principall Lands of the Earldome of <hi>Merche,</hi> which were of the Patrimony of the Crown.</p>
                  <p>At the same time the Superintendents, with the other Ministers of the Churches, perceiving the Ministery like to decay for lack of payment of Stipends to Ministers, they gave this Supplication at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

and for that cause your Majesty, with the advice of the Councell and Nobility aforesaid, upon the 15 day of <hi>December</hi> 1562. in like manner concluded and determined, That if the said part of the Rents of the whole Benefices Ecclesiasticall within this Realme would be sufficient to maintain the Ministers thorowout the whole Realm, and to support your Majestie in the setting forward of your common affairs, should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed accordingly: Failing thereof, the third part of the said fruits, or more, to be taken up yeerly in time coming, untill a generall Order be taken therein; as the Act made thereupon at more length bears: Which being afterward considered by your Majesty, the whole Thirds of the fruits aforesaid were propounded to the uses aforesaid, by Act of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.

                  <p>The 19 of <hi>Iune,</hi> the Queen was delivered of a man-childe (the Prince in the aforesaid Castle) and immediately sent into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> her Posts, to advertise the neighbour Princes, and to desire them to send Gossips or Wintesses of the Princes Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time there was joy and triumph made in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and such other places where it was known, after thanks and praises given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, with Supplications for the godly Education of the Prince; and principally, wishing that he should be Baptized according to the manner and forme observed in the Reformed Churches within this Realme.</p>

                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:61872:258"/>About the same time, to wit, the 25 of <hi>Iune,</hi> the generall Assembly of the whole Church convened at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Earles of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> assisted at the Assembly: <hi>Paul Methvin,</hi> who before, as we heard, was excommunicate, gave in his Supplication, and desired to be heard, as he had done divers times; for the said <hi>Paul</hi> had written oft times out of <hi>England</hi> to the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> and to divers others, most earnestly desiring to be received again into the Fellowship of the Church. After reasoning of the matter, it was finally granted, That he should be heard; And so being before the Assembly, and falling upon his knees, burst out with tears, and said, He was not worthy to appear in their presence; alwayes he desired them, for the love of God, to receive him to the open expression of his repentance. Shortly after, they appointed certain of the Ministers to prescribe to him the form of his declaration of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which was thus in effect, first, That he should present himself bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot and bare-head, arayed in Sack-cloth, at the principall entry of Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> Kirk in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> at seven hours in the morning upon the next <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday,</hi> and there to remain the space of an hour, the whole people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him, till the Prayer was made, Psalmes sung, and Text of Scripture was read, and then to come into into the place appointed, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of repentance, and tarry the time of Sermon; and to do so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the next Friday following, and also upon the Sunday; and then, in the face of the whole Church, to declare his repentance with his owne mouth. The same form and manner he should use in <hi>Iedwart</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi>; And that being done, to present himself again at the next generall Assembly following in Winter, where he should be received to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church. When the said <hi>Paul</hi> had received the said Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he took it very grievously, alleadging, They had used over-great severity; Neverthelesse, being counselled and perswaded by divers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Personages, he began well in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to proceed, whereby a great number were moved with compassion of his state; and likewise in <hi>Iedwart:</hi> but he left his duty in <hi>Dundie,</hi> and passing again into <hi>England,</hi> the matter, not without offence to many, ceased.</p>
                  <p>The Ministers complaining that they could not be paid their Stipends, were licensed by the Assembly to passe to other Churches to Preach, but in no wise to leave the Ministery. And because that the Queens Majesty had promised often before to provide remedy, it was thought expedient that Supplication should be yet made, as before, That the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty should cause such order to be taken, that the poor Ministers might be paid their Stipends. The Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> who was brother to the Earle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and now a great man in the Court, travelled much with the Queens Majesty in that matter, and got of her a good answer, and fair promises. A few yeers before, the said Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> desired of the generall Assembly to be made Superintendent of <hi>Galloway</hi>; but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promoted to great Dignity, as to be of the number of the Lords of the Privy Councell,<note place="margin">See in what sense proud ambitious men takes the name of Bishop.</note> and likewise one of the Session, he would no more be called Over-looker, or Over-seer of <hi>Golloway,</hi> but Bishop: Alwayes truth it is, That he laboured much for his Nephew the Earle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> that he might be restored to his Lands and Honours; for the said Earle

                  <p>The Queen not yet satisfied with the death of her man <hi>David,</hi> caused in <hi>August</hi> to be apprehended a man called <hi>Hary,</hi> who sometime had been of her Chappell Royall, but afterward became an exhorter in a Reformed Church; and for want of stipend, or other necessaries, past in service to my Lord <hi>Ruthuen,</hi> and chanced that night to be present when the said <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was slaine; and so finally, he was condemned, and hanged, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                  <p>The King being now contemned of all men, because the Queen cared not for him, he went sometime to the <hi>Lenox</hi> to his father, and sometime to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> whither the Prince was carried a little before: Alwayes he was destitute of such things as were necessary for him, having scarcely six horses in Trayn. And being thus desolate, and half desperate, he sought means to go out of the Countrey: And about the same time, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Forlish Cagets,</hi>

And as he left God, so he was left by him.</note> he wrote to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the King of <hi>France,</hi> complaining of the state of the Countrey, which was all out of order, all because that Masse and Popery were not againe erected, giving the whole blame thereof to the Queen, as not managing the Catholike Cause aright: By some knave this poor Prince was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Queen got a Copie of these Letters into her hands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore threatned him sore; and there was never after that, any appearance of love betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>The Churches of <hi>Geneva, Berne</hi> and <hi>Basill,</hi> with other Reformed Churches of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> sent to the whole Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the sum of the Confession of their Faith, desiring to know if they agreed in Uniformity of Doctrine, alleadging, That the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was dissonant in some Articles from them: Wherefore the Superintendents, with a great part of the other most qualified Ministers, convened in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> in S. <hi>Andrews</hi>; and reading the said Letters, made answer, and sent word again, That they agreed in all points with those Churches, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in nothing from them: Albeit in the keeping of some Festivall days our Church assented not; for onely the Sabbath day was kept in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

after she took sicknesse in a most extreme manner, for she lay two houres long, cold dead, as it were without breath, or any signe of life, at length she revived, by reason they had bound small Cords about her shackle bones, her knees and great toes, and speaking very softly, she desired the Lords to pray for her to God, she said the Creed in English, and desired my Lord of <hi>Murray,</hi> if she should chance to depart that he would not be over extreme such as was of her Religion; the Duke and he should have been Regents. The bruit went from <hi>Iedwart</hi> in the month of <hi>October,</hi> 1565. that the Queen was departed this life, or at least she could not live any time, wherefore there was continually prayers publikely made at the Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and divers other places for her conversion towards God, and amendment. Many were of opinion, That she should come to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and renounce Popery; But all in vain, for God had some other thing to doe by her. The King being advertised, rid Post from <hi>Sterlin</hi> to <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> where he found the Queen somewhat convalesced, but she would scarce speak to him, and hardly give him presence or a good word; wherfore he returned immediately to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where the Prince was, and after to <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow</hi> to his Father.</p>
                  <p>There appeared great trouble over the whole Realm, and especially in the Countreys neer the borders, if the Queen had departed at that time. as she began to recover, the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> was brought in a Charriot from the Hermitage to <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> where he was cured of his wounds; in whose presence the Queen took more pleasure then in all the rest of the world; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by his meanes most part of all that were out-lawed for the slaughter of <hi>David Rizio</hi> got reliefe, for there was no other meanes, but all things must needs passe by him; wherefore every man sought to him, where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately favour was to be had, as before to <hi>David Rizio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after, the Queen passing along the borders, she came within the bounds of <hi>Barwick,</hi> where she viewed the Town at her pleasure a far off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within half a Mile and lesse; all the Ordnance within <hi>Barwick</hi> were Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: The Captain came forth with fourscore Horses bravely arrayed, to do her honour, and offer her lawfull service. Then she came to <hi>Craig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miller,</hi> where she remained in <hi>November</hi> till she was advertised of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Ambassadors to the Baptisme of the Prince; and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there was great preparation made, not without the trouble of such as were supposed to have money in store, especially of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; for there was borrowed a good round summe of money for the same businesse. All her care and solicitude was for that triumph. At the same time arrived the <hi>Counte de Briance,</hi> Embassadour of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who had a great Train. Soon after the Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> went forth of <hi>England</hi> with a very gorgious company to the number of fourscore Horses, and passing to <hi>Sterlin</hi> he was humanly received of the Queens Majestie, and every day banquetted. The excessive expences and superfluous apparell, which was prepared at that time, exceeded farre all the preparation that ever had been devised or set forth afore that time in this Countrey. The 17 of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> 1566. in the great Hall of the Castle of <hi>Sterlin</hi> was the Prince baptized by the Bishop of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> at five a Clock at Even, with great Pompe, albeit with great paine could they finde men to beare the



<pb n="438" facs="tcp:61872:260"/>
Torches, wherefore they took Boyes. The Queen laboured much with the Noblemen to bear the Salt, Grease and Candle, and such other things, but all refused; she found at last the Earls of <hi>Eglington, Athole,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi> who assisted at the Baptisme, and brought in the said Trash. The <hi>Counte de Briance</hi> (being the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour) assisted likewise. The Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> brought for a Present from the Queen of <hi>England</hi> a Font of Gold, valued to be worth three thousand Crownes. Soon after the said Baptisme, as the Earle was in communing with the Queen, who entertained him most reverently, he began to say merrily to her, amongst other talking, Madame, I rejoyce very greatly at this time, seeing your Majestie hath here to serve you so many Noblemen, especially twelve Earles, whereof two onely assist at this Baptisme to the Superstition of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. At the which saying the Queen kept good countenance. Soon after they banquetted in the said great Hall, where they wanted no prodigality. During the time of the Earle of <hi>Bedfords</hi> remaining at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the Lords for the most part waited upon him, and conveyed him every day to the Sermon, and after to Banquetting.</p>
                  <p>The King remained in <hi>Sterlin</hi> all that time (never being present) kept his Chamber: his father hearing how he was used, writ to him to repaire unto him; who soon after went (without good-night) toward <hi>Glasgow</hi> to his Father; he was hardly a Mile out of <hi>Sterlin</hi> when the poyson (which had been given him) wroght so upon him, that he had very great pain and dolour in every part of his body. At length, being arrived at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the Blisters brake out, of a blewish colour, so the Physitians presently knew the Disease to come by poyson; he was brought so low that nothing but death was expected; yet the strength of his youth at last did surmount the poison.</p>
                  <p>During the time of this Triumph the Queen was most liberall in all things that were demanded of her; amongst other things, she subscribed a writing for the maintenance of the Ministers in a reasonable proportion, which was to be taken up of the Thirds of Benefices: which writing being purchased by the Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> was presented at the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Church at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the five and twentieth day of <hi>December,</hi> 1566. where were conveened the Superintendents and other Ministers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in reasonable number, but very few Commssioners. The first matter that was there proposed, was concerning the said Writing lately obtained; and the most part of the Ministers being demanded their opinions in the matter, after advice, and passing a little aside, they answered very gravely, That it was their duty to preach to the people the Word of God truly and and sincerely, and to crave of the Auditors the things that were necessary for their sustentation, as of duty the Pastour might justly crave of their Flock; and further it became them not to have any care. Neverthelesse the Assembly taking in consideration, that the said Gifts granted by the Queens Majestie, was not to be refused; they ordained, That certaine faithfull men of every Shire should meet, and do their utmost diligence for gathering and receiving the said Corne and money, and likewise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Superintendent of <hi>Lowthian,</hi> and Master <hi>Iohn Row</hi> to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> and concurre and assist him for further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition

cannot be ignorant what tendernesse is in a scrupulous Conscience, and all that have knowledge are not alike perswaded; the Consciences of some of you stirres not, with the wearing of such things, on the other side many thousands (both godly and learned) are otherwayes perswaded, whose Consciences are continually strucken with these sentences, <hi>What hath Christ to doe with Beliall? What fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loship is there betwixt Light and darknesse?</hi> If Surplice, Corner-Cap and Tippet have been the Badges of Idolaters in the very act of their Idolatry, what hath the Preachers of Christian libertie, and the Rebukers of Superstition with the dregs of that Romish Beast? yea, What is he that ought not to fear, <hi>either to take in his hand, or on his forehead the Prints and Mark of that odious Beast:</hi> The Brethren that refuse such unprofitable apparell do neither condemne nor molest you who use such Trifles. On the other side, if ye that use these things, will do the like to your Brethren, we doubt nor but therein you shall please God, and comfort the Hearts of many, which are wounded to see extremitie used against these godly Brethren: Humane arguments or coloured Rhetoricke, we use none to perswade you, onely in Charity we desire you to minde the sentence of <hi>Peter,</hi> Feed the Flock of Christ which is committed to your charge, caring for it, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, but willingly; not being as Lords of Gods Heritages, but being examples to the Flock.

But we hope you will excuse our freedom in that we have entred in reasoning farther then we intended in the beginning; now againe we return to our former request, which is, That the Brethren among you who refuse the Romish Rags, may finde of you who use and urge them, such favour as our Head and Master commandeth each one of his Members to shew to another, which we look to receive of your courtesie, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because you will not offend God in troubling your brethren for such vain Trifles, but also because you will not refuse the earnest request of us your Brethren and fellow Ministers, in whom although there appear no worldly pompe; yet we are assured you will esteem us as Gods servants, travelling to set forth his glory against the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Antichrist; the dayes are evill, iniquitie aboundeth, and Charitie (alas) waxeth cold, wherefore we ought to walk diligently, for the hour is uncertain when the Lord shall come, before whom we must all give an account of our administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

The Provest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertised thereof, by the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> they sent to the Bishop three or foure of the Councell, desiring him to desist from the said mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for fear of trouble and sedition that might rise thereupon; whereby he was perswaded to desist at that time. Soon after, the Queen came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where she remained a few dayes. In the moneth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> she was informed that the King was recovered of the poyson given him at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and therefore she past to <hi>Glasgow</hi> to visite him, and there tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him six dayes, using him wonderfully kindely, with many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and good words; and likewise his father the Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi>; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all men marvelled whereto it should turn, considering the great contempt and drynesse that had been before so long together the Queen notwithstanding all the contempt that was given him, with a known de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to take away his life, yet by her sweet words gains so far upon the uxorious husband, and his facile father, that he went in company with her to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where she had caused to lodge him at the Church of <hi>Field,</hi> in a lodging lately bought by Master <hi>Iames Balfour</hi> Clerk Register, truely very unmeet for a King. The Queen resorted often to visite him, and lay in the house two nights by him (although her lodging was in the Palace of <hi>Halyrud-house.</hi>) Every man marvelled at this reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and sudden change. The ninth of <hi>February</hi> the King was murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the house where he lay burned with Powder. About twelve of the clock in the night; his body was cast forth in a yard without the Town wall adjoyning close by. There was a servant likewise murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beside him, who had been also in the chamber with him. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ran to behold this spectacle; and wondring thereat, some judged one thing, some another.</p>
                  <p>Shortly thereafter, <hi>Bothwell</hi> came from the Abbey with a company of men of War, and caused the body of the King to be carryed to the next house; where, after a little, the Chirurgions being convened at the Queens command, to view and consider the manner of his death; most part gave out, to please the Queen, That he was blown in the Ayre, albeit he had no mark of fire; and truely he was strangled. Soon after, he was carryed to the Abbey, and there buryed.</p>
                  <p>This tragicall end had <hi>Henry Steward,</hi> after he had been King eighteen moneths. A Prince of great Linage, both by mother and father: He was of a comely stature, and none was like unto him within this Island; he died under the age of one and twenty yeers; prompt and ready for all Games and Sports much given to Hawking and Hunting, and running of horses, and likewise to playing on the Lute, and also to <hi>Venus</hi> Chamber; he was liberall enough: He could write and dictate well; but he was somewhat



<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61872:262"/>
given to wine and much feeding, and likewise to inconstancy; and proud beyond measure, and therefore contemned all others: He had learned to dissemble well enough, being from his youth misled up in Popery. Thus within two yeers after his arriving in this Realme, he was highly by the Queen alone extolled; and finally, had this infortunate end by her procurement and consent. To lay all other proofs aside, her Marriage with <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who was the main executioner of the King, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the advices and counsells that the King of <hi>France</hi> and Queene of <hi>England</hi> did earnestly &amp; carefully give her, as other friends did likewise, witnesse anent their guilt. Those that laid hands on the King to kill him, by <hi>Bothwels</hi> direction, was Sir <hi>Iames Balfour, Gilbert Balfour, David Chalmers,</hi> black <hi>Iohn Spense, Francis Sebastien, Io. de Bourdean,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> the brother of <hi>David Rizio:</hi> These last four were the Queens domesticks and strangers. The reason why the Kings death was so hastened, because the affection or passion of the Earl <hi>Bothwell</hi> could not bear so long a delay, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of a Bill of Divorce required, although the Romish Clergie offered their service willingly to the businesse, namely, Bishop <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and so he came great again at Court; and he for the advancement of the businesse, did good Offices to increase the hatred betwixt the King and Queen; yea, some that had been the chief instruments of the Marriage of the King and Queen, offered the service for the Divorce, seeing how the Queens inclination lay: So unhappy are Princes, that men, for their own ends, further them in all their inclinations and undertakings, be they never so bad or destructive to themselves.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> in the mean time wrote to the Queen, to cause to punish <hi>Bothwell,</hi> with his other complices, for murthering the King. The Queen not daring openly to reject the Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> his solicitation, did appoint a day for the Triall of <hi>Bothwell</hi> by an Assize; the members whereof, was the Earle of <hi>Cathnes</hi> President, the Earle of <hi>Cassels,</hi> (who at the first refused, but thereafter, being threatned to be put in prison, and under the pain of Treason, was present by the Queens command) <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> Commendator of <hi>Aberbrothok,</hi> Lord <hi>Rosse,</hi> Lord <hi>Semple,</hi> Lord <hi>Boyd,</hi> Lord <hi>Hereis,</hi> Lord <hi>Olyphant</hi>; the Master of <hi>Forbes,</hi> the Lairds of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinuar, Langton, Cambusidentham, Barnbougel</hi> and <hi>Boyne:</hi> They, to please the Queen, and for fear, did pronounce <hi>Bothwell</hi> not guilty, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the manifest evidences of the cruell fact committed by <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who before the Tryall, did make himself strong by divers means; namely, by the possession of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> so that the accusers durst not appear, not being strong enough. The Earle of <hi>Marre</hi> did retire to <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and had committed to his charge the young Prince. All this was done in <hi>February.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>April, Bothwell</hi> called together sundry of the Lords who had come to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to a meeting that was there; and having gained some before, made them all, what by fear, what by fair promises, first of their private State, and then of advancing the Papists Religion, to consent by their subscriptions to the Marriage with the Queen. Then the Queen goes to <hi>Sterlin</hi> to see her son; <hi>Bothwell</hi> makes a shew as if he were going to the Borders to suppresse Robbers, and so he raiseth some men of War; which



<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61872:262"/>
when he had done, he turneth towards the way to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where he meets the Queen, according to appointment betwixt them, and carrieth her to <hi>Dumbar,</hi> as it had been by force, although every one knew it was with the Queens liking. The prime Nobility convened at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and from thence sent to her, to know whether or not she was taken against her will: She answered, That it was true she was taken against her will, but since her taking, she had no occasion to complain; yea, the courteous entertainment she had, made her forget and forgive all former offences. These expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were used by way of preface to the Pardon, which was granted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thereafter to <hi>Bothwell</hi>; for by Letters Patents he was pardoned by the Queen, for laying violently hands upon her Majestie, and for all other crimes: So by this, &amp;c. the murther of the King was pardoned. During the Queens abode in <hi>Dumbar,</hi> there was Letters of Divorce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and granted unto <hi>Bothwell</hi> from his Lady (who afterward was married to the Earle <hi>Sutherland</hi>) she was sister to the Earle of. <hi>Huntley.</hi> The ground of the Divorce was, The parties being within the degrees prohibited, could not be lawfully joyned: Next, because <hi>Bothwell</hi> was an Adulterer, the Marriage was voyd. The Bill of Divorce was granted by the Papisticall Court of the Archbishop of Saint <hi>Androes.</hi> And here mark how they juggle in sacred things; for when it pleaseth them, they untie the Bond of Marriage, as now, and as we have seen in the first Book of this History. When the Queen fell in distaste of the late King her husband, it was proposed unto her to have Divorce upon the same ground from the King: To which, first ear was given, but after second thoughts, a Bill of Divorce was too tedious (as we have now said) and could not be stayed for, therefore the King must be dispatched.</p>
                  <p>The Queen, when <hi>Bothwell</hi> had obtained by the Archbishop a Letter of Divorce from his lawfull wife, sent a Letter signed with her own hand, to M. <hi>Io. Craig,</hi> Minister of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> commanding him to publish the Band of Matrimony betwixt her and <hi>Bothwell.</hi> M. <hi>Io. Craig,</hi> the next Sermon day thereafter, declared in full Congregation, That he had received such a Command, but in conscience he could not obey it; the Marriage was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlawfull; and of that he would declare the reasons to the parties, if he had audience of them, otherwise he would make known his just reasons in the hearing of the people. Immediately thereafter, <hi>Bothwell</hi> sends for Master <hi>Craig</hi> to the Councell, where M. <hi>Craig</hi> told, first, That by an Act of the Assembly it was forbidden to allow the Marriage of any divorced for adultery: The Divorce of <hi>Bothwell</hi> from his lawfull wife, was by collusion, witnesse the quick dispatch thereof; for it was sought and had within ten dayes, and his contracting with the Queen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly thereafter; then his rapt of the Queen, and the guilt of the Kings death, which was confirmed by this Marriage: Withall, he desired the Lords to stop the Queen from that infamous Marriage. The Sunday af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he told publikely to the people, what he had said to the Councell; and he took heaven and earth to witnesse, That he detested that scandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and infamous Marriage; and that he discharged his conscience unto the Lords, who seemed unto him, as so many slaves, what by flattery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what by silence, to give way to that abomination. Upon this, he was called



<pb n="444" facs="tcp:61872:263"/>
to the Councel again, and was reproved, as if he had exceeded the bounds of his Calling. Whereunto he answered, That the bounds of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was the Word of God, right reason, and good Laws, against which he had said nothing; and by all these offered to prove this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to be scandalous and infamous. At this he was stopped by <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and sent from the Councell. Notwithstanding all this done and said by M. <hi>Craig,</hi> and the opposition of many that wished well to the Queen, and were jealous of her Honour, the Marriage went on, and they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the 15 of <hi>May.</hi> This makes good the Latine Proverb, <hi>Mala nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt mense Maio</hi>; and a Bishop must blesse the Marriage: The good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat was Bishop of <hi>Orkney:</hi> If there be a good work to be done, a Bishop must do it.<note place="margin">

                     </note> Here mark the difference betwixt this worthy Minister Master <hi>Craig,</hi> and this base Bishop.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Athole,</hi> immediately after the murther of the King, had tetired home, waiting for the occasion to revenge the Kings death: But seeing this abominable Marriage, he went to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where other honest Lords with him had a Meeting, and made a Bond, To defend the young Prince from the murtherers of his father: As already they had had one Plot to cut him off, which God in his mercy did prevent. The Nobles that entred in this Bond, were the Earles of <hi>Argyle, Athole, Morton, Marr,</hi> and <hi>Glencarne</hi>; the Lords <hi>Lindsey</hi> and <hi>Boyd. Argyle</hi> thereafter, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by some fair words, fell off; and <hi>Boyd</hi> became a great Factionary for <hi>Bothwell</hi> in all things.</p>
                  <p>The Queen, soon after the Marriage, was advised to send abroad an Ambassadour to acquaint her forraigne friends and kindred; And this must be a Bishop: It is pity that any good work should be done without a Bishop: Was not this a worthy employment for a Pastor in Gods Church?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bothwell</hi> seeing the Bond made at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> causeth the Queen to write to sundry of the Nobility: Divers repaired unto her, where they found a Bond tendred unto them, by which they were to binde themselves to defend the Queen and <hi>Bothwell.</hi> Some that were corrupt, did willingly subscribe; others for fear did the same: And there was not one that went to Court that did refuse, but the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi>; who refusing absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enter into a Bond with <hi>Bothwell,</hi> said, It was not the part of a good subject; Yet since he had been made friends with him some time before, he would keep his promise unto the Queen: And to enter into a Bond with the Queen, it was needlesse and unfit, since he was to obey her in all lawfull and just things. Upon this, he gat leave, although with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, to go into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queen receives now <hi>Hamilton</hi> Archbishop of S. <hi>Androes,</hi> into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour since these changes; who was no lesse a faithfull Councellor to her, then he was a good Pastor of Christs Flock; that is, He betrayed her, and disobeyed God. With this a Proclamation comes out in favour of the poor Protestants; whereby the Queen declares, That she will keep and confirm all that she had promised at her Arrivall into <hi>Scotland:</hi> This was done to stop the peoples mouthes; but all in vain, for the people were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally against the abomination of the Court.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="445" facs="tcp:61872:263"/>Within few dayes, <hi>Bothwell</hi> and the Queen, were raising men, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to go to the Borders to represse the Robbers there; but in effect, to go to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> to have the Prince in their custody, that they might dispose of him according to their minde. Then a new Proclamation came out, That the Queen hereafter would rule onely by the advice of the Nobles of the Land, as her best Predecessors had done. The Lords at <hi>Sterlin</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this plot, strives to prevent it, and to this purpose they appointed with the Lord <hi>Humes</hi> to besiege the Castle of <hi>Borthwike,</hi> where the Queen and <hi>Bothwell</hi> was: But because the Earl of <hi>Athole</hi> did not come at the hour appointed, they had not men enough to environ and compasse the Castle; so that <hi>Bothwel</hi> having notice given him of the businesse, escaped to <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> and the Queen after him, in mans clothes. The Lords failing of their designe at <hi>Borthwike</hi> Castle, went to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> whereof they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters easily, having the affections of the people, notwithstanding the Earle <hi>Huntley,</hi> and the Archbishop of S. <hi>Androes</hi> perswasion to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: These two, with their associates, were constrained to retire to the Castle, where they were received by Sir <hi>Iam. Balfour,</hi> left there by <hi>Bothwel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The twelfth of <hi>Iune,</hi> which was the next day following, the Lords at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> caused to publish a Proclamation, whereby they declared, That the Earl <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who had been the principall author, deviser, and actor of the cruell murther of the late King, had since laid hand upon the Queens person, and had her for the present in <hi>Dumbar</hi> in his power; and finding her utterly destitute of all good counsell, had seduced her to a dishonest and unlawfull marriage with himself; yea, that now he was gathering Forces, and stirring himself to get the young Prince in his hands, that he might murther the Childe, as he had murthered the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This wicked man the Nobles of the Land resolved to withstand, and deliver the Queen out of his bondage; wherefore they did charge all Lieges within the Kingdom that could come to them, to be in readinesse at 3 hours warning to assist them, the Nobles, for the freeing of the Queen from captivity, and bringing the said Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> to a Legall Triall, and condigne punishment for the aforesaid murther and other Crimes. All such that would not syde with the Lords were by this Proclamation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to depart from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> within four hours, under the pain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted enemies, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding this Proclamation, the people did not joyn unto these Lords as was expected, for sundry of the Nobles were adversaries to the businesse, other stood as Neuters; and withall, those that were convened together were not well provided of Armes and Munition for exploits of warre; so that they were even thinking to dissolve and leave off their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize till another time, and had absolutely done so; but God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained other wayes, as the event did shew (if the Queen and <hi>Bothwell</hi> could have had patience to stay at <hi>Dumbar</hi> for three or four dayes without any stirre) but the Queen and <hi>Bothwell</hi> having gathered together about four or five thousand men, trusting in their Force (the Queen being puft up by Flatterers) set forth and Marched towards <hi>Leith:</hi> being come forward as farre as <hi>Glaidsmure,</hi> she caused publike Proclamation against the aforesaid Lords, calling them a number of Conspirators, and that she now discerned



<pb n="446" facs="tcp:61872:264"/>
their inward malice against her and her husband, the Duke of <hi>Orkney</hi> (for so now they called <hi>Bothwell:</hi>) After they had endeavoured to apprehend her and her Husband at <hi>Brothwick,</hi> and had made a seditious Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under pretence of seeking the revenge of the King her late husband; and to free her from Captivity, giving out, That the Duke her husband had a minde to invade the Prince her Sonne; all which was false, for the Duke her Husband had used all means to clear himself, both by a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall way, and by the offer of a Combate to any that did accuse him, as they knew well enough: As touching her captivity, she was in none, but was in company with her Husband, unto whom she was publikely married in the view of the world, and many of the Nobles had given their consent unto this her marriage: As for the Prince her Sonne, it was but a specious pretence to the Treason and Rebellion against her their naturall Soveraign, and her Posterity, which they intended to overthrow; wherefore she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her self necessitated to take Arms, hoping that all her faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would adhere unto her, and that those who were already assembled with her, would with good hearts and hands stand to her defence; and for the recompence of their valour they should have the Lands and goods of these unnaturall Rebels. After this Proclamation the Army went on, and the Queen that night came to <hi>Seaton,</hi> where she lay.</p>
                  <p>About Midnight the Lords of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were advertised of the Queens approach, presently they took Arms, and at the Sun rising they were at <hi>Muselburgh,</hi> where they refreshed themselves with meat and rest. The Queens Camp was not yet stirring. About Midday the Scouts that the Lords had sent out, brought word that the Enemy was Marching towards them; presently they put themselves in two Battalia's, the first was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the Earle <hi>Morton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hume</hi>; the second by the Earls <hi>Athole, Glencarne,</hi> the Lords <hi>Lindsey, Ruthuen, Semple</hi> and <hi>Sancharmar,</hi> with the Lairds <hi>Drumlanrick, Tullibardin, Cesfoord,</hi> and <hi>Graunge,</hi> with divers others, their number was almost as great as the Queens, their men better, being many of them expert men, that I say nothing of the Cause. The Queen had gained a Hill, called <hi>Carbarry,</hi> which the Lords (by reason of the steepnesse of the ascent) could not well come at; wherefore they wheeled about to get a more convenient place to go to the Hill, where the Enemy was, and to have the Sunne behinde them in the time of the sight. At the first the Queen seeing their thus going about, did imagine they were fleeing away to <hi>Dalketh,</hi> but when she saw them come directly towards her, she found her selfe deceived.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour seeing them ready to fight, strived to take up the businesse, and having spoken with the Queen, went to the Lords, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that the Queene was disposed to peace, and to forgive and pardon this Insurrection; wherefore it was very fit to spare blood, to agree in a peaceable way. The Earle of <hi>Morton</hi> (in the name of all rest) answered, That they had taken up Armes, not against the Queen, but against the murtherer of the King; whom if she would deliver to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, or at least put from her company, she should finde a continuation of dutifull obedience by them, and all other good subjects; otherwise no peace: Besides, we are not to ask pardon for any offence done by us. The



<pb n="447" facs="tcp:61872:264"/>
Ambassadour seeing their resolution to stand to the right of their Cause, withdrew, and went to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour was thus labouring for Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Bothwell</hi> came out of the Camp (which was in the Trench that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen had left at their last being in these places, as was we have said in the former Books) well mounted, with a defie to any that would fight with him. <hi>Iames Murray,</hi> brother to the Laird of <hi>Tullibardin,</hi> who before had accepted of <hi>Bothwells</hi> challenge, when he made the Rodomontade at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> immediately after the Kings death; but then <hi>Iames Murray</hi> did not make knowne his name. <hi>Bothwell</hi> refused to fight with <hi>Iames Murray,</hi> alleadging he was not his equall. Upon this the Elder Brother <hi>William Murrey,</hi> Laird of <hi>Tullibardin,</hi> answered, That he would fight with him, as being his Better in Estate, and in Antiquitie of House many degrees above him; yet <hi>Bothwell</hi> refused him, saying, That he was not a Peer of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as he was; then sundry Lords would have gone to fight with <hi>Bothwell</hi>; but the Lord <hi>Lindsey</hi> namely, who said to the rest of the Lords and Gentlemen, That he would take it as a singular favour of them, and as a recompence of his service done to the State, if they would suffer him to fight with the Braggadocio. <hi>Bothwell</hi> seeing that there was no more subterfuge nor excuse, under-hand made the Queen to forbid him. After this challenge and answers, <hi>Bothwells</hi> Complices and Followers were very earnest to fight, but others that had come only for the Queens sake, became little cold, saying, That <hi>Bothwell</hi> would do well to fight himself, and spare the blood of divers Gentlemen that were there. Some counselled to delay the Battell till the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> came, whom they did expect. All this the Queen heard with anger; and riding up and down, burst out in tears, and said, They were all cowards and traytors that would not fight. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after, thus vapouring, the Queen pereceiving sundry to leave her, she advised <hi>Bothwell</hi> to look unto himself, for she said to him, She would render her self unto the Noble-men. Upon this she sent for <hi>Iames Kirkaldie</hi> of <hi>Grange,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note how God changeth things in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> with whom she kept discourse for a while, till that she was assured that <hi>Bothwell</hi> was out of danger. Then she went to the Lords, whom she did entertain with many fair words, telling them, That it was neither fear, nor want of hope of victory, that made her come unto them, but a meer desire to spare shedding of innocent blood: Withall she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be ruled and advised by them. With this she was received with all respect: But shortly after, declaring that she would go to the <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> with promise to return, they restrained her liberty, and brought her along with them to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> at night: She was very slow in marching, looking to be rescued by the <hi>Hamiltons</hi>; but in vain: She lay that night in the Provest his house. The next day, the Lords sent the Queen to the Castle that is within an Isle of <hi>Lochlevin.</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Balfour</hi> seeing the Queen committed, and <hi>Bothwell</hi> consequently defeated, he capitulated with the Lords for the delivery of the Castle. <hi>Bothwell</hi> finding himself thus in disorder, sent a servant to Sir <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> to save a little silver Cabinet, which the Queen had given him. Sir <hi>Iames Balfour</hi> delivers the Cabinet to the messenger, and under-hand giveth of it to the Lords. In this Cabinet had <hi>Bothwell</hi> kept the Letters of privacy he had from the



<pb n="448" facs="tcp:61872:265"/>
Queen: Thus he kept her Letters, to be an awe-bond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pon her, in case her affection should change. By the taking of this Cabinet, many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars betwixt the Queen and <hi>Bothwell</hi> were cleerly discovered. These Letters were after printed: They were in French; with some Sonnets of her own making.</p>
                  <p>Few dayes after the commitment of the Queen, the Earle of <hi>Glencarne</hi> with his domesticks, went to the Chappell of <hi>Halyrud-house,</hi> where he brake down the Altars and the Images: Which fact, as it did content the zealous Protestants, so it did highly offend the popishly affected. The Nobles, who had so proceeded against <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and dealt so with the Queen, hearing that the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> had a great number of men, and had drawn the Earls of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Huntley</hi> to their side, sent to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> desiring those that were there to joyn with them, for the redresse of the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Church and State: But the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> thinking now they had a fair occasion fallen unto them to have all again in their hands, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of all according to their own minde, did refuse audience to the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage sent by the Lords,</p>
                  <p>Upon this, the Lords moved the generall Assembly then met in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>Iune,</hi> to write to the Lords that either were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally declared for the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> or were neuters: And so severall Letters were directed to the Earles of <hi>Argyle, Huntley, Cathnes, Rothesse, Crauford,</hi> and <hi>Menteth</hi>; to the Lords <hi>Boyd, Drummens, Grame, Cathcart, Yester, Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, Levinston, Seaton, Glamnis, Uthiltrie, Gray, Olyphant, Methven, Inder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi> and <hi>Somervile</hi>; as also to divers other men of note. Besides the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Assembly, Commissioners were sent from the Assembly, to the Lords above-named; to wit, <hi>Iohn Knox, Iohn Dowglas, Iohn Row,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Craig,</hi> who had instructions conforme to the tenour of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to desire these Lords and others, to come to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and joyn with the Lords there, for the setling of Gods true Worship in the Church, and policy reformed according to Gods Word, a maintenance for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and support for the poor: But neither the Commissioners nor the Letters did prevail with these men; they excused, That they could not repair to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> with freedome, where there was so many armed men, and a Garrison so strong: But for the Church-affairs, they would not be any wayes wanting, to do what lay in them.</p>
                  <p>The Lords at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> seeing this, joyneth absolutely with the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (which had been prorogated to the 20 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> upon the occasion of these Letters and Commissioners aforesaid) and promiseth to make good all the Articles they thought fit to resolve upon in the Assembly: But how they performed their promises, God knows alwayes.

And therefore, my Lords, I cannot cease in the Name of Christ Jesus, to require of you, That the matter may come to examination, and that ye the States of the Realme, by your Authority, compell such as will be called Bishops, not onely to desist from their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell murthering of such as do study to promote Gods glory, in detecting and disclosing the damnable impiety of that Man of Sin the Romane Antichrist; but also that ye compell them to answer to such crimes as shall be laid to their charge, for not righteously instructing the Flock com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their cares.</p>
                  <p>But here I know two things shall be doubted:<note place="margin">Answer: 1.

                  <p>The one and the other I nothing doubt most cleerly to prove: First,



<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61872:268"/>
That my Appellation is most lawfull and just: And secondly, That your Honours cannot refuse to defend me thus calling for your ayd; for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing, ye declare your selves rebellious to God, maintainers of murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and shedders of innocent blood.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, To me was no intimation made of their summons, but so secret was their surmised malice, that the Copie of summons being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, was denyed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To the Realme of <hi>Scotland</hi> could I have had no free nor sure accesse, being before compelled to quit the same by their unjust Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, To me they neither could nor can be competent and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Judges, for that, before any summons were raised against me, I had accused them by Letters published to the Queen <hi>Dowager,</hi> and had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against them all crimes, offering my self, with hazard of life, to prove the same, for the which they are not onely unworthy of Ecclesiasticall Authority, but also of any sufferance within a Common-wealth profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Christ. This my accusation preceding their summons, neither by the Law of God, neither yet by the law of man, can they be to me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges, till place be granted unto me openly to prove my accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intended against them, and they be compelled to make answer, as cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalls: For I will plainly prove, That not onely Bishops, but also Popes, have been removed from all Authority, and pronouncing of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till they have purged themselves of accusations laid against them. Yea, further I will prove, That Bishops and Popes have most justly been deprived from all Honours and administration, for smaller crimes then I have to charge the whole rabble of your Bishops.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> was commanded by God to stand in the court of the House of the Lord,<note place="margin">Jer. 26.</note> and to preach this Sermon, in effect; That <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> should be destroyed, and be exposed in opprobrie to all Nations of the earth; And that also that famous Temple of God should be made desolate, like unto <hi>Sylo,</hi> because the Priests, the Prophets, and the people, did not walk in the Law which God hath proposed unto them, neither would they obey the voyces of the Prophets whom God sent to call them to repentance.</p>
                  <p>For this Sermon, was <hi>Ieremy</hi> apprehended, and a sentence of death pronounced against him, and that by the Priests, by the Prophets, and by the People: which things being bruted in the ears of the Princes of <hi>Iuda,</hi>



                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61872:268"/>
they passed up from the Kings House, to the Temple of the Lord, and sate downe in Judgement for further knowledge of the cause: But the Priests and Prophets continued in their cruell sentence which before they had pronounced, saying, <hi>This man is worthy of death; for he hath prophesied against this City, as your ears have heard.</hi> But <hi>Ieremy,</hi> so moved by the holy Ghost, began his defence against that their tyrannous sentence, in these words; <hi>The Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath sent me to prophesie against this House, and against this City,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Advert.</note> 
                     <hi>all the words which you have read. Now therefore make good your wayes, and hear the voyce of the Lord your God, and then shall he repent of the evil which he hath spoken against you. And as for me, behold, I am in your hands</hi> (so doth he speak to the Princes) <hi>do to me as you think good and right: Neverthelesse, know you this most assuredly, That if ye murther or slay me, ye shall make your selves, this City, and the inhabitants of the same, criminall and guilty of innocent blood; for of a truth the Lord hath sent me to speak in your ears all these words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then the Princes and the people</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>said,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Princes did absolve the Prophet, whom the Priests had condemned.</note> 
                     <hi>This man is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, for he hath spoken to us in the Name of the Lord our God.</hi> And so, after some contention, was the Prophet delivered from that danger. This fact and history manifestly proveth whatsoever before I have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to wit, That it is lawfull for the servants of God to call for the help of the Civill Magistrate, against the sentence of death, if it be unjust, by whomsoever it is pronounced; And also that the Civill Sword hath power to represse the fury of the Priests, and to absolve whom they have condemned: For the Prophet of God was condemned by those, who then onely in earth were known to be the visible Church; to wit, the Priests and Prophets who were in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> the successors of <hi>Aaron,</hi> to whom was given a charge to speak to the people in the Name of God, and a Precept given to the people to hear the Law from their mouthes; to the which if any should be rebellious or inobedient, he should die the death without mercy. These men, I say, thus authorized by God, first did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>Ieremy,</hi> for that he did Preach otherwise then did the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of Prophets in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> And last, apprehended him, as you have heard, pronouncing against him this sentence afore-written; from the which neverthelesse the Prophet appealed, that is, Sought helpe and defence against the same, and that most earnestly did he crave of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For albeit he saith, <hi>I am in your hands, do with me as ye think righteous,</hi> he doth not contemne or neglect his life, as though he regarded not what should become of him, but in those his words most vehemently did he admonish the Princes and Rulers of the people, giving them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what God should require of them;<note place="margin">The meaning of these words, <hi>I am in your hands, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> as if he should say, Ye Princes of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and Rulers of the people, to whom appertaineth indifferently to judge betwixt party and party, to justifie the just man, and to condemne the malefactor,<note place="margin">Deut 17. Jerem 1. Deut 1 10.</note> you have heard a sentence of death pronounced against me, by those whose lips ought not to speak deceit, because they are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and appointed by God himself, to speak his Law, and to pronounce judgement with equity; but as they have left the living God, and have taught the people vanity, so are they become mortall enemies to all Gods true servants, of whom I am one, rebuking their iniquity, apostasie and



<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61872:269"/>
defection from God, which is the onely cause they seek my life. But a thing most contrary to all equity, law and justice it is, that I, a man sent of God, to call them, his people, and you again to the true service of God, from the which you are all declined, shall suffer the death, because that my enemies do so pronounce sentence. I stand in your presence, whom God hath made Princes, your power is above their Tyranny, before you do I expose my cause, I am in your hands, and cannot resist to suffer what ye think just: But lest that my lenity and patience should either make you negligent in the defence of me in my just cause, appealing to your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either yet encourage my enemies in seeking my blood, this one thing I dare not conceal, That if you murther me (which thing ye do, if ye defend me not) ye make not onely my enemies guilty of my blood, but also your selves, and this whole City. By these words, I say, it is evident, That the Prophet of God, being condemned by the Priests, and by the Prophets of the visible Church, did seek ayd, support and defence at the Princes and temporall Magistrates, threatning his blood to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their hands, if they, by their Authority, did not defend him from the fury of his enemies; alleadging also just causes of his Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and why he ought to have been defended; to wit, That he was sent of God to rebuke their vices and defection from God; That he taught no Doctrine which God before had not pronounced in his Law;<note place="margin">The causes of his Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and why he ought to have been defended.</note> That he desired their conversion to God, continually calling upon them to walke in the wayes which God had approved; and therefore doth he boldly crave of the Princes, as of Gods Lievtenants, to be defended from the blinde rage and tyranny of the Priests, notwithstanding that they claimed to themselves Authority to judge all matters of Religion. And the same did he when he was cast in prison, and thereafter was brought to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of King <hi>Zedechias.</hi> After, I say, he had defended his innocency, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, That he neither had offended against the King, against his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, nor against the people, at last he made intercession to the King for his life,<note place="margin">Jerem. 38.</note> saying, <hi>But now, my Lord the King, take heed, I beseech thee, let my prayer fall into thy presence, command me not to be carried again into the house of</hi> Jonathan <hi>the Scribe, that I die not there.</hi>

                  <p>And the Text witnesseth, That the King commanded the place of his imprisonment to be changed. Whereof it is evident, That the Prophet did ofter then once seek help at the Civill power; and that first the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thereafter the King did acknowledge, That it appertained to their Office to deliver him from the unjust sentence which was pronounced against him. If any man think that <hi>Ieremy</hi> did not appeal, because he onely declared the wrong done unto him, and did but crave defence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his innocency, let the same man understand, That none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise do I appeal from that false and cruell sentence which your Bishops pronounced against me;<note place="margin">Just cause of Appellation.</note> Neither yet can there be any just cause of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, but innocency, or suspition to be hurt, whether it be by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a Judge, or by malice and corruption of those, who under the title of Justice, do exercise Tyranny. If I were a thief, murtherer, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, open adulterer, or any offender whom Gods Word command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to suffer for a crime committed, my Appellation were vain, and to

be rejected: But I being innocent, yea, the Doctrine which your Bishops have condemned in me being Gods Eternall Verity, have no lesse liberty to crave your defence against that cruelty, then had the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> to seek ayd of the Princes and King of <hi>Iuda.</hi> But this shall more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear in the fact of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who after that he was apprehended in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 22, 23, 24, &amp; 25.</note> did first claim the liberty of the Romane Citizens, for avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torment, when the Captain would have examined him by questions: Thereafter in the Councell, where no righteous judgement was to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, he affirmed that he was a Pharisee, and that he was accused of the Resurrection of the dead, and last, in the presence of <hi>Festus,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed from all knowledge and judgement of the Priests at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to the Emperour: Of which last Point, because it doth chiefly appertain to this my cause, I will somewhat speak.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Paul</hi> had divers times been accused, as in the Acts of the Apostles is manifest, at the last the chief Priests and their faction came to <hi>Cesarea,</hi> with <hi>Festus</hi> the President, who presented uuto them <hi>Paul</hi> in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom they accused of horrible crimes, which neverthelesse they could not prove, the Apostle maintaining, That he had offended neither against the Law, neither against the Temple, neither yet against the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Festus <hi>willing to gratifie the Iews, said to</hi> Paul, <hi>Wilt thou go up to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <hi>and there be judged of these things in my presence?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>But</hi> Paul <hi>said, I stand at the Iustice Seat of the Emperour, where it behoveth me to be judged; I have done no wrong to the Iews, as thou better knowest: If I have done any thing unjustly, or yet committed crime worthy of death, I refuse not to die: But if there be nothing of these things true whereof they accuse me, no man may give me to them: I appeal to</hi> Caesar. It may appear at the first sight, That <hi>Paul</hi> did great injury to <hi>Festus</hi> the Judge, and to the whole Order of the Priesthood, who did hope greater equity in a cruell tyrant, then in all that Session, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed company: which thing, no doubt, <hi>Festus</hi> did understand pronouncing these words, <hi>Hast thou appealed to</hi> Caesar? <hi>Thou shalt go to</hi> Caesar. As if he would say, I, as a man willing to understand the truth, before I pronounce sentence, have required of thee to go to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where the learned of thine own Nation may hear thy Cause, and discern in the same. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie standeth in matters of Religion; thou art accused as an apostate from the Law, as a violator of the Temple, and a transgressor of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their Fathers; in which matters I am ignorant, and therefore desire information by those that be learned in the same Religion whereof the question is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet dost thou refuse so many godly Fathers to hear thy cause, and dost appeal to the Emperor, preferring him to all our judgments, of no purpose, belike, but to delay time. Thus, I say, it might have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Paul</hi> did not onely injury to the Judge and to the Priests, but also that his cause was greatly to be suspected, partly for that he did refuse the judgement of those that had most knowledge (as all men supposed) of Gods Will and Religion; and partly, because he appealed to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who then was at <hi>Rome,</hi> far absent from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a man ignorant of God, and enemy to all vertue. But the Apostle considering the nature of his enemies, and what things they had intended against him, even from



<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61872:270"/>
the first day he began freely to speak in the Name of Christ, did not fear to appeal from them, and from the Judge that would have gratified them. They had professed themselves plain enemies to Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">Why <hi>Paul</hi> would admit none of the Leuiticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge in his cause.</note> and to his blessed Evangell, and sought the death of <hi>Paul,</hi> yea, even by factions and treasonable conspiracy, and therefore by no means would he admit them either as Judges in his cause, or auditors of the same, as <hi>Festus</hi> required; But grounding himself upon strong reasons, to wit, That he had not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Jews, neither against the Law, but that he was innocent, therefore that no Judge ought to give him into the hands of his enemies: ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I say, his Appellation upon these reasons, he neither regarded the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of <hi>Festus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Upon what reasons the Appellation of <hi>Paul</hi> was grounded.</note> neither yet the brute of the ignorant multitude, but boldly did appeal from all cognoscance of them, to the judgement of the Emperour, as said is. By these two examples, I doubt not but your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours do understand, That it is lawfull to the servants of God, oppressed by tyrannts, to seek remedy against the same, be it by appellation from their sentence, or by imploring the help of Civill Magistrates: For what God hath approved in <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> he can condemne in none that are so dealt withall. I might alleadge some History of the primitive Church serving to the same purpose; as of <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Athanasius,</hi> of whom, the one would not be judged but at <hi>Millan,</hi> where that his Doctrine was heard of all his Church, and received and approved by many: And the other would in no wise give place to those Councells, where he knew that men conspiring against the Truth of God, should sit in Judgement and Consultation: But because the Scriptures of God are my onely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and assurance in all matters of weight and importance, I have thought the two former testimonies sufficient, as well to approve my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation reasonable and just, as to declare to your Honours, That with safe conscience ye cannot refuse to admit the same. If any think it arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy or foolishnesse in me to compare my self with <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> let the same man understand,<note place="margin">The cause is to be regarded, and not the persons.</note> That as God is immutable, so is the Verity of his glorious Evangell of equall dignity, whensoever it is impugned, be the members suffering never so weak. What I think touching mine owne person, God will reveal, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed: and such as with whom I have been conversant, can witnesse what arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy or pride they espie in me. But touching the Doctrine and cause which that adulterous and pestilent Generation of Antichrists servants (who will be called Bishops amongst you) have condemned me, I neither fear nor shame to confesse and avow before man and Angel, to be the Eternall Truth of the Eternall God. And in that case I doubt not to compare my self with any member in whom the Truth hath been impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned, since the beginning: For as it was the Truth which <hi>Ieremy</hi> did Preach, in these words; <hi>The Priests have not known me (saith the Lord) but the Pastors have treacherously declined and fallen back from me.</hi>

And finally, as it was a truth, That the Princes and the Priests were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of Christ Jesus, and cruell persecutors of his Apostles, so likewise it is a truth (and that most infallible) That those who have condemned me (the whole rabble of the Papisticall Clergie) have declined from the true Faith,<note place="margin">Act. 3 &amp; 4.</note> have given ear to deceivable spirits, and to doctrine of devils; are the stars fallen from the heaven to the earth, are fountains without water; and finally,<note place="margin">Jude 1. 2 Pet. 2.</note> are enemies to Christ Jesus, denyers of his vertue, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blasphemers of his death and passion. And further, As that visible Church had no crime, whereof justly they could accuse either Prophets or the Apostles, except their Doctrine onely; so have not such as seek my blood other crime to lay to my charge, except, That I affirm, as alwayes I offer to prove, That the Religion which now is maintained by fire and sword,<note place="margin">Let the cause be noted.</note> is no lesse contrarious to the true Religion taught and established by the Apostles, then is darknesse to light, or the devill to God; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, That such as now do claim the title and name of Church, are no more the elect Spouse of Christ Jesus, then was the Synagogue of the Jews the true Church of God, when it crucified Christ Jesus, condemned his Doctrine, and persecuted his Apostles. And therefore seeing that my Battell is against the proud and cruell hypocrites of this age, as that Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of those most excellent instruments was against the false Prophets and malignant Church of their ages: Neither ought any man to thinke it strange that I compare my self with them, with whom I sustain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause; Neither ought your Lordships judge your selves lesse addebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bound to me, calling for your support, then did the Princes of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> think themselves bound to <hi>Ieremy,</hi> whom for that time they delivered, notwithstanding the sentence of death pronounced against him by the visible Church.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the right of my Appellation, which in the bowells of Christ Jesus I require your Honours not to esteem as a thing superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vain, but that ye admit it, and also accept me in your protection and defence, that by you assured, I may have accesse to my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which I never offended; to the end that freely and openly, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the whole Realm, I may give my confession of all such Points as this day be in controversie; And also that you, by your authority which ye have of God, compell such as of long time have blinded and deceived both your selves and the people, to answer to such things as shall be laid to their charge.</p>

And to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of every one of these, do your Offices and Names, the Honours and

Benefits which ye receive, the Law of God universally given to all men and the examples of most godly Princes, binde and oblige you.</p>
                  <p>My purpose is not to labour greatly to prove, That your whole studie ought to be, To promote the glory of God; Neither yet will I studie to alleadge all reasons that justly may be brought to prove, That ye are not exalted to raign above your brethren as men without care and solicitude; for these be principles so grafted in Nature, that very Ethnicks have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the same: For seeing that God onely hath placed you in his Chayr, hath appointed you to be his Lieutenants,<note place="margin">The singular honours which Magistrates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of God, ought to move them with all diligence to promote his Religion.</note> and by his own Seal hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked you to be Magistrates, and to rule above your brethren, to whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture neverthelesse hath made you like in all points (for in conception, birth, life and death ye differ nothing from the common sort of men, but God onely as said is, hath promoted you, and of his speciall favour hath given you this Prerogative, to be called Gods) How horrible ingratitude were it then, that you should be found unfaithfull to him, that hath thus honoured you? And further, What a monster were it that you should be proved unmercifull to them, above whom ye are appointed to raigne, as fathers above their children? Because, I say, that the very Ethnicks have granted, That the chief and first care of Princes, and of such as be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to rule above others, ought to be, To promote the glory and honour of their Gods, and to maintain that Religion which they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have been true; And that their second care was, To maintain and defend the subjects committed to their charge in all equity and justice: I will not labour to shew unto you what ought to be your studie in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Gods true honour, left that in so doing I should seem to make you lesse carefull to Gods true Religion, then were the Ethnicks over their Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The duty of Magistrates.</note>But because other Petitions may appear more hard and difficile to be granted, I purpose briefly, but yet freely, to speak what God by his Word doth assure me to be true:<note place="margin">1.</note> to wit, first, That in conscience you are bound to punish malefactors, and to defend innocents imploring your help. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That God requireth of you to provide that your subjects be rightly instructed in his true Religion;<note place="margin">2.</note> and that the same be by you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, whensoever abuses do creep in by the malice of Satan and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of men.<note place="margin">3.</note> And lastly, That ye are bonnd to remove from Honour, and to punish with death (if the crime so require) such as deceive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or defraud them of that food of their souls, I mean, Gods lively Word. The first and second are most plain by the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> thus speaking of lawfull powers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let every soul</hi> (saith he) <hi>submit himself unto the higher Powers; for there is no power but of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Whosoever resisteth therefore the Power, resisteth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God; and they that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation: For Rulers are not to be feared of those that do well, but of those that do evil. Wilt thou then be without fear of the Power? Do that which is good, and so shalt thou be praised of the same: For he is the Minister of God for thy weal: But if thou do that which is evil, fear; for he beareth not the Sword for nought; for he is the Minister of God, to take vengeance on them that do evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Apostle in these words most straitly commandeth Obedience to



<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61872:271"/>
be given to lawfull powers, pronouncing Gods wrath and vengeance against such as shall resist the Ordinance of God; so doth he assigne to the powers their Offices, which be, To take vengeance upon evil doers, To maintain the well doers, and so to minister and rule in their Office, that the subjects by them may have a Benefit, and be praised in well doing. Now if you be powers ordained by God, (and that I hope all men will grant) then by the plain words of the Apostle is the Sword given unto you by God, for maintenance of the innocent, and for punishment of malefactors: But I, and my brethren with me accused, do offer not onely to prove our selves innocents in all things laid to our charge, but also we offer most evidently to prove your Bishops to be the very pestilence, who have infected all Christianity: And therefore by the plain Doctrine of the Apostle, you are bound to maintain us, and punish the other, being evidently convinced, and proved criminall. Moreover, the former words of the Apostle do teach,<note place="margin">In what Points powers are bound to their subjects.</note> How far high powers are bound to their subjects; to wit, That because they be Gods Ministers, by him ordained for the profit and utility of others, most diligently ought they to attend upon the same. For that cause assigneth the holy Ghost, commanding subjects to obey,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> and to pay Tribute, saying, <hi>For this do you pay Tribute and Toll</hi>; that is, Because they are Gods Ministers, bearing the Sword for your utility. Whereof it is plain, That there is no honour, without a charge annexed. And this one point I wish your wisedoms deeply to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, That God hath not placed you above your Brethren, to raigne as Tyrants, without respect of either profit or commodity. You hear the holy Ghost witnesse the contrary, affirming, That all powers be Gods Ministers, ordained for the weal, profit, and salvation of their subjects, and not for their destruction. Could it be said (I beseech you) That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates inclosing their subjects in a City without all victualls, or giving unto them no other victualls but such as were poysoned,<note place="margin">Let the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude be noted.</note> did rule for the profit of their subjects? I trust that none would be so foolish as so to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; but that rather every discreet person would boldly affirm, That such as so did, were unworthy of Regiment. If we will not deny that which Christ Jesus affirmeth to be a truth infallible; to wit, That the soul is greater and more precious then is the body, then shall we easily espie how unworthy of Authority be those that this day debar their subjects from hearing of Gods Word, and by fire and sword compell them to feed upon the very poyson of their souls, the damnable Doctrine of Antichrist. And therefore in this point, I say, I cannot cease to admonish your Honors diligently to take heed over your charge, which is greater then the most part of men suppose.<note place="margin">It is not enough that Rulers do not oppresse their subjects.</note> It is not enough that you abstain from violent wrong and oppression which ungodly men exercise against their subjects; but ye are further bound, to wit, That ye rule above them for their weal; which we cannot do, if that ye either by negligence not providing true Pastors, or yet by your maintenance of such as be ravening Wolves, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their souls to starve and perish for lack of the true food, which is Christs Evangell sincerely preached: It will not excuse you in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence who will require account of every Talent committed to your charge, to say, That ye supposed that the charge of the souls had been

                     <note place="margin">Isaiah 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy Princes</hi> (saith he) <hi>are apostates,</hi> (that is, obstinate refusers of God) <hi>and they are companions of theeves.</hi> This grievous accusation was laid against them, albeit that they ruled in that City, which sometime was called Holy, where then were the Temple, Rites, and Ordinances of God; because that not onely they were wicked themselves, but chiefly because they maintained wicked men, their Priests and false Prophets, in honours and authority: If they did not escape this accusation of the holy Ghost in that age, look ye neither to scape the accusation nor the judgement of wicked men;<note place="margin">Jerem 23. &amp; 27.</note> to wit, That the one and the other shall drink the Cup of Gods wrath and vengeance together. And lest ye should deceive your selves,<note place="margin">Ezech. 13. Hosa 4.</note> esteeming your Bishops to be vertuous and godly, this do I affirm, and offer my self to prove the same, That more wicked men then be the whole rabble of your Clergie, were never from the beginning universally known in any age; yea, <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorra</hi> may be justified in respect of them; for they permitted just <hi>Lot</hi> to dwell amongst them without any violence done to his body, which that pestilent Generation of your sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven sort doth not, but most cruelly persecute by fire and sword the true members of Christs Body, for no other cause, but for the true service and honouring of God. And therefore I fear not to affirm that, which God will one day justifie, That by your Offices ye are bound, not onely to represse their tyranny, but also to punish them as theeves and murtherers, as Idolaters,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> and blasphemers of God; and in their rooms ye are bound to place true Preachers of Christs Evangell, for the instruction,<note place="margin">If Powers provide not for instruction of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they do never rule above them for their Profit.</note> comfort, and salvation of your subjects, above whom else shall never the holy Ghost acknowledge, That you rule in justice for their profit. If ye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to possesse the Kingdom with Christ Jesus, ye may not take example neither by the ignorant multitude of Princes, neither by the ungodly and cruell Rulers of the earth, of whom some passe their time in sloth, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and riot, without respect had to Gods honour, or to the salvation of of their brethren; and others most cruelly oppresse, with proud <hi>Nimrod,</hi> such as be subject to them. But your pattern and example must be the practice of those whom God hath approved by the testimony of his Word, as after shall be declared.</p>
                  <p>Of the premises it is evident, That to lawfull powers is given the Sword, for punishment of malefactors, for maintenance of innocents, and for the profit and utility of their subjects. Now let us consider, Whether the Reformation of Religion fallen in decay, and punishment of false Teachers, do appertain to the Civill Magistrate and Nobility of any Realme.<note place="margin">What Satan hath obtained of the blinde world.</note> I am not ignorant that Satan of old time, for maintenance of his darknesse, hath obtained of the blinde world two chief points: The former, He hath perswaded to Princes, Rulers, and Magistrates, That

                     <hi>that they may execute the Office of the Priesthood; thou shalt make them Garments, thou shalt anoynt them, thou shalt wash them, thou shalt fill their hands with Sacrifice.</hi> And so forth of every Rite and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony that was to be done unto them, especiall commandment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto <hi>Moses,</hi> That he should do it. Now if <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons were subject to <hi>Moses,</hi> that they did nothing but at his commandment, Who dare be so bold as to affirm, That the Civill Magistrate hath nothing to do in matters of Religion? For seeing that then God did so straitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, That even those who did bear the figure of Christ, should receive from the Civill power as it were their Sanctification, and entrance into their Office: And seeing also that <hi>Moses</hi> was so far preferred to <hi>Aaron,</hi> that the one commanded, and the other did obey, Who dare esteem that the Civill power is now become so profane in Gods eyes, that it is sequestred from all intromission with the matters of Religion. The holy Ghost in divers places declareth the contrary. For one of the chief Precepts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to the King, when that he should be placed in his Throne, was to write the example of the Book of the Lords Law, that it should be with him, that he might reade in it all the dayes of his life, that he might learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all the words of his Law and his Statutes to do them. This Precept he requireth, not onely that the King should himself fear God, keep his Law and Statutes, but that also he, as the chief Ruler, should provide that Gods true Religion should be kept inviolated of the people and flock which by God was committed to his charge.<note place="margin">The facts of godly Kings are an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Law, and declaration of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Such as be not more then blinde, cleerly may perceive that the King doth acknowledge, That it appertained to his charge, To reforme the Religion. To appoint the Levites to their charges, and To admonish them of their Duty and Office: Which thing he most evidently declareth, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Letters to all <hi>Israel,</hi> to <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasses,</hi> and sent the same by the hands of Messengers, having this tenour:</p>

but did further destroy all Monuments of Idolatry which of long time had remained: For it is written of him, That after that the Book of the Law was found, and that he asked counsell at the Prophetesse <hi>Hulda,</hi> he sent and gathered all the Elders of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>

He further commanded <hi>Hilkias</hi> the high Priest,<note place="margin">The King commanded the Priests.</note> and the Priests of the inferiour Order, That they should carry forth of the Temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made to <hi>Baal,</hi> which he burnt, and did carry their powder to <hi>Bethel.</hi> He did further destroy all Monuments of Idolatry, yea, even those that had remained from the dayes of <hi>Solomon</hi>; he did burn them, stamp them to Powder, whereof one part he scattered in the brook <hi>Kidron,</hi> and the other part upon the Sepulchres and Graves of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whose bones he did burn upon the Altars where before they made Sacrifice not onely in <hi>Iuda,</hi> but also in <hi>Bethel,</hi> where <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had erected his Idolatry: yea, he further proceeded, and did kill the Priests of the high places, who were Idolaters, and had deceived the people; he did kill them, I say, and burnt their bones upon their own Altars, and so returned to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> This Reformation made <hi>Iosias,</hi> and for the same obtained this Testimony of the holy Ghost, That neither before him nor after him was there any such King, who returned to God with his whole soul, and with all his strength, according to all the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>

                  <p>Of which Histories it is evident, That the Reformation of Religion in all points, together with the punishment of false Teachers, doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the power of the Civill Magistrate: For what God required of them, his justice must require of others having the like charge and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; what he did approve in them, he cannot but approve in all others who with like zeal and sincerity do enterprise to purge the Lords Temple and Sanctuary. What God required of them, it is before declared; to wit, That most diligently they should observe his Law, Statutes and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. And how acceptable were their facts to God, doth he himself witnesse;<note place="margin">2 Par. 32.</note> For to some he gave most notable Victories without the hand of man; and in their most desperate dangers, did declare his especiall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards them by signes supernaturall: To other he so established the Kingdom, that their enemies were compelled to stoup under their feet.

not onely voyd of love towards your subjects, but also to live without care of your own salvation, yea, without all fear and true reverence of God.

And secondly, Because you are no Kings, but Nobles in your Realm. But be not deceived; for neither of both can excuse you in Gods presence from doing his duty, for it is a thing more then certain, That whatsoever God required of the Civill Magistrate in <hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Iuda</hi> concerning the observation of true Religion during the time of the Law, the same doth he require of lawfull Magistrates pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Christ Jesus in the time of the Gospel, as the holy Ghost hath taught us by the mouth of <hi>David</hi> (<hi>Psal.</hi> 2.) saying, <hi>Be learned, you that judge the earth, kisse the Son, lest that the Lord wax angry, and that ye perish away.</hi> This Admonition doth not extend to the Judges under the Law onely, but doth also include all such as be promoted to Honours in the time of the Gospel, when Christ Jesus doth raigne and fight in his Spirituall Kingdom, whose enemies in that Psalme be first most sharply taxed, their fury expressed, and vanity mocked; and then are Kings and Judges, who think themselves free from all Law and Obedience, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to repent their former blinde rage; and Judges are charged to be learned; and last, are commanded to serve the Eternall God in feare, to rejoyce before him in trembling, to kisse the Son, that is, To give him most humble Obedience: Whereof it is evident, That the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Magistrates, and Judges now in Christs Kingdom, are no lesse bound to Obedience unto God, then were those under the Law: And how is it possible that any should be obedient, who despiseth his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in which standeth the chief glory that man can give to God, and is a service which God especially requireth of Kings and Rulers? Which thing Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> plainly did note, writing to one <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facius</hi> a man of Warre,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epist.</hi> 50.</note> according to the same argument and purpose which I labour to perswade your Honours: For after that he hath in that his Epistle declared the difference betwixt the heresie of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> and <hi>Arrians,</hi> and hath somewhat spoken of their cruelty, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way how their fury should and ought to be repressed, and that it is lawfull for the unjustly afflicted to seek support and defence at godly Magistrates; for thus he writeth, <hi>Either must the Verity be kept close,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Advert.</note> 
                     <hi>or else must their cruelty be sustained.</hi> But if the Verity should be concealed, not onely should none be saved, but also should many be lost through their deceit. But if by Preaching of the Verity their fury should be provoked more to rage, and by that means yet some were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made strong, yet should fear hinder many weaklings to follow the Verity, if their rage be not stayed. In these first words <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth three reasons why the afflicted Church in those dayes called for the help of the Emperour, and of godly Magistrates, against the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the persecuters. The first, <hi>The Verity must be spoken, or else man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde shall perish in errour.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note well.</note> The second, The Verity being plainly spoken, provoketh the adversaries to rage. And because that some did alleadge, That rather we ought to suffer all injury, then to seek support by man, he



<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61872:274"/>
addeth the third reason; to wit, That many weak ones be not able to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer persecution and death for the Truths sake, to whom not the lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect ought to be had, that they may be won from their errour, and so be brought to greater strength.</p>
                  <p>Oh that the Rulers of this age would ponder and weigh the reasons of this godly Writer, and provide the remedy, which he requireth in these words following; <hi>Now when the Church was thus afflicted, if any thinke, That rather they should have sustained all calamity,</hi>

                     <hi>then that help should have been asked of Christian Emperours by the godly, he doth not well to advert, That of such negligence no good counts nor reason could be given: For where such as would that no just Laws should be made against their impiety, alleadge, That the Apostles sought no such things of the Kings of the earth, they do not consider, That the time was other then it is now, and that all things are done in their owne time. What Emperour then believed in Christ, that he should serve him in making Laws for godlinesse against impiety? While that saying of the Prophet was compleat, Why hath</hi> Nations raged, and people have imagined vanity? The Kings of the earth have stood up, and Princes have conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together against the Lord, and against his Anoynted. <hi>That which is after in the same Psalme, was not yet come to passe:</hi> And now understand, O ye Kings, be learned you that judge the earth, serve the Lord in fear,<note place="margin">Advert the minde of <hi>Augustine.</hi>
                     </note> and rejoyce to him with trembling. <hi>How do Kings serve the Lord in feare, but in punishing, and by a godly severity forbidding those things which are done against the Commandment of the Lord? For otherwise doth he serve the Lord in so farre as he is man, otherwise in so farre as he is King. In so farre as he is a man, he serveth him by living faithfully; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is also King,</hi>

                     <hi>he serveth establishing Laws that command the things that be just, and that with a convenient rigour forbid things contrary.

                     <hi>when they do those things to serve him, which none except Kings be able to doe.</hi> He further proceedeth, and concludeth, That <hi>as when wicked Kings do raigne, impiety cannot be bridled by Laws, but rather is tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exercised under the title of the same; So is it a thing without all reasons, That Kings professing the knowledge and honour of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">O that the world would understand!</note> 
                     <hi>should not regard nor care who did defend nor who did oppugne the Church of God in their Dominions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By these words of this ancient and godly Writer, your Honours may perceive what I require of you, to wit, To represse the tyranny of your Bishops, and to defend the innocents professing the Truth. He did require of the Emperour and Kings in his dayes professing Christ, and manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concludeth, That <hi>they cannot serve Christ, except that so they doe.</hi> Let not your Bishops think that <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh for them, because he nameth the Church: Let them reade and understand, That <hi>Augustine</hi>

writeth for that Church which professeth the Truth, and doth suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution for the defence of the same, which your Bishops do not, but rather with the Donatists and Arrians do cruelly persecute all such as boldly speak Christs Eternall Verity, to manifest their impiety and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. But thus much we have of <hi>Augustine,</hi> That it appertaineth to the obedience and service which Kings owe to God, as well now in the time of the Gospel,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> as before under the Law, to defend the afflicted for matters of Religion, and to represse the fury of the persecuters by the rigour and severity of godly Laws. For which cause, no doubt, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet saith,<note place="margin">Isai. 49.</note> That Kings should be nourishers of the Church of God, that they should abase their heads, and lovingly embrace the children of God. And thus, I say, your Honours may evidently see, That the same Obedience doth God require of Rulers and Princes in the time of the Gospel, that he required in the time of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">An answer to the second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note>If you do think that the Reformation of Religion, and defence of the afflicted doth not appertain to you, because you are no Kings, but Nobles and States of a Realme, in two things you are deceived: First, In that you do not advert, That <hi>David</hi> requireth as well that the Princes and Judges of the earth to be learned, and that they serve and fear God, as that he requireth that Kings repent. If you therefore be Judges and Princes (as no man can deny you to be) then by the plain words of <hi>David</hi> you are charged to be learned, to serve and fear God; which ye cannot do, if ye despise the Reformation of his Religion. And this is your first errour.</p>
                  <p>The second is, That ye neither know your duty which ye owe to God, neither yet your Authority which of him ye have received, if ye for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or fear of any earthly man despise Gods true Religion, and contemn your brethren that in his Name call for your support. Your duty is to hear the voyce of the Eternall your God, and unfainedly to studie to follow his Precepts; who, as is before said, of speciall mercy hath promoted you to Honours and Dignity.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> His chief and principall Precept is, That with reverence ye receive and embrace his onely beloved Son Jesus; That ye promote to the uttermost of your powers his true Religion; and That ye defend your brethren and subjects, whom he hath put under your charge and care. Now if your King be a man ignorant of God, enemy to his true Religion, blinded by Superstition, and a persecuter of Christs mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Shall ye be execused, if with silence ye passe over his iniquity? Be not deceived, my Lords, ye are placed in Authority for another purpose then to flatter your King in his folly and blinde rage; to wit, That as with your bodies, strength, riches and wisedom ye are bound to assist and defend him in all things which by your advice he shall take in hand for Gods glory,<note place="margin">Note diligently</note> and for the preservation of his Common-wealth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; so by your authorities, counsell, and admonition, ye are bound to correct and represse whatsoever ye know him to attempt expressely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Gods Word, Honour and glory, or what ye shall espie him to do, be it by ignorance, or be it by malice, against his subjects, great or small: Of which last part of your obedience if you defraud your King, ye commit against him no lesse Treason,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> then if ye did extract from him your due and promised support, when by his enemies unjustly he were pursued.



<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61872:275"/>
But this part of their duty, I fear, do a small number of the Nobility of this age rightly consider; neither yet will they understand that for that purpose hath God promoted them: For now the common song of all men is, <hi>We must obey our Kings, be they good or bad; For God hath commanded it.</hi> But horrible shall the vengeance be, that shall be poured forth upon such blasphemers of God his holy Name and Ordinance;<note place="margin">Note diligently</note> For it is no lesse blasphemy to say, That God hath commanded Kings to be obeyed, when they command impiety, then to say, That God by his Precept is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and maintainer of all iniquity. True it is, God hath commanded Kings to be obeyed; but like true it is, That in things which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit against his glory, or when cruelly without cause they rage against their brethren the members of Christs body, he hath commanded no obedience, but rather he hath approved, yea and greatly rewarded such as have opposed themselves to their ungodly commandments and blinde rage; as in the examples of the three Children, of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Abdemelech</hi> it is evident. The three Children would neither bow nor stoup before the golden Image at the commandment of the great King <hi>Nebuchadnezar. Daniel</hi> did openly pray, his windows being open, against the established Law of <hi>Darius</hi> and of his Councell. And <hi>Abdemelech</hi> feared not to enter in before the presence of <hi>Zedechias,</hi> and boldly to defend the cause and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet,<note place="margin">Jerem 38.</note> whom the King and his Councell had condemned to death. Every one of these facts should this day be judged foolish, by such as will not understand what God doth require of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when his Verity is oppugned, or his glory called in doubt: such men, I say, as prefer man to God, and things present, to the heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, should have judged every one of these stubborn inobedience, foolish presumption and singularity, or else bold controlling of the King and his wise Councell. But how acceptable in Gods presence was this resistance to the ungodly commandments and determinations of their King, the end did witnesse; for the three children were delivered from the Furnace of fire, and <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Den of Lions, To the confusion of their enemies, To the better instruction of the ignorant Kings, and To the perpetuall comfort of Gods afflicted children. And <hi>Abdemelech,</hi> in the day of the Lords Visitation,<note place="margin">Jerem. 39.</note> when the King and his Councell did drink the bitter cup of Gods Vengeance, did finde his life for a prey, and did not fall by the edge of the sword, when many thousands did perish: And this was signified unto them by the Prophet himself, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, before that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was destroyed. This promise and cause were recited unto him in these words, <hi>I will bring my words upon this City unto evil, and not unto good; but most assuredly I shall deliver thee, because thou hast trusted in me, saith the Lord.</hi> The trust and hope which <hi>Abdemelech</hi> had in God, made himself bold to oppose himself, being but one, to the King and to his whole Councell, who had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death the Prophet, whom his conscience did acknowledge to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: for thus did he speak in presence of the King, sitting in the Port of <hi>Benjamin; My Lord the King,</hi> (saith <hi>Abdemelech</hi>) <hi>these men do wickedly in all things that they have done to</hi> Jeremy <hi>the Prophet.</hi> Advert and take heed, my Lords, that the men who had condemned the Prophet, were the King,

his Princes and Councell, and yet did one man accuse them all of iniquity, and did boldly speak in the defence of him, of whose innocency he was perswaded:<note place="margin">Note dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> And the same, I say, is the duty of every man in his Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but chiefly of the Nobility, which is joyned with their kings, to bridle and represse their folly and blinde rage: Which thing if the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility do not, neither yet labour to doe, as they are Traitours to their Kings, so do they provoke the wrath of God against themselves, and against the Realme, in which they abuse the Authoritie which they have received of God, to maintaine Vertue, and to suppresse Vice. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I would your Honours were most certainly perswaded, That God will neither excuse Nobilitie nor people, but the Nobility least of all that obey and follow their Kings in manifest iniquity; but with the same ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance will God punish the Prince, People, and Nobility conspiring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against him and his Holy Ordinances; as in the punishment upon <hi>Pharaoh, Israel, Iuda,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> is evidently to be seene; for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not drowned alone, but his Captains, Charets, and great Army drank the same Cup with him. The Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> were not punished without company, but with them were murthered the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, their Princes imprisoned, and their people led Captive: And why? because none was found so faithfull to God, that he durst enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise to resist, nor gainstand the manifest impietie of their Princes. And therefore was Gods wrath powred forth upon the one and the other. But the more ample discourse of this argument I deferre to better opportunity; onely at this time I thought expedient to admonish you, That before God it shall not excuse you to alleadge, We are no Kings and therefore neither can we reforme Religion, nor yet defend such as be persecuted. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, my Lords, that ye are powers ordained of God (as before is declared) and therefore doth the Reformation of Religion, and the defence of such as unjustly are oppressed, appertaine to your charge and care; which thing shall the Law of God (universally given to be kept of all men) most evidently declare; which is my last and most assured reason, why (I say) ye ought to remove from your Honours, and to punish with death such as God hath condemned by his own mouth.</p>

conjunction with us) will not wink at the Idolatry of others, of what state or condition soever they be.</p>
                  <p>It is not unknown,<note place="margin">If any state might have claimed privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it was the Prophets.</note> That the Prophets had Revelations of God, which were not common to the people; as <hi>Samuel</hi> had the Revelation that <hi>Eli</hi> and his posterity should be destroyed, That <hi>Saul</hi> should first be King, and thereafter, That he should be rejected; That <hi>David</hi> should raign for him. <hi>Michaiah</hi> understood by Vision,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3: 1 Sam. 9.15. 1 King. 22. 1 Kings 21. 2 Kings 1.</note> That <hi>Achab</hi> should be killed in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell against the <hi>Syrians. Elias</hi> saw that dogs should eat <hi>Iezabel</hi> in the Forts of <hi>Iezreel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Elisha</hi> did see hunger come upon <hi>Israel</hi> by the space of seven yeers. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> did foresee the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the time of their Captivity. And so divers other Prophets had divers Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of God, which the people did not otherwise understand, but by their affirmation; and therefore in those dayes were the Prophets named Seers, because that God did open unto them that which was hid from the multitude. Now if any man might have claimed any priviledge from the rigour of the Law, or might have justified his fact, it should have been the Prophet: For he might have alleadged for himself his singular Prerogative that he had above other men, to have Gods Will revealed unto him by Vision or by Dream; or, That God had declared particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto him, that his pleasure was, To be honoured in that manner, in such a place, and by such means. But all such excuses doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, commanding, That the Prophet that shall so solicitate the people to serve strange Gods, shall die the death, notwithstanding that he alleadge for himself Dream, Vision, or Revelation; yea, although he promise mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; and although that such things as he promised should come to passe, yet I say commandeth God that no credit be given to him, but that he die the death, because he teacheth apostasie and defection from God. Hereby your Honours may easily see, That none provoking the people to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, ought to be exempted from the punishment of death: For if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that inseparable Conjunction which God himself hath sanctified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and wife, neither that unspeakable love grafted in nature, which is betwixt the father and the son, neither yet that reverence which Gods people ought to bear to the Prophets, can excuse any man to spare the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, or to conceal his offence: What excuse can man pretend, which God will accept? Evident it is, That no state, condition, nor honour can exempt the Idolater from the hands of God, when he shall call him to account, or shall inflict punishment upon him for his offence: How shall it then excuse the people, that they, according to Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, punish not to death such as shall solicitate, or violently draw the people to Idolatry?</p>
                  <p>And this is the first which I would your Honours should note of the former words, to wit, That no person is exempted from punishment, if he can be manifestly convinced to have provoked or led the people to Idolatry: And this is most evidently declared in that solemn Oath and Covenant which <hi>Asa</hi> made with the people, To serve God, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Religion, adding this penalty to the transgressors of it; to wit, That whosoever should not seek the God of <hi>Israel</hi> should be killed, were he great,<note place="margin">2 Par. 15.</note> or were he small, were it man, or were it woman. And of this



<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61872:277"/>
Oath was the Lord well pleased, he was found of them, and gave them rest on every part, because they sought him with their whole heart, and did swear to punish the offenders according to the Precept of his Law, without respect of persons. And this is it which I say I would your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours should note for the first, That no Idolater can be exempted from punishment by Gods Law.</p>
                  <p>The second is, That the punishment of such crimes as are Idolatry, Blasphemy, and others that touch the Majesty of God, doth not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Kings and chief Rulers onely, but also to the whole Body of the people, and to every member of the same, according to the Vocation of every man, and according to that possibility and occasion which God doth minister, to revenge the injury done against his glory, when that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety is manifestly known: And that doth <hi>Moses</hi> more plainly speak, in these words;<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>If in any Cities</hi> (saith he) <hi>which the Lord thy God giveth to thee to dwell in them thou shalt hear this brute, There are some men the sons of</hi> Belial <hi>passed from thee, and have solicited the Citizens out of their Cities by these words, Let us go and serve strange gods which you have not known; search and enquire diligently, and if it be true that such abomination is done in the midst of thee, thou shalt utterly strike the Inhabitants of that City with the Sword, thou shalt destroy it, and whatsoever is within it; thou shalt gather the spoyl of it into the midst of the Market-place, thou shalt burn that City with fire, and the spoyl of it to the Lord thy God, that it may be a heap of stones for ever; neither shall it be any more builded. Let nothing of that execration cleave to thy hand, that the Lord may turn from thee the fury of his wrath, and be moved towards thee with inward affection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Plain it is, That <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh not, nor giveth charge to Kings Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Judges onely, but he commandeth the whole Body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yea, and every member of the same, according to their possibility; And who dare be so impudent,<note place="margin">Why every man in <hi>Israel</hi> was bound to obey Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> as to deny this to be most reasonabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

were not to be found many innocent persons, as infants, children, and some simple and ignorant souls, who neither did nor could consent to such impiety? And yet we finde no exception, but all are appointed to the cruell death. And as concerning the City, and the spoyl of the same, mans reason cannot think, but that it might have been better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, then to be consumed with fire, and so to profit no man: But in such cases Gods will is, That all creatures stoup, cover their faces, &amp; desist from reasoning, when commandment is given to execute his judgement. Albeit I could adduce divers causes of such severity, yet will I search none other then the holy Ghost hath assigned: First, That all <hi>Israel,</hi> hearing the judgement, should fear to commit the like abomination. And secondly, That the Lord might turn from the fury of his anger, might be moved towards the people with inward affection, be mercifull unto them, and multiply them, according to his Oath made unto their fathers. Which reasons, as they are sufficient in Gods children to correct the murmuring of the grudging flesh, so ought they to provoke every man, as before I have said, to declare himself enemy to that which so highly provoketh the wrath of God against the whole people: For where <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>Let the City be burned, and let no part of the spoyl cleave to thy hand, that the Lord may return from the fury of his wrath,</hi>

I am not ignorant that this Law was not put in execution, as God commanded; But what did thereof ensue and follow, histories declare; to wit, Plague after plague, till <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iuda</hi> were led in Captivity, as the Books of the Kings do witnesse.

                     <note place="margin">Ezek 9.</note> when he gave him to understand why he would destroy <hi>Iuda</hi> with <hi>Israel</hi>; and that he would remove his glory from the Temple and place that he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,<note place="margin">Ezek 8. &amp; 9.</note> and so pour forth his wrath and indignation upon the City that was full of blood and apostasie, which became so impudent, that it durst be bold to say, <hi>The Lord hath left the earth, and seeth not.</hi> And this time, I say, the Lord revealed in vision to his Prophet, who they were that should finde favour in that miserable destruction; to wit, That those that did mourn and lament for all the abominations done in the City, in whose foreheads did God command to Print and Seal <hi>Tau,</hi> to the end that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer, who was commanded to strike the rest without mercy, should not hurt them in whom that signe was found.

(I mean, after they be once received.) And if Christ be not come to dissolve, but to fulfill the Law of his heavenly Father, Shall the liberty of his Gospel be an occasion that the especiall glory of his Father be trodden under foot, and regarded of no man? God forbid. The especiall glory of God is, That such as professe themselves to be his people,<note place="margin">The especiall honour which God requireth of his people.</note> should hearken to his voice: And amongst all the voices of God revealed to the world, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing punishment of vices, is none more evident, neither more severe, then is that which is pronounced against Idolatry,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> the teachers and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the same: And therefore I fear not to affirm, That the Gentiles (I mean, every City, Realm, Province, or Nation amongst the Gentiles, embracing Christ Jesus, and his true Religion) be bound to the same League and Covenant that God made with his people <hi>Israel,</hi> when he promised to root out the Nations before them, in these words, <hi>Beware that thou make not any Covenant with the Inhabitants of the Land,</hi>

shall you make Sacrifice, his Statutes, Iudgements, Laws, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you shall keep and observe. This is the Covenant which I have made with you, saith the Eternall, forget it not, neither yet fear ye other gods; but fear you the Lord your God, and he shall deliver you from the hands of all your enemies.</hi> To this same Law and Covenant are the Gentiles no lesse bound, then sometime were the Jews, whensoever God doth illuminate the eyes of any multitude, Province, people, or Citie, and putteth the sword in their own hand to remove such enormities from amongst them, as before they knew to be abominable;<note place="margin">

                  <p>In universall desections, and in a generall revolt, such as was in <hi>Israel</hi> after <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> there is a divers consideration; for then, because the whole people were together conspired against God, there could none be found that would execute the punishment which God had commanded, till God raised up <hi>Iehu,</hi> whom he appointed for that purpose. And the same is to be considered in all other generall defections, such as this day be in the Papistry, where all are blinded, and all are declined from God, and that of long continuance, so that no ordinary Justice can be executed, but the punishment must be reserved to God, and unto all such means as he shall appoint: But I speak of such a number as after they have received Gods perfect Religion, do boldly professe the same, notwithstanding,<note place="margin">

                     </note> that some, or the most part fall back (as of late dayes was in <hi>England</hi>) unto such a number, I say, it is lawfull to punish the Idolators with death, if by any means God give them power: For so did <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> determine to have done against the children of <hi>Reuben, Gad,</hi> and <hi>Manasses,</hi> for their suspected Apostasie and defection from God. And the whole Tribes did in very deed execute that sharp judgement against the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> for a lesse offence then for Idolatry. And the same ought to be one wheresoever Christ Jesus and his Evangell is so received in any Realm, Province, or Citie, that the Magistrates and people have solemnly avowed and promised to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the same, as under King <hi>Edward</hi> of late dayes was done in <hi>England.</hi> In such places, it is not onely lawfull to punish to the death, such as labour to subvert the true Religion, but the Magistrates and people are bound so to, unlesse they will provoke the wrath of God against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And therefore, I fear not to affirm, That it had been the duty of the Nobilitie, Judges, Rulers, and people of <hi>England,</hi> to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted and gain-standed <hi>Mary</hi> their Queen, with all the sort of her Idolatrous Priests, together with all such as should have assisted her, when that she and they openly began to suppresse Christs Evangell, to shed the blood of the Saints of God, and to erect that most devillish

Idolatry, the Papisticall abominations, and his usurped tyranny, which once most justly by common Oath was banished from that Realm. But because I cannot at this present discusse this argument as it appertaineth, I am compelled to omit it to better opportunity; and so returning to your Honours, I say, That if ye confesse your selves baptized in the Lord Jesus, as of necessity ye must confesse, That the care of Religion doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to your charge: And if ye know that in your hands God hath put the sword, for the causes above expressed, then can ye not deny, but that the punishment of obstinate and malapert Idolaters (such as all your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops be) doth appertain to your Office, if after admonition they continue obstinate.

                     </note> That no priviledge granted against the Ordinance and Statutes of God is to be observed, although all Councells and men on the earth have appointed the same: But against Gods Ordinance it is, That Idolaters, murtherers, false Teachers, and Blasphemers, shall be exempted from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, as before is declared; and therefore in vain it is, that they claim for priviledge, when God saith, The murtherer shalt thou drive from my Altar, that he may die the death. And as to the Order and Reformation which they promise, that is to be looked or hoped for, when Satan, whose children and slaves they are, can change his nature. This answer, I doubt not, shall suffice the sober and godly reader: But yet, to the end that they may further see their own confusion, and that your Honours may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understand what ye ought to do in so manifest a corruption and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from God, I ask of them, What assurance they have of this their immunity, exemption or priviledge? Who is the author of it? And what fruit it hath produced?<note place="margin">God is not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of any priviledge granted to the Papisticall Bishops, that they be exempted from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the civill sword.</note> And first I say, That of God they have no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, neither yet can he be proved to be author of any such priviledge. But the contrary is easie to be seen; for God in establishing his Orders in <hi>Israel,</hi> did so subject <hi>Aaron</hi> (in his Priesthood being the figure of Christ) to <hi>Moses,</hi> that he feared not to call him in judgement, and to constrain him to give accounts of his wicked deed in consenting to Idolatry, as the History doth plainly witnesse; for thus it is written; <hi>Then</hi> Moses <hi>took the Calfe which they had made, and burned it with fire, and did grinde it to powder;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>and scattering it in the water, gave it to drink to the children of Israel,</hi> declaring thereby the vanity of their Idol, and the abomination of the same: And thereafter <hi>Moses</hi> said to <hi>Aaron, What hath this people done to thee, that thou shouldest bring upon it so a great sin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, I say, doth <hi>Moses</hi> call <hi>Aaron,</hi> and accuse him of the destruction of the whole people; and yet he perfectly understood that God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to be the high Priest, That he should bear upon his shoulders and upon his brest the names of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> for whom



<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61872:279"/>
he was appointed to make sacrifice, prayers, and supplications. He knew his dignitie was so great, that onely he might enter within the most holy place;<note place="margin">The dignity of <hi>Aaron</hi> did not exempt him from judgment</note> but neither could his Office nor dignitie exempt him from judgement, when he had offended. If any object, <hi>Aaron</hi> at that time was not anointed, and therefore was he subject to <hi>Moses</hi>; I have answered, That <hi>Moses</hi> being taught by the mouth of God did perfectly understand to what dignitie <hi>Aaron</hi> was appointed, and yet he feared not to call him in judgement, and to compell him to make answer for his wicked fact. But if this answer doth not suffice, yet shall the Holy Ghost witnesse further in the matter. <hi>Salomon</hi> removed from honour <hi>Abiathar</hi> being the High Priest, and commanded him to cease from all function, and to live as a private man. Now if the Unction did exempt the Priest from Jurisdiction of the Civill Magistrate, <hi>Solomon</hi> did offend and injured <hi>Abiathar</hi>; for he was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed, and had carried the Arke before <hi>David</hi>; But God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the fact of <hi>Solomon,</hi> neither yet doth <hi>Abiathar</hi> claime any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative by the reason of his Office, but rather doth the Holy Ghost approve the fact of <hi>Solomon,</hi> saying, Solomon <hi>ejected forth</hi> Abiathar, <hi>that he should not be the Priest of the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 2. 1 Sam 3.</note> 
                     <hi>that the word of the Lord might be performed which he spake upon the house of</hi> Eli. And <hi>Abiathar</hi> did thinke that hee obtained great favour, in that hee did escape the present death, which by his Conspiracie he had deserved. If any yet reason, That <hi>Abiathar</hi> was no otherwise subject to the judgement of the King, but as he was appointed to be the executor of that sentence, which GOD before had pronounced, as I will not greatly denie that reason, so require I that every man consider, That the same God who pronounced sentence against <hi>Eli</hi> and his house,<note place="margin">Notewell.</note> hath pronounced also, That Idolaters,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 1 Tim. 3.</note> Whore-mongers, Murtherers and Blasphemers, shall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have portion in the Kingdom of God, neither ought to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bear any Rule in his Church and Congregation. Now if the Unction and Office saved not <hi>Abiathar,</hi> because that Gods sentence must needs be performed, Can any priviledge granted by man be a Buckler to malefactors, that they shall not be subject to the punishments pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by God? I think no man will be so foolish as so to affirm; for a thing more then evident it is, That the whole Priesthood in the time of the Law was bound to give obedience to the Civill Powers; and if any member of the same was found criminall, the same was subject to the punishment of the Sword which God had put into the hand of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.

And therefore, I say, as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and ignorance remain alwayes with the most perfect man in his life, so must their works be examined by another rule, then by their own holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if they shall be approved.</p>

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61872:281"/>But if this Answer doth not suffice, then will I answer more shortly, That no godly Emperour since Christs Ascension hath granted any such priviledge to any such Church or person, as they (the whole generation of Papists) be at this day.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant, that some Emperours of a certain zeale, and for some considerations granted liberties to the true Church, afflicted for their maintenance against Tyrants; but what serveth this for the defence of their Tyrannie? If the Law must be understood according to the minde of the Lawgiver, then must they prove themselves Christs true and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Church, before they can claim any priviledge to appertaine to them, for onely to that Church were the priviledges granted; it will not be their glorious Titles, neither yet the long possession of the name that can prevail in this so weighty a Cause; for all those had the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which did crucifie Christ, and did condemne his Doctrine. We offer to prove by their fruits and Tyrannie, by the Prophets, and plain Scriptures of God, what trees and generation they be, to wit, unfruitfull and rotten, apt for nothing, but to be cut and cast into Hell fire; yea, that they are the very kingdome of Antichrist, of whom we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to beware.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, my Lords, to return to you, seeing that God hath armed your hands with the sword of Justice, seeing that his Law most straightly commandeth Idolaters and false Prophets to be punished with death, and that you be placed above your Subjects, to reigne as fathers over their Children; and further, seeing that not onely I, but with me many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand famous, godly and learned persons, accuse your Bishops, and the whole rabble of the Papisticall Clergie, of Idolatrie, of Murther and Blasphemie against God committed: It appertaineth to your Honours to bee vigilant and carefull in so weighty a matter? The question is not of earthly substance, but of the glory of God, and of the Salvation of your selves, and of your brethren subject to your charge; in which if you (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this plain admonition) be negligent, there resteth no excuse by reason of ignorance; for in the name of God I require of you, That the Cause of Religion may be tried in your presence by the plain and simple Word of God; That your Bishops be compelled to desist from their Tyrannie, That they be compelled to make answer for the neglecting of their Office for the substance of the poor, which unjustly they usurp, and prodigally they do spend; but principally for the false and deceivable Doctrine which is taught and defended by their false Prophets, flattering Friers, and other such venomous Locusts: Which thing if with single eyes yee do, (preferring Gods glory and the Salvation of your Brethren before all wordly Commoditie) then shall the same God, who solemnly doth pronounce to honour those that do honour him, pour his benedictions plentifully upon you, he shall be your Buckler, protection and Captain, and shall represse by his strength and wisdom, whatsoever Satan by his supposts shall imagine against you I am not ignorant, that great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles shall ensue your enterprise; for Satan will not be expelled from the possession of his usurped Kingdom without resistance: But if you (as is said) preferring Gods glory to your own lives, unfainedly seek and study

He furthermore added a Precept, That the rich should give no more for that use, and in that behalf, then should the poor; neither yet that the poor should give any lesse then should the rich in that consideration. This law, to mans reason and judgement, may appear very unreasonable; for some rich man might have given a thousand sickles with lesse hurt of his substance, then some poor man might have payed the half Sickle: And yet God maketh all equall, and will that the one shall pay no more then the other, neither yet the poor lesse then the rich; This Law (I say) may appear very unequall: But if the cause which God addeth be observed, we shall finde in the same the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and inestimable wisdom of God to appear, which cause is expressed in these words;<note place="margin">Exod. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>This money received from the children of Israel, thou shalt give in for the service of the Tabernacle, that it may be to the clildren of Israel for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance before the Lord, that he may be mercifull to your souls.</hi> This cause (I say) doth evidently declare, That as the whole multitude was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the bondage of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the mighty power of God alone; so was every member of the same (without respect of persons) sanctified by his grace, the richest (in that behalfe) nothing preferred before the poorest: For by no merit and worthinesse of man was he moved to choose and to establish his habitation and dwelling amongst them; but their felicity, prerogative and honour which they had above all other Nations, proceeded onely from the fountaine of his eternall goodnesse, who loved them freely, as he freely had chosen them to be a priestly kingdome, and holy people from all Nations of the earth: Thus to honour them that hee would dwell in the midst of them, he neither was moved (I say) by the wisdome of the wise, by the riches of the potent,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> neither yet by the vertue and holinesse of any state amongst them, but of meer goodnesse did he love them, and with his presence did he honour the whole people, and therefore to paint out

It will not excuse you (dear brethren) in the presence of God, neither yet will it avail you in the day of his visitation, to say, <hi>We were but simple sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, we could not redresse the faults and crimes of our Rulers, Bishops and Clergy: We called for Reformation, and wished for the same; but Lords brethren were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, their sons were Abbots, and the friends of great men had the possession of the Church, and so were we compelled to give obedience to all that they demanded.</hi> These vain excuses, I say, will nothing avail you in the presence of God, who requireth no lesse of the subjects, then of their Rulers; That they decline from evil, and that they do good; that they abstain from Idolatry, Superstition, Blasphemy, Murther, and other such like horrible crimes which his Law forbiddeth, and yet neverthelesse are openly committed and maliciously defended in that miserable Realm. And if ye think that ye are innocent, because ye are not the chief actors of such iniquity, ye are utterly deceived; for God doth not onely punish the chief offenders, but with them doth he condemn the consenters to such iniquity; and all are judged to consent,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> that knowing impiety committed, give no testimony that the same displeaseth them.<note place="margin">

Evident it is that they were not, if they be judged according to their externall facts; for some were young, and could not be oppressors, neither yet could defile themselves with unnaturall and beastly lusts: Some were pitifull, and gentle of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and did not thirst for the blood of Christ, nor of his Apostles: But did any escape the plagues and vengeance which did apprehend the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? Let the Scriptures witnesse, and the Histories be considered, which plainly do testifie, That by the waters all flesh in earth at that time did perish; (<hi>Noah</hi> and his family reserved) That none escaped in <hi>Sodome,</hi> and in the other Cities adjacent, except <hi>Lot</hi> and his two daughters.

And what is the cause of this severity, seeing that all were not alike offenders, let the flesh cease to dispute with God, and let all men by these examples learn betimes to fly, and avoid the society and company of the proud contemners of God, if that they list not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their plagues. The cause is evident, if we can be subject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grudging to Gods judgements, which in themselves are most holy and just: For in the originall world none was found, that either did resist tyranny and oppression that universally was used, nor yet that earnestly

In <hi>Sodome</hi> was none found that did gain stand that furious and beastly multitude that did compasse about and besiege the house of <hi>Lot:</hi> None would believe <hi>Lot,</hi> that the City should be destroyed.

Which thing, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have touched, ought to move you to the deep consideration of your duties in these last and most perillous times. The iniquity of your Bishops is more then manifest; their filthy lives infect the ayr; the innocent blood which they shed, cryeth vengeance in the ears of our God; the idolatry and abomination which openly they commit, and without punishment maintain, doth corrupt and defile the whole Land, and none amongst you do unfainedly study for any redresse of such enormities. Will God in this behalf hold you as innocents? Be not deceived, dear brethren; God hath punished not onely the proud tyrants, filthy persons, and cruell murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but also such as with them did draw the yoke of iniquity, was it by flattering their offences,<note place="margin">What subjects shall God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish with their Princes.</note> obeying their unjust commandments, or in wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their manifest iniquity. All such, I say, God once punished with the chief offenders.

                  <p>It shall not bee necessary to handle the Text word by word, but of the whole summe to gather certain Notes and Observations, (which shall not farre disagree from the state of these dayes) it shall be sufficient. And first it is to be observed,<note place="margin">The first Note</note> That after this great miracle that Christ had wrought,<note place="margin">John 6.

                  <p>Why Christ removed and sent away from him the people, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> declareth, saying, <hi>When Iesus knew that they were come to take him,</hi>

of this doctrine pleased them, or could enter into their hearts, but their whole minde was upon their bellies, for sufficing whereof they devised and imagined, that they would appoint Christ Jesus to be their worldly King;<note place="margin">John 6.</note> for he had power to multiply bread at his pleasure. Which vain opinion and imagination perceived by Christ Jesus, he withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from their company, to avoid all such suspition, and to let them understand,<note place="margin">Matth. 20.</note> That no such honours did agree with his Vocation, who came to serve, and not to be served: And when this same people sought him againe,<note place="margin">John. 6.</note> he sharply rebuked them, because they sought him more to have their Bellies fed with corruptible meat, then to have their souls nourished with lively Bread that came down from Heaven. And thus in the people there was just cause why Christ should withdraw himself from them for a time.</p>
                  <p>Why the Disciples should suffer that great danger, feare and anguish, Saint <hi>Marke</hi> in his Gospel plainly sheweth,<note place="margin">Mark 6.</note> saying, <hi>That their hearts were blinded, and therefore did neither remember nor consider the miracle of the Loaves</hi>: That is, Albeit with their hands they had touched that bread by which so great a multitude was fed;<note place="margin">The disciples did not rightly consider Christs work.</note> and albeit also they had gathered up twelve Baskets full of that which remained of a few Loaves, which before the Miracle a Boy was able to have borne; yet did they not rightly consider the infinite power of Christs Jesus by this wonderfull Miracle:<note place="margin">

                     </note> And therefore of necessity it was, that in their owne Bodies they should suffer trouble for their better instruction.</p>
                  <p>When I deeply consider (dearly beloved in our Saviour Christ) how abundantly, and how miraculously the poor and small flock of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus was fed within the Realm of <hi>England</hi> under that elect and chosen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of God to glory and honour <hi>Edward the sixt</hi>; and now again behold not onely the dispersion and scattering abroad, but also the appearing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the same, under these cursed, cruell and abominable Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, me thinke I see the same causes to have moved God, not onely to withdraw his presence from the multitude, but also to have sent his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved servants to the travels of the Seas, wherein they were sore tossed and turmoyled, and apparently most like to perish.</p>
                  <p>What were the affections of the greatest multitude that followed the Gospel in this former rest and abundance, is easie to be judged, if the life and conversation of every man should have beene thorowly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For who lived (in that rest) as that he had refused himself?<note place="margin">Note this for our time.</note> Who lived in that rest, as that he had been crucified with Christ?

we perswaded our selves of a certaine tranquility, as though the troubles whereof mention is made within the Scriptures of God, appertained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to this age, but unto such as of long time are passed before us: and therfore was our heavenly Father compelled to withdraw from us the presence of his veritie (whose voyce in those dayes we could not beleeve) to the end that more earnestly we may thirst for the same, and with more obedience embrace and receive it, if ever it shall please his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in such abundance to restore the same againe.</p>

                  <p>It is not unknown unto many, that I (the most wretched) was one of that number whom God appointed to receive that Bread (as it was broken by Christ Jesus) to distribute and give the same to such as he had called to this banquet, in that part of his table where he appointed me to serve. It is not in my knowledge nor judgement to define nor determine what portion or quantity every man received of this bread, neither yet how that which they received agreed with their stomacks; but of this I am assured, That the benediction of Christ Jesus so multiplyed the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I received of his hands, that during the banquet (this I write to the praise of his Name, and to the accusation of mine owne unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) the bread never failed when the hungry soule craved or cried for food; and at the end of the banquet, mine own conscience beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that mine hands gathered up the crummes that were left in such abundance, that the banquet was full among the rest.

That day I thought I had not sinned, if I had not been idle; But this day I know it was my duty to have had consideration how long I had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one place, and how many hungry souls were in other places, to whom alas none took pain to break and distribute the bread of Life.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note>In Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> Gospel it appeareth, That another time there arose a great stormy Tempest,<note place="margin">The disciples also before this time were troubled in the Sea.</note> and sore tossed the Boat wherein Christs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were labouring: But that was nigh the day light, and then they had Christ with them in the Ship, whom they awaked, and cryed for

                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> and it was night, and Christ their Comforter absent from them, and cometh not to them neither in the first, second, nor third Watch; What fear think ye were they in? And what thoughts arose out of their so troubled hearts, during that storm? Such as this day be in like danger within the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> doth by this storm better understand then my pen can expresse. But of one thing I am well assured, That Christs presence would in that great perplexity have been to them more comfortable then ever it was before; and that patiently they would have suffered their incredulity to have been rebuked, so that they might have escaped the present death.</p>
                  <p>But profitable it shall be, and somewhat to our comfort, to consider every parcell of their danger: And first, ye shall understand, That when the disciples passed to the Sea to obey Christs Commandment,<note place="margin">What time the tempest did arise.</note> it was fair weather, and no such Tempest seen. But suddenly the storme arose with a contrarious flaw of winde, when they were in the midst of their Journey. For if the Tempest had been as great in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their entrance into the Sea, as it was after when they were about the midst of their Journey, neither would they have adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red such a great danger; neither yet had it been in their power to have attained to the midst of the Sea. And so it may be evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered,<note place="margin">The Sea was calm when the disciples took their Ship.</note> That the Sea was calme when they entered into their Journey.</p>
                  <p>Then it is to be remarked, By what means and instruments was this storme moved:<note place="margin">What moved the Sea.</note> Was the plunging of their Oars, and force of their small Boat such as might stirre the waves of the great Sea? No, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: But the holy Ghost declareth, That the Seas were moved by a vehement and contrary winde, which blew against their Ship in the time of darknesse. But seeing the winde is neither the commander nor mover of it self, some other cause is to be enquired, which hereafter we shall touch.</p>
                  <p>And last, it is to be noted and considered, What the disciples did in all this vehement Tempest. Truely they turned not to be driven backe for land or shore, by the vehemency of the contrary winde; for so it might be thought that they could not have escaped shipwrack and death:<note place="margin">The tossed Ship is a figure of the Church of Christ.</note> but they continually laboured in rowing against the winde, abiding the ceasing of that horrible tempest.</p>
                  <p>Consider and mark, beloved in the Lord, what we reade here to have chanced to Christs disciples, and to their poor Boat; and you shall well perceive, That the same thing hath chanced, doth and shall chance to the true Church and Congregation of Christ (which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else in this miserable life but a poor Ship) travelling in the Seas of this unstable and troublesome world, toward the heavenly Port, and Haven of eternall felicity, which Christ Jesus hath appointed to his elect.</p>
                  <p>This I might prove by the posterity of <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>; By the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in their Captivity; and by the Church during the time that Christ

                     </note> So is the pestilent envie of the devill work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes in the hearts of the reprobate so subtill and crafty, that it cannot be espied by Gods Elect, nor by his Messengers, till first they feel the blasts thereof to blow their Ship backward: And as the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment winde causeth the waves of the Sea to rage,<note place="margin">The Sea can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quiet when the wind bloweth outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously.</note> and yet the dead water neither knoweth what it doth, neither yet can it cease nor refrain; so that both it is troubled by the winde, and also it self doth trouble Christs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples in their poor Ship: So by the envie and malice of the devill, are wicked and cruell, as well subjects as Princes (whose hearts are like the raging Sea) compelled to persecute and trouble the true Church of Christ; and yet so blinded are they, and so enthralled under the bondage of the devill, that neither can they see their manifest iniquity, neither yet can they cease to run to their own destruction.

Be not moved from the sure foundation of your faith: For albeit that Christ Jesus be absent from you (as he was from his disciples in that great storme) by his bodily presence, yet is he present by his mighty power and grace:<note place="margin">Christ is sute upon the mountain.</note> He standeth upon the mountain in security and rest; that is, his flesh and whole humanity is now in heaven, and can suffer no such trouble as sometimes he did: And yet he is full of pity and compassion, and doth consider all our travell, anguish and labours; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be doubted, but that he will suddenly appear to our great comfort. The tyranny of this world cannot keep back his coming, more then the blustering winde and raging Seas lett Christ to come to his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when they looked for nothing but present death. And therefore yet again I say, beloved in the Lord, Let your hearts attend to the promises that God hath made unto true repentant sinners, and be fully perswaded with a constant faith, That God is alwayes true and just in his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his promises. You have heard these dayes spoken of very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when your hearts could fear no danger, because you were nigh the land, and the storm was not yet risen; that is, Ye were young Scholars of Christ when no persecution was felt or seen: But now ye are come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the midst of the Sea (for what part of <hi>England</hi> heard not of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession?) and the vehement storm whereof we then almost in every Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation spake of, is now suddenly risen up. But what? Hath God brought you so far forth,<note place="margin">God never brought his people into trouble to the intent that they should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish therein.</note> that you shall both in souls and bodies every one perish? Nay, my whole trust in Gods mercy and truth is to the contrary. For God brought not his people into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from thence thorow the Red Sea to the intent they should perish, but that he in them should shew a most glorious deliverance: Neither sent Christ his Apostles into the middest of the Sea, and suffering the storm to assault them and their Ship, to the intent they should there perish, but because he would the more have his great goodnesse towards them felt and perceived in so mightily deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them out of the fear of perishing, giving us thereby an example that he would do the like to us, if we abide constant in our profession and saith, with-drawing our selves from superstition and idolatry. We gave you warning of these dayes long ago: For the reverence of Christs Blood let these words be noted; <hi>The same Truth that spake before of these dolorous dayes,</hi>

But Christ Jesus came when they looked not for him; and so shall he do to you, if you will continue in the profession that you have made. This dare I be bold to promise, in the Name of him whose Eternall Verity and glorious Gospel ye have heard and received: who also putteth into my heart an earnest thirst (God knoweth I lie not) of your sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and some care also for your bodies, which now I will not expresse.</p>

                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61872:294"/>Thus shortly have I passed thorow the outragious tempest wherein the disciples of Christ were tempted, after that the great multitude were by Christ fed in the desert, omitting many profitable Notes which might well have been marked in the Text, because my purpose is at this present not to be tedious nor yet curious, but only to note such things as be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to these most dolorous dayes.</p>
                  <p>And so let us now speak of the end of this storm and trouble, in which I finde four things chiefly to be noted:
<list>
                        <item>First, <hi>That the disciples at the presence of Christ were more afraid then they were before.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Secondly, <hi>That Christ useth no other instrument but his Word to pacific their hearts.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Thirdly, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>in a fervency first left his Ship, and yet after feared.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Fourthly and lastly, <hi>That Christ permitted neither</hi> Peter <hi>nor the rest of his disciples to perish in that fear, but gloriously delivered all, and pacified the Tempest.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their great fear, and the cause thereof, are expressed in the Text, in these words; <hi>When the disciples saw him walking upon the Sea, they were afraid, saying, It is a Spirit; and they cryed through fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not my purpose in this Treatise to speak of spirits, nor yet to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, Whether spirits good or bad may appear and trouble men: Neither yet to enquire, Why mans nature is afraid of spirits, and so vehemently abhorreth their presence and company. But my purpose is onely to speak of things necessary for this time.</p>
                  <p>And first,<note place="margin">The causes why Christs disciples mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew him.</note> let us consider that there was three causes why the disciples knew not Christ, but judged him to be a spirit.</p>
                  <p>The first cause was, <hi>The darknesse of the night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second was, <hi>The unaccustomed vision that appeared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the third was, <hi>The danger and the tempest, in which they so earnestly laboured for the safeguard of their selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The darknesse (I say) of the night letted their eyes to see him: And it was above nature, that a massie, heavy, and weighty body of a man (such as they understood their Master Christ to have) should walk, go upon, or be born up of the water of the raging Sea, and not sink. And finally, the horrour of the tempest, and great danger that they were in, perswaded them to look for none other, but certainly to be drowned.</p>
                  <p>And so all these three things concurring together, confirmed in them this imagination, <hi>That Christ Iesus, who came to their great comfort and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, was a fearfull and wicked spirit appearing to their destruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What here happened to Christ Jesus himself,<note place="margin">What chanced to Christ, that also in all ages chanceth to his holy Word.</note> that I might prove to have chanced, and daily to happen to the verity of his blessed Word in all ages from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>For as Christ himself in this their trouble, was judged and esteemed by his disciples at the first sight a spirit, or phantasticall body; so is the Truth and sincere Preaching of his glorious Gospel, sent by God for mans comfort, deliverance from sin, and quietnesse of conscience, when it is first offered, and truely preached, it is (I say) no lesse but judged to be heresie and deceivable doctrine, sent by the devill to mans destruction.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61872:295"/>The cause hereof is the dark ignorance of God, which in every age since the beginning so overwhelmed the world, that sometimes Gods ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Elect were in like blindenesse and errour with the reprobate: As <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was an Idolater; <hi>Moses</hi> was instructed in all the wayes of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; Paul</hi> a proud Pharisee, conjured against Christ and his Doctrine: And many in this same our age, when the Truth of God was offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, were sore afraid, and cryed against it, onely because the dark clouds of ignorance had troubled them before. But this matter I omit and let passe, till more opportunity.</p>
                  <p>The chief Note that I would have you well observe and mark in this preposterous fear of the disciples, is this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The fear is greatest, when deliverance is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>The more nigh deliverance and salvation approacheth, the more strong and vehement is the temptation of the Church of God. And the more nigh that Gods vengeance approacheth to the wicked, the more proud, cruell and arrogant are they.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereby it commonly cometh to passe, That the very messengers of life are judged and deemed to be the authors of all mischief: And this in many histories is evident. When God had appointed to deliver the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>Israelites</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moses</hi> from the tyranny of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> was sent to the presence of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for the same purpose, such was their affliction and anguish by the cruelty which newly was exercised over them,<note place="margin">Exod. 5, 6, &amp;c.</note> that with open mouthes they cursed <hi>Moses</hi> (and no doubt in their hearts they hated God who sent him) alleadging, That <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> was the whole cause of their last extreme trouble.</p>
                  <p>The like is to be seen in the Book of the Kings, both under <hi>Elisha</hi> and <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophets: For in the dayes of <hi>Ioram,</hi> sonne of <hi>Achab,</hi> was <hi>Samaria</hi> besieged by the King of <hi>Syria:</hi> In which <hi>Samaria</hi> no doubt (albeit the King and the most multitude were wicked) there was yet some members of Gods Elect Church, which were brought to such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme famine,<note place="margin">5 Reg. 7.</note> that not onely things of small price were sold beyond all measure; but also women against nature were compelled to eat their own children: In this same City <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet most commonly was most conversant and dwelt, by whose counsell and commandment, no doubt, the City was kept: For it appeareth, the King, to lay that to his charge, when he, hearing of the piteous complaint of the woman (who for hunger had eaten her own son) rent his clothes, with a solemne Oath and vow, That the head of <hi>Elisha</hi> should not stand upon his shoulders that day. If <hi>Elisha</hi> had not been of counsel, That the city should have been kept, Why should the King have more fumed against him, then against others? But whether he was the author of the defending the City or not, all is one to my purpose; for before the deliverance, was the Church in such extremity, that the chief Pastor of that time was sought to be killed by such as should have defended him.</p>
                  <p>The like is read of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who defending his City <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and resisting proud <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> no doubt obeying the counsell of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isai. 36, 37.</note> at length was so oppressed with sorrow and shame, by the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous words of <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> that he had no other refuge, but in the Temple of the Lord (as a man desperate and without comfort) to open

                  <p>After that the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was burnt and destroyed, the King led away prisoner,<note place="margin">Jerem. 42.</note> his sons and chief Nobles slain, and the whole ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God poured out upon the disobedient; yet there was left a remnant in the Land, to make use of and possesse the same, who called upon the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> to know concerning them the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God, Whether they should remain still in the Land of <hi>Iudea,</hi> as was appointed and permitted by the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> Or if they should depart and flie into <hi>Egypt</hi>: To certifie them of this their duty, they desire the Prophet to pray unto God for them: Who condescending and granting their Petition, promised to keep back nothing from them, which the Lord God should open unto him.<note place="margin">Reade the Text, Jer 42.</note> And they in like manner taking God to record and witnesse, made a solemn Vow, To obey whatsoever the Lord should answer unto him.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hereof it is plain, That many were departed from him, whom he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more then he did his enemies.</p>
                  <p>Many more testimonies might be brought, to declare how mightily Gods Word, spoken by man, hath wrought in the hearts of great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes: As in the hearts of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi>

of those three thousand who at <hi>Peters</hi> first Sermon openly made after Christs Ascension, acknowledged their offences, repented, and were soon after baptized.<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> But these premises are sufficient to prove, as well that Gods Word draweth his Elect after it, against worldly appearance, against naturall affections, and against evil Statutes and Constitutions; as also, That such as obey Gods speaking by his Ministers, never lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth just reward, and recompence: For onely such as obeyed the voyce of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Jerem. 32.</note> found favour and grace, to the praise and glory of Gods Name, when his just judgements took vengeance upon the disobedient. But now briefly by Notes we will touch the rest of <hi>Peters</hi> act, and Christs mercifull deliverance of him; which is the end of all troubles sustained by Gods Elect.</p>
                  <p>And first, That <hi>Peter</hi> seeing a mighty winde, was afraid, and so, when he began to sink, he cryed, <hi>Lord save me,</hi> are three things principally to be noted:
<list>
                        <item>The first, <hi>From whence cometh the fear of Gods Elect.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>The second, <hi>What is the cause that they faint and fall in adversity.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>The third, <hi>What resteth with them in the time of this fear and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinking.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>And first, it is plain, That so long as <hi>Peter</hi> had his eyes fixed upon Christ, and attended upon no other thing but the voyce of Christ, he was bold and without fear: But when he saw a mighty winde (not that the winde was visible, but the vehement storm and waves of the Sea that were stirred up and carried by the winde were seen) then began he to fear, and to reason (no doubt) in his heart, that better it had been for him to have remained in his Ship; for so might Christ have come to him: But now the storm and rage of winde was so vehement, that he could never come to Christ, and so he greatly feared. Whereof it is plain, That the onely cause of our fear that have left our Ship, and thorow the storms of the Sea would go to Christ with <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The cause of fear.</note> is, That we more consider the dangers and letts that are in our journey, then we do the Almighty power of him that hath commanded us to come to himself. And this is a sinne common to all the elect and chosen children of God, That whensoever they see a vehement trouble appearing to lett them, and drive them back from the obedience of God, then begin they to fear and to doubt of Gods power and good will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 12. Exod. 34. Isa. 36, 37.</note>With this fear was <hi>Abraham</hi> stricken, when he denied his wife. This storme saw <hi>Moses,</hi> when he refused to be Gods Messenger. And <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> sore complaint declareth, That more he believed, considered, and looked upon the proud voyces, and great power of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> then he did the promises of the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>This I note for this purpose, That albeit this late and most raging storm within the Realme of <hi>England</hi> have taken from you the presence of Christ for a time, so that you have doubted whether it was Christ which you saw before, or not. And albeit that the vehemency of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winde that would drive you from Christ have so employed your ears, that almost you have forgotten what he was who commanded you to come to himself,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> when that he cryed, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour

It had been your duty indeed, and agreeable to your profession, to have looked to Christ alone, and to have contemned all impediments; but such perfection is not alway with man, but happy is he that feeleth himself to sink.</p>
                  <p>The cause that Godt elect begin to faint and to sink down in the time of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> great adversitie, is fear and unbelief, as in <hi>Peter</hi> doth appear; for so long as he neither feared danger, neither mistrusted Christs word, so long as the waves (above, and contrary to their nature) did obey and serve his feet,<note place="margin">Lively faith maketh a man bold.</note> as they had been the drie, solid and sure ground: But so soon as he began to despair and fear, so soon began he to sink: To instruct us, That lively faith maketh man bold, and is able to carry us thorow such perils, as be uncapable to nature; But when faith beginneth to faint, then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth man to sink down in every danger; as in the Histories before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, it may appear,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 18.</note> and in the Prophets it is plain; for <hi>Elias</hi> at Gods Commandment passing to the presence of King <hi>Ahab,</hi> in the fervency of his faith, obtained the fire to come from heaven, and to consume his Sacrifice: by which also he was made so bold, that in the presence of the King he feared nothing to kill his false Prophets. But the same <hi>Elias</hi> hearing of the managing and threatnings of cursed <hi>Iezabel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3.

                     </note> and a readinesse and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse to obey his commandments; but it is like plain, That of long continuance there rested with <hi>Peter</hi> a desire of honor and worldly rest (and that moved him to perswade Christ that he should not die.<note place="margin">The vice that long rested with <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </note>) There rested with him pride,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> presumption, and a trust in himself; which presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vain trust in his own strength, unlesse it had been corrected, he had never been fit to have fed Christs flock:<note place="margin">

                     </note> And such sinnes can never be fully corrected or reformed, till they be felt, known, and confessed. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse so arrogant is our nature, that neither will it know nor confesse the



<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61872:302"/>
infirmitie of it self, untill such time as it hath a triall by manifest experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; This is most plain by <hi>Peter,</hi> long after this tempest; for when Christ said to his Disciples, <hi>This night shall ye all be slandered in me, Peter</hi> boldly bragged and said,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Albeit that all should be slandered, and should flie from thee, yet shall not I be slandered, but I am ready to go to prison, and to die with thee.</hi> This was a bold presumption, and an arrogant promise spoken in contempt of all his Brethren, from which he could not be reduced by Christs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, but the more that Christ shewed him, that he should deny him, the more bold was he to affirm the contrary; as though his Master Christ (the Author of all Trueth, yea rather trueth it self) should make a loud lie; and therefore of necessitie it was, that he should prove in experience what was the frailtie of mans nature, and what was the imbecillity and weaknesse of faith, even in those, that were his chief Apostles, which had continually heard his heavenly Doctrine, seen daily his wonderfull Miracles, which had heard themselves so many admonitions of him, which also had followed and obeyed him in many things. That imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and weaknesse of faith, if <hi>Peter</hi> had not proved and felt it in himself, neither could he rightly have praised Gods infinite goodnesse, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced his free mercy; neither had he been apt and meet to have been a a Pastor to the weak sheep and tender lambs of Christ, but he should have been as proud a contemner and dispiser of his weak brethren, as the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Papists, that contemn and dispise all godly and great learned men, though they be a thousand parts more excellent then they.<note place="margin">Why <hi>Peter</hi> was suffered to sink.</note> But to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and informe both presumptuous arrogancy and fraile imbecilitie and weaknesse of faith, <hi>Peter</hi> was permitted once to sink, and thrice most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to refuse and deny his Master, to the intent that by the knowledge of his own weaknesse, he might be the more able to instruct others of the same; and also that he might more largely magnifie Gods free grace and mighty deliverance: And that Christ taught him before his falling; saying,<note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> 
                     <hi>When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren:</hi> As though Christ should have said, <hi>Peter,</hi> yet art thou too proud to be a Pastor, thou canst not stoop nor bow thy back down to take up the weak sheep, thou doest not yet know thine own infirmitie and weaknesse, and therefore canst thou do nothing but despise the weak ones; but when thou shalt be instructed by experience of thine own self, what hid iniquitie lurketh within the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, then shalt thou learn to be humble, and stoop among other sinners; and also shalt be an example to others which after shall offend, as thou didst, so that if they repent as thou didst, they need not despaire of mercy, but may trust most assuredly of Christ to obtain grace, mercy and forgivenesse of sins, as thou didst.</p>
                  <p>This fruit have we to gather (dear Brethren) of <hi>Peters</hi> down-sinking in the sea, (which was a secret knowledge and privie admonition, that he after should deny Christ) that we are assured by the voice of Christ, if in the time of trouble and extreme danger we crie with <hi>Peter,</hi> we shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered as he was; and if we mourn for our deniall of Christ, as hee did, we shall finde the same grace and favour at Christs hand, that hee found.</p>
                  <p>But now let us touch the third Note, which is this, That with Gods

Elect in their greatest feare and danger there resteth some small sparke of faith, which by one means or other declareth it selfe, albeit the afflicted person in feare or danger, doth not presently perceive the same. As here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> is most cleare and manifest.<note place="margin">
                        <p>What resteth with Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in their greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>The nature of faith.</p>
                     </note> For, perceiving himself to sink down, he cryed, saying, <hi>Lord save me,</hi> which words were a declaration of a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and quick faith, which lay hid within his afflicted and sore perplexed heart, whose nature is (I mean of faith) to hope against hope, that is: against all appearance or likelihood to looke for help and deliverance, as the words of <hi>Peter</hi> witnesseth that he did. He saw nothing but the raging Sea ready to swallow him up. He felt nothing but himself sinking down in body, and sore troubled in heart, and yet he cryed: <hi>Lord save me.</hi> Which words first delare,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Peter</hi> knew the power and good will of God.</note> that he knew the power of Christ able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. For foolishnesse it had been to have called for the help of him whom he had known to be impotent and unable to help.</p>
                  <p>The calling for Christs help by prayer in this extream danger declared also that <hi>Peter</hi> had some hope through his gracious goodnesse to obtain deliverance. For in extream perils impossible it is, that the heart of man can cry for Gods help without some hope of his mercy.</p>
                  <p>It is also to be noted, that in his great jeopardy <hi>Peter</hi> murmureth not against Christ. Neither doth he impute or lay any crime or blame upon Christ, albeit, at his commandment he had left his Bote. He saith not: <hi>Why lettest thou me sinke, seeing that I have obeyed thy Commandment.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Peter</hi> asked help at Christ alone, of whom he was perswaded both could and would help at a pinch. He cryed not upon <hi>Abraham, Iacob, Moses, Samuel, David</hi>; Neither upon any other of the Patriarks, Prophets, or Saints departed: neither yet upon his own fellows in the Bote, but upon Christ, at whose commandment he had left the Bote.</p>
                  <p>All these things together considered, declare, that <hi>Peter</hi> in this his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame fear and danger had yet some sparke of faith (albeit in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent jeopardy he had neither consolation nor comfort.) For these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses are undoubted tokens that he had faith. But now to the end, which is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And immediately Iesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: O thou of little faith, wherefore diddest thou doubt. And when they were come into the ship, the winde ceased; And they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Sonne of God: And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly the ship was at the Land whither they went.</hi>

amongst the Lyons, To <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Whales Belly, to <hi>Peter</hi> in the prison, is likewise most evidently declared in the holy Scriptures.

                  <p>Albeit (I say) that sometimes they have fainted in their journey,<note place="margin">The sheep of Christ cannot be rent from his hand.</note> albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it that weaknesse in faith permitted them to sink, yet from the hand of Christ can they not be rent; he may not suffer them to drown, nor the deep to devour them:<note place="margin">Joh. 10.</note> But for the glory of his own Name he must deliver, for they are committed to his charge,<note place="margin">Joh. 7.</note> protection, and keeping; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must he keep and defend such as he hath received at his father, from sin, from death, from devil and hell.</p>
                  <p>The remembrance of these promises is to mine own heart such occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of comfort, as neither can any tongue nor pen expresse, but yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure some there is of Gods elect that cannot be comforted in this tempest, by any meditations of Gods election or defence, but rather beholding such as sometimes boldly have professed Christs Verity,<note place="margin">The temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods elect now in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> now to be returned to their accustomed abominations; And also themselves to be overcome with fear, that against their knowledge and conscience they stoup to an Idol, and with their presence maintaineth the same; and being at this point, they begin to reason, Whether it be possible that the members of Christs body may be permitted so horribly to fall to the denyall of their Head; and in the same to remain of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: And from this reasoning they enter in dolour, and from dolour, they begin to sink to the gates of hell; and Ports of despair.</p>
                  <p>The dolour and fear of such I grant to be most just: For oh how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is it, for the love of this transitory life, in the presence of man to deny Christ Jesus, and his known and undoubted Verity?</p>
                  <p>But yet to such as be not obstinate contemners of God, and of all godlinesse, I would give this my weak counsell, That rather they should appeal to mercy, then by the severe judgements of God to pronounce

Besides these, I say (of whom ye hear the brute) ye have been witnesse, That some within the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the same cause, most cruelly have been murthered, whose cause was never heard with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency; But murtherers sitting in the Seat of Justice, have shed the blood of Christs true Witnesses; which albeit did then appear to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed away with fire, yet it is resent in the presence of him for whose cause they did suffer, and ceaseth not to call for vengeance, with the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> to fall upon, not onely such as were immediate and next authors of that murther, but also upon all those that maintain those tyrants in their tyranny, or that do consent to their beastly cruelty, or that do not stop, having the power in hand.

Fearfull, I grant, is the sentence; yet it is most equall and just: For whosoever sheddeth the blood of any one of Christ Jesus his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,<note place="margin">Whosoever sheddeth the Blood of one of Christs members, for his Names sake, consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the blood of all that have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered since the beginning.</note> for professing of his Truth, consenteth to all the murther which hath been made since the beginning for that cause.

How soon a great man hath spoken the corruption of his minde, he hath his flatterers ready to applaud and confirm whatsoever he speaketh. And let the Princes be of what Religion they please, that is all one to the most part of men; so that with abnegation of God, of his honour, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they may retain the friendship of the Court.<note place="margin">Flatterers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contagious stilence.</note> But alas, how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable be Princes that so are abused, and how contageous a pestilence be such flatterers to Common-Wealths, Empires, and Realms, God hath declared even from the beginning, to paint out the mischief, which from them proceedeth to such as give ear unto them. The ancient Writers compare them to Harlots, to Ravens, and to most ravenous Beasts, and not without cause. For as Harlots can never abide, that their lovers should return to repentance and sobernesse of minde, so cannot flatterers sustain, that such as they deceive, shall come to right judgement. And as Ravens pike out the eyes of dead carions, and as ravenous Beasts devour the same, so do flatterers (being more cruell) pike at the eyes of living men, and blinding the eyes of their understanding, and judgement, do expose them to be devoured in body and soul, to Satan. This we have by prophane Writers onely, but the holy Spirit teacheth us this infallible Trueth, That where iniquitie reigneth in a Common-wealth, and none is found boldly and openly to reprehend the same, that there shall sudden vengeance and destruction follow.

                     <p>IN writing of this parcell, as I remembred the impediments which might call you back from God, and from his true obedience; so did I consider what occasion you had to tremble and to fear before his Majestie, and to undergo the losse of all the worldly glory, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the glory of God. I do consider, that your power is but borrowed, extraordinary, and unstable, for you have it but by permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others.<note place="margin">

                        </note> And seldom it is, that women do long raign with felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and joy. Your most especiall friends moreover, blinded by the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this World; yea, being drunken with the Cup of that <hi>Roman</hi> Harlot, are mortall enemies to Christ Jesus, and to his true Religion. These things may easily abash the minde of a Woman not confirmed by grace; But yet, if you will a little consider with me the causes why, that ye ought to hazard all for the glory of God in this behalf, the former terrours shall suddenly vanish. I do not esteem that thing greatest, which peradventure some others do: to wit, That if ye shall enterprise to innovate any thing in matters of Religion, that then ye shall lose your Authoritie, and also the favours of your carnall friends.</p>
                     <p>I look further, to wit, To the judgements of God, who hath begun already to declare himself angry with you, with your Seed, and Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; yea, with the whole Realm, above which it should have ruled. Impute not to fortune, that first your two sons were suddenly taken from you, within the space of six houres, and after your Husband, raft as it were, by violence, from life and honour; the memoriall of his name,<note place="margin">

And so I say, That with himself was buried, his name, succession, and royall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, as he himself did apprehend in dying; And in this, If ye espy not the anger and hot displeasure of GOD (threatning you and the rest of your Posteritie with the same plague) ye are more obstinate, then I would wish you to be.<note place="margin">

                     <p>I answer, The maintenance, and defence of most horrible Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with the shedding of the blood of the Saints of God, who laboured to notifie and rebuke the same. This I say, (other iniquities omitted) is such a crime before the eyes of his Majestie, That for the same, he hath poured forth his extreme vengenance upon Kings, and upon their Posteritie, depriving them from honours and dignitie for ever; As by the Histories of the Books of the Kings is most evident. To <hi>Ieroboam</hi> it is said, <hi>Because I have exalted thee from the midst of the people, and have made thee Prince over my people</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Israel, <hi>I have rent the Kingdom from the house of</hi> David, <hi>for Idolatry also, and have given it unto thee,</hi>

                        <hi>but thou hast not been as</hi> David <hi>my servant, &amp;c. But thou hast done wickedly above all that have gone before thee; For thou hast made to thee, other gods, and molten images, to provoke me, and hast cast me behinde thy back; Therefore shall I bring affliction upon the house of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>and I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy to</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>all that pisseth against the Wall (signifying thereby the Male children) and shall cast forth the Posteritie of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>as dung is cast forth, till it be consumed.</hi>

                     <p>This sentence was not onely executed against this Idolater, but also against the rest of Idolaters in that Realm, as they succeeded one after another, for to <hi>Baasa,</hi> whom God used as an Instrument to root out the seed of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> it is said: <hi>Because thou hast walked in the way of</hi> Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, <hi>and hast caused my people to sin, that thou shouldest provoke me in their sins; therefore shall I cut down the posteritie of</hi> Baasa, <hi>and the posterity of his house, and shall make thy house as the house of</hi> Jeroboam. <hi>He that shall die to</hi> Baasa <hi>in the City, him shall dogs eat; and be that shall die in the field, him shall the fowls devour:</hi>

                     <p>By these examples, you may evidently espy, That Idolatry is the cause, why God destroyeth the posteritie of Princes; not onely of those that first invent abominations, but also of such as follow and defend the same.

If further ye shall consider, that God will do nothing touching the punishment of Realms and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he will not reveale to his servants the Prophets, whose tongues he will compell to speak somtimes contrary to the appetites and desires of their own hearts,<note place="margin">Zach 15</note> and whose words he will perform, be they never so unapparent to the judgement of men,<note place="margin">James 5. 1 Reg 17. 1 Reg. 18.</note> If these ye do deeply weigh, then will ye fear the thing, which presently is not seen. <hi>Elias</hi> was but a man, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doth witnesse, like to his Brethren, and yet at his prayer was <hi>Achab</hi> the Idolater,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 19.</note> and all Israel with him punished three yeares and six moneths, God shutting up the heaven, that neither rain nor dew fell upon the earth the space afore written. And in the end, God so wrought by him,<note place="margin">2 Reg 9.</note> that <hi>Baals</hi> Priests were first confounded, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter justly punished. And albeit that <hi>Iesabel</hi> sought his blood, and by oath had determined his death,<note place="margin">1 Reg 19.</note> yet as she was frustrate of her intent, so could she not keep her own bones from the dogs, which punishment, the Prophet (God so ruling his tongue) had before appointed to that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked woman. Albeit Madam, that the Messengers of God are not sent this day with visible miracles, because they teach none other doctrine then that which is confirmed with miracles from the beginning of the world: yet will not he (who hath promised to take charge over his poor and little flock, to the end) suffer the contempt of their Embassage, escape punishment and vengeance. For the truth it self hath said: <hi>He that heareth you,</hi>

And in this quarrell I present my self against all the Papists in the Realm, desiring none other Armour but Gods holy Word, and the liberty of my tongue. God move your heart to understand my Petition, to know the truth, and unfeinedly to follow the same, <hi>Amen.</hi>

I dare not deny (lest that in so doing I should be injurious to the Giver) but that God hath revealed unto me, secrets unknown to the world, and also that he hath made my tongue a Trumpet to forewarn Realms &amp; Nations, yea, certain great revelations of mutations and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, when no such things were feared, nor yet was appearing; a portion whereof cannot the world deny, (be it never so blinde) to be fulfilled; and the rest (alas) I fear shall follow with greater haste, and in more full perfection then my

sorrowfull heart desireth: Nothwithstanding these revelations and assurances, I did ever abstain to commit any thing to writing, contented onely to have obeyed the charge of him, who commanded me to crie. If any then will ask to what purpose this onely Sermon is set forth, and greater matters omitted; I answer, to let such as Sathan hath not altogether blinded so, upon how small occasions, great offence is now conceived, This Sermon is it, for the which (from my Bed) I was called before the Councell, and after long reasoning, I was by some forbidden to Preach in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> so long as the King and Queen were in Town; This Sermon is it that so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth such as would please Court, and will not appear to be enemies to the Truth, yet they dare affirm, That I exceeded the bounds of Gods Messenger: I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faithfully committed unto writing whatsoever I could remember might have been offensive in that Sermon, to the end, That as well the enemies of Gods truth, as the professors of the same, may either note unto me wherein I have offended, or at the least cease to condemn me before they have convinced me by Gods manifest Word. If any man think it easie unto me to mitigate by my pen the inconsiderate sharpnesse of my Tongue, and so cannot men freely judge of that my Sermon; I answer, That I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so impudent, that I will studie to abuse the world in this great light, neither yet so void of the fear of my God, that I will avow a lie in his own presence; and no lesse do I esteem it to be a lie, To deny or conceale that which in his Name I have once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, then to affirm, That God hath spoken, when his Word assures me not of the same; for in the publike place I consult not with flesh and blood wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At that Sermon were auditors unto me, not onely professors of the truth, and such as favour me, but rank Papists, dissembling Hypocrites, and no small number of covetous Clawbacks of the new Court; now I will appeal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of them all, as they will answer in the presence of the Eternall God, that either they bear me record, now writing the truth, or else note unto me the sentences offensive then by me pronounced, and now omitted in writing; for in Gods presence I protest, That so far as memory would serve me, I have written more vehemently then in the action I spake and pronounced; but of purpose I have omitted perswasions and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which then were made <hi>Quaedam hîc desunt.</hi>

away captives; and finally, the whose seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> razed, as it were, from the face of the earth: The Prophet (I say) fearing these horrible ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, doth,<note place="margin">The dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> as it were, sometimes suffer himself, and the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Charge, to be carryed away with the violence of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, without further resistance; then by pouring forth his and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous complaints before the Majestie of God; as in the 13, 17, and 18 verse of this present Text we may reade. At other times he valiantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the desperate tempest, and pronounceth the fearfull destruction of all such as trouble the Church of God; which he pronounceth, that God will multiply,<note place="margin">

                     </note> even in such time as when it appeareth utterly to be exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate. But because there is no small rest to the whole Body, till that the Head returne to judgement, he calleth the afflicted to patience, and promiseth such a Visitation, as whereby the wickednesse of the wicked shall be disclosed, and finally recompenced in their own bosoms.</p>
                  <p>These are the chiefest Points of which by the grace of God we intend more largely at this present to speak:</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Verse 23.</note> the Prophet saith, <hi>O Lord our God, other lords besides thee have ruled us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, no doubt, is the beginning of the dolorous complaint in the which he complaineth of the unjust tyranny that the poor afflicted <hi>Israelites</hi> sustained, during the time of their Captivity. True it is, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was gathered to his fathers in peace, before that this apprehended the people: For a hundred yeers after his decease, was not the people led away captive: Yet he fore-seeing the assurance of the calamity, did before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand endite and dictate unto them the complaint that after they should make. But at the first sight it appeareth, That the complaint hath but small weight: For what new thing was it, that other lords then God in his own person ruled them, seeing that such had been their Regiment from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning? For who knoweth not that <hi>Moses, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> the Judges, <hi>Samuel, David,</hi> and other godly Rulers, were men, and not God; And so other lords then God, ruled them in their greatest prosperity.</p>
                  <p>For the better understanding of this complaint,<note place="margin">From whenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> all Authority floweth.</note> and of the minde of the Prophet, we must first observe from whence all Authority floweth; and secondly, To what end Powers are appointed by God: The which two points being discussed, we shall the better understand, what lords, and what authority rules beside God; and who they are in whom God and his mercifull presence rules.</p>
                  <p>The first is resolved to us by the words of the Apostle, saying, <hi>There is no Power but of God. David</hi> bringeth in the Eternall God, speaking to Judges and Rulers,<note place="margin">Psal. 82.</note> saying, <hi>I have said, Ye are gods, and Sons of the Most High.</hi> And <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the person of God, affirmeth the same, saying, <hi>By me Kings raigne, and Princes discern the things that are just.</hi> Of which place it is evident, That it is neither Birth, influence of Stars, election of people, force of Arms; nor finally, whatsoever can be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the power of nature, that maketh the distinction betwixt the superiour power and the inferiour, or that doth establish the Royall Throne of Kings, but it is the onely and perfect Ordinance of God, who willeth his Terrour, Power, and Majestie in a part to shine in the Thrones



<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61872:317"/>
of Kings, and in the faces of Judges, and that for the profit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of man; So that whosoever would studie to deface that order of Regiment that God hath established, and by his holy Word allowed, and bring in such a confusion, as no difference should be betwixt the upper Powers and the subjects, doth nothing but evert and turne upside downe the very Throne of God, which he will to be fixed here upon earth; as in the end and cause of this Ordinance more plainly shall appear: which is the second Point we have to observe, for the better understanding of the Prophets words and minde.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2.

                  </p>
                  <p>Of which words, it is evident, That the sword of God is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the hand of man,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> to use as it pleaseth him, but onely to punish vice, and maintain vertue, that men may live in such society, as before God is acceptable. And this is the very and onely cause, why God hath appointed powers in this Earth.</p>
                  <p>For such is the furious rage of mans corrupt nature, That unlesse severe punishment were appointed, and put in execution upon malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; Better it were, that man should live among brute and wilde Beasts, then among men. But at this present, I dare not enter into the description of this common place; for so should I not satisfie the Text, which by Gods grace I purpose to absolve. This onely by the way, I would that such as are placed in Authority, should consider, Whether they raign and rule by God, so that God ruleth them or if they rule without, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, and against God, of whom our Prophet here doth complain.</p>
                  <p>If any list to take tryall of this point, it is not hard: For <hi>Moses</hi> in the election of Judges,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> and of a King, describeth, not onely, what persons shall be chosen to that honour, but doth also give to him that is elected and chosen, the rule by the which he shall try himself, whether God raign in him or not, saying: When he shall sit upon the throne of his Kingdom, he shall write to himself an examplar of this Law, in a Book by the Priests and Levites; it shall be with him, and he shall read therein, all the dayes of his life, That he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all the words of this Law, and these Statutes, that he may do them, that his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren, and that he turn not from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Josh. 1.</note>The same is repeated to <hi>Ioshuah</hi> in his inanguration to the Regiment of the people by God himself, saying; Let not the Book of this Law depart from thy mouth, but meditate in it day and night, that thou mayst keep it, and do according to all that which is written in it. For then shall thy way be prosperous, and thou shalt do prudently.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:61872:317"/>The first thing then that God craveth of him that is called to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a King, is, <hi>The knowledge of his Will revealed in his Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second is,<note place="margin">What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a King or Prince.</note> 
                     <hi>An upright and willing minde to put in execution such things as God commandeth in his Law, without declining to the right, or to the left hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Kings then have not an absolute Power to do in their Regiment what pleaseth them;<note place="margin">The Authority and Power of Kings is limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> but their Power is limited by Gods Word: So that if they strike where GOD hath not commanded, they are but murtherers; and if they spare where GOD hath commanded to strike, they and their Throne are criminall and guilty of the wickednesse that aboundeth upon the face of the earth, for lack of punishment.</p>
                  <p>O that Kings and Princes would consider what account shall be cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> as well of their ignorance and misknowledge of Gods Will, as for the neglecting of their Office. But now to returne to the words of the Prophet. In the person of the whole people he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain unto God, That the <hi>Babilonians</hi> (whom he calleth, <hi>Other lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides</hi> God, both because of their ignorance of God, and by reason of their cruelty and inhumanity) had long ruled over them in great rigour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pity or compassion had upon the ancient men, and famous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons: For they being mortall enemies to the people of God, fought by all meanes to aggravate their yoke, yea, utterly to have exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the memory of them, and of their Religion; from the face of the earth.</p>
                  <p>After the first part of this dolorous complaint, the Prophet declareth the Protestation of the people, saying, <hi>Neverthelesse in thee shall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy Name:</hi> (others reade it, <hi>But we will remember thee onely, and thy Name:</hi>) But in the Hebrew there is no Conjunction Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in that sentence. The minde of the Prophet is plaine, to wit, That notwithstanding the long sustained affliction, the people of God declined not to a false and vain Religion, but remembred God, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time appeared to them in his mercifull presence; which albeit then they saw not, yet would they still remember his Name, that is, They would call to minde the Doctrine and Promise which at sometimes they heard, albeit in their prosperity they did not sufficiently glorifie God, who so mercifully ruled in the midst of them. The temptation, no doubt, of the Israelites, was great in those dayes: They were carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was to them the gage and pledge of Gods favour towards them; for it was the inheritance that God promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his seed for ever. The League and Covenant of Gods Protection, appeared to have been broken: They lamentably complain, That they saw not their accustomed signes of Gods mercifull presence; The true Prophets were few, and the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations used in <hi>Babylon</hi> were exceeding many: And so it might have appeared to them, That in vain it was, that they were called the Posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or that ever they had received the Law, or Forme of right Religion from God. That we may the better feel it in our selves, the temptation, I say, was even such, as if God should utterly destroy all Order and Policie that this day is within his Church, that the



<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61872:318"/>
true preaching of the Word should be suppressed, The right use of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments abolished, Idolatry and Papisticall abomination erected up again; And therewith, That our bodies should be taken prisoners by Turks or other manifest enemies of God, and of all godlinesse. Such, I say, was their temptation; How notable, then is this their confession, that in bondage they make, to wit, That they will remember God onely, albeit, he hath appeared to turn his face from them, They will remember his name, and will call to minde the deliverance promised.</p>

                        <hi>Usc.</hi>
                     </note>Hereof have we to consider, what is our duty, If God bring us (as for our offences and unthankfulnesse justly he may) to the like extremity. This confession is not the fair flattering words of hypocrites, lying and bathing in their pleasures, but it is the mighty operation of the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">The duty of Gods people.</note> who leaveth not his own destitute of some comfort, in their most desperate calamities. This is then our duty, not onely to confesse our God in time of peace and quietnesse, but he chiefly craveth, that we avow him in the midst of his, and our enemies. And this is not in us to do, but it behoveth, That the Spirit of God work in us, above all power of nature. And thus we ought earnestly, to meditate before the battell rise more vehement, which appeareth not to be far off. But now must we enter in somewhat more deeply to consider these judgements of God.</p>
                  <p>This people dealt with all, as we have heard, was the onely people upon the face of the Earth, to whom God was rightly known; among them onely were his Laws, Statutes, Ordinances, and Sacrifices used, and put in practise; They onely invocated his Name, and to them alone had he promised his protection and assistance: What then should be the cause, that he should give them over into this great reproach, and bring them into such extremity, as his own name, in them, should be blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that saw this horrible destruction fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> put in just execution, giveth an answer in these words, <hi>I gave unto them Laws that were good,</hi>

                     <hi>in the which, Whosoever should walk, should live in them; But they would not walk in my wayes, but rebelled against me; And therefore, I have given unto them Laws that are not good, and Iudgements, in the which they shall not live.</hi> The Writers of the Books of Kings, and Chronicles, declare this in more plain words, saying: <hi>The Lord sent unto them his Prophets, rising early, desiring of them to return unto the Lord, and to amend their wicked wayes</hi> (for he would have spared his people, and his Tabernacle) <hi>but they mocked his servants, and would not return unto the Lord their God to walk in his wayes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Reg. 17.</note> Yea, <hi>Iudah</hi> it self kept not the precepts of the Lord God, but walked in the Manners and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of <hi>Israel</hi>; That is, Of such as then had declined to Idolatry from the dayes of <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> And therefore, the Lord God abhorred the whole seed of <hi>Israel,</hi> that is, The whole body of the people, he promised them, and gave them into the hands of those that spoiled them, and so he cast them out from his presence.</p>
                  <p>Hereof it is evident, That their disobedience unto God, and unto the voices of his Prophets, was the cause of their destruction. Now, have we to take heed how we should use the good Laws of God, that is, his Will revealed unto us in his Word, and that Order of Justice, that by him,

for the comfort of man is established amongst men. It is no doubt, but that obedience is the most acceptable sacrifice unto God, and that which above all things he requireth; That when he manifesteth himselfe by his word, that men follow according to their vocation and commandment. Now so it is, that God by that great Pastor, our Lord Jesus, now manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his word calleth us from all impiety, as well of body, as of mind, to holinesse of life, and to his spirituall service: And for this purpose, he hath erected the throne of his mercy among us, the true preaching of his word, together with the right administration of his Sacraments: But what is our obedience, let every man examine his own conscience, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what statutes and lawes we would have to be given unto us.</p>
                  <p>Wouldst thou, O <hi>Scotland,</hi> have a King to raign over thee in justice, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and mercy? subject thou thy selfe to the Lord thy God, obey his commandments, and magnifie thou that word that calleth unto thee, <hi>This is the way,</hi>

                     <hi>walke into it,</hi> and if thou wilt not, flatter not thy self, the same justice remaineth this day in God to punish thee <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thee <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in especiall, that before punished the land of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and the City of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Every Realm or Nation (saith the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi>) that likewise offendeth,<note place="margin">Jere. 9.</note> shall be likewise punished. But if thou shalt see impiety placed in the seat of justice above thee, so that in the Throne of God (as <hi>Salomon</hi> doth complain) raigneth nothing but fraud,<note place="margin">Eccles 3.</note> &amp; violence, accuse thy own ingratitude and rebellion against God, for that is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause,<note place="margin">Isa. 3.</note> why God taketh away (as the same Prophet in another place doth speak) the strong man and the man of war, the Judge and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the prudent and the aged, the Captain and the honourable, the Counsellor and the cunning Artificer. And I will appoint, saith the Lord, children to be their Princes, and babes shall rule over them. Children are extortioners of my people, and women have rule over them.</p>
                  <p>If these calamities, I say, apprehend us, so that we see nothing but the oppression of good men, and of all godlinesse, and wicked men without God, to reigne above us; Let us accuse and condemn our selves, as the onely cause of our own miseries. For if we had heard the voyce of the Lord our God, &amp; given upright obedience unto the same, God should have multiplyed our peace, &amp; should have rewarded our obedience before the eyes of the world. But now let us hear what the Prophet saith further.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The dead shall not live,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> 
                     <hi>saith he, neither shall the tyrants, or the dead arise, because thou hast visited and scattered them, and destroyed all their memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this 14 verse, unto the end of the 19, it appeareth, That the Prophet observeth no order; yea, that he speaketh things directly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one to another: For first he saith, <hi>The dead shall not live:</hi> After, he affirmeth,<note place="margin">Verse 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy dead men shall live.</hi> Secondly, he saith, <hi>Thou hast visited and scattered them, and destroyed all their memory:</hi> Immediately after he saith, <hi>Thou hast increased thy Nation, O Lord, thou hast increased thy Nation.</hi> They have vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited thee, and have poured forth a prayer before thee.</p>
                  <p>Who, I say, would not think, that these are things not onely spoken forth of good order and purpose, but also manifestly repugning one to another. For, to live, and not to live, to be so destroyed that no memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall remaineth; and to be so increased, that the coasts of the earth shalbe

replenished, seem to import plain contradiction. For removing of this doubt, and for better understanding of the Prophets minde, we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the Prophet had to do with divers sorts of men; he had to do with the conjured and manifest enemies of Gods people, the <hi>Caldees</hi> or <hi>Babylonians</hi>; even so such as professe CHRIST JESUS, have to doe with the <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Sarazens.</hi> He had to doe with the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereof there were three sorts. The ten Tribes all degenerate from the true worshipping of GOD, and corrupted with Idolatry, as this day are our pestilent Papists in all Realms and Nations, there rested onely the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where the form of true Religion was observed, the Law taught, and Ordinances of God outwardly kept; but yet there were in that body (I mean, in the body of the visible Church) a great number that were Hypocrites, as this day yet are among us that do professe the Lord Jesus, and have refused Papistrie; not a few that were licentious livers, some that turned their backe to God; that is, Had for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And first (after the first part of the complaint of the afflicted, as we have heard in vehemency of spirit) he bursteth forth against all the proud ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Gods people, against all such as trouble them, and against all such as mock and forsake God, and saith, <hi>The dead shall not live, the proud Giants shall not rise, thou hast scattered them, and destroyed their memoriall.</hi> In which words he fighteth against the present temptation and dolorous state of Gods people, and against the insolent pride of such as oppressed them; as if the prophet should say, O ye troublers of Gods people, howsoever it appeareth to you in this your bloody rage,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>

                  <p>Hereof have the Tyrants their admonition, and the afflicted Church inestimable comfort; The Tyrants that do oppresse, shall receive the same end that they did which have passed before; that is, They shall die and fall with shame, without hope of resurrection, as is foresaid, not, That they shall not arise to their own confusion and just condemnation; but, that they shall not recover power to trouble the servants of God, neither yet shall the wicked arise (as <hi>David</hi> saith) in the Councell of the Just: Now have the wicked their Councells, their Thrones, and finally hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (for the most part) of all things that are upon the face of the earth; but the poor servants of God are reputed unworthy of mens presence, envyed, mocked; yea, they are more vile before these proud Tyrants, then is the very dirt and mire that is trodden under foot: But in that glorious

The remembrance hereof ought to make us patient in the dayes of affliction, and so to comfort us, that when we see Tyrants in their blinde rage, tread under foot the Saints of God, that utterly we despaire not, as if there were neither Wisdome, Justice nor Power above in the Heavens to represse such Tyrants, and to redresse the dolours of rhe unjustly afflicted; No bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let us be assured that the right hand of the Lord will change the state of things that be most desperate: In our God there is Wisdome and Power in a moment, to change the joy and mirth of our enemies, into everlasting mourning, and our sorrows into joy and gladnesse that shall have no end.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore in these apparent calamities (and marvell not that I say calamities apparent, for he that seeth not a fire begun, that shall burn more then we look for, unlesse God of his mercy quench it, is more then blinde,) not bee discouraged, but with unfained repentance, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Lord our God, let us accuse and condemne our former negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and stedfastly depend upon his promised deliverance, so shall our temporall sorrows be converted into everlasting joy. The doubt that might be moved concerning the destruction of those whom God exalteth, shall be discussed, if time will suffer, after that we have passed thorowout the Text; now proceedeth the Prophet, and saith;

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these words the Prophet giveth consolation to the afflicted, assuring them, That how horrible soever that desolation should be, yet should the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> be so multiplied, that it should replenish the coasts of the earth; yea, that God should be more glorified in their affliction, then he was during the time of their prosperitie: This promise (no doubt) was incredible when it was made, for who could have been perswaded, That the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should have been the meanes whereby the Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> should have beene increased, seeing that much rather it appeared, That the overthrow of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should have been the very abolishing of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>: But we must consider, to what end it was that God revealed himself to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and what is contained in the promise of the multiplication of his Seed, and the benediction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised thereto.</p>
                  <p>First, God revealed himself to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that by the means of his Word; to let all flesh after understand, That God first called man, and revealed himself unto him,<note place="margin">Josh 24.</note> that <hi>flesh can do nothing but rebell against God</hi>; for <hi>Abraham</hi> (no doubt) was an Idolater before that God called him from <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Caldees</hi>; The Promise was made, <hi>That the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>should be multiplyed as the Stars of heaven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom 9.</note> 
                     <hi>and as the sand of the sea</hi>; which is



<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61872:319"/>
not simply to be understood of his naturall Seed, as though it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times greatly increased; but rather of such as should become the spirituall Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh; Now if we be able to prove, That the right knowledge of God, his Wisdom, Justice, Mercy and Power, was more amply declared in their captivity, then ever it was at any time before, then can we not deny, but that God (even when to mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had utterly rased them from the face of the earth) did increase the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> so that he was glorified in them, and did extend the Coasts of the earth for their habitation. And for the better undestanding hereof, let us shortly trie the Histories, from their Captivitie to their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and after the same, to the comming of the <hi>Messias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is no doubt, but that Sathan intended by the dispersion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> so to have prophaned the whole Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that among them should neither have remained the true knowledge of God, nor yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sanctification; but that all should have come to a like contempt of God:<note place="margin">Dan. 1.</note> For I pray you, for what purpose was it, that <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellows were taken into the Kings Court, were commanded to be fed at the Kings Table, and were put to the Schools of their Divines, Southsayers and Astrologians? It may be thought that it proceeded of the Kings hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and of a zeal that he had, that they should be brought up in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and good learning; and I doubt not but it was so understood of a great number of the <hi>Iews</hi>; but the secret practise of the Devill was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he refused to defile himself with the Kings meat, which was forbidden to the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Law of their GOD. Well, God beginneth shortly after to shew himself mindefull of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made by his Prophet, and to trouble <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himselfe, by shewing to him a vision in his dream, which did the more trouble him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not forget the terror of it; neither yet could he remember what the Vision and the parcels thereof were: Whereupon were called all Divines, Interpreters of dreams, and Southsayers, of whom the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, If they could let him understand what he had dreamed; But while that they answer, That such a question used not to be demanded of any Southsayer or Magician, for the resolution thereof onely appertained to the gods, whose habitation was not with men; the charge was given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they all should be slain;<note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> and amongst the rest <hi>Daniel</hi> was sought (whose innocency the Devill envyed) to have suffered the same judgement: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth, and asketh time to disclose that secret; (I onely touch the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, to let you see by what means God increaseth his knowledge) which being granted, the vision is revealed unto him, he sheweth the same unto the King, with the true interpretation of it; adding, That the knowledge thereof came not from the Stars, but onely from the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who onely was, and is, the true God: which thing understood, the King burst forth in his confession, saying, <hi>Of a truth your God is the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of all gods, and he is Lord of Kings, and onely he that revealeth the secrets, seeing that thou couldest open this secret.</hi> And when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> after that, puffed up in pride by the counsell of his wicked Nobilitie, would make an Image, before the which he would that all Tongues and Nations, subject to him, should make adoration, and that <hi>Sydrack, Meshack</hi> and



<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61872:320"/>
                     <hi>Abednago</hi>; would not obey his unjust commandment, and so were cast in the flaming furnace of fire; and yet by Gods Angels, were so preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that no smell of fire remained in their persons nor garments: This same King giveth a more notable confession, saying, <hi>The Lord God of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drack, Misack and Abednago, is to be praised, who hath sent his Angels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his worshippers, that put trust in him, who have done against the Kings commandment, who have rather given their own bodies to torment, then that they would worship another God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>except their own God. By me therefore, is there made a decree, That whosoever shall blaspheme the God of Sydrack<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Misack and Abednago, that he shall be cut in pieces, and his house shall be made detestable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we see how God began, even almost in the beginning of their Captivity, to notifie his name, to multiply his knowledge, and set forth as well his power, as his wisedom, and true worshipping, by those that were taken prisoners; yea, that were despised, and of all men contemned, So that the name and fear of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was never before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to so many Realmes and Nations. This wondrous work of God proceeded from one Empire to another: For <hi>Daniel,</hi> being promoted to great honour by <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> falleth into a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate danger;<note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> For he was committed to prison among Lyons, because that he was deprehended, breaking the Kings Injunction; not that the King desired the destruction of Gods servants, but because the corrupt Idolaters, that in hatred of <hi>Daniel</hi> had procured that Law to be made, urged the King against his Nature; but God by his Angel, did stop the Lyons mouths, and so preserved his servant: Which considered with the sudden destruction of <hi>Daniels</hi> enemies, by the same Lyons, King <hi>Darius,</hi> besides his own confession, wrote to all people, tongues, and nations after this form; <hi>It is decreed by me, That in all the dominions of my Kingdom, men shall fear and reverence the God of Daniel, because he is the living God, abiding for ever; whose Kingdom shall not be destroyed, and his dominion remaineth, who saveth and delivereth, and sheweth signes and wonders in Heaven and in Earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the Lyons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This knowledge was yet further increased, in the dayes of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who giving freedom to the Captives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to return to their own Native Country, giveth this confession; Thus saith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the King of <hi>Persians, All the Kingdoms of the Earth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Esd 2.</note> 
                     <hi>hath the Lord God of Heaven given unto me, and hath commanded me, that a house be built to him in Ierusalem, which is in Iuda. Whosoever therefore of you, that are of his people, Let the Lord his God be with him, and let him passe up to Ierusalem, and let him build the house of the Lord God of Israel; for he onely is God, that is in Ierusalem.</hi> Time will not suffer me to intreat the points of this confession, neither yet did I for that purpose adduce the History; But onely, to let us see how constantly God kept his promise in increasing of his people, and in augmenting of his true knowledge, when that both they that were the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that Religion which they professed, appeared utterly to have been extinguished, above mens expectation; I say, he brought freedom out of bondage, light out of darknesse, and life out of death. I am not ignorant, that the building of the Temple, and reparation of the Walls



<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61872:321"/>
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were long stayed, so that the work had many enemies; But so did the hand of God prevail in the end, That a decree was made by <hi>Darius</hi> (by him I suppose, that succeeded to <hi>Cambises</hi>) not onely that all things necessary for the building of the Temple, and for the Sacrifices that were to be there brent,<note place="margin">1 Esd 6.</note> should be ministred upon the Kings charges; but also, That whosoever should hinder that work, or change that decree, that a balk should be taken out of his house, and that he should be hanged thereupon; yea, that his house should be made a dunghill; and thereto, he addeth a Prayer,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A Prayer.</hi>
                     </note> saying, <hi>The God of Heaven, who hath placed his Name there, root out every King, and People (O that Kings and Nations should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand) that shall put his hand, either to change, or to hurt this house of God, that is in Ierusalem.</hi> And so, in despight of Sathan, was the Temple builded, the walls repaired, and the City inhabited, and in the most desperate dangers it was preserved, till that the <hi>Messias</hi> promised, the glory of the second Temple, came, manifested himself to the world, suffered and rose againe, according to the Scriptures: And so, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his Gospel from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> did replenish the earth with the true knowledge of God; and so did God in perfection encrease the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the spirituall Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, dear brethren, we have no small consolation, if the state of all things be this day rightly considered; we see in what fury and rage the world, for the most part, is now raised, against the poor Church of Jesus Christ, unto the which he hath proclaimed liberty, after the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bondage of that Spirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the which we have been holden captives longer space, then <hi>Israel</hi> was prisoner in <hi>Babylon</hi> it self: For if we shall consider, upon the one part, the multitude of those that live wholly without Christ; and upon the other part, the blinde rage of the pestilent Papists, What shall we think of the small number of them that do professe Christ Jesus, but that they are as a poor sheep, already seized in the claws of the Lyon? yea, that they, and the true Religion which they professe, shall in a moment utterly be consumed?</p>
                  <p>But against this fearfull temptation, let us be armed with the Promise of God, to wit, That he will be the Protector of his Church; yea, That he will multiply it, even when to mans judgement it appeareth utterly to be exterminate. This Promise hath our God performed, in the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, in preservation of it, when Sathan laboured utterly to have destroyed it, in deliverance of the same, as we have heard, from <hi>Babylon.</hi> He hath sent his son Christ Jesus, clad in our flesh, who hath tasted of all our infirmities (sin except) who hath promised to be with us to the end of the world. He hath further kept Promise, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, yea, in the restitution of his glorious Gospel; Shall we then think that he will leave his Church destitute in this most dangerous age? Onely let us stick to his Truth, and study to conform our lives to the same, and he shall multiply his knowledge, and encrease his people. But now let us hear what the Prophet saith more.</p>

True it is, That such obedience deserveth small praise before men, for who can praise, or accept that in good part, which cometh as it were of meer compulsion; and yet rare it is, that any of Gods children do give unfained obedience, untill the hand of God turn them; For if quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and prosperity, make them not utterly to forget their duty, both towards God and man, as <hi>David</hi> for a season, yet it maketh them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, insolent, and in many things unmindefull of those things that God chiefly craveth of them; which imperfection espied, and the danger that thereof might ensue, our heavenly Father visiteth the sins of his children, but in the rod of his mercy, by the which they are moved to return to their God, to accuse their former negligence, and to promise better obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in all times hereafter; as <hi>David</hi> confesseth, saying, <hi>Before I fell in affliction, I went astray, but now will I keep thy Statutes.</hi>

                  <p>But yet for the better understanding of the Prophets minde, we may consider how God doth visite man, and how man doth visite God, and what difference there is, betwixt the visitation of God upon the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and his visitation upon the chosen.</p>
                  <p>God sometimes visiteth the reprobate in his hot displeasure, pouring upon them his plagues for their long rebellion; as we have heard before, that he visited the proud, and destroyed their memory. Other times, God is said to visite his people being in affliction, to whom he sendeth comfort, or promise of deliverance, as he did visite the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> being oppressed in <hi>Egypt:</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> saith, That God had visited his people, and sent unto them hope of deliverance, when <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist was borne. But of none of these visitations speaketh our Prophet here, but of that onely which we have already touched, to wit, when that God layeth his correction upon his own children, to call them from the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Breasts of this corrupt world, that they suck not in over-great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance the poyson thereof; and doth, as it were, wean them from their mothers Paps, that they may learn to receive other nourishment. True it is, That this weaning (or spaning, as we terme it) from worldly pleasure, is a thing strange to the flesh, and yet it is a thing so necessary to Gods children, that unlesse they be weaned from the pleasures of the world, they can never feed upon that delectable Milk of Gods eternall verity; For the corruption of the one, doth either hinder the other to be received, or else so troubleth the whole powers of man, that the soul can never so digest the truth of God, as that he ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Albeit this appeareth hard, yet it is most evident; For what liquor can we receive from the Breasts of the world, but that which is in the world, what that is, the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.</note> saying; <hi>Whatsoever is in the world, is either the lusts of the eyes, the lusts of the flesh, or the pride of life.</hi>



                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:61872:322"/>
Now seeing that these are not of the Father, but of the world, how can it be, that our souls can feed upon chastitie, temperance, and humility, so long, as that our stomacks are replenished with the corruption of these vices?</p>
                  <p>Now so it is, that willingly, flesh can never refuse these forenamed, but rather still delighteth it self in every one of them; yea, in them all, as the examples are but too evident.</p>
                  <p>It behoveth therefore, that God himself shall violently pull his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from these venemous breasts, that when they lack the liquor and poyson of the one, they may visite him, and learn to be nourished of him. Oh if the eyes of worldly Princes should be opened, that they might see with what humour and liquor their souls are fed, while that their whole delight consisteth in pride, ambition, and lusts of the stinking flesh. We understand then how God doth visite men, as well by his severe judgements, as by his mercifull visitation of deliverance from trouble, or by bringing trouble upon his chosen for their humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And now it resteth to understand how man visiteth God: Man doth visite God, when he appeareth in his presence; be it to the hearing of his Word, or to the participation of his Sacraments; as the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> besides the observation of their Sabbaths and daily oblations, were commanded thrice a yeer to present themselves before the presence of the Tabernacle, and as we do, and as often as we present our selves to the hearing of the Word; for there is the footstool, yea, there is the face and throne of God himself, wheresoever the Gospel of Jesus Christ is truely Preached, and his Sacraments rightly ministred.</p>
                  <p>But men may on this sort visite God hypocritically, for they may come for the fashion, they may hear with deaf ears; yea, they may understand, and yet never determine with themselves to obey that, which God requireth: And let such men be assured, That he (who search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the secrets of hearts) will be avenged of all such. For nothing can be to God more odious, then to mock him in his own presence. Let every man therefore examine himself, with what minde, and what purpose, he cometh to hear the Word of God; yea, with what ear he heareth it, and what testimony his heart giveth unto him, when that God commandeth vertue, and forbiddeth impiety.</p>
                  <p>Repinest thou when God requireth obedience? Thou hearest to thine own condemnation. Mockest thou at Gods threatnings? Thou shalt feel the weight and truth of them, albeit too late, when flesh and blood cannot deliver thee from his hand. But the visitation (whereof our Prophet speaketh,) is onely proper to the sons of God, who in the time when God taketh from them the pleasures of the world, or sheweth his angry countenance unto them, have their recourse unto him, and confessing their former negligence with troubled hearts, cry for his mercy. This visitation is not proper to all afflicted, but appertaineth onely to Gods children: For the reprobates can never have accesse to Gods mercy in time of their tribulation, and that because they abuse as well his long patience, as the manifold benefits they receive from his hands; For as the same Prophet heretofore saith, Let the wicked obtain mercy, yet shall he



<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61872:322"/>
never learn wisdome, but in the land of righteousnesse, that is, Where the very knowledge of God aboundeth, he will do wickedly, which is a crime above all others abominable; for to what end is it that God erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Throne among us, but that we should fear him? Why doth he reaveal his holy will unto us, but that we should obey it? Why doth he deliver us from trouble, but that we should be witnesses unto the world, that he is gracious and mercifull?</p>
                  <p>Now when that men, hearing their duty, and knowing what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of them, do malapertly fight against all equity and justice, what, I pray you, do they else, but make manifest warre against God? yea, when they have received from God such deliverance, that they cannot deny, but that God himself hath in his great mercy visited them, and yet that they continue wicked as before; what deserve they, but effectually to bee given over unto a reprobate sense, that headlong they may runne to ruine, both of body and soul? It is almost incredible that a man should be so enraged against God, that neither his plagues, nor yet his mercy shewed, should move them to repentance; but because the Scriptures beareth witnesse of the one, and the other, let us cease to marvell, and let us firmly beleeve, that such things as have beene, are even presently before our eyes, albeit many, blinded by affection, cannot see them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ahab</hi> (as in the book of the Kings it is written) received many notable benefits of the hand of God, who did visit him in divers sorts; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by his plagues, sometimes by his word, and sometimes by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull deliverance; He made him king, and for the Idolatry used by him and his wife, he plagued whole <hi>Israel</hi> by Famine; He revealed to him his Will and true Religion by the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi>; he gave unto him sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry deliverances, but one most speciall, when proud <hi>Benhadad</hi> came to besiege <hi>Samaria,</hi> and was not content to receive <hi>Ahabs</hi> gold, silver, sons, daughters and wives, but also required, that his servants should have at their pleasure whatsoever was delectable in <hi>Samaria:</hi> True it is, that his Elders and people willed him not to hear the proud Tyrant, But who made unto him the promise of deliverance? and who appointed and put his Army in order? who assured him of victory? The Prophet of God onely, who assured him, That by the servants of the Princes of the Provinces, who in number were onely two hundred thirty and two, hee should deface that great Army, in the which there were two and thirty Kings, with all their Forces; and as the Prophet of God promised, so it came to passe, victory was obtained, not once onely, but twice, and that by the mercifull visitation of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But how did <hi>Ahab</hi> visite God again for his great benefit received? Did he remove his Idolatry? did he correct his Idolatrous wife <hi>Iezabel?</hi> No, we finde no such thing, but the one and the other, wee finde to have continued and increased in former impiety: But what was the end hereof? The last visitation of God was, That dogs licked the blood of the one, and did eate the flesh of the other. In few words then wee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, what difference there is betwixt the visitation of God upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 22.</note> and his visitation upon his Chosen; the Reprobate are visited, but never truly humbled,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 9.</note> nor yet amended; the Chosen being visited,

they sob, and they cry unto God for mercy (which obtained) they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Gods Name, and after declare the fruits of repentance. Let us therefore that hear these judgements of our God, call for the assistance of his holy Spirit, that howsoever it pleaseth him to visit us, that we may stoop under his mercifull hands, and unfainedly cry to him when he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth us; And so shall we know in experience, that our cryes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were not in vain.

                  <p>This is the second part of the Prophets complaint in the which he in the person of Gods people complaineth, that of their great affliction there appeared not end. This same similitude is used by our Master Jesus Christ; for when he speaketh of the troubles of his Church,<note place="margin">John 16.</note> he compareth them to the pains of a woman travelling in her child-birth. But it is to another end. For there he promiseth exceeding and permanent joy, after a sort, though it appear trouble. But here is the trouble long &amp; vehement, albeit the fruit of it was not suddenly espied. He speaketh no doubt of that long and dolorous time of their captivity, in the which they continually tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled for deliverance, but obtained it not before the compleat end of 70 yeres; during the which time, the earth, that is, the land of <hi>Iuda,</hi> which somtimes was sanctified unto God, but was then given to be prophaned by wicked people, got no help, nor perceiving any deliverance: For the Inhabitants of the world fell not, that is, the tyrants and oppressors of Gods people, were not taken away, but stil remained and continued blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers of God and troublers of his Church.

                  <p>The Prophet here pierceth through all impediments that nature could object; And by the victory of faith, he overcommeth, not only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies, but the great and last enemy of all, <hi>to wit,</hi> death it selfe: For this would he say, Lord, I see nothing to thy chosen, but misery to follow misery, &amp; one affliction to succeed another, yea, in the end I see, that death shall devour thy dearest children. But yet, O Lord, I see thy promise to be true, &amp; thy love to remain towards thy chosen, even when death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have devoured them: <hi>For thy dead shal live, yea not only shal they live,



<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61872:323"/>
but my very dead Carcase shall arise</hi>; And so I see honour and glory to succeed this temporall shame, I see joy permanent to come after trouble, order to spring out of this terrible confusion; and finally, I see that life shall devour death, so that death shall be destroyed, and so thy servants shall have life. This (I say) is the victory of faith, when in the midst of death, through the light of Gods Word, the afflicted see life. Hypocrites, in the time of quietnesse and prosperitie, can generally confesse, That God is true in his promises; but bring them to the extremitie, and there ceaseth the Hypocrite further to trust in God then he seeth naturall means whereby God useth to work: But the true faithfull, when all hope of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall means faileth, then flie they to God himself, and to the truth of his Promise, who is above nature, yea, whose works are not so subject to the ordinary course of nature, that when Nature faileth, his Power and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise fail also therewith.</p>
                  <p>Let us further observe, That the Prophet here speaketh not of all dead in generall, but saith, <hi>Thy dead, O Lord, shall live:</hi> In which words he maketh difference betwixt those that die in the Lord, and those that die in their naturall corruption, and in the old <hi>Adam.</hi> Dye in the Lord can none, except those that live in him (I mean those that attain to the yeers of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion) and none live in him, but those that with the Apostle can say, <hi>I live, and yet not I, but Christ Iesus that dwelleth in me; The life that I now live,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>I have by the faith of the Sonne of God.</hi> Not that I mean, That the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full have at all hours such sense of the life everlasting, that they fear not the death, and the troubles of this life; no, not so, for the faith of Gods Children is weak, yea, and in many things imperfect: But I mean, That such as in death and after death shall live, must communicate in this life with Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> and must be regenerate by the seed of life; that is, by the Word of the everliving God, which whosoever despiseth, refuseth life and joy everlasting.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet transferreth all the promises of God to himselfe, saying, <hi>Even my dead body shall arise</hi>; and immediately after, giveth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and charge to the dwellers in the dust, that is, To the dead Carcases of those that were departed (for the spirit and soul of man dwelleth not in the dust) <hi>That they should awake, that they should sing and rejoyce</hi>; for they should arise and spring up from the earth, even as the Herbs do, after they have received the dew from above.</p>
                  <p>Time will not suffer that these particulars be so largely treated as they ought to be, and as I gladly would; therefore let us consider, That the Prophet in transferring the Power and Promise of God to himself, doth not vindicate to himself any particular prerogative above the people of God, as that he alone should live and arise, and not they also; But he doth it, to let them understand, That he taught a Doctrine whereof he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yea, and whereof they should have experience after his death: As if he should say, My words appear to you now to be incredible, but the day shall come, that I shall be taken from you, my Carcase shall be inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the bosome of the earth, and therefore shall ye be led away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where ye shall remain many dayes and yeers, as it were buryed in your Sepulchres.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:61872:324"/>But then call to minde, that I said unto you before hand, that my body shall arise: Even so shall ye rise from your graves out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and be restored to your own Countrey, and City of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> This, I doubt not, is the true meaning of the Prophets. The charge that he giveth to the dwellers in the dust, is to expresse the power of Gods Word; whereby, he not onely giveth life, where death apparantly had prevailed; but also by it, he calleth things that are not, even as if they were. True it is, that the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> saw not the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> much lesse could he see the restitution of it with his corporall eyes; but he leaveth this, as it were, in testament with them, That when they were in the extremity of all bondage, they should call to minde, what the Prophet of God had before spoken.</p>
                  <p>And lest that his doctrine, and this promise of God made unto them by his mouth, should have been forgotten (as we are ever prone and ready to forget Gods promises when we are pressed with any sorrow) God raised up unto them, in the midst of their calamity, his Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> unto whom,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37</note> among many other visions, he gave this; <hi>The hand of the Lord first led him in a place, which was full of dry and dispersed bones.</hi> The question was demanded of the Prophet, if these bones, being wondrous dry, should live. The Prophet answered, The knowledge thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained unto God. Charge was given unto him, that he should speak unto the dry bones, and say, <hi>Thus saith the Lord God to these bones, Behold, I shall give you breath, and you shall live; I shall give unto you sinews, flesh, and skin, and you shall live.</hi> And while the Prophet spake (as he was commanded) he heard a voyce, and he saw every bone joyn in his Marrow; he saw them covered with flesh and skin, albeit, there was no spirit of life in them. He was commanded again, to speak, and to say, <hi>Thus saith the Lord God, Come O spirit from the four quarters, and blow in these that are slain, that they may live.</hi> And as he prophesied, the spirit of life came; They lived and stood, upon their feet. Now doth the Lord inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret what this vision meant, saying, <hi>O Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel.</hi> Behold, they say, our bones are dryed, our hope is perished, we are plainly cut off; But behold, saith the Lord, <hi>I will open your graves, I will bring you forth of them, ye shall live, and come unto the Land of Israel, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This vision I say, given to the Prophet, and by the Prophet preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the people, when they thought that God had utterly forgotten them, compelled them more diligently to advert, what the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had spoken. It is no doubt, but they carryed with them, both the prophesie of <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Ieremy,</hi> so that the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary to these words of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> where he saith. <hi>Thy dead, O Lord, shall live, with my body they shall arise.</hi> The Prophet bringeth in this similitude of the <hi>dew,</hi> to answer unto that part of their fidelity, who can believe no further of Gods promises, then they are able to apprehend by naturall judgement; As he would say, Think ye this impossible, that God shall give life unto you, and bring you to an estate of a Common-wealth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, after that ye be dead, and as it were raced from the face of the earth. But why do ye not consider, what God worketh from yeer to



<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61872:324"/>
yeer in the order of nature, sometimes ye see the face of the earth decked and beautified with herbs, flowers, grasse, and fruits. Again, ye see the same utterly taken away by storms, and vehemency of the Winter. What doth God to replenish the earth again, and to restore the beauty thereof. He sendeth down his small and soft dew, the drops whereof, in their descending, are neither great nor visible, and yet thereby are the pores and secret veins of the earth, which before by vehemency of frost and cold were shut up, opened again; and so doth the earth produce again the like herbs, flowers, and fruits. Shall ye then think, that the dew of Gods heavenly grace shall not be as effectuall in you to whom he hath made his promise, as that it is in the herbes and fruits that from year to year buddeth forth and decayeth? If ye do so, the Prophet would say your incredibility is inexcusable, because ye do neither rightly weigh the power, nor the promise of your God.</p>
                  <p>The like similitude useth the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> against such as called the resurrection in doubt, because that by naturall judgement they could not apprehend that flesh once putrified, and resolved, as it were, in other substance, should arise again, and return again to the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and nature. <hi>O fool</hi> (saith he) <hi>that which thou sowest is not quickned, except it dye, and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare corn, as it falleth, of wheat, or some other, but God giveth it a body as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him, even to every seed his own body.</hi> In which words and sentence, the Apostle sharply rebuketh the grosse ignorance of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who began to call in doubt the chiefe article of our faith, the resurrection of the flesh after that it was once resolved, because that naturall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as said he) reclaimed thereto. He reproveth (I say) their grosse ignorance, because they might have seen and considered some proofe and document thereof in the very order of nature: For albeit the wheat, or other corn cast in the earth, appeareth to die or putrifie, and so to be lost, yet we see that it is not perished, but that it fructifieth according to Gods will and ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Now if the power of God be so manifest in raising up of the fruits of the earth, unto the which no particular promise is made by God, what shall be his power and vertue in raising up of our bodies, seeing that thereto he is bound by the solemne promise of Jesus Christ his eternall wisdom? And the verity it self that can not lie: yea, seeing that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers must once communicate with the glory of the head, How shall our bodies, which are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones, lie still for ever in corruption, seeing that our head Jesus Christ is now exalted in his glory. Neither yet is this power and good will of God to be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the last and generall resurrection onely, but we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it in the marvellous preservation of his Church, and in the raising up of the same from the very bottome of death, when by Tyrants it hath been oppressed from age to age.</p>
                  <p>Now of the former words of the Prophet, we have to gather this comfort, That if at any time we see the face of the Church within this Realm so defaced (as I think it shall be sooner then we look for) when we shall see, I say, vertue to be despised, vice to be maintained,



<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61872:325"/>
the verity of God to be impugned, lies and mens inventions holden in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; and finally, when we shall see the true Religion of our God, and the zealous observers of the same, to be trodden under the feet of such as in their heart say,<note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> That there is no God. Let us then call to mind what have been the wonderous works of our God from the beginning, that it is his proper Office to bring forth light out of darknesse, order out of confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, life out of death; and finally, that it is he, that calleth things that are not, even as if they were, as before we have heard: And if in the day of our temptation (which in my judgement approacheth fast) wee be thus armed, if our incredulity cannot utterly be removed, yet shall it so be corrected, that damnable despaire oppresse us not. But now let us hear how the Prophet proceedeth:
<q>Come <hi>(saith he)</hi> thou my people, enter within thy chamber, shut thy door af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, hide thy self a very little while, untill the indignation passe over.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Prophet bringeth in God amiably calling upon his people to come to himself, and to rest with him, untill such time as the fury and sharp plagues should be executed upon the wicked and inobedient. It may appear at the first sight, That all these words of the Prophet in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of God calling the people unto rest, are spoken in vain; for we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finde chambers nor rest more prepared for the dearest children of God (so far as mans judgement can discern) then there was for the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and disobedient; for such as fell not in the edge of the sword, or dyed not of pestilence, or by hunger, were either carryed captives unto <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> or else departed after into <hi>Egypt,</hi> so that none of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, had either chamber or quiet place to remain within the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> For the resolution hereof, we must understand, That albeit the Chambers whereunto God called his Chosen, be not visible, yet notwithstanding they are certain, and offer unto Gods Children quiet habitation in spirit, howsoever the flesh be travelled and tormented.</p>
                  <p>The chambers are then Gods sure promises, unto the which Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are commanded to resort, yea, within the which they are commanded to close themselves in the time of greatest adversitie. The manner of speaking is borrowed from that judgement and foresight, which God hath printed in this our Nature; for when that men espie great tempests appearing to come, willingly they will not remain uncovered upon the fields, but straightway they will draw them to their houses or holds, that they may escape the vehemency of the same; and if they fear any ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to pursue them, they will shut their doors, to the end that suddenly the enemy should not have entry.</p>
                  <p>After this manner God speaketh to his people; as if he should say, The Tempest that shall come upon this whole Nation, shall be so terrible, that nothing shall appear but extermination to come upon the whole body: But thou my people (I say) that hearest my word, beleevest the same, and tremblest at the threatnings of my Prophets, now when the world doth insolently resist, let such (I say) enter within the secret Chamber of my promises, let them contain themselves quietly there, yea let them



<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61872:325"/>
shut the door upon them, and suffer not infidelity, the mortall enemy of my trueth, and of my people that depend thereupon, to have free entry to trouble them (yea, farther to murther) in my promise; and so shall they perceive that my indignation shall passe, and that such as depend upon me, shall be saved.</p>
                  <p>Thus we may perceive the meaning of the Prophet; Whereof, we have first to observe, That God acknowledgeth them for his people, that are in greatest affliction; yea, such as are reputed unworthy of mens presence, are yet admitted within the secret Chamber of God. Let no man think that flesh and blood, can suddenly attain to that comfort; and therefore most expedient it is, That we be frequently exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in meditation of the same. Easie it is I grant, in time of prosperity, to say, and to think, That God is our God, and that we are his people; But when he hath given us over in the hands of our enemies, and turned (as it were) his back unto us, then I say, still to reclaim him to be our God, and to have this assurance, That we are his people, proceedeth wholly from the holy spirit of God,<note place="margin">1 John 5.</note> as is the greatest victory of faith, which over-cometh the world; for increase whereof, we ought continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pray.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine we shall not think strange, if we shall consider how suddenly our spirits are carryed away from our God, and from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his promise, so soon as any great temptation doth apprehend us, then begin we to doubt, If ever we beleeved Gods promises, if God will fulfill them to us, if we abide in his favour, if he regardeth and looketh upon the violence and injury that is done unto us, and a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of such cogitations, which before lurked quietly in our corrupted hearts, burst violently forth when we are oppressed with any desperate calamity. Against the which, this is the remedy, once to apprehend and still to retain, God to be our God, and firmly to believe, that we are his people whom he loveth, and will defend, not onely in affliction, but even in the midst of death it self.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let us observe, That the judgements of our God, never were, nor yet shall be so vehement upon the face of the earth, but that there hath been, and shall be, some secret habitation prepared in the sanctuary of God, for some of his chosen, where they shall be preserved untill the indignation passe by, and that God prepareth a time, that they may glorifie him again, before the face of the world, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times despised them; And this ought to be unto us no small comfort in these appearing dangers, to wit, that we be surely perswaded, That how vehement soever the tempest shall be, that it yet shall passe over, and some of us shall be preserved to glorifie the name of our God, as is aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>Two vices lurke in this our nature; the one is, That we cannot tremble at Gods threatnings, before that the plagues apprehend us, albeit, that we see cause most just, why that his fierce wrath should burn as a devouring fire. The other is, That when calamities before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, fall upon us, then begin we to sinke down in despair, so that we never look for any comfortable end of the same.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61872:326"/>To correct this our mortall infirmity in time of quietnesse, We ought to consider what is the justice of our God, and how odious sin is. And above all other, how odious Idolatry is in his presence, who hath forbidden it, and who hath so severely punished it in all ages, from the beginning; And in the time of our affliction we ought to consider, what have been the wondrous Works of our God, in preservation of his Church, when it hath been in uttermost extremity: For never shall we finde the Church humbled under the hands of Traytors, and cruelly tormented by them; but therewith, we shall finde Gods just vengeance to fall upon the cruell persecuters, and his mercifull delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be shewed to the afflicted: And in taking of this tryall, we should not onely call to minde the Histories of ancient times, but also we should diligently mark what notable Works God hath wrought even in this our age, as well upon the one, as upon the other. We ought not to think that our God beareth lesse love to his Church this day, then that he hath done from the beginning: For as our God in his own nature is immutable, so remaineth his love towards his elect, alwayes unchangeable; For as in CHRIST JESUS he hath chosen his Church, before the beginning of all ages, so by him will he maintain and preserve the same unto the end. Yea, he will quiet the storms, and cause the earth to open her mouth, and receive those raging flouds of violent waters, cast out by the Dragon, to drown and carry away the woman which is the spouse of Jesus Christ, unto whom, God for his own Names <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This saw that notable servant of Jesus Christ, <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who (being exiled from <hi>Alexandria</hi> by that blasphemous Apostata <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour) said unto his flock, who bitterly wept for his envious banishment; <hi>Weep not, but be of good comfort, said he, For this little cloud will suddainly vanish.</hi> A little cloud, he called both the Emperour himself, and his cruell tyranny; And albeit, That small appearance there, was of any deliverance to the Church of God, or yet, of any punishment, to have apprehended the proud tyrants, when the man of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced these words, <hi>Yet shortly after, God did give witnesse, That those words did not proceed from flesh, nor blood, but from Gods very spirit.</hi> For not long after, being in warfare, he received a deadly wound, whether by his own hand, or by one of his own souldiers, the Writers cleerly conclude not, But casting his own blood against the Heaven, he said, <hi>Vicisti tandem Galilee,</hi> That is, <hi>At last thou hast overcome thou Galilean</hi>; So in despite, he termed the Lord Jesus, and so perished that tyrant in his own iniquity; The storm ceased, and the Church of God received now comfort.</p>
                  <p>Such shall be the end of all cruell persecuters, Their raign shall be short, their end miserable, and their name shall be left in execrations to Gods people; and yet shall the Church of God remain to Gods glory, after all storms. But now shortly, let us come to the last point.</p>
                  <q>

                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:61872:326"/>For behold <hi>(saith the Prophet)</hi> the Lord will come out of his place to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit the iniquitie of the Inhabitants of the earth upon them, and the earth shall disclose her blood and shall no more hide her slain; because that the finall end of the troubles of Gods Chosen shall not be before that the Lord Iesus shall return to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store all things to their full perfection.</q>
                  <p>The Prophet bringeth forth the Etenall God, as it were from his owne place and habitation, and therewith sheweth the cause of his coming, to bee, That hee might take account of all such as have wrought wickedly; for that he meaneth, where he saith, <hi>Hee will visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth upon them.</hi> And lest that any should thinke, That the wrong doers are so many that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee called to an account, he giveth unto the earth (as it were) an Office and charge to beare witnesse against all those that have wrought wickedly, and chiefly against those that have shed innocent blood from the beginning; and saith, <hi>That the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more hide her slain men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Tyrants of the earth, and such as delight in the shedding of blood should be perswaded that this sentence is true, they would not so furiously come to their own destruction; for what man can be so enraged, that he would willingly do even before the eyes of God, that which might provoke his Majestie to anger, yea, provoke him to become his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for ever, if that he understood how fearfull a thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God?</p>
                  <p>The cause then of this blinde fury of the world, is the ignorance of God, and that men think that God is but an Idoll, and that there is no knowledge above, that beholdeth their Tyranny; neither yet Justice that will, nor power that can represse their impiety; but yet the Spirit of truth doth witnesse the contrary, affirming, That as the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and as his ears are ready to receive their sobbing and prayers, so is his angry visage against such as work iniquitie, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and holdeth in abomination every deceitfull and blood-thirsty man, whereof he hath given sufficient document from age to age, in preserving the one, or at least in revenging of their cause, and in punishing of the other. Where it is said, That the Lord will come from his place, and that he will visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth upon them, and that the earth shall disclose her blood, we have to consider, what most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hath been, and what shall be the condition of the Church of God, to wit, That it is not onely hated, mocked, and despised, but that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as it were, in a prey, unto the fury of the wicked; so that the blood of the Children of God, is spilt like unto water upon the face of the earth.</p>
                  <p>The understanding whereof, albeit it be unpleasant to the flesh, yet to us it is most profitable, lest that we seeing the cruell entreatings of Gods servants, begin to forsake the Spouse of Jesus Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that she is not so dealt withall in this unthankfull world, as the just and upright dealing of Gods Children do deserve: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, for mercy they receive crueltie; for doing good to many,



<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61872:327"/>
of all the reprobate they receive evill: And this is decreed in Gods eternall Councell, that the members may follow the trace of the head, to the end that God in his just judgement should finally condemne the wicked; for how should he punish the inhabitants of the earth, if their iniquitie deserved it not? How should the earth disclose our blood, if it should not bee unjustly spilt? Wee must then commit our selves into the hands of our God, and lay downe our neckes, yea, and patiently suffer our blood to bee shed, that the righteous Judge may require account, as most assuredly hee shall, of all the blood that hath been shed, from the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> the just, till the day that the earth shall disclose the same; I say, every one that shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, or consenteth to shed the blood of Gods Children, shall be guilty of the whole:<note place="margin">A terrible, but must true sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note> So that all the blood of Gods children shall crie vengeance, not onely in generall, but also in particular, upon every one that hath shed the blood of any that unjustly suffered.</p>
                  <p>And if any thinke it strange, that such as live this day, can be guilty of the blood that was shed in the dayes of the Apostles, let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the verity it selfe pronounced, That all the blood that was shed from the dayes of <hi>Abel,</hi> unto the dayes of <hi>Zacharie</hi>; should come upon that unthankfull generation, that heard his Doctrine, and refused it.</p>
                  <p>The reason is evident, for as there is two heads and captains that rule over the whole world, to wit, Jesus Christ, the Prince of Justice and Peace; and Sathan, called the Prince of the world; so are they but two Armies that hath continued battell from the beginning, and shall fight unto the end: The quarrell is one which the Armie of Jesus Christ do sustain, and which the reprobate do persecute, to wit, The eternall truth of the Eternall God, and the Image of Jesus Christ prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Elect, so that whosoever in any age persecuteth any one Member of <hi>IESUS CHRIST,</hi> for his Truths sake, subscribeth as it were, with his hand, the persecution of all that have passed before him.</p>
                  <p>And this ought the Tyrants of this age deeply to consider, for they shall bee guilty, not onely of the blood shed by themselves, but of all (as is said) that hath been shed for the Cause of Jesus Christ from the beginning of the world.</p>
                  <p>Let the faithfull not bee discouraged, although they bee appointed as Sheepe to the Slaughter-house, for hee, for whose sake they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, shall not forget to revenge their cause. I am not ignorant, That flesh and blood will thinke that kinde of support too too late, for wee had rather bee preserved still alive, then to have our blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged after our death; and truely if our felicitie stood in this life, or if death temporall should bring unto us any damage, our desire in that behalfe were not to bee disallowed or condemned; But seeing that death is common to all, and that this temporall life, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but miserie, and that death doth fully joyne us with our God, and giveth unto us the possession of our Inheritance, why should we thinke it strange to leave this world, and go to our Head and Soveraign Captain Jesus Christ?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, we have to observe this manner of speaking, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet



<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61872:327"/>
saith, that <hi>The earth shall disclose her blood:</hi> In which words the Prophet would accuse the crueltie of those that dare so unmercifully and violently force from the Breasts of the Earth, the dearest Children of God, and cruelly cut their Throats in her bosome, who is by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the common mother of mankinde, so that she unwillingly is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to open her mouth and receive their blood.</p>
                  <p>If such Tyrannie were used against any naturall woman, as violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pull her infant from her Breasts, cut the Throat of it in her own bosome, and compell her to receive the blood of her deare Childe in her owne mouth, all Nations would hold the fact so abominable, that the like had never been done in the course of nature; no lesse wickednesse commit they that shed the Blood of Gods Children up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of their common mother the earth (as I said before:) But bee of good courage (O little and despised Flock of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus) for hee that seeth your griefe hath power to revenge it, He will not suffer one teare of yours to fall, but it shall bee kept and reserved in his Bottell, till the fulnesse thereof bee poured downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon those that caused you to weep and mourne; this your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God (I say) will not suffer your blood for ever to be covered with the earth, nay, the flaming fires that have licked up the blood of any of our Brethren, the earth that hath beene defiled with it, I say, with the blood of Gods Children; for otherwise, to shed the blood of the cruell blood-shedders, is to purge the land from blood, and as it were to sanctifie it; The earth (I say) shall purge her selfe of it, and shew it before the face of God; yea, the Beasts, Fowls, and other Creatures whatsoever, shall be compelled to render that which they have received, bee it Flesh, Blood or Bones that appertained to thy Children, O Lord, which altogether thou shalt glorifie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy promise made to us in our Lord and Saviour <hi>IESUS CHRIST</hi> thy welbeloved Sonne, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be honour, praise, and glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now humble our selves in the presence of our God, and from the bottome of our hearts, let us desire him to assist us with the power of his Holy Spirit, that albeit for our former negligences God giveth us over into the hands of other then such as rule in his fear, that yet he letteth us not forget his mercy, and that glorious Name, that hath beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed amongst us; but that wee may look thorow the dolorous storm of his present displeasure, and see as well what punishment hee hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the cruell Tyrants, as what reward hee hath laid in store for such as continue in his fear to the end; That it would further please him to assist. That albeit we see his Church so diminished, that it appear to bee brought (as it were) to utter extermination, that wee may be assured, that in our God there is great power and will, to increase the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Chosen, untill they bee enlarged to rhe uttermost parts of the earth: Give us (O Lord) hearts to visite thee in time of affliction, and albeit we see no end of our dolours, yet our faith and hope may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us to the assured hope of that joyfull resurrection, in the which wee shall possesse the fruit of that for which now we labour: In the mean time,
