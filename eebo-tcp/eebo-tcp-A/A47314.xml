         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Lybeller Carracterizd,</hi>
OR A
Hue and Cry
Sent after Him. Some of his <hi>Works</hi> made
Publick: with <hi>Obſervations</hi> thereupon.</head>
            <p>WHereas ſome envious Perſon, or Perſons in or about
<hi>London</hi> (as is ſuppoſed) have of late abuſed ſeveral
honeſt Men in ſeveral Countries, by ſending great
<hi>Packets</hi> by the <hi>POST;</hi> and thereby not only putting
them to conſiderable Charges, but alſo abuſing ſeveral with ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Language and Falſhood; which have been born with until it
became frequent; and then ſeveral have refuſed to receive them;
ſo they have been returned upon the <hi>Poſt-Maſter</hi> again. The
Hand-Writing being compared, ſeems much alike; and the <hi>Seal,</hi>
ſometimes the <hi>Anchor,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Ship,</hi> &amp;c. and Printed
Books writ upon between the Lines, and wrapt up in a blank piece
of Paper, charged 14, and 18 <hi>d.</hi> for <hi>Poſtage;</hi> and ſome leſs: And
inaſmuch as ſuch Practice is very unjuſt, and a Work of Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:
it is the duty of all honeſt men fearing God, not only
to diſown, but publickly to teſtifie againſt ſuch a Practice.</p>
            <p>It was, and is at this day, a certain Truth, <hi>That he that doth Evil
hates the Light:</hi> neither will he bring his Deeds to it, leaſt it
ſhould reprove him. And doubtleſs, the Nameleſs Author of
thoſe <hi>Packets</hi> loved <hi>Darkneſs</hi> rather than the <hi>Light,</hi> becauſe he
was afraid to put his Name to what he hath writ: but his Work
diſcovers him to be a <hi>Night Wanderer:</hi> and though he would
ſeem (it may be) to be Religious; yet how vain is it for him
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37421:2"/>
ſo to do, that hath not a Bridle to his Tongue; but will accuſe,
and not prove, and ask Queſtions to no purpoſe, except to ſlander
and abuſe men; and is yet to learn that Leſſon which our Saviour
taught his Followers, <hi>Viz. Whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould
do unto you, that do unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Nameleſs Author of the <hi>Packets,</hi> ſeems as if he had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
(or at leaſt aſſumes it) to judge of Men's Properties, and
queſtion the printing of Books, that are not Licenſed by ſuch
nameleſs Perſons as himſelf: and in particular, he quarrels, and
ſeems to be offended with a ſmall Book written concerning that
Honourable Woman <hi>Loveday Hambly,</hi> deceaſed; and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Books, that have been wrote by Perſons of good Repute,
Men fearing God, and abhorring ſuch idle Practices as the
Author of the <hi>Lybel</hi> is found in.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Author of thoſe Packets makes it his Buſineſs to
abuſe honeſt men, and endeavours as much as in him lyes, to take
away their good Name, by beſpattering them with bad Names,
and in particular, hath bent his Arrows of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> againſt
that Servant of God <hi>J. S.</hi> deceaſed, and <hi>J. W.</hi> and others: but
ſeeing he is ſuch a <hi>Night-Wanderer,</hi> and will not tell his Name,
what he writes is the leſs taken notice of, or credited amongſt
men of Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Now if this <hi>Lybeller</hi> will come forth, and own his Work, he
ſhall have a fair Hearing; and if he be found guilty, let him repent
and do ſo no more; but if he doth perſiſt in this wicked Work to
abuſe and cheat men, as before mentioned; which is little leſs
than picking their Pockets. This is to give notice, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
can give certain intelligence of his Name, and place of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
or Habitation, ſhall have reaſonable Satisfacton for their
pains. Written by a Lover of Truth and Honeſty, but a Witneſs
againſt the Contrary.</p>

Good Works and Charity, or Evil? Haſt thou not cryed <hi>Peace</hi> to ſuch

<hi>Blewberry,</hi> and they were fain to meet at an <hi>Inn,</hi> and <hi>A. Eſtmead</hi> nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up their Meeting-Houſe Door at <hi>Calne,</hi> and they were fain to meet
in the Street, and the Women fain to meet in a <hi>Malt-Houſe.</hi> Is this
your <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and Works of <hi>Charity,</hi> to keep People out
of their Property, or the Perſecuting Spirit of the <hi>World</hi> cloakt with
Liberty? Hath <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> taught you this Doctrine? Is this

did abhor ſuch a Practiſe as he is found in; but his Reward will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Work: <hi>How are the hidden things of Eſau ſearched out!</hi>
The Nameleſs Author cites <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48. 8. <hi>I knew thee that thou wouldſt deal
treacherouſly. Anſ.</hi> Very proper for himſelf. And it may be ſaid of him
as once the Prophet of the Lord ſaid concerning <hi>Edom, The pride of thy
heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwillest in the Clefts of the Rock, whoſe
Habitation is high; that ſaith in his heart, who ſhall bring me down to the
ground? Tho thou exalt thy ſelf as the Eagle, and tho thou ſet thy Nest

               <q>You may take your fawning, flattering <hi>Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
home again, and ſpread not ſuch things abroad leaſt they be turned
home again with ſhame; had you not, nor do you not expect ſome great
<hi>Legacy</hi> for your Work? and is not this crying up one, as you did <hi>J. S.</hi>
and crying down others, like <hi>Carnal</hi> men, building of <hi>Babel,</hi> whom
God will confound; and ſome of her Neighbours reproved the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Folly of ſuch Prophets, when they ſaw thoſe flattering frothy
Expreſſions concerning <hi>L. H.</hi> which more manifeſts a puft up Spirit
than <hi>Humility,</hi> but no better Fruits can be expected. <hi>T. C.</hi> read it over
again, and it may happen thou mayſt better conſider thy Folly, if Envy
and Paſſion hath not blinded thee; and thou haſt made a great Boaſt
what thou haſt done in this Book; but the Truth hath tryed it, and
hath a ſenſe of the Work and Spirit to be conceited and Lofty, <hi>&amp;c.
There is no peace, ſaith the Lord to the Wicked.</hi> Their <hi>Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
you may read,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 16. Iſai. 48. 22. and in <hi>Jude.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader may take notice, that <hi>T. C.</hi> was one of them that gave a
teſtimony forth concerning his old Friend <hi>L. H.</hi> with whom he had been
converſant, and made ſerviceable in the hand of the Lord, as appears
more at large, by what he hath wrote on her behalf; and I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why this Nameleſs Author ſhould be ſo much offended at it as he is,
except it was, becauſe it was not ſent to be approved of by the <hi>Second,
Days Meeting,</hi> as if he had power to Bind and Looſe: he ſaith, <hi>the Truth
hath tryed it, and hath a ſence of the Work and Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve.</hi> So many as have an Eye to him, that are zealous for the Form,
and oftentimes ſit with their hats on in time of Prayer, will be ready to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37421:5"/>
ſay, <hi>It is out of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> as they uſed to do by that Innocent Man <hi>J. S.</hi>
Which the Formal <hi>Apoſtate</hi> cites: he talks of <hi>Crying up one, and crying
down others, like Carnal Men, building of Babel.</hi> Who will cry up thee,
thou treacherous perſon, that art aſhamed to put thy Name to thy
Work? What can be more like <hi>Babel</hi> than what thou haſt done. The
<hi>Lybeller</hi> ſaith, <hi>That ſome of her Neighbours reproved the Madneſs and Folly
of ſuch Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> They are as nameleſs as this Author, and
I may ſay to him as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> once ſaid, <hi>What ſhall be done unto thee,
thou falſe tongue?</hi> And doth not this manifeſt more a puft up Spirit than
Humility, let his own words anſwer him; but no better Fruits can be
expected from one that is aſhamed of his Name,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> He ſaith flatteringly, <hi>Read it over again, &amp; it may happen thou mayſt
better conſider thy Folly, if Envy &amp; Paſſion hath not blinded thee. Anſ.</hi> If En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Madneſs and Folly had not blinded this Formal <hi>Apostate,</hi> he would
never have done as he hath done, to put honeſt men to ſuch unneceſſary
Charge, as he did in eight days time, and concealing his Name. Surely
none will own his Work nor he, unleſs he give forth a Paper of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
for ſuch things go a great way in our days; eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſuch as are ready to pin their <hi>Faith</hi> on other Folks Sleeves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked. Anſ.</hi> Very true,
therefore it will concern this Perſon to look back and repent of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Work that he hath been found in, and not like <hi>Lucifer,</hi> think to
make his Neſt amongſt the Stars, for the Lord God in his own day and
time will bring him down, and all that ſo do.</p>
            <p>The Nameleſs Author talkes of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and cites 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 16. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48. 2. and in <hi>Jude.</hi> So the Reader is deſired to ſearch the
Scriptures before cited, and compare what they ſay with his Practice.
It was ſaid by the Prophet, <hi>The Remnant of Iſrael ſhall not do Iniquity, nor
ſpeak Lyes, neither ſhall a deceitful tongue be found in their Mouth.</hi>
