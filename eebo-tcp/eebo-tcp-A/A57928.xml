            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Having used this plain language, as the businesse requires, I wish it may be as effectuall with you, as it is satisfactory to my self, that I do a little expostulate with you about the Surrender of the same, which I confesse is a way not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and which I should not have used, but in Respect to such a Person; and to such a place: I take into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Your Royall Birth and Relation to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Your Honour, Courage, the vertues of Your Person, and the strength of that place, which You may think Your self bound, and able to maintain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SIR,</hi> The Crown of <hi>England</hi> is and will be where it ought to be, we fight to maintain it there; But the King mis led by evil Councellors, or through a seduced heart hath left His Parliament, and His People, under God, the best assurance of His Crown and Family; the maintaining of this Schisme, is the ground of this unhappy War on Your part: And what sad effects it hath produced in the three Kingdoms, is visible to all men: To maintain the Rights of the Crown and Kingdom, joyntly, (a principall part whereof, is, That the King in Supream Acts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole State, is not to be advised by men of whom the Law takes no notice, but by His Parliament, the great Councell of the Kingdom, in whom as much as man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, He hears all His people, as it were at once advising him, and in which multitude of Councellors lies His safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113198:3"/>
and His peoples Interest) and to set him right in this, hath been the constant and faithfull endeavor of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to bring these wicked Instruments to Justice, that have mis-led Him, is a principall ground of our fighting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SIR,</hi> If God makes this clear to You, as he hath to us, I doubt not but he will give You a heart to deliver this place; Notwithstanding, all the other considerations of Honour, Courage, Fidelity, &amp;c. because of their consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and use in the present businesse, depends upon the right or wrongfulnesse of this that hath been said: And if upon such Conviction You shall Surrender it, and save the losse of blood, or hazard of spoyling such a City, it would be an occasion glorious in it self, and joyfull to us, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of You to the indeared affection to the Parliament and people of <hi>England,</hi> the truest Friend to Your Family it hath in this world.</p>
               <p>But if this be hid from your eyes, and through your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse this so great, so famous and ancient a City, and so full of people, be by your putting us to force the same, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to ruine, and the extreamities of war (which yet we shall in that case as much as possible, endeavour to prevent) then I appeale to the righteous God, to be Iudge between you and us, and to require the wrong: And let all <hi>England</hi> judge, whether the burning of its Towns, ruining its Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and destroying its people, be a good requitall from a person of your family, which hath had the Prayers, Tears, Purses, and Blood of its Parliament and people; and (if you look on either, as now divided) hath ever had that same party both in Parliaments, and amongst the people most zealous for their assistance and restitution, which you now oppose and seek to destroy, and whose constant grief hath been their desires to serve your Family, have been ever hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or made fruitlesse by that same party about his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,

               <p>This Answer being returned presently after dinner by the same Trumpeter, he was detained till eight at night, and then he brought this Answer from the Prince, or to this effect, in writing:</p>

                     <p>So this night also, though eight men were drawn out and appointed to their severall posts, the storm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was put off; and to morrow a certain hour will be set the Prince peremptorily for his positive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                     <p>There can be but two things, in my opinion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the Prince to offer Conditions; either he is not able to defend the place, and in fear of Sir <hi>Lewis Dives</hi> conditions, if he be driven for refuge into the Fort Royall; or else, he doth it to gain time, till his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-scarfes and Inner-lines be finished, which he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry active in making day and night; or that he expects
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113198:7"/>
aid from the King, or <hi>Goring,</hi> neither of which are moving this way, as our Intelligence is; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (on that reason) one dayes time longer is given. No man knows how this businesse may work, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the Towns-men: if the Generals Answer be made known to them, or if a Treaty be imbraced, the noise of it, and the sight of Committees, will make men greedy of Conditions, or unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, if on the Princes part it be broken off.</p>
                     <p>Truely, I think, some good will come of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which I rather wish then by storm; though by the latter, we shall reduce them to more extremities. God by his providence will order things for the best: I doubt not of good successe, which way soever is taken: For the Articles that are point of honour, I beleeve will not be much insisted on, as to grant four peece of ordinance, where ten is desired, and so proportionably of other things; and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of civility. The essentiall Articles are: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from sequestration: Cathedrall men to continue</hi>; against which there is an Ordinance: <hi>The works to be demolished, and no Garison hereafter</hi>; which may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient: These Articles will receive dispute; if they will agree, the Fort and Castle may have a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Garison, the Town perhaps will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted.</p>
                     <p>By to morrow night I shall acquaint you more: In the mean time I desire you these may not be too pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, till you hear further from the Generall himself, who is so busied he cannot write, neither to your self, nor the Committee of both Kingdoms.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>BEfore I descend to the particulars of <hi>Bristol,</hi> I shall humbly beg leave to offer a word or two, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Army for coming hither after the taking of <hi>Sherborn</hi>-Castle, because some endevours have been, to perswade a belief, that for respect to some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men, or other self-end, the Army was drawn to decline the West, and come hither: Me thinks it should be sufficient to convince any (reasonable) man, That to adventure naked bodies against an Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with Stone-walls, Strong-works, and a Castle, and to bring them into apparant danger of being visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Plague, (for that they must quarter where the sicknesse was very rife) was an argument of little self-respect; and when the City was gained, little could our security be to remain there, where 120 died weekly of the Plague. Surely Sir, it was God that put it into the heart of the Generall and his Officers to come before this place, and a regard they had unto the publike: And indeed God hath appeared to own our coming hither, in preserving this Army from the Infection of the Plague, considering that the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (do what we can to prevent it) run daily into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected houses; and to this day, not a man in the Army dead thereof, that I can hear of, but one. For the reasons inducing this Army to come before this place, rather then at that time, to advance further West, had I time, I beleeve I should make it evident unto
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113198:8"/>
you, That to come before this City, was most for the service of the Kingdom, and the safest and most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure course that could have been taken, to reduce the West to a thorow obedience to the Parliament: And this might be laid for a ground, That this Army could not (having a regard to the safety of other parts of the Kingdom, on any emergent occasion or accident, and to its own security) march from <hi>Sherborne</hi> into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> (as in all probability the Army must have done, if the enemy had drawn there together in a Body) leaving <hi>Bristol</hi> a Garrison on our backs, and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> at liberty, with neer 1000. Horse, and 1000. Foot, besides the addition of other Forces that might be joyned to his, to range all over <hi>Wiltshire</hi> and <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> and draw to them the assistance of the ill affected Club-men (we being not able to leave strength to secure <hi>Bathe, Bridgewater,</hi> and other Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,) and sufficient power to ballance his Forces. But this place being reduced, there is no Garison in the West of <hi>England</hi> left behinde us, that can secure or countenance the raising of any considerable force: Besides, the reputation in the gaining of this place, may operate so much among men (that are not void of reason or sense) as (perhaps) without many blows more, to reduce the West of <hi>England,</hi> and put fair to settle <hi>England</hi> too, which was once very low when this place was first lost. Also, the Club-men are hereby engaged, who have declared to assist this Army against the enemy. The example whereof, may do much elsewhere, especially in <hi>Wales,</hi> where (by our gaining of <hi>Bristol</hi> and <hi>Kings-Road</hi>) the people will undoubtedly be our friends. Craving pardon for this digression, I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113198:9"/>
now come to the businesse of besieging and storming of <hi>Bristol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saturday the 23. of <hi>August,</hi> the Army encompassed the City round, both on <hi>Gloucestershire</hi> and <hi>Somershire</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, our Horse having been there some dayes before, to prevent the burning of the Towns and Villages adjacent, whose seasonable coming, saved the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Stapleton, Hanham,</hi> and other Towns, which the enemy had sent out Parties of Horse with Fire-balls to set them on fire, but that our Horse repulsed them; but <hi>Bedminster, Clifton,</hi> and other places, they consumed by fire. From that time, till the 3. of <hi>September,</hi> the weather was so extreme wet, that both man and Horse with hard duty grew weak, and died in the Field: during that unseasonable weather, the Army was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Assault. The weather no sooner changed, but our Souldiers (being refreshed with the warm beams of the Sun) were impatient of falling on, being not out of action the time before, having had severall skirmishes with the enemy, where they took Sir <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Ashley,</hi> and others; besides, the taking in of <hi>Ports-head</hi> Point Fort, and fix peece of Ordnance. The Generall (with Lievtenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi>) having taken, full, and exact views of the Line and Works, and what places most fit to enter on, called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of War (having first set a day a part for the Army to seek God by Prayer and Fasting, to direct them in what they were to undertake:) At which Councell, it was resolved on, to storm the place, as most necessary to the timely reducing of it, and of having the Army timely in a condition to oppose an enemy that should advance towards us: Laying this for a Ground.</p>

On the last Lords day, Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> being prest by the Generall for a positive Answer to his summons, sent Propositions of surrender: the answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, and Replyes on both sides, spent time til Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day five in the afternoone, and then the Prince appeared in his proper colours, to be a man that pretended one thing, and intended another; delatorie proceedings, you will the better discerne, by all the Letters and Answers, which time will not now give me leave to repeat. The Prince, Noblemen, Souldiers, and Citizens, being left inexcusable, for refusing such honourable Conditions as was offered them, and being guiltie of that blood that should be spilt. The same night, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Treatie broke off, Tuesday <hi>September</hi> 9. at 12 at night, all the Armie, Horse and Foot, round the Citie, were set in a posture to fall on; The signes were to be, to give notice when the storme should begin, by kindling a fire of straw, and shooting off soure great Guns. The Word during the storme, was <hi>David</hi>: the word after the Lyne was entered, was <hi>The Lord of Hosts</hi>: About two of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the storm begun, the Souldiers shouted for joy, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was very hot for a time, especially with Collonel <hi>Rainsboroughs</hi> Brigade, who with a partie of his force, spent almost three houres in the storming of the <hi>Pryors</hi> Fort, a place of great advantage; Which piece of service was as bravely performed, as ever thing was done by man: In re<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
