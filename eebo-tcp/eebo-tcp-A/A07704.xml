            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For neyther whanne oure lorde sayed he was a very vyne, nor whanne he sayde he was the dore / there was none that herde hym that any thynge merueyled therof.

But whan he sayed that hys flesshe was very mete, &amp; hys blood was very drynke, and that they sholde not be saued but yf they dyd eate hys flesh and drynke hys blood / than

were they all in suche a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therof, that they coulde not abyde.

were so sore moued, &amp; thought the mater so harde, &amp; the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so greate, that they asked how coulde that be, and went almoste all theyr waye. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we maye well se, that he spake these wordes in suche wyse, as the herers perceyued that he ment it not in a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor an allegory / but spake of hys very flesshe and hys very blood in dede.</p>

            <p>How be it as for this poynt that an allegory vsed in some

For the thynge he sayth that is ment therby, can not be trewe / that is to wytte that the very body of Chryste can not be in the sacrament, bycause the sacrament is in many dyuers places at onys / and was at the maundy, that is to wytte in the handes of

And yet he goth after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and sayth that no more it can neyther when it is glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed to. And that he proueth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayeng of saint Austayn / whose wordes be as he sayth, that the body wyth whyche Chryste rose, muste be in one place, and that it contynueth in heuen, and shall do tyll he shall come to iudge bothe quycke and dede.

            <p>Now as for hys naturall reasons be not worth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonynge. For fyrste that the body of Chryste vngloryfyed coulde no more be in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at onys thanne hys awne can / bycause he is a naturall body as Christes was, &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes body a naturall body as his is: I wyll not examyne any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paryso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bytwene theyr two bodyes. But yf Chryste wolde telle me that he wolde make eche of bothe theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes too be in fyftene pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at ones, I wolde byleue hym I, that he were able to

make hys worde trewe in the bodyes of bothe twayne / and neuer wolde I soo myche as aske hym whyther he wolde gloryfye them bothe fyrste or not. But I am sure gloryfyed or vngloryfyed, yf the sayde it he is able to do it. whan our sauyour sayde, that it was as possible for a camel or a great cable rope to entre thorowe a nedles eye, as for a ryche man to entre into the kyngdome of heuen, and after tolde hys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles that though those two thinges were both impossyble to men, yet all thyng was pos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>syble to god: I thynke that he ment that neyther the sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple nor the mater was to god impossyble. Now syth than at the lest wyse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syble
<pb facs="tcp:4486:26"/>
for hym to conuaye the camel or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cable rope thorowe the nedels eye / what shall me nede to study now whyther he can brynge them thorow such as they be, or ellys muste of fyne force be fayne to gloryfye the camel or the cable fyrste / as thys yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayth of hys body, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it were impossyble for god to brynge aboute to haue it in two places at onys suche as it is now, bycause it is yet somwhat groce and vnglory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed / and than by the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryson of his owne, he argueth the lyke of the blessed body of Chryst, beyng lyke his at his maundye no more gloryfyed that he. But I say yet agayn of theyr bodyes both twayne, yf he sayed that he wold do it / 
<pb facs="tcp:4486:26"/>
I wold not dowt but he could do it. And yf he coulde not do it but yf he glorified the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fyrst / than were I sure that he wold gloryfye them both. And ther fore yf it were trewe, that he coulde not make hys owne body to be in two places at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes at maundy, but yf it were than gloryfyed / than syth I am sure that he there dyde it, I am therby sure also that he than for the tyme glorifyed it. For that thynge was in hys owne power to do as ofte as he wolde, as well before hys deth as at hys resurreccyon / &amp; yet to kepe hys gloryfycacion from perceyuynge,<note place="margin">Marci. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:4486:27"/>
And therefore as I saye, yf Chryste sayd vnto me that he wolde make bothe hys body and this yong mannes to, ech of them to be in a thousande places at ones / I wolde putte no dowte therin, but that by some maner meanes he were able inough to do it.</p>
            <p>But here wolde thys yong man peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture saye, ye say very well yf god so sayed, and by hys so sayenge so mente in dede. But ye wote wel I deny that he so mente though he so sayed. For I saye that in so sayenge he ment but by an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorye, as he dyd whanne he called hym selfe a vyne and a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dore. But nowe muste this yonge man consyder agayne, that hym self confesseth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:4486:27"/>
cause for which hym self saith that Chryste in so sayeng dyd not so mene, is bycause that if he shold haue ment so, it was impossyble for god to brynge hys menynge aboute / that is to saye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Crystes body myght be in two places at onys. And therfore but yf he proue that thynge impossyble for god to do, ellys he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth that god not onely sayd it, but also me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it in dede.</p>
            <p>And yet ouer this, yf Cryst had neuer sayde it / yet dowte I no thing but that he is able to do it / or els were there som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that he coulde not do, &amp; than were god not almyghty.</p>
            <p>Nowe yf thys yonge man wyll saye that to make one bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy to be in two places, dothe
<pb facs="tcp:4486:28"/>
imply repugnaunce, and that god can do no suche thynge: I dare be bolde to tell hym agayne, that many thynges maye seme repugnant both to hym and me, whyche thynges god seeth how to make them stande to gyther well inough.</p>
            <p>Suche blynde reasons of repugnaunce induceth many men in to greate errour, some ascrybynge all thynge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styny wythout any power of mannys free wyll at all / and some gyuynge all to mannes owne wyll, and no forsyghte at all vnto the prouydence of god / and all bycause the pore blynde reason of man can not se so farre, as to perceyue how goddes prescyence and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes free wyll can stande and
<pb facs="tcp:4486:28"/>
agre togyther, but seme to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> clerely repugnant.</p>
            <p>And surely yf the semyng of our owne feble reason, may dreue vs onys to thynke that one man to be at onys in two places, is a thynge so harde &amp; so repugnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and therfore so impossyble that god hym selfe can neuer brynge it aboute / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuyll wyll within a whyle set vs vppon suche a truste vnto our owne reason, that he wyll make vs take it for a thynge repugnaunt and impossyble, that euer one god sholde be thre persons.</p>
            <p>I wote well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many good folke haue vsed in thys mater many good frutefull exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of goddes other workys, not onely myracles wryte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in scryp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture,

but also done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> course of nature here in erthe, and some thynges made also by mannes hand / as one face beholden in dyuers glassys, &amp; in euery pyece of one glasse broken in to twenty, and the meruayle of the makynge of the glasse it selfe suche mater as it is made of, and of one worde comynge whole to an hundred eares at onys, and the syghte of one lytle eye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and beholdyng an whole greate countrey at onys, with a thousande suche other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayles mo, such as those that se them dayly done and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meruayle not at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, shall yet neuer be able, no not thys yonge man hym selfe, to gyue suche reason by what meane

they may be done, but that he maye haue suche repugnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce layde agaynst it, that he shall be fayne in conclusyon for the chyefe and the moste euydent reason to saye, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of all those thynges is bycause god that hath caused theym so to be done is almyghty of hym selfe &amp; can do what hym lyste. And also I can not se why it shulde be more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt that one body maye be by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of god in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at onys, than that two bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyes may be to gether in one place at onys. And that poynt I thynke thys yonge man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth not. And I verily thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke there is vnto mannes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son neyther more seblau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of difficulty nor of repugnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
<pb facs="tcp:4486:30"/>
neyther in the beynge of one body be it neuer so groce and vnglorified in twenty dyuers places at onys, than in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of all that whole world, in whyche all the bodyes both gloryfyed and vngloryfyed haue all theyr romys and pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, to make I saye all that hole world of ryght nought. whyche artycle of oure fayth we shall fynde folke wythin a whyle not greately force to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye, yf men fall to this poynt, that for impossibylytees of na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, they thynke the thynges impossyble also to god that is the mayster and the maker of nature / and that they wyll vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon that ymagynacyon do as thys yong man doth, flee fro the lytterall sense of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:4486:30"/>
and seke some allegorye in the stede, and saye they be dreuen therto by necessyte, by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause of the impossybylyte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mater. For thus shall as ye maye wel se, by thys meanes none artycle of oure faythe stande.</p>
            <p>Now hys laste argument wyth whych he proueth it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possyble for one body of Cryst to be in two places at onys is thys. you can sayeth he shewe no reason, why he sholde be in many places at onys and not in all. But i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all places he can not be / wherfore we muste co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clude that he can not be in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny places at onys. Thys is a meruelous concluded argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I am sure a very chylde maye sone se that thys conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb facs="tcp:4486:31"/>
can neuer folowe vpon those twoo premysses of hys antecedent. For he can no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude vpon them, but that we can shewe no reason why he sholde be in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at onys. Now yf I sholde graunte hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man could shewe a reason why he shulde be in many places at onys / what had he wonne by that? myght he then conclude there vpon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could not be in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny places at onys / as though that it were not possyble for god to make hys body in two places at onys, but if we were able to tell how, and why, and wherby, and shewe the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Now in thys argument he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gynneth wyth (sholde) in the maior / and than in the minor
<pb facs="tcp:4486:31"/>
and the conclusyon turneth in to (can) and so varyeth his ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tremytes, that the argument can neuer be good yf it were but for that. If he wolde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the conclusyon whych he concludeth here / he must haue rather haue argued thus. If it myghte be in many places at ones, than myghte it be in all places at onys. But in all places at onys it can not be / &amp; therfore it can not be in many places at ones. Thus or in some suche maner must he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, yf he wyll awghte proue. But here nowe bothe the par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tys of hys antecedent be very weke. The fyrste is thys, that yf the body of oure sauyoure maye be in many places at onys, it may be i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all places at
<pb facs="tcp:4486:32"/>
onys. Though I wold grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thys causale proposycyon for the trouth of the second part / yet wolde I denye it hym for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme. For though I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it to be trewe / yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrst parte is not the profe of the second / but rather contrary wyse the seconde inferreth well y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrst. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reason is good: he may be in all places, ergo he maye be in many. But argue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary wyse as thys yong man argueth, and than is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme very faynt. For this hath lytle strength: he maye be in many places, ergo he may be in all, many men ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, ergo all men ronne, men ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ergo men ronne in all pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces / but yf the mater mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne the argument, eyther by
<pb facs="tcp:4486:32"/>
the possybylyte of the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or by the necessyte of the consequent / as one man is a stone, ergo all men be stones, one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a lyuyng creature, ergo all men be lyuyng crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs. But let thys fyrst propo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sycyon passe and come now to the seconde, vppon whych all hys argument hangeth / that is, that the body of Chryste can not be at onys in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thys he sayeth / but how dothe he proue it. If he wyll byd me proue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affyrmatyue / I maye answere that I nede not, for it is not the thynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue in hande. For we do not saye that he is in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / for the sacrament is not at onys in all places. And we be not bounde for thys mater
<pb facs="tcp:4486:33"/>
to go any forther / &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poynte for so far I proue by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell that sayth it is so. And therfore thys yonge man that sayeth it can not be / lette hym proue that it may not be. For yf it maye be / he than confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that the wordes of Cryst do proue that it must be. But bycause it can not be sayth he / therfore he is dreuen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue these wordes by ani alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorye.

            <p>How be it as for me though I be not bounden to it / I am content yet to proue that god maye make the body of Cryst

to be in all places at onys. And bycause thys yonge man coupleth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> proposycyon with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tother / so wyll I do to. And I proue therfore that god can make hys body be bothe in many places at onys, and in all places at onys / by that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is almyghty, and therfore can do all thynge. And nowe muste thys yong man tell vs eyther that thys is nothynge, or els denye that god can do all thynge. And than muste he lymyte goddes power howe farre he wyll giue god leue to stretch it.
