            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

late Soueraygne of Famous Memory, for his desired <hi>Satisfaction about some of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Points, which with-held his Royall ioyning vnto the Church of Rome.</hi> The Authour when he penned them, did expect they should haue been kept within the priuate Library of his Princely Reading, and not made publike to the World, as afterward they were by a Doctour Minister, togeather with a Voluminous <hi>Reply,</hi> wherin he seekes to disgrace them, by much bitternes of speach, vttered in the violence of his Zeale.</p>
            <p>This imposed an Obligation vpon the Authour, to reuiew them agayne, and to set them forth whole and entiere, purged from the faults of hand-writing misprisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; cleered from the cloudes cast vpon them by ignorant Cauill; strenghthened with some new Collaterall Additions of more euident Explication and Proofe. Which Labours renewned &amp; published, we humbly offer vnto your most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maiesty, as vnto the Heyre, not only of your Renowned Fathers Dignity and State, but also of his Wisdome and Vertue,
<pb facs="tcp:2259:4"/>
in whome is perpetuated, as the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Bloud, so the Excellency of his Mind.</p>
            <p>And though it be their hard fortune to appeare in your Presence at the time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the light of your Royall Clemency is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes your Catholicke Subiects eclyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; yet for themselues, they confide to find some speciall Fauour, not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, or banished your Maiestyes Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, in that they be Natiffe of your Royall Fathers Command, by the Warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his Authority borne into the World, whose Sacred Pleasure, through pious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of Filiall Affection, You still reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence after his Discease.</p>
            <p>Neyther can it be for the credit of our Aduersaryes, or of their Cause, that free Accesse should be denyed vnto these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which (as themselues testify) were by the sound of Authority summoned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Combat, vpon supposition, that thereby, <hi>Our weakenes, and want of strength would manifestly appeare.</hi> For thus they write: <hi>The better to discouer their weaknes,</hi>

and visibility, the King imposed the Taske of writing vpon the Nine Questions, knowing our Aduersaryes to be cunning, and subtill in eluding our Arguments, but of no strength, especially in particular Questions, to proue their owne</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, <hi>or to confirme their Fayth by sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Auncient Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If after so solemne Inuitation vnto the Combat, if after so bold Promises that in these Writings, <hi>our weakenes would be discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> if after so great assurance giuen to their Credents, that we cannot confirme our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by Scripture, these challenged Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings be stayed by Authority, not to enter into the Field; this may yield vnto Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Protestants iust reason to suspect, <hi>that weaknes and want of strength,</hi> rather lyeth on their side; and that the Patrons of their Reformed Religion, place their confidence of Victory, rather in the Partiality of the State, then in the Euidence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the behalfe of their Doctrines.</p>
            <p>And, as these Tytles, euen the Credit of the Protestant Cause, pleade for the free permission of this Booke: so the Booke it selfe contaynes nothing that may cause the

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end (good Reader) thou mayst more cleerly conceaue the Scope of these Writings, I haue thought fit, to giue thee notice of some things, concerning the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto the <hi>Nine Poynts,</hi> and of the occasion thereof.</p>
            <p>I suppose, thou hast heard of some Conferences about matters of Religion, which passed between <hi>M. Iohn Fisher</hi> Iesuit on the one side, and <hi>D. Francis White</hi> Minister on the other, for the satisfaction of an Honourable Person that was moued to doubt, whether the Protestant were the true Church. At the second Conference our late Soueraigne King <hi>Iames</hi> being himselfe present, about the conclusion thereof imposed vpon <hi>M. Fisher</hi> a Taske of writing about some Questions of Controuersy, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb facs="tcp:2259:18"/>
sent a note contaying <hi>Nine Poynts,</hi> with this title of Superscription: <hi>Some of the Principall Poynts, which with-hold my ioyning vnto the Church of Rome, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept she reforme herselfe, or be able to giue me satisfaction, are these.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the true Occasion of <hi>M. Fishers</hi> writing, and the manner in which his Maiesty proposed the sayd <hi>Nine Questions</hi>: whereby thou mayst discouer the falshood of the Occasion pretended by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister <hi>D. White,</hi> to saue his owne credit, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit <hi>M. Fishers</hi> Relation of the Conference. He sayth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In his Preface to the Reader.</hi>
               </note> his Maiesty <hi>hauing well vnderstood of the Iesuits Cretizing Relation, &amp; of his dispersing hundreds of papers to his owne prayse, and to the disgrace of his Aduersaryes, THERFORE made the proposition of the Nine Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, that,</hi> the Iesuit answering them, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster replying agaynst his Answere, <hi>a publicke testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny might be extant, whereby men might iudge of the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the one, and insufficiency of the other.</hi> This is a Tale faygned vpon the fingers ends of the Writer thereof. For (besides that the superscription of the <hi>Nine Questions</hi> sheweth, his Maiesty had another intention in proposing them) his Maiesty layd the charge of writing vpon <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> at the second Conference when he had dispersed no papers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the particulars of the first Conference; yea the sayd Relation was not penned, nor the penning thereof begun, when the Note of the <hi>Nine Poynts</hi> was d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>liuered into his hands. So that it is a meere Fable, that his Maiesty iudged the Iesuits Relation of the Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rences to be Cretizing and false, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charged him with the obligation of writing.</p>
            <p>And in my Iudgment the Minister is not aduised
<pb facs="tcp:2259:18"/>
in confessing, that according to <hi>M. Fishers</hi> Relation, his carriage in the Conference was most shameful, <hi>That a Schoole-boy of thirteen yeares old,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Preface to the Reader.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>could not haue been more vnskillful, and childish.</hi> This Confession, (I say) cannot but be a stayne to his Cause &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Iudgement of most men, the foresayd Relation being of such Credit, and in substance so exactly true, as none of the Honourable Audience disclaymed from it; yea, which is more, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Counter-narration ready and prepared, as he sayth, for the print, durst neuer appeare agaynst it. Whereof no doubt the reason is, for that he saw that his printed narration must eyther be notoriously false, with da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to be proclaymed a falsifyer by the Honourable Audience, or else in substance agree with <hi>M. Fishers,</hi> which he doth acknowledge to be so much to his discredit.</p>
            <p>Agayne, the Minister (which was the cause <hi>M. Fisher</hi> published his Relation) had by word of mouth vttered vaunting reportes of his owne victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, and of his putting <hi>M. Fisher</hi> to a <hi>Non-plus,</hi> by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments he neuer proposed; yea concerning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersyes that were not touched. In his printed Narration, these triumphant arguments could ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue been well omitted, nor hamsomely set downe. If he should haue omitted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his Credents would haue been scandalized, perceauing he doth delude them by verball Reports which he dares not vtter in print. If he should haue set them downe, the Honourable Audience would haue been offended to see the Cause (as they suppose) of Truth, mantay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by such exorbitant Falshood.</p>
            <p>This is the true Reason he is so silent in print
<pb facs="tcp:2259:19"/>
about the particulars of the Confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, only doing his endeauour to disgrace the Iesuit in generall tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes saying, <hi>That he vanished away from before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty with foyle and disgrace, his Maiesty telling him, he neuer heard a Verier</hi> 
               <note n="(*)" place="margin">Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a <hi>Foole</hi> or <hi>Asse.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A report so false, as the Minister contradicts the same himselfe elsewhere, writing to the contrary,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face towards the end: and Reply to the Iesuits Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face initio.</hi>

            <p>Now concerning the Answere it selfe to the <hi>Nine Poynts, M. Fisher</hi> hauing receaued the note, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently addressed himselfe to comply with his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styes Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, being encouraged thereunto by the Title, shewing his Maiestyes desire of ioyning vnto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> could he be satisfyed about some Poynts. And as he imployed therein his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test strength, so likewise he was carefull to vse the expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that was required, atchieuing the Worke in lesse then a moneth, though the same was not so soone deliuered into his Maiestyes hands. This expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was likewise the cause, that he did omit the discussion of the <hi>Ninth Poynt, About the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to depose Kings.</hi> For being bound by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of his Generall, giuen to the whole Order, not to
<pb facs="tcp:2259:19"/>
publish any thing of that Argument, without sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the same first to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be reuiewed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, his Answere to that Poynt could not haue been performed without very longe expectation &amp; delay. And he was the more bold to pretermit that Controuersy, in regard that sundry whole Treatises about the same, written by Iesuits and others, both Secular &amp; Religions, had been lately printed: These Authours so fresh and new, he was sure were not vnknowne to his Maiesty, nor was it needfull that any thinge should be added. Also knowing that commonly Kings be not so willing to heare the proofes of Coerciue Authority ouer them, be the same neuer so certayne, he iudged by this omission, the rest of his Treatise might be more gratefull, and find in his Maiestyes breast lesse disaffection &amp; resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance agaynst the Doctrine thereof. Nor could he thinke, that his Iudicious Maiesty, being persuaded of the other eight Points, would haue been stayd from ioyning vnto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Nynth, <hi>Of the Popes Authority ouer Kings</hi>; the Doctrine of the Protestant Church about the Authority of the people, and of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth in such cases, being farre more disgracefull &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. And this forbearance is not,<note place="margin">

cleerely declare his Fayth about the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, his Maiesty telling him, <hi>he liked him the better,</hi> in respect of his playnesse. This notwithstanding, there is no man of Learning &amp; Discretion, but will acknowledge, that <hi>a Constant Deuine</hi> may put off the Scholasticke Tractatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of some Poynt of Fayth that is lesse pleasing, vntill the Auditours, by being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of Articles that do lesse distast, be made more capable of the truth, towardes which by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection they are not so prone.</p>

            <p>Concerning the manner of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling these Points, the Minister graunting the Iesuite sheweth himselfe <hi>well verst in Controuersy,</hi> addeth,<note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>he is deficient of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine proofe in euery Article, and farre more specious in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluding our Arguments, then happy in confirming his owne.</hi> What reason he may haue to giue this ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sure of the Treatise I do not see, but only that he would say something agaynst it, and no better exception oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred: otherwise it is cleere, that in euery Article the Answerer vrgeth not only the Tradition of the Church, not only the consent of Fathers, but also sundry Texts and Testimonyes of Scripture. And he doth not only (which is the Ministers tricke) score Bookes, Chapters, Verses, without so much as citing the wordes, nor only doth he produce the wordes of the Text, but also refuteth the Protestant Answeres, by the rules of interpretation themselues commend, by recourse vnto the Originalls; by the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Texts, Antecedent, and Consequent; by the drift and scope of the discourse; by Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of other places, specially by the expresse Letter and proper sense of Gods word. He sheweth that Protestants pretending to appeale vnto Scripture, interpreted from within it selfe, as vnto the supreme Iudge, in very truth appeale from the expresse sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of diuine Scripture vnto the figuratiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their humane conceyte. For in euery Point of these Controuersyes, they are proued to
<pb facs="tcp:2259:21"/>
leaue the litterall sense of some Text of Scripture, without euident warrant from the sayd Scripture so to doe, vpon Arguments at the most probable, vnto which themselues say, <hi>specious Answeres</hi> are made, yea vpon the Arguments that haue neyther substance, nor seemelines, neyther forme, nor <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciosity</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>And this will be more cleerly confirmed by the ensuing Confutation of the Ministers Reply, which agaynst the Answere vnto the <hi>Nine Points</hi> came forth at last after two yeares expectation. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that his Booke being <hi>long before finished, &amp; ready for the print,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>he stayed that he might cite word by word the sentences of the Authours, quoted in his margent; that so his worke might be more vsefull vnto such as want the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Libraryes.</hi> Which excuse to be false his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents proclayme in innumerable places. I should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke, considering the circumstances of the tyme (if his booke was so longe before ready) that another reason stayed the printing thereof. You may remember, that the Catholickes of <hi>England</hi> by the Clemency of our late Soueraigne during those two yeares had more calme dayes, and a season of some more freedome, then many yeares before they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed. Whereby the mindes of Protestants became more free &amp; vnpartiall, more erected to vnderstand the issue of the Controuersyes betweene them and vs, and lesse vnwilling to see the Catholicke Truth, which now they might with lesse trouble &amp; danger imbrace. Wherfore the Ministers booke not daring to appeare in these sunneshine dayes of more sincere and vnpassionate iudgment, was by him reserued to be published, when the Skye should be darkened
<pb facs="tcp:2259:21"/>

For when former amity and peace with Catholicke Princes began to be shaken, when the Parlament was hoat in petitioning for a persecution of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks with vttermost rigour, then presently went the Ministers booke to the presse, and not longe after (when the Decree for Persecution was enacted) came forth secure and ioyfull,<note place="margin">

            <p>And who shall with indifferency reuiew the booke, may find the same had good reason to fly the light, being euery where full of afflictiue Tearmes, and spitefull Inuectiues, which can giue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but only to mindes dimmed with the extremest passion of dislike, who take pleasure to read not what may conuince and conuert, but what may grieue and gall the Aduersaryes. Wherein the Iesuit hath some cause to complayne, that his Answere being so moderate and temperate, without any sharpe tearmes agaynst Protestants, still excusing their Errours &amp; Mistakings, by the forwardnes of their Zeale; he hath reason, I say, to grieue, that his Treatise written with such Charity, and Modesty, and this not vpon his owne pleasure, but enforced
<pb facs="tcp:2259:22"/>
by his Maiesties Command, could not find in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland a proportionable Reply, tending towardes a calme cleering of the truth, but was set vpon by fierce Reproaches, as if he had been vrged to write for no other end, but that a Minister might haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to disgorge towardes him, and his Religion, the bitternes of his gall.</p>
            <p>It is true, that with these reproachful discourses, the Minister hath mingled matters of substance, that is, all the principall Shifts deuised by others, and which he could deuise himselfe, to giue a shew to his Religion, or to obscure the light and euidence of the Catholicke; which had he set downe learnedly and calmely, without the admixtion of so much ragefull Impertinency, his Booke had been of lesser bulke: Whereby also, one good peece of this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder</hi> might haue beene spared, to wit, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure prefixed before the same.</p>
            <p>My purpose indeed, was to haue passed ouer his bitter Inuectiues &amp; large impertinencies with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and only haue touched what is really of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: but the request of friends wonne me to the contrary. For they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering, that many be carryed away to their perdition, not by the Ministers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but by their opinion thereof, thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary I should prefixe a Discouery of his In-side, in the beginning of this <hi>Reioynder,</hi> as he hath placed a faire Picture of his Out-side, with diuers glorious Emblems to his Honour, vpon the front of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. In which prefixed <hi>Censure,</hi> in euery passage thereof matters of substance are handled; yet my principall drift is to make the same a <hi>Picture,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Ministers Ignorance in all sorts of Sciences,
<pb facs="tcp:2259:22"/>
&amp; his falsifying of all kinds of Authours is set forth, not with the black Coale of bare verball Accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the <hi>Reioynder,</hi> which is collaterally ioyned with the Text of the Answere vnto the <hi>Nine Poynts,</hi> the matters of substance in the Ministers Reply, that indeed may breed doubt to men not perfectly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are refuted: The difficulty is not dissembled, nor shu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, the same is set downe commonly in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters words, with the whole force &amp; pith thereof summed togeather, the Refutation presently follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not by the sole contradiction of words, but by the oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of reasons. These, as they be ordinarily still <hi>of number,</hi> so I hope the Reader will find them to be likewise <hi>of waight,</hi> that pondering them, and comparing them with the Ministers, in the ballance of vnpartiall iudgment, he will easily see towards whom the doctrine not only of Christian Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but also of the holy Scripture inclineth.</p>
            <p>If any wonder that this Treatise came forth no sooner the tyme being more then an yeare and a halfe since the Ministers Reply was printed; let him consider, that it was a good while after the printing thereof, before the same came to my hands, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my absence &amp; great distance from London. The booke is huge and vast, that to read the same attentiuely tyme and disoccupation is required. The Vastnes thereof was likewise the cause the same could not be confuted <hi>Verbatim</hi> (which had been
<pb facs="tcp:2259:23"/>
easy) without making a Booke as bigge as <hi>Calepine,</hi> with great and vnnecessary charges; which also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so bigge, would neuer haue found passage, and vtterance in tymes of difficulty. Hence the Reioyner was forced not only to reade his huge Volume at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely, but also to choose and summe togeather what the Reply contayneth of substance, seuering the same from the drosse of impertinent Reproach, which cost him both tyme and labour. Besides about the tyme this Worke should haue gone to the print aboue a yeare agoe, they that should haue concurred vnto the printing thereof, were called to another place by their necessary occasions, and stayd away more then halfe a yeare; in which case we haue not the choyce of Printers, that Protestants inioy.</p>
            <p>Of thee (Gentle Reader) in requitall of my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours I require no more, then that to the perusing of them thou wilt bring an vnpartiall minde, free from preiudicate opinion, raysed by Pulpit-inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiues, and Popular Reports; free I say, from human regards, affected vnto the Truth of Saluation, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued when the same appeares not to be kept from the imbracing therof through the feare of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.

In your solution of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, grounded on the word <hi>accipite, take,</hi> to shew both your Grammaticall and Scripturall erudition,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2259:37"/>
yow write in this sorte: <hi>The Iesuit imagineth that all taking is with the hand, and thus he proueth himselfe to be neither good Grammarian, nor Deuine. Virgil saith,</hi> illos porticibus Rex accipiebat in amplis, <hi>where</hi> accipio <hi>is to entertaine. S. Paul saith,</hi> per quem accepimus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam. Rom. 1.5. <hi>By whome we haue receaued grace and Apostleship. c.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Yee haue receaued</hi> (accepistis) <hi>the spirit of adoption. The Angell said, Ioseph thou sonne of Dauid, feare not to take Mary thy wife, Matt.</hi> 1.20. <hi>His Bishopricke let another man take,</hi> Act. 1.20. Thus yow, very learnedly as yow thinke; so that you dare accuse the Iesuite as neither good <hi>Gramarian nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine.</hi> Giue Iesuits I pray you, leaue to examine your learning before they yield that you be their maister both in Grammer and Diuinity, as you challenge to be.</p>
                        <p>First, what blindnes is it in yow to say, that <hi>the Iesuit imagineth that all taking is with the hand?</hi> Doth he not in this place most expressely say, men may take meate out of the hand of another, with their hand immediatly, or with their mouth? He suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth then, that there is other taking then with the hand; but proues in this text, <hi>take, eate, drinke,</hi> that <hi>take</hi> must needes command <hi>taking</hi> with the hand, not immediatly with the mouth. For (as he saith) in this text, take, eate, drinke, <hi>take</hi> commands such a kind of taking of meate offered, as is distinct from eating therof, and not inuolued therin: But to take with the mouth is inuolued in eating, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therin. <hi>Ergo,</hi> in this text, take, eate, drinke, <hi>take</hi> cannot be vnderstood of taking immediatly with the mouth, but with the hand.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If the Iesuit were so simple as yow

The scripture saith, <hi>Yee haue receaued grace, the Apostleship, the spirit of adoption,</hi> therfore all corporall taking is not with the hand. The Angell said to S.

Hence in lawfull forme in the third figure, followes this conclusion, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Roman is the one, holy, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, &amp; Apostolike Church.</p>
                        <p>Your second fault is grosser then the first. For you know not the quality of Propositions, nor can discerne a negatiue from an affirmatiue, which is as great simplicity in Logicke, yea greater then in Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer not to know the termination of the second De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clension from the first. You say, in the Iesuits Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both propositions are pure affirmatiue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his <hi>Minor</hi> is in part negatiue, to wit, Protestants receaued the Scripture from no other but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Who feeles not this proposition to be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly negatiue, wherein is denyed, that any Church besides the Roman, is that Church from which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants can pretend the Scriptures, to wit, authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, or by assured perpetuall Tradition, hand to hand from the Apostles?

                           <hi>Exposition</hi> of them is to be made into two single propositions, whereof the one is negatiue, the other affirmatiue. So the Iesuites proposition <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants receaued Scripture by no other Church but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> being exceptiue, is to be expounded by a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, <hi>No Church not Roman, is the Church from which Protestants receaued Scripture</hi>; and also by an affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, <hi>The Church from which Protestants receaued Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the Roman.</hi> Hence the Iesuit, as he did conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in a forme of the third figure called <hi>Disamis,</hi> his

                        <p>Your third fault is, not to know the forme of Expository Syllogismes from the common An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository syllogisme is that, wherein the meanes of proofe is a singular and indiuiduall thing, in which kind it is good forme to argue affirmatiuely in any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure euen in the second. For example this sillogisme: The Minister grossely ignorant in Logicke, replyed agaynst <hi>M. Fisher.</hi> The Deane of Carlile is he who replyed against <hi>M. Fisher. Ergo,</hi> the Deane of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liele is the Minister grossely ignorant of Logicke This sillogisme is in the second figure, and both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are affirmatiue; yet if you deny the forme of arguing to be good, you will but confirme the truth of the conclusion. Hence the Iesuit might in good forme haue argued affirmatiuely in the second figure, in this manner. The One, Holy, Catholike, &amp; Apostolicall Church, is that Church from which Protestants pretend to haue the Scriptures authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: The Roman is that Church from which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants pretend to haue the Scriptures authentical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Roman is the <hi>One, Holy, Catholike, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall Church.</hi>

that is, hath foure different termes, whereas all true forme of arguing ought to haue only three. <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is one terme, <hi>Modell and patterne of the rest,</hi> a second, <hi>Most excellent in euery kind,</hi> a third, <hi>the most excellent part,</hi> a fourth: for it is not all one to say the excellent thing in euery kind, &amp; the most excellent part of many partes. Amongst whole and totall things, the most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in euery kind may in some sort be said to be the patterne of the rest, but amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst parts, the most excellent is not the ground of the rest.</p>
                        <p>In substantuall Compounds, the substantiall forme is more excellent then the substantiall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet the substantiall forme is not the ground of the matter; yea rather the matter is the ground of the forme, being the fundamentall &amp; radicall cause out of which materiall formes are produced. Who sees not that Walles, Chambers, and Galleryes are more excellents parts of the house, and more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull then the fundations? Yet the fundations are more prime, originall, and wheron the Walls, and Chambers depend, and are kept in being. In this manner the word of God as written, is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, in respect of deep and profound learning, then Tradition, yet the word as deliuered by Tradition is more prime, originall, fundamentall; because it is the sole ground and foundation, by which wee know which is the word of God the Apostles deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in writing. Hence yow are such a Bungler in Logicke, as yow vndertake to proue one thing, and conclude another. Yow vndertake <note n="(h)" place="margin">

conclude, <hi>that the written word is the patterne, and modell of all other kinds of</hi> Diuine Reuelations. Now to be the <hi>ground</hi> of the rest, is different from to be the <hi>patterne</hi> of the rest; yea the ground of thinges is seldome or neuer the patterne of them. The grape by common consent is held the most excellent of all kind of fruite, and so by your rule, the modell and patterne of the rest; yet the grape is not the ground, the roote, and seed of all other fruite; nor do all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruite spring and proceed from it.</p>

Hence your conclusion, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, or he that is fundamentally built, is built on the Scripture, is affirmatiue, in the second figure.

                        <p>Thus you; giuing vs great cause to commiserate your blindnes, that disputing so ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly you should conclude so arrogantly. You haue in the place by you quoted, <note n="(r)" place="margin">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2259:53"/>
First, that it is Pious and Godly to read Scriptures with deuotion, with humility, with submission of iudgement vnto the teaching of the Church, and common Exposition of Catholike Doctours. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the practise of reading by Lay people was common &amp; frequent in the Primitiue Church, for the time that the learned Languages were vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly knowne, in which tongues the Church ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now doth, nor euer did prohibit the reading of Scriptures vnto any person. These two things we approue; so that you are vnaduised (might I not say impudent?) in your affirming that, <hi>The Papists impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deny this to haue been a Primitiue practise.</hi> No, we deny not the reading of Scripture with due humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to be pious, or to haue been a primitiue practise, but onely two proud Noueltyes brought in by your Religion. First, that it <note n="(s)" place="margin">The very wordes of your brother Iohn in <hi>His VVay pag.</hi> 126.</note> is <hi>lawfull, yea necessary for euery particular man, by the Scripture to</hi> EXAMINE, <hi>and</hi> IVDGE <hi>of the things the Church teacheth him. And when</hi> A PRIVATE MAN <hi>by Scripture reiects and condemnes the teaching of the</hi> GREATEST, <hi>and</hi> BEST CHVRCH <hi>that is, his</hi> IVDGEMENT <hi>is not to be taken as</hi> PRIVATE, <hi>but as</hi> SPIRITVALL, <hi>and the</hi> PVBLIKE <hi>Censure of</hi> THE SPIRIT. Secondly, that all, euen Laymen, by diuine Pretext and Ordinance, are bound to read the Scriptures, &amp; to haue them in their vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
                        <p>This your doctrine; This your practise we dislike, as dangerous, as impious, as the fountaine of Discord, of Heresy, and of manifold most damnable errours. A doctrine, which were it euery where esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, not <hi>Dagon</hi> before the <hi>Arke,</hi> but Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity would fall before, and yield vnto the Diuell: as

Thus much we see, it hath already made</hi> THOVSANDS so HEADSTRONGE <hi>euen in</hi> GROSSE and PALPABLE ERRORS, <hi>as that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whose capacity will scarce serue him to vtter fiue words in sensible manner,</hi> BLVSHETH <hi>not for</hi> MATTER <hi>of</hi> SCRIPTVRE <hi>to thinke his owne bare Yea, as good as the Nay of all the wise, graue, and learned men that are in the world: which insolency must be represt, or it will the</hi> VERY BANE <hi>of Christian Religion.</hi> Behold open Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion extorted vpon the racke of Truth, by which we may perceaue, how fully and handsomely your Doctrine (that it is necessary, and Diuine Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that euery particular man read Scripture, and by it examine and iudge the Churches teaching) hath made <hi>Dagon</hi> to fall before the <hi>Arke.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But leauing the vanity of your bitter vanting, let vs examine what demonstrations out of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you bring for your pretended Diuine Ordinance, which with so much confidence you auerre. If your arguing be idle and ridiculous in this point, wherin yow professe to be so confident, what may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of you in other articles? Especially being challenged to shew your vttermost force by your aduersary, affirming <note n="(u)" place="margin">

                        <p>Your arguments be seauen, drawne from 7. texts of Scripture, in which your Antecedent common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is eyther false or vncertayne, and your inference ridiculous.</p>

                           <hi>Eunuch is commended for reading holy Scripture; Ergo</hi> it is <hi>a diuine Ordinance</hi> that ignorant Laymen read Scripture in their vulgar tongue: Your Antecedent is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Scripture doth expresse.

                              <hi>Act.</hi> 8.28.</note> sayth, <hi>he was sitting in his Chariot, &amp; reading the Prophet Esay.</hi> But suppose he be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his reading (as it was indeed commendable) is it consequent, that therefore euery Christian, by Diuine order and precept, do the like? Is euery man bound by diuine precept, to doe euery thing for which any person is praysed in Scripture? Dauid is commended in Scripture for rising at midnight to prayse God; is this Argument good, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Euery Christian is bound by diuine precept to rise at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night? Verily this consequence is as good, yea better both in respect of forme and matter, then is this of yours: The Enunch is commended for reading holy Scripture; <hi>Ergo,</hi> euery man is bound to read Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by <hi>diuine ordinance.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Beroeans are called Noble by the holy Ghost for searching the Scriptures.</hi> Ergo, we may with great confidence auouch, that it is a diuine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that all ignorant Laymen read Scripture in the vulgar. A strong argument. The Scripture doth not say the Beroeans read the Scripture in their vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue, nor doth it tearme them <hi>Noble</hi> for their reading of Scripture, but for their receauing the word of Paul with alacrity and ioy. Yea the tearme of <hi>The more noble,</hi> is not giuen them in prayse of their Religion, but to declare the quality of their Gentry: and so <hi>Fulke</hi> his Bible hath <hi>the Noblest</hi> for byrth.

                           <hi>Blessed is he that readeth and heareth: Ergo</hi> it is <hi>a diuine ordinance,</hi> that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; that the Church giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Scripture trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into all vulgar tongues. Here you not only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue impertinently, but also detruncate &amp; curtall the text of Gods Word, leauing out words without which the text hath a false and foolish sense. <hi>For if all be blessed that read and heare,</hi> without mention or care of what, then they be blessed who read or heare Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; Virgill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the bookes of Knighthood.

Blessed is he that readeth, or heareth the Apocalyps: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a diuine ordinance that none be blessed but such as read Scripture.</p>
                        <p>The fourth argument; <hi>The Galathians read the Scripture; Ergo,</hi> it is a diuine ordinance that ignorant laymen read them, and that they be translated into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery vulgar Dialect. That the Galathians read the Scriptures you prooue by the cypher of Galat. 4.24. where the Apostle sayth, <hi>you that will be vnder the Law, haue you not read the Law? For it is written, Abraham had two Sonnes.</hi> This proofe is very poore. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth not affirme they read, but doubtingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds whether they had not read one particle of Scripture? Also, the question was mooued without doubt only to the learned Galathians But suppose they read the Scripture; is it lawfull thence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Ergo</hi> they read it in their vulgar? If they read it in their vulgar, is it thence consequent, <hi>Ergo,</hi> euery man is bound by diuine ordinance to read, and this so strictly as the Church may not forbid translations vnto such as abuse them?</p>
                        <p>The fifth place; <hi>The Ephesians read the Scripture; Ergo,</hi> it is a <hi>diuine precept</hi> that ignorant Laymen read the Scripture in their vulgar tongue. The antecedent you shew by the cypher <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.4. where the Apostle sayth, <hi>Reading, you may vnderctand my wisdome in the Mistery of Christ</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A seely proofe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not say, that the <hi>Ephesians</hi> read, but only, that by reading his Epistle, they might vnderstand his wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But suppose they read S Pauls Epistle sent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; doth it follow, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a diuine ordinance that Laymen promiscuously read Scripture? and that the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2259:56"/>
Church must translate Scripture to that end? This inference as euen as good as this: By reading the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> one may vnderstand the great knowledge he had of Christ; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Euery man is bound to read S. <hi>Peters</hi> Epistles.</p>
                        <p>The sixt; <hi>The Colossians read the Scripture; Ergo,</hi> it is a diuine ordinance that all ignorant Laymen read the Scripture. The antecedent is by you proued by the cypher <hi>Coloss.</hi> 4.16. which sayth, <hi>When this Epistle hath been read amongst you, cause it also to be read in the Church of Loadicea.</hi> This place doth not proue your intent, that they read so much as that Epistle priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, but only that the same was publikely read in the Church by the Bishop, or the Priest, or some Church officer in the same la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage wherin it was written originally. But suppose the Colossians read this Epistle priuately by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, what a woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den inference is this, <hi>Ergo,</hi> euery Christian is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by diuine ordinance to read Scripture? Or, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church is obliged by diuine precept to prouide, that the Scripture be translated into vulgar tongues?</p>
                        <p>The seauenth Argument; <hi>The Thessalonians read the Scripture; Ergo,</hi> the reading thereof by ignorant Laymen is a diuine ordinance. The antecedent you prooue by the cypher 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.25. which sayth, <hi>I adiure you, that this Epistle be read vnto all holy brethren.</hi> Neyther doth this text prooue priuate reading of Scripture by Laymen, but only publik reading ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the Church. But suppose they priuately read this Epistle sent them by the Apostle, is it conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>Ergo,</hi> all Laymen are bound to read Scripture, and the Church to translate the same into euery tongue? Truly this argument is euen as good as this, God
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2259:56"/>
created heauen and earth of nothing: <hi>Ergo</hi> Ministers may make arguments of nothing, or make argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts good that haue nothing in them. Or, as this: In the beginning was the word, &amp; the word was with God, <hi>Ergo</hi> euery godly person is bound to read the Scripture word by word from the beginning of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,</hi> to the end of the Apocalyps: Or, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Godly persons do nothing els but read Scripture.</p>

                        <p>Nor can you say, that when you affirme <hi>Religious Worship</hi> to be due to God only, you meane <hi>primary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Adoration,</hi> and that consequently you doe not contradict your selfe in saying, that <hi>secondary Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Adoration</hi> is due vnto Ministers. This euasion (I say) will not serue your turne, because you declare in expresse tearmes, that all <hi>Religious adoration, primary</hi> or <hi>secondary,</hi> is due to God only. Thus you write pag. 322. <hi>Whereas the Iesuite doth distinguish two kinds of Religious Worship, the one Primary and simply Diuine, founded vpon the increate and infinite Excellency, which is due to God only: the other Secondary, founded vpon the created Excellency of grace and glory, which is yielded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Saints and Angells. To this we reply, that there be no
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2259:57"/>
other kinds of worship, then there be Tables of the morall law; but there are only two tables of the morall Law, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer whereof teacheth diuine worship, and the second hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, ciuill, and of speciall obseruance. And if there be a mixt worship partly human, partly diuine, so much thereof as is diuine, is proper to God, and may not be imparted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any creature,</hi> Isa. 42.8. <hi>Where God sayth, My glory I will not giue to another.</hi> Thus you.

and yet you say, <hi>that vnto the Sacraments, and Word of the Ghospell</hi> Religious adoration is due, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue a relatiue vnion with God How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is <hi>Religious adoration</hi> due to God only?

                        <p>Thirdly, you haue ouerthrowne and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all you said about the second of the <hi>Nine points,</hi> to wit, against Oblations vnto the Virgin Mary. <hi>In the old Law</hi> (say you) <hi>not onely Sacrifices, but also Vowes and Oblations were made to God onely,</hi>

For what more daily and quotidian then for men to make presents, and oblations the one to the other,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2259:58"/>
specially vnto Kings and Princes in testimony of their duty? But as I say, your discourse is vaine, not onely in respect of your idle cyphering of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but also because your selfe demolish this your Doctrine, by saying, or supposing the contrary, to wit, that Oblations by way of Religion, may be made vnto Ministers. That this is by yow supposed, I proue.</p>
                        <p>To shew that Ministers are Religiously to be adored, you cypher 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. where <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith of the Church of <hi>Macedonia:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Reply pa.</hi> 224. <hi>lin.</hi> 26.</note> 
                           <hi>They gaue themselues first vnto God, &amp; then by the will of God, vnto vs.</hi> By which text you cannot conclude <hi>Religious Adoration</hi> to be due vnto Ministers, but by arguing in this manner: They vnto whom men by way of Religion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion giue &amp; offer themselues, are Religiously ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, because oblations be Diuine &amp; Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: The Church of <hi>Macedonia</hi> did by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and deuotion, offer themselues vnto <hi>S. Paul,</hi> because he was a Minister: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Vnto Ministers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious adoration is to be giuen. This I say must be the force of your argument. For if the <hi>Macedonians</hi> did not by way of Religion, &amp; deuotion offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto <hi>S. Paul,</hi> how can you shew that by giuing themselues vnto him, they did Religiously adore him, because he was a Minister? Now, if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that gifts and oblations by way of Religion may be made vnto Ministers, your discourse against Oblations vnto Saints is eueruated, and falleth to the ground. For thus I argue. If oblations may be made to God onely, why are they made vnto Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters? If they may be made vnto creatures, why not vnto Saints and Angells, as well as vnto Ministers?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2259:59"/>
If oblations be proper vnto God, how dare Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters make themselues fellowes with God in this point of his Honour? If they be not proper vnto God, why do you reprooue vs for offering gifts, and vowes vnto the blessed Virgin his Mother? Heere you are so taken, that you cannot shift away, nor euade.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly and principally, by this doctrine that <hi>Religious Adoration is due vnto Ministers,</hi> you ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe all you say in the <hi>Third point</hi> against giuing worship, specially <hi>Religious</hi> vnto blessed Saints and Angells For if Ministers may be religiously adored with reference vnto God, why not Saints, why not Angells? You alleadge <note n="(d)" place="margin">

But I pray you, be not Angells Gods Messengers as much as Ministers, yea in a more high, holy, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent sort, being all ministring Spirits sent in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice for them, that partake the inheritance of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.23.</p>

we should honour you with <hi>Religious Adoration</hi>?</p>
                        <p>You produce <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.14. where the Apostle saith vnto the <hi>Galathians; You receyued me as an Angell of God, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Christ Iesus.</hi> Who seeth not that this maks rather for adoration of Angells then of Mynisters?

And if you cannot, why may not we argue agaynst your worships as you argue agaynst Images pag. 233. <hi>I am taught by learned Vasquez that the Diuell may lurke in Images, and our Aduersary cannot proue that Christ is present, or assistant vnto them.

                        <p>Hence, though your paradoxe, that the Church which hath a wicked man for Pastor cannot be the true Church, were true &amp; your tale, that some Popes haue been wicked, were also graunted; yet it is not hence consequent, that the Romane Church is not now the true Church, but at the most that it was not the true Church for the tyme that it had some wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Pope for supreme Pastour.</p>
                        <p>Secondly you contradict your selfe about the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that wicked Pastours cannot faithfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and deliuer the true word of saluation: for pag. 52. you thus write to the contrary. <hi>The promises of Christ made to the Church concerning his presence &amp; assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to his Sacraments, preached and administred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his commandement are fulfilled, when</hi> WIC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KED <hi>Persons execute the office, and performe the worke of outward Ministry.

then may wicked persons faythfully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly deliuer Apostolicall Traditions about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Saluation. This sequele I proue.

That without which the word of Christ cannot be true in the proper and literall sense, is inforced, and prooued by the word of Christ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the literall sense: But except the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread be absent, and Christ in lieu thereof present, according to his corporall substance, the word of Christ, <hi>This is my body,</hi> cannot be true in the literall and proper sense, as you affirme: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, and the presence of Christ on earth, according to his bodily substance in lieu of bread, is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2259:64"/>
inforced, &amp; proued by the literall sense of the word of Christs institution. Wherfore to professe (as you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is not this to professe Infidelity?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, you may say, that when you require that we demonstrate by testimony of Scripture, that a body may be in two places at once, you meane not that we bring texts of Scripture that demonstrate by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how this is possible, but only that we bring places that expresly say that, <hi>This is possible vnto God.</hi> For as you say pag. 438. <hi>In the wordes of our Sauiour,</hi> This is my body, <hi>there is not a sillable concerning accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts without a subiect, or of a bodyes being in two places at once, or concerning any miracle wrought by Gods omnipotency.</hi> I answere, that likewise in this text of Scripture, <note n="(s)" place="margin">

                           <hi>The Word was made flesh,</hi> there is not a sillable, that a perfect substantiall nature can exist without proper personality, or that two complete natures can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist togeather in the same <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> nor of any mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle done by the diuine omnipotency; yet because this text of Scripture about the mistery of the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be true in the literall sense, except those hard &amp; incomprehensible things be graunted to be possible by diuine omnipotency, we must togeather with the mistery implicitly belieue, that God can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate proper subsistance from complete substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all natures, that two natures infinitly distant in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, can subsist in the same Hypostasis, though the Scripture doth not expressely so affirme. In like
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2259:65"/>
manner though the words of Christ, <hi>This is my body,</hi> do not expressely say, that his body may be in many places at once, nor that accidents can exist without a subiect by diuine omnipotency, yet because this his word whereon we grounde our fayth concerning this mistery, cannot (as your selfe graunt) be true in the proper and literall sense, except Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and the Presence of his body in many places at once be belieued; hence we must togeather with the reall presence and litterall sense of Gods word, implicitely belieue these miracles to be done.

And this Example may serue, as a patterne how insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and impertinently you answere the Iesuites argument. The Iesuit <hi>pag.</hi> 406. argueth in this sort: <hi>Christ doth affirme that the Sacrament is truly, really, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially (not the figure, and effect of his body, but) his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2259:65"/>
very body: but how can consecrated bread be termed tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, really, and substantially the body of Christ, if his body be not so much as in the same place with it?</hi> Thus you ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were pag. 406. <hi>To the effecting hereof, locall &amp; corporall presence is not necessary. A Father and his Sonne may be absent by distance of place one from the other, yet the Sonne is</hi> TRVLY AND REALLY VNITED <hi>with his Father, so as his Fathers nature is in him, and he hath right in his Fathers person and state. A mans goods may be at Constantinople, and yet he liuing in England is a true possessour and owner of them, and he may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and vse them, and distance of place hindreth not his right and propriety. Now, although there be a difference betweene things temporall and spirituall, yet thus farre there is agreement, that euen as we possesse temporall things being locally absent, so likewise we may receyue and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take Christs body and bloud by the power of Fayth, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Holy Ghost, according to a celestiall and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall manner.</hi> Thus you. Now behold how many wayes yow discouer grosse Ignorance in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</p>
                        <p>First, were all that you say true, yet is it imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and ineptly brought in answere of the Iesuits argument. For the question is not, whether men may receiue by the vertue of Fayth and donation of the holy Ghost, sanctity and grace through the merits of Christs body and bloud that are absent (for this al acknowledge to happen in Baptisme, and to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in the Eucharist, if Christ had so ordained:) The question is about the truth of Gods word whether consecrated bread may be truly and really called the body of Christ, being (as you say) a thing not only indiuidually distinct, but also locally distant from
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2259:66"/>
his body. A man being in <hi>London</hi> may possesse iuridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally an Horse that is in the Countrey, is it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true to say, that this man in London is truly &amp; really the Horse in the Countrey? A Merchant in <hi>London</hi> may haue great treasures of money in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and a right to lay them vp in his Coffers at <hi>London,</hi> may one therfore shewing his empty cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers at <hi>London</hi> say truly, this is a treasure of money? In like manner, suppose (which is false) that a man hath iuridicall authority ouer Christs body absent, and existing in heauen, to dispose therof at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, may he therfore be sayd to be truly and really Christs body? May one therefore shewing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, being in your <hi>Tenet</hi> an empty thing in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of containing Christs bodily substance, say tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therof, This is really Christs body and corporall substance? who will maintaine such absurdities that is sober? Wherefore your discourse that a man may truly posesse a thing absent, serues nothing to satisfy the Iesuites question, how can consecrated bread be truly, verily, &amp; really the body of Christ, if he be not so much as present in place with it?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, what more absurd then what you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that a man may not only in right possesse, but really and truly vse his things that be absent? Can a man in London vse, and ride on his horse that is at Yorke! Or a Merchant in Bristow feed on his grapes that are growing in his vineyard in Spayne? If they cannot (and it is ridiculous to say, they can) how can a man existing on earth, receaue truly and really Christ distant from him, as farre as the highest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? Receaue him (I say) not in a signe only, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to gracious Effects, but euen according to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2259:66"/>
his body and corporall substance, with their mouth of flesh. For Christ did not say, <hi>This is a figure of my body,</hi> or, <hi>this is soule-feeding grace giuen by the merit of my body and bloud</hi>; but, <hi>This is my body,</hi> euen to your corporall mouth, wherewith I bid you, <hi>to take, and eate it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forbeare laughing to heare you so soberly affirme, that the Son that is absent from his Father, as far as <hi>Constantinople</hi> is from <hi>London,</hi> is not only morally by Loue and Affection, but TRVLY and REALLY VNITED with his Father? For Vnion is the way vnto Vnity; so that whensoeuer two indiuiduall things are truly &amp; really vnited, by this vnion is made a third indiuiduall thing distinct fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ech of them a part, &amp; from all other indiuiduall things. When soule and body come to be vnited, by this vnion is produced a third substance, to wit, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> composed of soule and body. When two waters that were seuered come to ioyne togeather, there ariseth one third water, wherin the two lesser waters are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as parts. But Father and Sonne, the one in London, the other at Constantinople, do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a third indiuiduall nature constant of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, wherin they both are contayned, as is most euident: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is ridiculous to affirme, that the Father in London, is truly and really vnited with his Sonne in Constantinople.</p>
                        <p>Finally, put case there were true and reall vnity betwixt Father and Sonne, so that the sonne might be said to be one with his father, truly and properly, in respect of kind, or specificall Identity; what can this serue to shew that consecrated bread, remaining bread in nature &amp; kind, may be said to be the body
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2259:67"/>
of Christ, or the same with it? Had Christ said of another mans body, This is my Body, you might haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strued it thus, This is my body, that is, a body of the same kind and nature with mine; but Christ saying of that which was bread, this is my Body, how can you vnderstand this to be true in respect of specificall Vnity? Is bread of the same kind and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as Christs body? I am sure, being afore warned of this absurdity, you will not dare so to teach. What then, doth specificall Identity or vnity in nature and kind serue to shew, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated bread remaining bread in kind, nature, &amp; essence, may be truly &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Christs body? Certainly Christ did affirme that the thing contained within the shape of bread, was his indiuiduall body, not another indiuiduall body of the same kind. This cannot be true verily, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to propriety of speach, as you grant, if the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread remaine, much lesse if also the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christs body be locally absent. The Iesuits argument then doth conuince, that the Sacrament cannot be truly, really, substantially Christs body, if the body of Christ be not locally indistant from the same.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Thus you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On the one side denying, against Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, Temporall Paine in the next life, and on the other, granting against Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts a Remaynder of Temporall Chastisement, for sinne remitted after the remission of the guilt.

Yow lay Principles which vnans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werably inforce temporall paine for remisse Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in the next world; Which three thinges I will in order demonstrate, that so it may appeare, that through Ignorance you haue your selfe dissolued &amp; broken in peeces the whole frame of your Volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Reply,</hi> in euery poynt of Controuersy proposed by his Maiesty, and handled therein.</p>
                        <p>First, you contradict your selfe; for in this very pag. 540. against the Remainder of temporall paine thus you write: <hi>That which is so forgiuen that after pardon it is not mentioned or remembred, and which is cast
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2259:68"/>
behind Gods backe, &amp; throwne into the bottome of the sea, and which can no where be found, and which is blotted out of the Debt-booke of the Almighty, is not taken away by commutation of a greater punishment into a lesser, but by a free and full condonation of all vindictiue punishment. But the holy Scripture, and the Fathers teach such a remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinne on Gods part to the penitent.</hi> Thus you: what cleerer contradiction can be deuised then is betwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne these two sentences, Remission of sinne is made not by commutation of a greater punishment into a lesse, but by free and full condonation of all vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue punishment: &amp;, There is <hi>a remainder of temporall paine after the remission of guilt of sinne,</hi> not onely for the triall and erudition of the penitent, but also for <hi>Chastisement,</hi> which may be <hi>remoued, or mitigated</hi> by mortification and penitentiall workes? What clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer contradiction, I say, can be deuised? For te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall paine inflicted vpon penitent sinners by way of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement after the remission of the guilt of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, is <hi>vindictiue Punishment.</hi> You professe in the end of this page to belieue <hi>Temporall paine to remaine, not onely by way of Probation and Erudition, but euen by way of chastisement, after the remission of the guilt of their sinne</hi>: Therfore you contradict what you say in the beginning of this page, <hi>That remission of sinne is free, and full condonation of all vindictiue punishment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Agayne; Condonation of sinne, wherby eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall punishment is changed into temporall, is remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinne, by commutation of a greater chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into a lesse, to wit, of eternall into temporall, as is most euident. But in the end of this page, you teach, that sinne is so remitted, as the guilt of sinne, and eternall Damnation <hi>is changed into a remainder of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2259:68"/>
temporall affliction for chastisement of the penitent sinner.</hi> Wherefore, if the changing of Eternall punishment into Temporall be commutation of greater punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into lesse; then by granting, in the end of the cited page, a Remaynder of Temporall Affliction, after the remission of the Eternall, you ouerthrow what you taught in the beginning of the same, <hi>that remission of sinne is not made by commutation of greater punishment into lesse.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, this your doctrine of the <hi>remainder of temporall paine, after the remission of the guilt of sinne,</hi> proueth that penitent saints may make compe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sant, yea superaboundant satisfaction, in manner as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes teach; for in the remainder of temporall affliction we may consider, and distinguish two things; the greatnes of the paine reserued, and the greatnes of Gods remaining anger against sinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, which he doth yet temporally punish. If we regard the greatnes of Gods iust anger and offence, we hold <note n="(t)" place="margin">Si ad ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam Diuinae Maiestatis respiciamus, quatenus Deus videli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet sic homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni manet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sus, vt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if we regard the greatnes of the penalty reserued, a man may remoue the same by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction compensant, yea superaboundant. This may be made euident by examples. Let vs suppose the remainder of Temporall affliction reserued, be equall vnto the paine of forty dayes fast in bread &amp; water in one whole yeare, why may not a iust man fast in this manner forty dayes in a yeare, &amp; so offer vnto God satisfaction iust &amp; equall? Also why may he not fast fifty dayes in a yeare with onely bread and water, &amp; so offer satisfaction superaboundant?
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2259:69"/>
Superaboundant, I say, not in respect of the Maiesty of God offended, but in respect of the temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued punishment: So that granting, as you do, a temporall remainder of chastisement after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne, to be remoued or mitigated by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiall workes, if you be in your right iudgment, and ponder the matter, you cannot deny (as you do) that compensant and superaboundant satisfaction may be made for the same.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, this your doctrine doth euidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Temporall and Purgatory paines in the next life. This I proue. Vnto sinnes of equall offence and heynousmes against God, remitted by the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of faith and contrition, the same punishment is due in iustice, after the remission of the guilt. For God being iust, doth neuer punish sinne remitted with more or longer affliction then it deserues: <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they be not contayned in Scripture, but condistinct from them, then according to your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction there be some traditions, not contayned in Scripture, which maintayne and vphold the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture, and the verity and doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If you grant this (as you must, vnlesse you will grant your distinction be voyd of iudgment) then must you also grant tradition to be more fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall then Scripture.

                        <p>First, if our Sauiour hauing named many thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> as difficile, hard, and impossible with men, conclude that not one of these things only, but al are possible with God; then to say, that one of the things only, &amp; not all are possible to God, is directly to contradict our Sauiour, &amp; to giue him the lye. Our Sauiour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing named many things as hard, difficile, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible vnto men, to wit, that Camells passe throgh a needles eye, and that rich men enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, concludeth, that not one of these things only, but all are possible vnto God, <hi>apud Deu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           <note n="(b)" place="margin">Matth. 19.16.

                        <p>Secondly, to affirme that a Camells passage through the eye of a needle is impossible vnto God, is more directly agaynst this speach of our Sauiour, then to say, that a rich mans entrance into heauen is impossible. This I prooue. If our Sauiour say, that of the two, the Camells passing through a needles eye is more easy, that is lesse difficile, then to deny the Camells passing through a needles eye to be possible vnto God, is more directly agaynst our Sauiours

                           </gap>s euident by the drift of this place: For our Lord by this discourse, doth directly intend to shew not a rich mans saluation to be possible, but the Apostles argument which moued them to dispayre of the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of richmen, not to be good. They hearing our Sauiour say, <hi>it is more easy for a Camell to passe through a needles eye, then that a rich man enter in the Kingdome of heauen,</hi> supposing in their thought as most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, that a Camells passing through a needles eye,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2259:77"/>
was altogeather impossible, concluding, What rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then can be saued? Our Sauiour answering vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the argument that so perplexed them sayth, <hi>though these things be impossible with men, yet all is possible vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</hi> As if he had sayd: What you suppose in your thoughts as certayne, that a Camell cannot passe through a needles eye, is false; because God is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and so though such things be impossible with men, yet all is possible vnto him. Now your supposition being false, your argument that richmen cannot be saued, is not solid. For from my words, <hi>it is more easy for a Camell &amp;c.</hi> you can only inforce, that as the Camell cannot passe through a needles eye, but by the ompote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of the diuine hand; so the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cannot be saued, but by the omnipotency of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine grace. Hence it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that our Sauiour did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to teach the possibility of a Camells pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through a needles eye; so destroying the ground on which the Apostles did build their false persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that rich men could not be saued. But this you auouch not to be possible vnto God. Therefore you are forced by the Iesuit to deny Gods expresse word, howsoeuer you bragge, that the Iesuits arguing from Scripture, is wonderous weake.</p>

But certayne it is, that our Sauiour sayd, <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi> to the Iewes, according to the signification of that word in the Gospell of <hi>S.

                        <p>Secondly, our Sauiour doth testify, that he sayd <hi>search the Scriptures</hi> vnto them, that sent the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> to know what he was,<note place="margin">

For it is cleere he did not by way of command say to the Iewes <hi>search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs,</hi> but by way of permission, in respect of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, whereby they would not without Scripture belieue in him, vpon other most sufficient diuine

                        <p>Certainly, if our Sauiour had been of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants mind, and would haue giuen the precept they pretend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would not haue sayd to the Iewes, <hi>search the Scriptures, because in them you thinke that you haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life,</hi> but, search the scriptures, because in them only eternall life is to be had, or, because nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary vnto eternall life is to be belieued vntill it be cleerly proued by them. This he doth not say, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rebuketh the Iewes for this their Ministerial co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, that <hi>nothing is to be belieued vpon any other testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without Scripture.</hi> He did not therfore command the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vse the Scriptures, but seing them obstinatly addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vnto only Scripture, he permitted them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their own way: Euen as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Protestants ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <p>Hence two thinges appeare. First that your two assertions that Christ saying <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi>
                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:2259:89"/>
did <hi>command,</hi> and command euen <hi>simple people to vse Scriptures,</hi> be two fancyes of your owne, foysted into the Scripture not by way of interpretation, but by way of Historical Relation of the sacred text, which is grosse abuse thereof. Secondly, that if we search deepely into this text, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> the same doth cleerly condemne the Protestant fancy, that only Scripture is the rule of fayth, and shewes this to haue been the ground and principle of Iewish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The text <hi>Matth. 24.24 That euen the elect be deceaued, were it possible,</hi> grossely applied.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THVS you write <hi>pag.</hi> 586. <hi>Although the Tradition, and teaching of the Church be fallible, yet vnlearned people where they inioy the free vse of Scripture, as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times all people did; and if they be carefull of their saluation, and desire to know the truth, God blesseth his owne Ordinance, and ordinarily assisteth them by grace, in such sort as they shall not be seduced to damnation. Math.</hi> 24.24. Thus you encourage simple people to be proud and obstinate in their priuate fancies, agaynst the teaching and tradition of the Church: For in this speach you assure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that reading their vulgar Bible, if they be <hi>carefull of their saluation, and desire to know the truth,</hi> though they will not regard the Church, as the <hi>pillar, ground,</hi> and infallible <hi>Mistresse of truth</hi>; yet God will so blesse and assist them, as they shall not be seduced into da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable errour. Now what is the bane of Christianity, but this false and proud persuasion inserted into the heads of Sots? <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Anabaptists, Arians, Brownists, Familians,</hi> do they not <hi>desire to know the truth,</hi> who to that end so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2259:89"/>
peruse their Bible? Be they not <hi>carefull of their Saluation</hi> that goe so readily to the fyre, rather then abandon the doctrine which by their skill in the Vulgar Bible, they iudge to be the sauing Truth? In these Wretches you may see, how in men <hi>desirous to know the truth</hi> God blesseth the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of reading the vulgar Bible, without regard had to the Church, as an infallible Mistresse.</p>
                        <p>And as your doctrine is the seed &amp; springe of heresy, so is the text of Scripture <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. most violently drawne to confirme it. For what sayth the text? <hi>They</hi> (the false Prophets) <hi>shall doe great signes &amp; wonders, that euen the elect be induced into errour, if it be possible.</hi> By which text it is cleere that the <hi>elect</hi> people of God, cannot be finally intrapped in damnable errour. This is vnderstood (as Deuines speake) <hi>in sensu composito,</hi> that is, they cannot be deceaued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God ordaynes and foresees that they shall vse the meanes to know sauing Truth; which meanes is to cleaue vnto the Tradition of the Church, not trusting their owne skill. Now then with what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines can you, from this truth, wrest your Paradoxe <hi>that men desyrous of the truth, reading the vulgar Bible, cannot be damned</hi>? Are all men desirous of the truth that reade the Bible, Gods elect? If Heretiks dispute in this manner: <hi>The Elect cannot be seduced vnto dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Ergo, <hi>If they presume on their skill in the Bible not respecting the Churches doctrine as infallible, they shall not be seduced vnto damnation.</hi> Why may not murderers argue in like sort? <hi>The elect cannot be damned, Therefore if they commit murder euery day, and so perseuer vntill the end, they cannot be damned.</hi> This argument is as good as yours.

                        <p>First, the text doth not say, these <hi>Beroeans</hi> were <hi>vnlearned</hi>; how then can you hence conclude any thinge for the ability of <hi>vnlearned people to search the Scriptures?</hi> Agayne, the Text doth not say, that by comparing the doctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> with Scripture, they came to know certaynly, that the doctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> was true; but only that belieuing his doctrine, they searched the Scriptures about the same, without mention of the successe of their search. And if they were resolued by Scripture, this was only in one poynt, to wit, whether <hi>Iesus</hi> were the Messias, about which the Scriptures are cleere and expresse. How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can you hence proue that vnlearned people may <hi>know certainly</hi> whether the doctrine of the Church be true, by comparing the same with Scripture, in so many mayne articles of Controuersy about Fayth, whereof some (as you <note n="(a)" place="margin">

contayned in the Scripture, and must by the rules of Logicke and Deduction, be thence wrunge out.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <hi>the Beroea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s read the Scriptures,</hi> only for their <hi>greater cofirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           </hi> in Fayth, in case they should find by their priuate reading, the doctrine of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to agree with the Scripture. They read not by way of <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full examination,</hi> that is, with purpose not to belieue <hi>S. Paul,</hi> if so they should not find the Scriptures to yield playne testimony vnto his doctrine. That they read not in this manner, is cleere. For the Scripture sayth, that before they searched the Scripture, they receaued <hi>the word with all alacrity, and readines of mind:</hi> But if they had been doubtfull of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> doctrine &amp; had (to cleere that doubt) gone to search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it could not haue been truly sayd of them, that they receaued the word with alacrity, and all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mind, and afterward searched the Scriptures. Therefore they did not search Scriptures by way of doubtfull examination, but with full resolution, to belieue <hi>S. Pauls</hi> doctrine, euen in case they should not find by their priuate industry, the same cleerly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in the Scripture. How then may you by this example make good your Protestant doctrine, that <hi>Vnlearned People</hi> may compare the doctrine of the Church with the Scripture, in doubting manner, that is, with intention not to belieue the Church in case they should not be able to discouer her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by priuate reading in their vulgar Bible? Or, in case, that in the seeming of their priuate iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Scripture should appeare as opposite vnto the Church?</p>

But first, though the Scripture had sayd, that all the elect commit actuall sinne, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance not without warrant we might except the mother of God; but I will not stand herein agaynst you.

                        <p>I adde, that to say <hi>S. Iohn</hi> spake the aforesayd wordes in the person of all the Elect, not only is not the text, but also agaynst the text, except wee will make <hi>S. Iohn</hi> excessiue in the conceyte of himselfe. For thus I argue. It is manifest, <hi>S.

Iohn could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pride ranke himselfe in the number of Saynts as singularly chosen as was the glorious Virgin, so that if the sense of his saying be, <hi>If we,</hi> that is, Saynts as singularly priuiledged as Gods Blessed mother, <hi>say wee haue not sinned, we deceaue our selues,</hi> what can be more arrogant?

                        <p>Secondly, you are to be pittyed, in regard your passion is so extreme, as you cannot ioyne togeather the parts of your discourse in any sensible manner. You say, that the Iesuit holding the Blessed Virgin was immaculate, and pure from actuall sinne, is like
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2259:92"/>
to <hi>Acesius</hi> the <hi>Nouatian,</hi> who thought himselfe pure and innocent, and denyed possibility of saluation vnto men that sinned after baptisme, so leauing no ladder to Climbe vp to heauen, but only that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency. What can be more inept, then to lay this censure on the Iesuite in that respect? If the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite hold the Blessed Virgin to haue been euer free from actuall sinne, doth it follow that he must also so esteeme of himselfe, as did the <hi>Nouatian?</hi> May he not iudge her to be an Immaculate Virgin, and yet himselfe a sinfull man, crauing pardon of his sinnes by her prayers? And if he should be so fond also as to thinke himselfe vnspotted &amp; pure from sinne, doth it follow, that he must needes with <hi>Acesius</hi> exclude from saluation all penitent sinners, &amp; allow no lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto heauen, but only that of purity, taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the other of pennance? Surely, you cannot but see this your Inuectiue to be not only wrongfull, but also witlesse. The same distemper of passion causeth you not to marke the want of coherence betwixt your Textuall assertions, and Marginall proofes. In your text you say, <hi>The Iesuit by saying the Blessed Virgin was pure from sinne, hath lost his witts by the feauer of pride.</hi> In proofe hereof you cite in your margent this sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>S.

                           <hi>it may appeare, that it did depend on the iudgment of the Roman Bishop to establish Decrees of Fayth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the established, and to</hi> DECREE <hi>with whome the rest of the Church were to keep</hi> COMMVNION. Hence it is euident that <hi>Baronius</hi> speaketh of Decrees of fayth declaratiue, with whome Communion in Fayth is to be kept, &amp; that those are mutable, as the Church shall see cause.</p>

Hence vpon the arising of new Heretikes, euen the Catholike Fathers were sometymes deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating with, some denying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vnto such Dogmatizants. The decision of these doubts is to be made by the Catholik Church,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2259:110"/>
and the supreme Pastour thereof, in which case the Church may change her decrees. For when there is sufficient reason to thinke that such propositions be taken by the Authours in the Hereticall sense, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is to be made, that no communion be held with them. If afterward it appeare by good proofe, that they meant the said propositions according to the Catholike sense, they may be receaued by some lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Decree, and the former Decree, about auoyding their Communion, may be repealed. In this sense true is the saying of <hi>S. Augustine:</hi>

                        <p>Now also see your falshood. That <hi>Fa.

Yea, seing you hold Ministers to be worthy of Religious Adoration [<hi>pag.</hi> 224.] and therfore more holy and venerable then Angells, I pray you, do they all keep their Orders, Rules &amp; Canons?

Therfore Scripture is not the supreme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonstrable principle of Fayth, but is proued to be truth by the authority of God reuealing it; to be of God by the miracles of the Apostles publishing it; to be the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles by the tradition of the Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering it as such; euen as all as other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steryes of Fayth are proued.</p>

Their chiefe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument are two. First, Scripture is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of fayth; but principles are to be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in themselues, and to be knowne by their own light. This argument (much &amp; often vrged by you, &amp; your <note n="(a)" place="margin">

and shew that they are diuine truth. I Answere, the Minor of this Argument is false, &amp; the whole argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grounded vpon ignorance, in not discerning a difference betwixt corporall &amp; spirituall light. True it is, that euery corporal light that doth enlighten the eye of body must be euident in it selfe &amp; primely &amp; originally cleere, but not so euery truth that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates mans vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. The reason is, because the eye of body cannot by thinges seene, inferre &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude things that are hidden, but only can apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what doth directly and immediatly shew it selfe. But mans Vnderstanding not only apprehends what sheweth it selfe, but by things knowne inferreth &amp; breedeth in it selfe knowledge of thinges hidden.</p>
                           <p>Hence vnto Vnderstanding, though things shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues directly, and by their owne light, be her prime principles, and meanes to know other thinges; yet also things hidden in themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly knowne by the light of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may thereby become lights, that is, meanes to know yet further of things hidden. So that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of spirituall and intellectuall lights, it is false that all lights enlightening mans Vnderstanding to know other thinges, are euident in themselues; yea some secondary Principles and Lights there are, which must be shewed by superior light, before they become lights. In which kind is the Scripture, being a Light vnto the faythfull, because knowne by the Churches perpetuall Tradition to be from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, by the Apostles miraculous authority to be of God, by Gods supreme Verity who cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, nor be deceaued, to be the truth.</p>

verity cannot reueale vntruth, specially about the State-matters of saluation when he speakes by secret inspiration immediatly himselfe. But he reuealed in this manner by inspiration vnto his Prophets, that men cannot serue him truly, nor be saued without knowing supernatural truthes beyond the <note n="(c)" place="margin">As mans felicity, the blissfull vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, is aboue the forces of Nature: so it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t God shold bring him vnto it by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing truth aboue the reach of his reason.</note> reach of Reason, which truthes in particular he reuealed vnto them.

                        <p>This the prime and highest principle of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an resolution Protestants not in expresse words, but in deeds, and by consequence, reiect from being the stay of their fayth. For as they that belieue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Aristotle</hi> lastly and finally by the light and euidence therof, because it sheweth it selfe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to reason, do not build vpon the authority of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor vpon his bare world; euen so they that belieue the doctrine of Scripture by the light &amp; resplendent verity thereof, because it shewes it selfe to be diuine and heauenly truth, as Protestants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to doe, do not build vpon the authority of God the authour and doctour of Scripture, nor his bare, meere, &amp; pure word. This is most euident for who doth not see that it is one thing to belieue the word of some Doctour by the light of the doctrine, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to belieue his word through reuerence vnto his authority, as knowing him to be infallible in his word? Hence the Protestant fayth is so independent of the authority of God, as though God were not prime verity, but fallible in his words, yet their fayth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2259:127"/>
might subsist as now it doth. This is cleere, because let one be neuer so fallible and false, yet when his sayings shew themselues to be true, we may (yea we cannot but) belieue his word, in respect of the resplendent verity therof. But Protestants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the sayings of Scripture shew themselues to be true by the light &amp; lustre of the Doctrine belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therin, &amp; vpon this resplende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t verity they build lastly their fayth: Therfore though God were falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; might be false, yet their fayth, that his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is truth, which sheweth it selfe to be truth by the resplendent verity of the doctrine, might subsist. Is this the true Christian fayth which depends not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Gods being the Prime and Infallible Verity? which giues no more credit vnto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then men wil giue vnto a lyar, to wit, to belieue him so farre as they see him? To credit the word of his teaching so farre as it sheweth it selfe to be truth by the light of the doctrine? Verily this forme of Fayths resolution is grosse and vnchristian, which I am persuaded Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants would not mantayne, did they well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what they say, or could they find some other way of Resolution, wherby they might know what doctrine is the Apostles, and therfore Gods, without being bound to relye vpon the Tradition of the Church.</p>

the world of the proofes of diuine reuelations that are more euident then the Sunne.

                        <p>HENCE is answered the common Obiection which Protestants make, that Tradition of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from hand to hand made by men, is fallible, &amp; subiect to errour, for they may deceaue, or be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued. If We answere, that Christian Catholicke Tradition of doctrines is infallible, through Gods speciall assistance, They reply, this infallibility of traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through diuine assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce cannot be knowne but by the Scripture, and so before we can build our fayth on Tradition as infallible, we must know the Scripture to be the word of God, and consequently we cannot build our persuasion of the Scriptures being Apostolicall and diuine, on Tradition, except we comit a Circle.</p>
                        <p>I Answere. First, that Catholicke Tradition is proued to be <note n="(m)" place="margin">Est su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2259:130"/>
should be a thing by the traditioners first deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Secondly, I say, that how soeuer human Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be by nature fallible, yet the Christian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke is assisted of God that no errour can creep into the same. Which diuine assistance to be due vnto it, is demonstrated by the perfection of Diuine verity, &amp; by the nature of tradition, precedently &amp; independently of Scripture, and therefore without any Circle by two Arguments.</p>

                           </gap>ng Prime Verity cannot conniue, that the meanes of conueying the Apostles doctrine vnto posterity which bindeth Religious belieuers to receaue the same as his word, should secretly be infected with damnable Errour. For being Infinit Verity in his knowledg, this cannot be done without his priuity. Knowing thereof, being infinit veracity in his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the truth, he cannot yield that the meanes of conueying his truth obliging men to belieue, should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mperceptibly be poysoned, whereby men for their deuotion vnto his Verity incurre damnation. This being so, I assume: But the Catholicke tradition of doctrine from the Apostles bindeth Christians to whome it is deliuered, to belieue the same as Gods word. This I proue. When doctrine is sufficiently proposed as Gods word, men are bound to belieue it. But that is sufficiently proposed as Gods word vnto Christians which is vnto them sufficiently proposed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s Doctrine of the Apostles. Now, that Catholicke Tradition of doctrine from the Apostles is sufficient proposition and proofe, that that Doctrine is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, is proued; first because <hi>Catholicke tradition of doctrine is by nature simply infallible,</hi> as hath bin shewed,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2259:131"/>
but proposition knowne simply to be infallible, is sufficient to bind men to belieue. Secondly, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke tradition, that is, the report of a world of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning sensible matters of fact, is so preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and obligatory, as it were insolent madnes to deny it.

                           <hi>Aske thy Father and he will tell thee, thyne Auncestors and they will certifye thee.</hi> Fourthly, the proofe of tradition is so full and sufficient as it conuinceth infidels. For though they be blind not to see the doctrine of the Apostles to be Diuine, yet are they not so voyd of common sense, impudent and obstinate as they will deny the doctrine of Christian Catholicke tradition to be truly Christian &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical. Whence two thinges are euident. First, that Catholicke tradition from the Apostles is an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sufficient proposition, and a conuincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the doctrin so deliuered is Apostolicall, &amp; consequently Diuine reuealed Doctrine.

The first man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of assurance is extraordinary, and immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, such as the Prophets had. Wherfore Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, if they callenge this first manner of inward teaching &amp; assurance, they approue Enthusiasme, &amp; immediat reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which in the <hi>Swenkfeldians</hi> they seeme to condemne. If they challenge only the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond manner of inward teaching and assurance, then besides inward light, they must assigne an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ground why they belieue these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Apostles, &amp; then I aske what ground this is besides Tradition?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they wil obiect, that though they haue no infallible ground besides the teaching of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet they are not taught immediatly in Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner because they are also taught by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal probable motiue, to wit the Churches tradition. I Answere, that except they assigne an externall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible meanes besides Gods inward teaching, they cannot auoyde, but they challenge immediate reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. For whosoeuer knoweth thinges assuredly by the inward teaching of the spirit, without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal infallible motiue vnto which he doth adhere, is assured prophetically, though he haue some exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall probable motiues so to thinke. <hi>S.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2259:132"/>
prophesy, because besides inward assurance he had no externall infallible ground. If one see a man giue publickly almes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he perceaue probable toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; signes that he doth it out of a Vayne-glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; yet cannot he be sure therof but by the light of immediat reuelation, because the other tokens are not grounds sufficient to make him sure. For if a man be sure, &amp; haue no ground of this assurance in any thinge out of his owne hart, it is cleere, that he is assured immediatly, &amp; only by Gods inward spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Wherfore Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, if they will disclayme in truth, and not in wordes only from immediate reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and teaching, they must eyther grant tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be infallible, or else assigne some externall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ground besides Tradition, whereby they are taught what Scriptures the Apostles deliuered.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they will say they know the Scriptures to be from the Apostles, by an externall infallible ground besides Tradition, to wit, by certayne <hi>lights, lustres, euidences</hi> of truth, which they see to blaze, &amp; <hi>emane from the thinges reuealed in Scripture,</hi> by which they are sure that the doctrin thereof is heauenly. I Answere, If they did see such lustres and lights that cleerly, &amp; not only probably, conuince the doctrine of Scripture to be heauenly truth, they be not indeed assured by immediate darke reuelation, but by an higher degree of heauenly knowledge, to wit, by the supernaturall light and euidence of the thinge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, which is a paradox, and pretence farre more false, and sensibly absurd, then is the challenge of immediate reuelation, or Enthusiasme, as hath beene shewed. Wherefore, seing that God hath chosen no externall meanes besides Catholicke Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2259:133"/>
to make men know perpetually, vntill the consummation of the world, what doctrins &amp; Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Apostles published, it is cleere vnto euery Christian, that this is the meanes by him chosen, &amp; which he doth assist, that it cannot be obnoxious vnto errour: so that precedently and independently of Scripture, the Catholicke tradition of Christian pastors &amp; fathers is proued to be infallible, through Diuine speciall assistance, and therefore a sufficient ground for Fayths infallible assurance.</p>

doth import. Some be so ignorant, as to thinke that the word <hi>Catholicke</hi> doth signify the same, as conforme vnto Scripture. And so what doctrine is Catholicke, they resolue by the light and lustre of the doctrine, or by the in ward teaching of the spirit, whereby they fall vpon the principle of Heresy, and become not so much belieuers of Heretikes as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. Some vnderstand by the word <hi>Catholicke,</hi> Doctrine truly Catholicke, that is, deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostles by Christian worlds of Fathers, vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian worlds of children, yet are so blind as to giue this Title vnto Sects lately sprung vp, which through pretended singular Illuminations, gotten by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using the Scripture, haue chosen formes of fayth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite one agaynst another, reformed agaynst the forme to them deliuered by their Ancestors: These Sects I say, they tearme Catholicke, which not to be Catholicke in this sense, is as euident as that night is not day.</p>
                        <p>Some through willfull ignorance, no lesse gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely deuide the name of Catholicke according to the diuision of Countryes, naming the Catholicke do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Church of <hi>France,</hi> of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> &amp;c. Which speach hath no more sense, then this: A fashion euer since Christ vniuersally ouer the world, newly begun, and proper vnto England.</p>
                        <p>Agaynst this Enemy true Religion is resolued in this fourth principle, <hi>The Catholicke Tradition of doctrine from the Apostles is the Roman.</hi> By Roman we vnderstand not only the Religion professed within the Citty &amp; Diocesse of Rome, but ouer the whole world by them that any where acknowledg the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of Peter and his successours, which now is the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2259:134"/>
Roman Bishop. About this principle fayth is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a fourth perfection belonging vnto God, as he is prime Verity reuealing truth, which is, that he cannot permit, that the knowing of sauing doctrine be impossible.</p>
                        <p>Hence I argue: God being Prime Verity reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, cannot permit the meanes of knowing his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing truth to be hidden, nor a false meanes to be so adorned with the markes of the true, as the true become indiscernable from it. But if the Roman be not the true Catholicke Tradition, the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church and Tradition is hidden, yea a false Church hath so cleerly the markes of Catholicke, that no other can with any colour pretend to be rather Catholicke then it, that is, to haue doctrin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the Apostles, by whole worlds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Fathers vnto whole worlds of Christian Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Hence eyther there is no meanes left to know assuredly the sauing truth, or else the meanes is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, inward teaching of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, without any externall infallible meanes, or else Scripture knowne to be the word of God, and truly sensed, by the light, lustre, and euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the things: which wayes of teaching, it is certayne, God doth not vse towards his militant Church succeeding the Apostles. For teaching of diuine and supernaturall truth by the light, lustre, and shining of the thing or doctrin, is proper vnto the Church triumphant. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward assurance without any externall infallible ground to assure men of truth, is proper vnto the Prophets, and the first publishers of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Hence I conclude, that if God be the Prime Verity, teaching Christian Religion darkely without
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2259:134"/>
making men see the light, and lustre of thinges belieued, and mediatly by some externall infallible meanes, vpon which inward assurance must rely; then he must euer conserue the Catholicke tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Church, visible and conspicuous, that the same may without immediat reuelation, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the lustre of doctrin be discerned, to wit, by sensible markes.</p>
                        <p>If any obiect, that the senses of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this search may be deceaued through naturall inuincible fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their organs, and so no ground of fayth that is altogether infallible. I Answere, that euidence had by sense being but the priuate of one man, is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and physically infallible; but when the same is also publicke and Catholicke, that is, when a whole world of men concurre with him, then his euidence is altogether infallible. Besides, seing God hath resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not to teach men immediatly, but will haue them to cleaue vnto an externall infallible meanes, &amp; to find out this meanes by the sensible euidence of the thinge, he is bound by the perfection of his Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity to assist mens senses with his prouidence, that therein they be not deceaued when they vse such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence as men ordinarily vse, that they be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by their senses. Now, what greater euidence ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one haue that he is not deceaued in this matter of sense, that the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Doctrine is the Catholicke, that is, Doctrine deliuered from the Apostles by worlds of Christian Ancestors, spread ouer the world, vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous amongst themselues in all matters they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue as Fayth; what greater assurance I say, can one haue, that herein he seeth aright, then a whole world of men professing to see the same that he doth?</p>

I Answere, An article of Fayth may be visible according to the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the thing, &amp; yet inuisible according to the manner it is belieued in the Creed. The third article, <hi>He suffered vnder Pontius Pilate, was crucifyed, dead and buried,</hi> according to the substance of the thinge, was euident vnto sense, and seen euen of the Iewes, and is now belieued of their posterity. But according to the manner as it is belieued in the Creed, to wit, that herein the Word of God by his auncient Prophets was fulfilled, that this was done in charity for the saluation of Man; in this manner (I say) that visible Article is inuisible, and belieued in the Creed. In like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner that there is in the world <hi>a Catholicke Church,</hi> and that the Roman is <hi>the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church,</hi> Pagans, Iewes, &amp; Heretikes (if they shut not their eyes agaynst the light) do cleerly behold: But that herein the word of God about the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall amplitude of his Church is accomplished, that this is an effect of Gods Veracity, to the end that the meanes to learne sauing truth may not be hidden; this is a thing inuisible, &amp; according to this notio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Catholicke Church is proposed in the Creed.

The thinges the Apostles belieued of Christ, to wit that he was the Sauiour of the world, the Son of God, were thinges inuisible; but the subiect and person of whome they did belieue, was to them visible &amp; seen; yea God did of purpose by his Prophets fortell cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne

In this sort the Predicate, or thing belieued in this article <hi>the holy Catholicke Church,</hi> to wit <hi>Holy</hi> is inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the Subiect, to wit, the <hi>Catholicke Church</hi> which we affirme and belieue to be holy in her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is visible and conspicuous vnto all. Yea God hath of purpose foretold signes and tokens whereby the same by sense may be cleerly discernable from all other that may pretend the title of Catholicke. For were not this subiect, the Catholicke Church, we belieue to be holy and infallible in her teaching, visible and discernable from all other that pretend the name; of what vse were it to belieue that there is such an infallible teaching Church in the world, hidden we know not where, as a needle in a bottle of hay?</p>

Luther in locis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mun.</hi> 1. <hi>part. c.</hi> 24. <hi>pag.</hi> 69. Secondly, now Protestants (euen our Minister <hi>pag.</hi> 32 <hi>lin.</hi> 2. and often in this reply) disclaime from expresse and formall Scripture, and pretend that all things are written eyther for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally or virtually, and so confesse, that there is herin <hi>no difference betwixt the most learned Papists and them.</hi> So saith <hi>Field Church. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>pag.</hi> 241. <hi>lin. 6.</hi> Thirdly, when some Catholicks, as <hi>Dominicus Bannes,</hi> so many tymes cited by the Minister. <hi>pag</hi> 151. <hi>Marg lit. f. pag</hi> 109. <hi>lin.</hi> 40. <hi>pag.</hi> 189. <hi>marg. lit. b. pag.</hi> 580. <hi>marg lit. a.</hi> say, that some points <hi>be neither expressely nor inuoluedly in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> they do not meane that they are not virtually inuolued in thinges contayned in Scripture as effects in their cause, &amp; so are deduceable from Scripture; but only that they are not formally inuolued in thinges of Scripture as parts in their whole, in sort as they can be articles of fayth by sole Scripture. For thinges formally inuolued in Scripture as parts in the whole, a soule and body in man, indiuidualls in the whole masse of their kind be articles of fayth by vertue of Scripture. Thus when the Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                             <desc>•</desc>

Fourthly, the question now resting between Protestants and vs, is not whether the Scripture be virtually intricate and inuolued about some points of fayth, nor whether some rule of interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be necessary; for that the Scripture is inuolued and needeth an vnfolding rule is granted on both sides: The only que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, by what rule these Doctrines inuolued are vnfolded and made knowne vnto vs as articles of fayth. Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts say <hi>by Scripture and the rules <pb n="64" facs="tcp:2259:143"/> of Logicke and Reason, [Wotton Triall of the Romish &amp;c. pag 88. lin.</hi> 29.] <hi>and by other things besides Scripture euident in the light of nature, [Feild pag</hi> 281. <hi>lin.</hi> 20.] Catholikes hold that the rule to expound Scripture, binding all men to belieue deductions as matters of fayth, is not Logicke, but the Tradition and definition of the Church.</p>
                                       <p>And this Catholicke doctrin is proued. First, because the rule of faith must be for the capacity of vnlearned men aswell as of learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But men vnlearned cannot be sure of the virtualityes of Scripture by the rules of Logicke, or Logicall deduction; for they cannot vnderstand when an argument is good by the rules of Logicke. Secondly, the Scripture it selfe to supply her wants sendeth vs not to the rules of Logicke, but vnto tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, saying 2. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Hold fast the Traditions ye haue receaued by word or our epistle.</hi> They send men to the Church, as to the pillar and ground of truth. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>which whosoeuer doth not heare, is as a hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therfore by the rule of Church-Tradition &amp; not by the rules of Logicke do we learne authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tically the confessed virtualities, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurities, and inuolutions of Scripture about matters of fayth. Thirdly the Fathers about matters inuolued in Scripture, send men not vnto Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, but vnto Tradition, auouching the same to be a rule as certaine &amp; no lesse estimable then Scripture. <hi>S. Chrysostome homil.</hi> 4 <hi>in</hi> 2. <hi>ad Thessal. The Apostles did not deliuer all things in Scripture, but some things without writing, and these are as much to be credited as the written: It is a Tradition, this is inough, seeke no more.</hi> The same is taught by <hi>S. Dionysius Eccles. Hierar. c.</hi> 1. <hi>Iren. l. 2. c.</hi> 2.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Eusebius lib. 1. de demonst. Euang. c.</hi> 8. <hi>by S.

                                       <p>Finally, we dislike the Protestant manner of controlling the Church by Scripture. For on the one side they contradict the vniuersall custome and Tradition of the Church at the least, and as they grant, of many ages, saying, <hi>The Popish doctrine during the space of nine hundred yeares hath spread it selfe ouer the whole world, so that an vniuersall Apostacy was ouer the whole face of the earth for many hundred yeares. [Perkins Exposit. of the Creed. pag.</hi> 307. <hi>&amp;</hi> 400.] On the other side their Arguments out of Scripture are at the most but probable, and they sometimes challenge no more: <hi>homini non prorsus alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato probabilior apparet. [Whitak contr.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 5. <hi>c</hi> 8. <hi>circa finem] Others alledge Scripture not with as probable colour as we doe. [Iohn White defence pag. 321.</hi>] Yea this Minister in his Reply doth acknowledge <hi>pag.</hi> 581. <hi>That by Sophistry we giue vnto their Scripturall arguments seeming and appearing solutions.</hi> Now we Catholikes thinke it to be <hi>Hereticall,</hi> &amp; as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>insolent madnes,</hi> 
                                          <pb n="65" facs="tcp:2259:143"/> vpon probabilities, vpon Arguments fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Scripture that receaue seeming solutions, to contradict the Christian vniuersall Tradition of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares: For what the Minister saith, this to be done by Sophistry, is ridiculous. For if to giue seeming plausible, and probable solutions vnto Scripturall arguments, against the full Tradition of Christianity be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry, what is true Theology? On the other side, if for men to stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Tradition of so many whole Christian ages vpon arguments they confesse to be probably, and seemingly answered, be Christianity, what is hereticall Obstinacy?</p>
                                       <p>Fifthly, whereas you obiect that <hi>pag.</hi> 199. <hi>lin.</hi> 6. the Fathers disputed from Scripture negatiuely agaynst Heretikes, in this sort; Doctrine is not cleerly deliuered in Scripture, therefore it is not to be receaued as Fayth; You must know, that the Fathers proceed vpon a supposition that was knowne vnto all, and granted by the Heretickes themselues, to wit, that the doctrins they disputed agaynst, were not the full and publicke Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Catholike Church. For seing Scripture (as we haue shewed) doth necessarily suppose Tradition that we may know the true text and sense thereof; so likewise the Fathers when they vrge that all doctrine is to be reiected which is not in Scripture, still suppose that that doctrine is not the publicke Tradition of the Church. Where we must also note, that the Fathers did not only require of Heretikes proofe from Scripture, by way of deduction &amp; Logicall inference (for such all heretiks did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and herewith deluded seely sots, as now Protestants doe) but they required of Heretikes to shew their doctrine in Scripture, <hi>ipsis dictionibus,</hi> sayth <hi>Irenaeus. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 36. expressely and in tearmes, and proue it, not by texts (sayth <hi>S. Augustine de vnitat. Eccles. c.</hi> 3.) <hi>which require sharpenes of wit in the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to iudge who doth more probably interprete them,</hi> not by places, <hi>quae vel inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretem quaerunt,</hi> which require an interpreter, and an arguer making Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall inferences vpon the text so concluding for his purpose; but by places <hi>playne, manifest, cleere, which leaue no place to contrary exposition, and that no Sophystry can wrest them to other sense,</hi> to the end that Controuersyes which concerne the Saluation of soules, be defined by Gods formall word, and not by deductions from it according to Logicall forme. For sayth <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> what more vniust, then <hi>Ingeniorum contentionibus causam populorum committere?</hi>
                                       </p>
                                       <p>Hence the Fathers negatiue argument from Scripture, ouerthroweth Protestant Religion, for thus I argue. Nothing is matter of Fayth and of necessity, which is not formally and expressely reuealed by the word <pb n="66" facs="tcp:2259:144"/> of God eyther written or vnwritten, deliuered by full Ecclesiasticall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But no Heretikes euer did nor our Protestants now do, or can pretend perpetuall publicke Tradition vnwritten for their doctrins, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the Catholicke and Roman Church: nor can they proue their <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets (ipsis dictionibus ex scriptura</hi>) by Scripture, auerring them in expresse te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armes. Only they clayme texts which as themselues confesse receaue see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming &amp; appearing solutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, agaynst which they haue nothing to say, but that this is done by Sophistry, so bringing the busines of the Saluation of the world to be decided by contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wit. Therefore their doctrins are to be reiected as vnchristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Finally it is great vanity in you to thinke that the Traditions vnwritten mentioned by Fathers, are conforme to your Doctrine, writing as you doe <hi>pag.</hi> 46. <hi>By Tradition the Fathers vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not the Fabulous dreames and inuentions of Papals, who like Pharisees corrupt the right sense of Scripture by their vnwritten Tradition, and affirme those thinges to be Apostolicall which agree with the confessed doctrine of the Apostles like darkenesse with light.</hi> Thus you, with much bitternesse, and no lesse falshood. For what <hi>Gerson [de signis ruinae Eccles. sig.</hi> 5.] sayth of the heresyes of his age, to wit of <hi>Waldo, Wickliffe</hi> and <hi>Husse, Fabulae sunt,</hi> they are Fables, you turne as by him spoken of perpetuall Traditions of the Catholicke and Roman Church. The Pharisees did indeed corrupt Scripture. But how? By Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall deductions out of the same, according to your Protestant, and the common Hereticall fashion, pretending greater skill then all their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. That they did affirme that their speciall obseruations were Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnwritten from <hi>Moyses,</hi> the Scripture hath not a word; yea the thing they most of all obiected agaynst our Sauiour, was the written Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Moyses</hi> about keeping the Sabboth Day. [<hi>Ioan.</hi> 7.] From which precept not by Tradition vnwritten, but by Logicall inference, they concluded that our Lord brake the Sabboth-Day by healing diseased persons thereon. So that Pharasaicall Traditions were neuer so much as pretended to be doctrines vnwritten as you imagine, but to be doctrines concluded from the text of Scripture, by the rules of Reason and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, iust according to your Protestant pretence.</p>
                                       <p>Also, what you say, that the Fathers Traditions vnwritten be not our doctrines but yours, is spoken because you would haue men so thinke though they erre, not because you can thinke the same to be so in truth. For thus I argue agaynst this your seely Shift. The Fathers, as appeareth by their wordes, vnderstand by Tradition Apostolical vnwritten, <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata quae peti non possunt è Sacra Scriptura,</hi> Doctrines of fayth that cannot be <pb n="67" facs="tcp:2259:144"/> gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy Scriptures with such certitude as they may therevpon be belieued as articles of fayth. But you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and glory, that all your Doctrines of Fayth be <hi>ex sacris Scripturis petitae,</hi> so drawne and gathered from holy Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, as they are belieued as Fayth only vpon this rule. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is great vanity for you to say that the Fathers by Apostolical Tradition vnwritten, vnderstood the Doctrine not of the Roman Church, but of your Protestant Separation.</p>
                                       <p>And if from generality (vpon which Ministers, whose drift is to deceyue, do willingly dwell) we descend to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, we shall find that you reiect those Doctrines &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of the Roman Church <hi>as Fabulous dreames, and human inuentions,</hi> which the Fathers expressely, and in tearmes affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to be <hi>Apostolicall Traditions.</hi> To pray for the reliefe of the Soules of the faythfull deceased Protestants esteeme fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: the <note n="(1)" place="margin">

                     <p>THIS principle is consequent vpon the former, out of which six things may be clerly proued. First, that there is alwaies a true <note n="(a)" place="margin">The Minister still co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth with his distin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that by Church we may vnderstand <hi>a Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy of mitred prelates</hi>; &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he denyes that there is still a church teaching the truth in the world.

This distinction so much repeated, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>pag.</hi> 57. and 58. is impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: for by <hi>Church</hi> we vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not euery small number of right belieuers, but a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian multitude of such credit and authority, as vpon her tradition we may be sure what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures &amp; doctrines were the Apostles. For this is a fundamentall pointe necessary to be knowne, that so we may know, what Doctrine is of God, and it cannot be knowne but by Tradition of the Church, as hath bene proued. Now whether this Church be Mitred, or not Mitred, goe in Blacke, or in White, or in Scarlet, doth little import. Let the Minister but shew vs a Church that hath euident Tradition of Doctrine hand to hand fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostles, &amp; we will say she is the true Church, though she haue no Surplisse, or Miter, but be as precise as <hi>Geneua</hi> it selfe: but if there be no Church in the world, but this <hi>Hierarchy of Mitred Prelates,</hi> whose Tradition hand to hand can assure men which be the Scriptures and doctrines of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deliuered by the Apostles, men ought not to beare such spleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Miter, or Corner-Cap, or Surplisse, as in respect of them to fly from the Church, that onely hath Catholicke Tradition from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</note> Church of Christ in the world, for if there be no meanes for men to know that Scriptures, and all other substantiall Articles came from Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and so consequently from God, but the Tradition of the Church; then there must needes be in all ages a Church, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and deliuering these Traditions, els men in some age since Christ, should haue

bene destitute of the <note n="(b)" place="margin">The Minister <hi>pa. 59. lin.</hi> 15. sayth, <hi>A corrupt Church may deliuer vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly some part of sacred truth, as the Scripture and Creed, by which men may be saued.</hi> Answer. We may conceaue two wayes of deliuering an incorrupt text. The one <hi>Casuall</hi> &amp; by chance, and so a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Church, yea a Iew, an Infidell, a child may deliuer an vncorrupt Copy of the Bible.

This Authentik and irrefragable Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be made by a false Church, erring in her Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as is cleer. Now it is necessary to saluation, that men not only <hi>Casually</hi> haue the true Scripture, but must be sure that the text therof be incorrupt. Therfore ther must be stil a Church in the world, whose Tradition is Authentike, that is, a sufficient warrant vpon which men must belieue Doctrines to come from the Apostles.</note> ordinary meanes of saluation, because they had not meanes to know assuredly the substantiall Articles of Christianity, without assured Fayth wherof no man is saued.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this Church must be alwaies <note n="(c)" place="margin">The Minister <hi>pag.</hi> 61. <hi>lin.</hi> 15 <hi>&amp; lin. 26.</hi> obiects, that <hi>in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution the true Church may be reputed an impious sect by the multitude, and so not be knowne by the notion of True and Holy; nor can her truth be discerned by sense and common reason.</hi> I answere. As there are foure properties of Church-doctrin, so likewise there are foure notions of the Church. The first is to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse of the sauing truth. According to this notion the Church is inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the naturall vnderstanding both of men and Angels. For God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; his Blessed see our Religion to be the truth. The second is to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse of Doctrine truly reuealed by secret inspiration. According to this notion (ordinarily speaking) the Church is inuisible to almost all men that are, or euer were, the Apostles onely and the Prophets excepted. The third, to be Mistresse of Doctrine which Christ and his Apostles by their Miraculous preaching planted in the world. According to this notion the Church was visible to the first and Primitiue world, but now is not. The fourth to be Mistresse of Catholike doctrine, that is, of doctrine deliuered and receaued by full Tradition and profession, all the aduersaryes therof being vnder the name of Christian, deuided amongst themselues, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious changers. According to this notion the Church is euer visible &amp; sensible to all men, euen vnto her very enemies. For not only Iewes and Infidels, but euen Heretickes know in their conscience, and sometimes acknowledge in words, that the Church is truly Catholike. So long as the Church according to this notion of Catholicke is in the sight of the world, the world hath sufficient meanes of saluation. They that see with their eyes which Religion is Catholicke, may easily find out the truth. For it is cleer to common reason that the <hi>Catholike</hi> Doctrine is the <hi>Apostles,</hi> cleere by common discourse that the <hi>Apostles</hi> miraculous preaching <hi>was of God,</hi> and that God being the prime verity, his doctrine ought to be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as the truth of saluation. On the other side if the Church according to the notion of Catholike, be hidden, and the light therof lost, there is no ordinary meanes left for men to know what the Apostles taught, nor consequently what God by inspiration reuealed vnto them. We must begin againe anew from a second fountaine of immediat reuelation from God, and build vpon the new planting of Religion with miracles in the world by some recent Prophet. And if this be absurd, then there must euer be in the world a Church, whose Tradition is illustriously Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, and consequently shewing it selfe to be the Apostles, vnto all men that will not be obstinate.</note> visible and conspicuous. For the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Church must euer be famous, glorious, and most notoriously knowne in the world, that a Christian may truly say with <hi>S. Augustine de vtilit. cred. c.</hi> 17. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue nothing but the consent of Nations, and countries, and most celebrious fame.</hi> Now if the Church were hidden, secret, inuisible in any age, then her Traditions could not be Doctrines euer illustriously knowne, but rather obscure, hidden, Apocriphall. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church the mistresse, pillar and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of truth must be alwaies visible and conspicuous, which (if need be) may be further proued most euidently.</p>

I answer. That God by his ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent will of mans saluation wisheth two things. First <hi>the saluation of all men</hi>: Secondly the meanes of their saluation. In respect of the meanes the will of God is absolute, that all men in some sort or other haue sufficient meanes of saluation. In respect of the end, to wit, the saluation of all men, the will of God is not absolute, but as Schoolmen say, virtually conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that is, God hath a will that al men be saued as much as lyeth in him, if the course of his prouidence be not stopped, and men will cooperate with his grace. Whence I thus argue. If God did not prouide sufficient meanes for all men, it could not be sayd, that on his part he wisheth the saluation of all. But euen our Minister pag. 78. lin. 38. <hi>grants that God wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the saluation of all men, and of euery indiuiduall person.</hi> Therefore God still makes his Church visibly vniuersal, <hi>vt neminem lateat,</hi> as saith S.

But if the Church were not still so diffused in the world that all knowne <note n="(n)" place="margin">The Answerer wryting to his Maiesty &amp; knowing the Prouerbe <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pienti verbu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> did inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by this word to insinuate how God prouided means of saluation for the world, wherof one part was many ages vnknowne. The solution of this difficulty much vrged by the Minister pag. 78 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in these points: first God our Sauiour being borne and dying in this knowne world, prouided that his Church should be still visibly spread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the same &amp; famously known. Secondly, Nations be not so vnknown, but by nauigation and other such naturall meanes they may be discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto this world where our Sauiour was borne, and his Church is euer visible. Thirdly, he still prouideth as Experience sheweth, that in the firmer members of this his visible Church, such zeale &amp; charity is found that natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s can no sooner be discouered, but presently some preachers passe thither with the sound of his Ghospell. Fourthly, hence the cause why some nations heare not of the Ghospell, is not any defect in his Church, but the want of working in the naturall causes to discouer such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, which defect God will not euer miraculously supply. Fiftly, if the Church were inuisible to the world, keeping her Religion to her selfe, not daring to professe or preach the same vnto others, Nations might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, &amp; yet not a whit the neerer in respect of knowing the Ghospel. Hence I thus argue. If the Church were hidden for many ages, as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants acknowledge theirs was, men should perish, not through defect in the natural causes, but only through the hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, obscurity &amp; wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the supernatural meanes, to wit, of the Church not daring to make profession of her Religion to the world. But this is impossible, for then God should not for his part wish the saluation of all men. Therfore it is impossible that the true Church should not be euer vniuersall and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously knowne, &amp; conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly it is impossible, that the Protestant should be the true Church.</note> nations may take notice of her, all men could not be saued.

                           <p>The Minister pag. 82. lin. 35. sayth, that <hi>vowed Chastity makes most of our Church more impure then doggs, before God and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> I answer, this is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.

                           <p>This blasphemy is the same in effect with that of Turkes, who say, that the Christian band of chastity to <hi>one immaculate bed,</hi> forbiding multitude of wiues, makes <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians more impure then doggs.</hi> Which they proue, because now many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Christians fall into Adultery, Incest, and other impurity, which would not haue been had Christ permitted, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did, the holy Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of many wiues which the ancient Prophets inioyed.</p>
                           <p>To this Hereticall Turkish accusation of the Catholike Christian Church, I answere: It was conuenient that Christ Iesus being the Sonne of God should exact of his followers such sanctity, and chastity as might suite with the perfection of so diuine a Lawmaker. And though he knew many thousands would therein be defectiue, for whome therefore in his mercy he prouided the remedy of Pennance; yet this fayling of some, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but an effect of human frailty, he thought it more tolerable, then that he should allow by his Law such liberty of lust, as was vndecent for his sanctity to permit, and vnworthy of a people redeemed with his bloud, whereby there would haue beene fewer sinners among Christians, not through strictnes of life, but through the loosenes of his law.</p>
                           <p>In this manner the Church of Christ taught by the spirit of his wisdom, doth, and did euer exact perfect chastity of them that were of her Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, though she be sure that in so great a multitude many will fayle who must seeke to be saued by pennance. As adultery in Christians is rather to be suffered then auoyded by allowing many wiues generally vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, though this be not of it selfe intrinsecally euill: euen so the falling of some Votaies is not so great an inconuenience as this were, that Sacred Ministers should not be bound to professe Chastity worthy of the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Christian Priesthood, the sinning agaynst Chastity being humane infirmity, but the not exacting thereof an indignity in the very Christian law.</p>
                           <p>For all men not blinded with passion see, it is most vndece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian consecrated Ministers should goe a wooing and wiuing, and when one wife dyeth wedde another as often as they please, as the Protestant pretended Holy Ministers vse to do.

Let them therefore consider how theirs can be the Holy Church, that doth not so much as professe high Sanctity that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Christian Church, no not in her consecrated Ministers and more Religious professours. Specially seing also Ministers by Mariage doe not wholy auoyd the stayne of wandring lust and other impurity, yea them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues acknowledge that they be at the least, as vicious as the Catholicke Cleargy.

This expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is false, first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Sauiour here promiseth his Presence vnto the Apostles and their successours to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, and teach vntill the worlds end, by one and the same forme of speach and indiuiduall breath, so that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise cannot be condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall in respect of the successors, except it be also conditionall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Apostles. But in respect of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles the promise is absolute as the Minister grants pag. 94. lin. 23. Therefore it is also ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in respect of their successors.

                           <p>Secondly, if the promise be conditionall, then the sense is this; I will alwayes assist you to teach &amp; Christen aright, when you teach &amp; christen according to my commandement, as the Minister expounds pag. 94. lin. 22. But this sense is idle and iust nothing, as if Christ had sayd, Behold I will assist you to teach aright when you teach aright: for what is to teach Christian Religion aright, but to teach it as Christ commanded, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the same?</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, if this Promise were conditionall &amp; not absolute, then by this place the Church could not be proued to last absolutly for euer, but only so long as she Christeneth aright &amp; teacheth the truth, wherin according to this Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t exposition she may fayle.

Now there remaynes six or seauen ages since the pretended Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy of the Roman Church, for which the Minister doth not name any professours that were Protestants for <hi>essence and kind.</hi> Secondly, because Protestants teach, that the most substantiall article of their Religion is <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by speciall fayth only,</hi> and not by workes and merits of grace, as all know.

                                          <p>Concerning the Waldenses, they were not Protestants according to kind, but rather Anabaptists, vnto whome Protestants are so vnkind as they burne them as Heretikes. They were not Protestants; For (as all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as may be seene in <hi>Illyricus Catal. Test. pag.</hi> 1498.) the most essentiall doctrine of the Waldenses was their extolling the merit of voluntary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, preaching the same so rigorously, as they <hi>held all Ministers to be damned that haue rents and possessions, and that the Church perished vnder Syluester and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine through the poyson of temporall goods which Cleargy-men then began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy</hi> (as they sayd) <hi>agaynst the Law of God.</hi> I am sure none that know Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants will thinke this doctrine of pouerty and giuing away all to the poore to be the Essence, or so much as an Accidence of their Religion. In respect of this their head-heresy about Pouerty, the Waldenses are named <hi>the Poore-men of Lyons,</hi> and were sayd by <hi>Reynerius</hi> cited by the Minister <hi>pag.</hi> 130. to haue beene euer since Siluester or the Apostles, and that they were much applauded in the world, to wit, (as I sayd) only in regard of this Heresy about pouerty, held anciently by the Heretikes tearmed <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolici,</hi> not in respect of other errours or doctrines wherein they agree with Protestants. And so Protestants labour in vayne by Waldensians, and the <hi>Apostolici,</hi> to bring their pedegree from the Apostles.</p>
                                          <p>Besides, the Waldensians held these Anabaptisticall errours, which are set downe by <hi>Illyricus in Catalogo Testium pag.</hi> 1502. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi> out of <hi>Reyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> an authour of those tymes whome he tearmes <hi>candidum &amp; sincerum,</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and vnpartiall; <hi>That children are not to be baptized, baptisme being of no vse for them, seing they do not belieue; That there is no difference betwixt Bishopps and Priests, nor betwixt Laymen and priests; That the Apostles were meere Laymen; That euery Layman that is vertuous, is priest may consecrate, preach, administer Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. That a woman pronouncing the words in the vulgar tongue doth consecrate; yea tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiate bread into the body of Christ; That it is mortall sinne to sweare in any case; That the Magistrates secular and Ecclesiasticall being in mortall sinne, loose their office, and that no man is to obey them.</hi> Indeed Illyricus <hi>pag.</hi> 1514. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1525. <hi>in <pb n="89" facs="tcp:2259:156"/> fine</hi> sayth, that this last errour is falsly layd to the charge of the <hi>Walde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> by <hi>Reynerius:</hi> which he proues, because <hi>AEneas Syluius</hi> in his Catalogue of their doctrine makes no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this.

                                          <p>Secondly, what more idle and vayne then to appeale from Scripture, setting downe matters cleerly, vnto Scripture teaching thinges obscurely or not so cleerly? what is this but to appeale from light to darkenes, or at the least from noone day to twy-light? But no particular point of doctrin is in holy Scripture so manifestly set down as is the Church, &amp; the marks whereby the same may be knowne; no matter about which the Scripturs are more copious and cleere, then about visibility, perpetuity, amplitude the Church was to haue; so that as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, Scriptures <hi>are more cleere about the Church then euen about Christ. [in Psalm.</hi> 30. <hi>concion. 2.] That Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in this poynt is so cleere, that by no shift of false interpretation it can be auoyded; the impudency of any forhead that will stand agaynst this euidence, is confounded. [de vnit. Eccles. c.</hi> 5.] <hi>That it is prodigious blindnes not to see which is the true Church. [Tract. 1. in</hi> 1. <hi>Epist. Ioan.</hi>] That the Church is the tabernacle placed in the Sunne, that it cannot be hidden vnto any, but such as shut their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. [<hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>cont. Petilian. c. 32.</hi>] What vanity then is it for Protestants not being able to cleere by Scripture the cleerest of all points, to appeale vnto the prouing of their doctrine by more darke or lesse euident places?</p>
                                          <p>Thirdly, if no man can directly know which be the Scriptures the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles deliuered but by the Tradition of the Catholike Church, then it is vayne before they decide this controuersy to vndertake to proue by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures what doctrine the Apostles taught. For how can Scripture make me know what the Apostles taught, vnlesse I know aforehand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Apostles? I may see this, or that doctrine deliuered in the Scripture, shewed me as the Apostles, but I cannot know that doctrin to be the Apostles, except I know aforehand the booke to be the Apostles, but this cannot be proued but by the Tradition of the Church.</p>
                                          <p>I omit many other arguments wherby this shift may be conuinced to be but flying from the light of Gods word about the visible Church. For as, sayth Saint <hi>Augustine l.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Crescon. cap.</hi> 33. God would haue his <pb n="91" facs="tcp:2259:157"/> Church to be described in Scripture without any ambiguity, as cleere as the beames of the Sunne, that the controuersy about the true Church, being cleerly decided, when questions about particular doctrines that are obscure, arise, we might fly to her, and rest in her iudgement, &amp; that this visibility is a manifest signe wherby euen the rude and ignorant may discerne the true Church from the false.

This some Protestants more iudicious then our Minister, acknowledge, who thus write: <hi>It is most playne that euen negatiuely an argument from humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may be strong, as namely this: The Chronicles of England mention no more then only six Kings bearing the name of Edward since the tyme of the last Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quest, therfore it cannot be there should be more. It is true, men are ignorant, many things may escape them, they may be deceaued, they may conceale truth, or vtter vntruth out of malice, they may forget what they know; Howbeit</hi> INFINITE CASES <hi>are wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all these impediments are so</hi> MANIFESTLY <hi>excluded, as there is no shew or colour wherby any such exception may be taken.</hi> Thus M.

                              <p>Now, amongst these cases wherein the negatiue argument from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and history is strong, the chiefest is when the matter is famous and illustrious, and there is a line and succession of chiefe Bishops, Princes, &amp; Persons notoriously knowne euen to the particularityes of their names, actions, dayes of their raygne, and death. Wherfore it is idle what the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister <hi>pag.</hi> 230. brings agaynst this, <hi>that we know not who was the first that eate mans flesh, nor when the Assyrian matrons did first prostitute themselues in the temple of Venus.</hi> For no wonder we know not such things, seing we haue not a lineall history of these times, as we haue of other times, specially since the comming of Christ. For lineall history concerning illustrious matters is both affirmatiuely &amp; negatiuely strong, yea more strong negatiuely then affirmatiuely. The reason is, because it is not so impossible that men with full report should vent an vntruth, as that they should be by full co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent about a most illustrious truth, men being in such cases more prone to report then to conceale. For example, should one contest that some of our Kings since the Conquest set vp Images in al Churches of <hi>England,</hi> the Country being before that tyme pure Protestant, might not such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent writer be conuinced of madnes by negatiue history?

                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the force thereof quite another way, saying: <hi>It is this: The text of the Scripture may be as easily corrupted as the sense.</hi> Ergo, <hi>All they which can deliuer by vniforme Tradition a false sense, may also deliuer a false text.</hi> In this argument he denyeth the antecedent or assumption. I answere. First, as I sayd, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is peruerted, and the medium, or meanes of proofe changed; for there is great difference betwixt Being as easy, &amp;, Being as possible, seing a thing may be as possible as another, and yet not so easy. That ten men should conspire to deceaue me, is not so easy as that three should so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire, as is euident; Yet it is as possible as the other, because no reason can be brought to proue that three may so conspire, that proues not that also ten may do the like. In the same manner though we should grant the sense may be more easily mistaken by the Church then the text, yet it is as possible, that the Church be mistaken in the sense: Because no reason proues that vniforme Tradition can be mistaken in the sense, that proues not that it is possible that the Church may be mistaken in the text, though perchance not so easily. Now, if the Church in her vniforme Tradition may be mistaken about the text, then is not Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a sufficient ground of infallible perswasion that the text is the Apostles, and so fayth is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, which hath no other ground to know assuredly the incorrupt Scriptures deliuered by the Apostles but Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as hath been prooued.</p>
                              <p>Secondly it is false, that the sense and doctrine of Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mayne and substantiall articles of fayth, may be sooner cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and a false sense persuaded to the Church, then a false text. The reason is manifest, because millions of Christians know by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the doctrine of Scripture about mayne points, that know not all the texts by which the same is proued, yea perchance truly &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not so much as one. For example the doctrine, that there are Three Diuine Persons, and One God, is so ingrauen in the harts of all, euen simple Christians, as you may sooner pull out their harts, then make them belieue that this is not the Christian fayth: whence no man can deny the Trinity, but he is presently noted by al. On the other side this text 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 5.7. wherby the Trinity is proued, <hi>There be three that giue testimony in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and these three are one,</hi> millions do not know, and so it is more easy to take from Christians this text then the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therof. And the same reason is of any other text, the texts being stil commonly farre more vnknowne then the doctrine of the Creed, &amp; such substantiall points.</p>

                           <p>The Minister in making answere vnto this Paragraffe, is from the beginning to the end not only exceeding bitter, and full of rayling, but also impertinent, not vnderstanding the state of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersy, nor what the Iesuite vndertaketh to proue. The Iesuites conclusion bendeth against some Protestants with whom he dealt in his Conferences, holding there is no fundamentall difference betwixt the Roman Church and the Protestant, that men may be saued indifferently in the one and the other, Protestant doctrines wherein they differ from the Roman, though they should be errours not being fundamentall, and damnable errours.</p>
                           <p>The Iesuits intention was agaynst these men not to proue absolutely that Protestants erre, (for then he would haue proued the Nine obiected articles to be errours, by such testimonyes of Scriptures and Fathers as would haue puzzeled the Minister) but supposing as giuen and not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his aduersaryes, <hi>Dato, &amp; non concesso,</hi> that Protestants erre, he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh to shew their errours to be mayne, fundamental and damnable, and that the mantayners therof cannot be saued, and so no saluation to be had but in the one, Catholike Church.

                     <p>Secondly, their denying the <note n="(z)" place="margin">The Minister though he deny the Primacy of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> yet is forced by the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the sacred Text to gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce this primacy is proued. First, <hi>p.</hi> 157. that S. Peter <hi>had the Primacy of spirituall authority &amp; vniuersall Iurisdiction ouer the whole Church with the rest of the Apostles.</hi> Secondly, that this <hi>was giuen him singularly,</hi> 
                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:2259:168"/> to wit, as appeares by the Ghospell <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 20.21. by the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar order &amp; institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ applyed to him. Now this doth inforce Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall primacy. For the three different formes of gouernement, <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, Aristocracy, Monarchy,</hi> are nothing els but three different applications of the primacy of iurisdiction vniuersall, to different persons. Primacy of vniuersall Iuridiction applyed generally to the whole Commons, is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy,</hi> applyed principally to some few chiefe persons of the State, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocracy,</hi> applyed singularly to one indiuiduall person, <hi>Monarchy.</hi> And what is vnderstood by Monarchy, but primacy of power and vniuersall Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction applyed singularly to one indiuiduall person ouer all the affaires of a whole and entiere state? Hence the Apostles were, as the Fathers say, both equall and inferiour vnto Peter. Equall, in that they had the same kind of power that Peter had, to wit the authority of the Key-bearers, of the Rockes, of the Pastors of the vniuersall Church, nor doe we read in the Ghospell any kind of power giuen to Peter which was not also giuen for kind to the rest: on the other side, the other Apostles were inferiour vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> as the same Fathers affirme, in that they had the same kind of power in a lower degree with subordination vnto <hi>Peter</hi> as the chiefe, no kind of power being giuen to the rest of the Apostles, which we doe not expressely reade in the Ghospell to haue been giuen to S. <hi>Peter</hi> by singular commission, order, and institution. Whence it is consequent that <hi>Peter</hi> was gouernour of the whole Church with the rest, in more eminent degree of power and Iurisdiction then the rest, all men being bound to obey him more specially, more singularly, and aboue the rest. The eminency of the rest in the Church was vniuersall power had by commission directed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to them all, wherby they all indifferently, not one more then the other, receaued commission of power in respect of all men of the Church distinct from themselues. The eminency of <hi>Peter</hi> in the Church was vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall power giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by commission directed singularly to his only person, <hi>To Peter the sonne of Ionas, Matth.</hi> 16.18. Wherby he was endued with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of Ecclesiasticall power in respect of all men in the Church distinct from himselfe, in which number all Christians absolutely are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, not one excluded. And this is Monarchy. Now, if Christ did ordayne and institute Monarchicall Gouernement in his Church, then the gouernement thereof must be, and was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euer <hi>Monarchicall,</hi> and that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> still hath had a Monarchicall successour; but if he had such a successour it is by all historyes more euident then the sunne, that he had no other but the Roman Bishop.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels to be infallible or not. His answere hereunto is like the oracle of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> giuen in generall and doubtfull tearmes, to wit, that Protestants giue the same authority vnto Councells that the ancient Church did; in the margent he cites S. <hi>Augustine</hi>; that Councells of Bishops are not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled vnto Scriptures, as doubtles they may not. The truth is, though he be ashamed to say it in plaine tearmes, Protestants hold General Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells lawfully assembled to be inferiour not only vnto Scripture, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vnto their exposition thereof. For they teach, that Councells be <hi>not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by the holy Ghost, that it is most pernicious yea abominable to thinke so of them. Luther Tom.</hi> 7. <hi>Germ. Wittenberg. fol.</hi> 262. and though they proceed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and be confirmed by the supreme Pastours, yet be they fallible, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, refusable, and subiect to the Protestant skill in Scripture. In so much as the same <hi>Luther in his articles, art.</hi> 115. sayth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

This done then speake of meeting with Catholikes in a Generall Councell: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Catholikes by meeting with you, are sure to gayne no peace and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity except they yield vnto you; &amp; besides by the very yielding to meete with you they must for euer renounce the infallibility of Councells, such a diuine stay of peace and vnity in the Church. That this perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation vnto Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cells must be made by meeting with you, is cleere. For by admitting you who question the authority of Councells, into their Councells, they must admit that it is at least questionable, among Christians, whether such Councells be infallibly assisted by Gods holy spirit, or not, els they cannot meet with you, but must fly from you as damned heretikes. If they admit the infallibility of Councells to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable, they must bid this infallibility farewell for euer, it can neuer be established by any ensuing consent of Generall Councels. For if a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell should define that Generall Councells are infallible, except we be sure aforehand that Councells are infallible we may doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Councell doth not erre in defining that Councels are infallible.

First that euery man is iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by the iustice of Christ, by being as it were vested therewith. Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly, this Iustice of Christ is formally imputed vnto euery man, not throgh repentance and mortification, but through <hi>Fayth only.</hi> Thirdly, that this fayth is not the dogmaticall or historicall fayth, whereby we belieue in generall the wordes of Christ and reuealed misteryes of the Scripture, but a speciall fayth wherby a man doth firmely and infallibly perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that to him in particular the Iustice of Christ is imputed for the full remission of his sinnes. Fourthly, that he that hath not firme fayth that his sinnes are remitted vnto him by the imputation of Christs merits, hath not Iustifying fayth, nor is iust in the sight of God, but as good as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell, though he haue historicall fayth that all the doctrins of Christian Religion are true. Hence you may perceyue, that our Minister is a man of no fayth, who not only denyes this article of Protestancy, not only sayes that they neyther now hold or euer held it, but also reuileth the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> charging him with <hi>Lying,</hi> with <hi>Calumniation,</hi> with <hi>Deprauing and falsifying their Protestant doctrine, and that he wanted matter to fraught his papers when he charged their Church with teaching Iustification by this speciall Fayth.</hi> pag. 163. yea on the contrary side he sayth, that Protestants hold these foure points. First, that <hi>a Christian of a contrite spirit belieuing that his sinnes are remissible, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth forgiuenes though he want fayth, and perswasion in himselfe that his sinnes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him in particular by the imputation of Christs merit.</hi> pag. 166. lin. 6. &amp; seq. Secondly, that Protestants <hi>hold no man is iustifyed by only fayth, or by only belieuing himselfe to be iust, and his sinnes forgiuen by the imputation of the Iustice of Christ, but he must be iust before he can, or ought to belieue himselfe to be so.</hi> pag. 62. lin. 8. Thirdly, <hi>that the promise of remission of sinnes is conditionall, requiring of sinners not fayth only,</hi> but also the forsaking of sinne and doing good works. Esa. 1.16.17.18. <hi>and that this promise becomes not absolute, till the conditions be fulfilled.</hi> pag. 166. lin. 12. Fourthly, that <hi>Iustifying fayth is the Christian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Dogmaticall fayth, wherby we belieue the hystories of Scripture and mysteries of our Religion.</hi> ibid. pag. 161. lin. 5. Wherfore he sayth that the difference betwixt Protestants and vs Catholikes, is only in two points. First, that they require not only dogmaticall fayth, but also that this be a <hi>Fiduciall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> that is, ioyned with Hope pag. 163. lin. 1. But we forsooth <hi>hold Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by dogmaticall fayth only, and by such fayth as is in Diuells, and do not require that the dogmatical or intellectual assent be also fiducial,</hi> that is, ioined with Hope. pag. 168. lin. 2. Secondly, that we hold that a man cannot be certayne by fayth that he is iust: but Protestants hold the contrary; yet he sayth pag. 167. lin. 20. that <hi>there is very small difference, if any at all, betwixt them &amp; vs herein,</hi> because they do not hold this their assurance that they are iust, to be equall in the firmity of assent, to the assurance of Dogmaticall fayth which they haue about the common obiect of fayth. Thus the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister: whome I leaue to the censure of Protestants, with no little won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they can indure him to write in this sort, and thus openly to disclaime &amp; shew himselfe ashamed of the very Essence of their Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne amongst Protestants, if this may be denyed? Howsoeuer I conclude this point with this syllogisme against them. Protestants, euen by the tacite concession of this their Aduocate hold fundamentall and damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, as certainly as it is certaine that they hold Iustification, not by common Dogmaticall fayth, but by speciall fayth only, whereby one apprehends the Iustice of Christ and vesteth himselfe therewith, belieuing in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar his sinnes to be forgiuen, and himselfe to be iust in Gods sight by the imputation thereof vnto him through this his fayth. But that Protestants hold this as a most fundamentall article of their Religion, is as certaine as it is certayne that there is, or euer was Protestant in the world; Wherin I appeale to the Iudgement of all learned Protestants, and to these their bookes, <hi>Luther Epist. ad Galat.

Note, that concerning the necessity of Baptisme there be three errours, the one greater then the other. The first, that though Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme be the only ordinary meanes of saluation, yet some children dying without Baptisme are saued by extraordinary fauour, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed in the wombe. <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.2.53. This is held by some Catholikes, but no fundamentall errour, because it affirmes not any extraordinary fauour but such as by the word of God we know may be graunted, only it doth rashly apply Gods extraordinary fauours to persons without sufficient warrant. The second errour is, that though Baptisme be the ordinary meanes of saluation for Infants, yet in defect therof there is also another ordinary meanes for their saluation, to wit the fayth of their Parents. This errour is grosse, because it presumes without the word of God written or vnwritten, to appoint an ordinary meanes of saluation for Infants. This doctrine is taught by Protestants, but no Catholike holds it: <hi>Caietan</hi> once held it with submission vnto the Church, which hath razed it out of his bookes. The third errour is, that the children of faythfull Parents are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed by the promise made to their seed, and are Gods adopted children before they be borne, so that Baptisme doth not truly regenerate them, &amp; make them Gods children, but is sayd to regenerate and adopt, because it is a seale and signe of this grace of adoption, which children had before Baptisme, yea brought with them into the world. This errour is funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and damnable, which Protestants hold, and will hold in despite of their Church, and yet dares she not say they are not her children. <hi>Caluin de vera Eccles. reform. inter eius opuscula fol.</hi> 759. writeth: <hi>The Issue of the faythfull is borne into the world holy and sanctifyed, because their children being yet in the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be before they draw breath, be adopted into the couenant of eternall life. For it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the grace of adoption go before baptisme, which grace is not the cause of halfe-saluation, but bringeth perfect and full saluation, which is afterward signed by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi> Thus Caluin. What the Minister brings out of the sayd Caluin to proue he held that Baptisme doth truly sanctify, to wit, that children are regenerated by Baptisme, is idle. For vnto it Caluin himselfe hath made answere, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>Institut. c.</hi> 15. §. 2. <hi>When</hi> (sayth he) <hi>Baptisme is sayd to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, to renew, to sanctify, to saue men, the meaning is not, that our purgation &amp; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is made by water, or that water hath vertue to purify, to regenerate, to renew, but only because by that signe we conceyue knowledge and certitude of such gifts; for what is giuen by the message of the Ghospell, is signed and sealed by Baptisme.</hi> Heere also I conclude, that eyther the Minister and his Church erres fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, or at least they must grant foure thinges.

                           <p>The Minister in this question knowes not well what to stand vnto. He graunts the question, and then he denyes it agayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting himselfe, yea censuring his owne whole discourse as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. This I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate out of his owne wordes. First <hi>pa.</hi> 242. he sayth, that the question <hi>is not about Diuine and Religious worship of Images, but about any kind of reall worship.</hi> These be his very wordes. <hi>The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether Images be to be adored with diuine worship, or not, is Heterogeneous, that is, impertinent to this disputation. It is sufficient that Papists adore and worship Images with some kind of Reall worship, such as the Trident Councell expressely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth.</hi> Thus he there, professing that to impugne <hi>Iconolatry,</hi> or diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of images, is impertinent. And yet in the beginning of this disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he professeth contrarywise to impugne this only Adoration, &amp; not euery kind of worship of Images. Thus he writes <hi>pag.</hi> 212. <hi>The Aduocate of Images should first of all haue declared what he vnderstandeth by worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whether Veneration only, or Adoration properly so called. Veneration signifies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall reuerence &amp; regard of pictures, such as is giuen to Churches Communion-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and sacred vessels; And according to this notion many haue approued worspippe of Images that deny adoration. Adoration properly so taken, is yelding of honour by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious submission of soule &amp; body &amp;c. the worshipping of Images in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</hi> Thus the Minister. Who to proue that Protestants allow venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or externall worshippe of Images, in his margent citeth Iunius against Bellarmine, professing in the name of all Protestants; <hi>None of vs say, Images are not to be worshipped, much lesse do we say, that they are no waies to be worshipped.</hi> WE ALLOW, <hi>that they be worshipped in their kind as Images, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:2259:175"/> but not with Religious worshippe.</hi> Behold how cleerly he grants the question in hand, euen asmuch as the answerer intended to proue. For what the Minister sayth, that the Answerer doth not declare what he vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth by worshippe, whether externall Veneration or internall Adoration, is false. For he often and cleerly affirmeth, that the worship he meanes to proue to be due vnto the Image of our Sauiour, is the externall regard &amp; the reuerence of bowing, such as is vsed towards Aultars and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion tables out of inward religions reuerence and deuotion vnto Christ. This the Answerer did set down presently in the beginning of his disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urse about images, and repeates the same almost in euery paragraffe. See his text in the Ministers booke <hi>pag.</hi> 214. <hi>Outwardly to the Image, inwardly to Christ. pag.</hi> 206. <hi>Externally to the Image, by mentall affection vnto the person. pa.</hi> 827. <hi>Outwardly to the Image, by deuout and pious Imagination to the person,</hi> and the like very often.</p>
                           <p>Nor is the Ministers insinuation true, that the Councell of Trent doth define the worshippe of Images vnder the tearmes of Religious Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. First, the Councell nether vseth the tearme Religious, nor Adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but Veneration, the tearme, the very word allowed by the Minister. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Councell declares, that this Veneration <hi>is outward regard, as kneeling, bowing the body, vncouering the head, done before the Images of our Sauiour, to the end we may adore him,</hi> that is, testify our inward supreme deuotion towards him. Finally, it is false that Adoration doth properly signify Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine &amp; Religious worship, seing properly according to the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the word in Scripture, it signifyes any bowing of the body in signe of reuerence; as might be proued by more then an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred examples of Scripture where creatures are said to be adored. The Fathers sometimes take the word <hi>Adore</hi> in the more principall sense, and <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> only for diuine worshippe. In which sense they say only God is adored. <hi>Epiphan. haeres.</hi> 79. <hi>Sit in honore Maria, Deus adoretur. Hieronymus Ep.</hi> 53. <hi>Non Angelos vel aliquam creaturam adoramus.</hi> Yet also the same Fathers take the word in the proper sense, &amp; say, that other things besides God are adored as <hi>Men.

                              <p>This description of an Image sheweth the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of proper Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our Sauiour fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> types and figures. By declaration wherof the cheife part of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters disputation will be answered, which is grounded vpon confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of these two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Image represents the person of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, according to the true and proper shape of his kind, and some indiuiduall propertyes that agree to him only. Such is the Image of a man crucified, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayted accordinge to speciall circumstances recorded in the gospell. A figure represents his person in the shape of some creature dissonant from his forme &amp; kind whose corporall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties haue resemblance with our Sauiours morall and spirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Thus the Lyon and Lambe be types or metaphoricall Images of our Sauiour, which resemble him not in corporall shape, but in his heauenly perfections, his mildnes being figured by the Lambe, his forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude by the Lyon.</p>
                              <p>From this fundamentall difference other three flow. First, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Image represents to mans Imagination, making him to apprehend by Imagination the person, or the samplar, as really present before his eies. The figure represents to mans vnderstanding, which apprehends by reason the analogy or proportion which the corporall qualityes of the figure haue with the morall propertyes, and perfections of the thing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured. Secondly, vpon sight of the proper Image, straight a mentall imagination of the person resultes in one that knoweth him, especially when the knowledge is ioyned with affection; and this is done so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, that ocular aspect of the Image, and mentall Imagination of the person seeme to be one and the same act; But vpon sight of the figure, the apprehension of the thinge figured, doth not instantly follow, but is leasurely caused by discourse, comparing the one with the other.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, hence the proper Image is taken for the prototype, that what is done to the Image by way of outward honour or dishonour, the same is, &amp; ought to be taken as done to the person, and this by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall force of Imagination, and by natures institution in this matter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any positiue ordinance. The figure is not so taken without some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue ordinance or custome. For example: If a Iew teare in peeces the Image of our Sauiour by way of despite, that is done, and to be taken as done mentally, and by affection to our Sauiour; but if he tread vnder foote bread and wine, that is not to be taken as done in disgrace of our Sauiours body and bloud, wherof bread and wine be types and figures, except that bread and wine be sanctified to represent his body &amp; bloud.</p>
                           </note> is a distinct and liuely portrayture of some visible and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thinge, parts of the Image corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2259:176"/>
to the parts of the thinge repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, more or lesse particularly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Image is more or lesse distinct and liuely.</p>
                        <p>The office of an Image is to carry the Imagination of the beholders therof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and immediatly to the person Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined therin, imagination of parts in the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2259:176"/>
person represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, answering to the parts seen in the Image; which kind and vse of Images Nature allowes vnto men, to the end they may remember, and more liuely imagine persons absent &amp; remoued from their corporall sight, vpon whom they ought, and haue great desire liuely and stayedly to fix their Imaginations, and Thoughts.</p>

                           <p>Hence ariseth the allowed <hi>Principle of Nature,</hi> receiued by all Nations, Ciuill and Barbarous, <hi>Ita vt in eo,</hi> to speake with <hi>S. Augustine, nulla doctorum paucitas, nulla indoctorum turba dissentiat:</hi> That the Image may and ought to stand for the prototype, and is by Imagination to be taken as it were the very person. And <note n="(d)" place="margin">The Minister <hi>pag. 214.</hi> sayth; <hi>This axione is not true of all Images, but onely of such Images as are by ciuill or diuine ordinance appointed to stand for the Prototype.</hi> This he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues by the examples of the brasen Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe, Golden CHERVBIMS, which might not be adored, thogh Images of Christ; yea Ezechias defaced the Image, that is, the brase<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet adored the Prototype Christ. <hi>Answer.</hi> These examples are impertinent. The brasen Serpent, and the Paschall Lambe were types and figures of our Lord; which we grant by the meere natiue force of Imagination, without positiue ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, do not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily stand for the thing figured; yea the Iewes, at the least the vulgar, did not vnderstand that the brasen serpent was a type of the Messias, nor can it be proued that <hi>Ezechias</hi> himselfe so vnderstood it. The question is of proper Images of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: These we say stand for the prototype inuiolably by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that honour done, or denyed outwardly to the Image, is done or denyed mentally to the person, and ought so to be taken. The Minister if he will speake to the purpose, must bring some examples where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Image may be disgraced, without dishonour done to the Prototype; which he will neuer find. For euen <hi>Ezechias</hi> when he brake in peeces the brasen serpent, did therein dishonour the proper prototype therof, to wit, the true serpent, of which the brasen was the direct &amp; proper Image, and of which he shewed contempt, in respect of being adored of men, by tearing in peeces the Image, because it was adored with reference vnto it, as Heathens worshipped the Images of Serpents and Calues. The truth of this difference between an image &amp; figure, may be made euident vnto the Minister by this familiar example. If his wife be found behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and kissing his Image, that is set in the frontispice of his Reply, with verses in praise of his sweet &amp; gracious face; ought not this to be taken as done mentally to his person? And were not the contrary to wronge her? yet there is no ciuill Ordinance, nor Parlament law that this his Image stand for him. On the other side, if she be found kissing &amp; making much of her little dogge, though that be the type of a preaching Minister; must that be taken as done vnto him? No verily. It is then cleere, that there is difference betwixt figures and proper Images, in respect of standing for the prototype. Hence this principle, Honour &amp; Dishonour done, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed outwardly to the proper Image, is done, or denyed mentally to the person, cannot be proued euer to faile: nor can our Minister shew by the word of God, that any proper Image of an adored person, was euer lawfully made, and not lawfully adored.</note> what we outwardly do to the Image, is done by Imagination to the person. And when we kisse the hands and feete of the Image, in our Imagination we kisse the hands and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2259:177"/>
feet of the person inwardly Imagined by his Image. This is the Axiome of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy gathered out of <hi>Aristotle: Idem est motus in Imaginem &amp; Exemplar.</hi> For motion proceeding from the body &amp; mind, what the body doth really and externally to the Image, the mind doth Imaginarily, that is, by conceite &amp; affection, to the <note n="(e)" place="margin">This is then the first argument for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe of our Sauiours Image which may be thus su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med. The proper Image, so stands for the Prototype, that what is done by way of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward honour to the Image, is done by affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the person; &amp; whosoeuer denyes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Reuerence to the Image, is to be taken as denying mentally Reuerence to the person. But our Sauiour is worthy of all worship, so that it is impious to deny any worship vnto him. Therfore (supposing what Protestants grant, that the Image of our Sauiour is lawfully made) it is impious to deny outward Reuerence vnto it.</note> person.</p>

Where is now the vniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Fathers?</hi> Answere. First, <hi>S. Athanasius,</hi> though he speake particularly of the kings Image, yet his reason is the same in all the proper Images of any adored person. For his reason why the kings Image must be adored, is because the Image of the king may (not by corporal speach but by the euidence of the thing) truly say, I and the king who is adored, be one; but this the proper Image of any adored person may truly say aswell as the kings. For example, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that were true which our Minister sayth. <hi>pag.</hi> 224. <hi>lin.</hi> 21. that <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters haue such vnion with God, as they are to be adored with Religious adoration,</hi> why may not the Image of our Adored Minister which is set in the front of this Reply say, I &amp; the Minister are one, he is in me, &amp; I in him, he that adoreth me, adoreth him, and who disgraceth me, disgraceth him aswell as the kings? And if the Ministers Image may truly affirme, I &amp; an adored person are one, why may not also the Image of our Sauiour, (who is a person more to be adored the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Minister) say the same? <hi>S. Basill</hi> speakes not particularly of the kings Image, but sayth vniuersally, that honour done to the Image, is done and referred to the person, and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in particular, that it is so in the adoration of the king &amp; his Image, so that there <hi>are not two adorations, but one,</hi> which being done outwardly to the Image, is referred and taken, as referred mentally to the kinge. It is true, <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> speakes of the Image and Crosse of Christ. That he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not the materiall Crosse but the Passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Minister doth say, but he cannot proue it, seing <hi>S. Ambros. orat. in Theodos.</hi> sayth expressely, <hi>that the Crosse is adored,</hi> and in his dayes the holy wood of the Crosse was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely proposed to be adored, as sayth <hi>S. Paulinus Epist.</hi> 11. <hi>ad Seuerum. S. Augustine</hi> sayth <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>de doctrin. Christian. c.</hi> 25. that such Images are not idle inuentions of men which are proposed by lawfull authority; but such be the Images of Christ and his Saints euer vsed by the Christian Church.

                                 <hi>S. Damascen</hi> liued nine ages agoe, &amp; so was by an hundred yeares neerer vnto Christ then vnto vs, how then is he not ancient? What you say, that according to Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine he was not Orthodoxe, <hi>but denyed the procession of the Holy Ghost from God the Sonne,</hi> you wronge both <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and him. For <hi>Bellarmine l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Christo c.</hi> 27. not only affirmes, but proues that <hi>S. Damascene</hi> held the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the holy Ghost from the Sonne, <hi>quoad rem,</hi> as for the matter, though he allowed not the forme of speach, <hi>procedit ex filio,</hi> because it was vsed by Heretiks in a false sense, as though the sonne onely had bene the immediate origen of the holy Ghost, and not also the Father. And this is all <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayth <hi>in libro de Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis</hi>; nor doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> say, that <hi>Damascene</hi> denyed the procession of the holy Ghost from the Son, though your put these downe in a distinct letter, as <hi>Bellarmines</hi> very words. This is false play.</note> who thus writes: <hi>An Image of the Kinge is nothing else but the forme &amp; shape of the King, which could it speak, would, and might truly say, I and the king are one, the king is in me, and I in him, so that who adoreth me his Image, doth therein adore the very King.</hi> Thus he: shewing that the kings Image, is to be imagined, and by Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be conceaued as the very king.</p>

She answered: Know brother, that the feet of the King of heauen are more louely and venerable then are the lips of an Earthly king.

First, Iudas his lips were conioyned substantially with Iudas that none could bow or bend vnto them, or kisse them, without seeming to bow, &amp; to do honour vnto his person, in regard he being an intellectuall creature, was an obiect capable of veneration, terminated and stayed in his owne person. But the Crosse being a senseles thing, is not an obiect sufficient to stay veneration within it selfe, neither is it a part belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to the substance of any wicked man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred vnto the punishing of our Sauiour, but rather was fixed vnto, and ioyned to his body, and so the outward bowing to the Crosse is done mentally, &amp; is taken as done onely vnto Christ, whom we behold as stretched theron.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the Crosse, the Nayles, the Launce, &amp; other such instruments being senseles creatures, may be thought off as things sanctified by the touch of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours body, they not hauing any thing in them contrary to the sanctity of Christ, &amp; so could not hinder the conceipt of such imputed sanctity. But Iudas being most wicked and detestable, and full of the most horrible Treason that euer was, did so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file &amp; prophane his whole person, and all the parts therof, that the meere touch of our Sauiours most sacred mouth could not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2259:183"/>
sanctify, nor make holy vnto Christian Imagination, his lips, without changing and sanctifying his hart. For so long as he continueth without repenting his treason, the liuely remembrance of that execrable fact doth so possesse a Christian hart, as no respectfull thought to him can enter into it.</p>
                           <p>Finally, the passion of Christ may be considered two wayes. First, as proceeding from the will of wicked men, the Diuels instruments to torment him. In which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, it is not gratefull vnto God, but a detestable sinne in the Authours therof.

Which in my Iudgement is sufficient to make any Iudicious man mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slike Protestant writers, that defend their Religion by such palpable vntruthes.

                              <p>Two things you here deuise for defence of your Brother. First you say <hi>pag.</hi> 241. <hi>lin.</hi> 25. that the determination in the Councell, in this and in many other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, is like Appollo his riddles, so ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, as no wonder your Brother was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued. I Answere that the Councell of Trent allowes onely bowing before Images, with inward reference of the adoring affection vnto Christ, as any man that shall peruse the decree wil presently perceaue. Secondly, though the meaning of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell were darke &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, yet whether the Councell gaue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in this forme of words, <hi>some Images are to be worshipped with latria,</hi> cannot be obscure, nor can any mistake their<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but only misrelate agaynst his knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, through desire to deceaue.</p>
                              <p>Now your Brother chargeth the Councell with giuing a comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in this very forme of words <hi>in his Way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions from the Church digress. 49. numero 5 pag.</hi> 345. <hi>lin. 10. The Church of Rom</hi> (sayth he) <hi>commands that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>me Images be worshipped,</hi> with Diuine honour, <hi>the very same that is due to God himselfe.</hi> The words <hi>with Diuine honour</hi> are set in a distinct letter, and the Councell of Trent is cited as commanding in this forme of speach, in the 25. Sessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, where no such wordes are found in any part of the Councell. Is not this inexcusable lying?</p>
                              <p>Secondly, for his excuse <hi>ibidem lin.</hi> 33. you say, <hi>That which induced my Brother to charge the Trent Maisters with defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Diuine worship of images, was their silence in condemninge the teachers of such diuine worship, but especially the practise of the late Pontificians, that since the Councell teach Diuine worship of Images. Answer.</hi> First, though later De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines did teach Diuine worship to be giuen to some Images, yet this would not excuse your Brother from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Councell. For your Brother doth not onely say, that some Pontificians so hold, but that the Church of Rome defines, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Diuine worship of Images, citing the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of <hi>Trent Sess.</hi> 25. so defining in as many words. Is not this kind of lying damnable, as being grosse in matter of religion &amp; saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Secondly, you eyther ignorantly mistake, or wilfully peruert the meaning of those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, as the Answerer doth shew in the next Paragraffe.</p>
                           </note> Councell of Trent taught that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2259:185"/>
worship is to be giuen vnto Images,</hi> there being no such words in the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell? As for the Iesuit, <hi>Vasquez</hi> whom he citeth, as so expounding the Councell, no such doctrine is found in him, either in the place quoted by the Minister, or in any part of his workes, yea the contrary is found <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>de adorat. disp.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 3. It is not (quoth he) to be said, that diuine honour is giuen vnto Images. Neyther doth <hi>Suarez</hi> the other Iesuit cited, expound the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel <hi>to giue diuine worship vnto Christs Image,</hi> but only saith, that out of the Councel it may be gathered, that the Image of Christ, and Christ, are honoured by one and the same act of worship, which as referred vnto Christ, is Diuine worship, as referred vnto the Image, not diuine worship but inferior veneration. For as he declareth <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>part. To.</hi> 1. <hi>disp.</hi> 54. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>ad</hi> 7. <hi>Ille actus respectu pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totypi est propriè Latria &amp;c. respectu viz. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis, non est tam perfecta adoratio, sed inferior veneratio.</hi> The worship of Christ and his Image though one and the same Physicall act, is virtually two fold, being diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour towards Christ, not diuine, but a kind of inferiour honour towards the Image.</p>
                        <p>Nor is <hi>M. Whites [Way pag.</hi> 400] Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment good, <hi>We worship Christ and his Image by the same act, but the worship of Christ is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne honour. Ergo, the worship of the Image is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2259:185"/>
diuine honour.</hi> For this proueth onely that the worship of the Image and of Christ being one and the same act, is diuine as referred to Christ, not as referred vnto the Image. Otherwise if <hi>M. White</hi> should helpe to pull his fellow-Ministers horse out of the mire, moued therunto out of christian charity and friendship, one might by the like argument proue that he beareth chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charity towards horses, for he reliueth the horse, and pleasureth his friend by one and the same acte. The pleasuring of his friend is an acte of christian charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. <hi>Ergo</hi> the pullinge of the horse out of the mire is an act of christian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards the horse. A foolish argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, because that one acte is virtually twofold; as referred to the man owner of the horse christian charity, as referred to the horse only, no charity at all, but a baser kind of loue, and that for his friends sake. The like is when we kisse with our corporall lips the feete of the Image of Christ, at the same time by deuout and reuerent Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation kissing his true feet represented by the Image, we honour Christ &amp; his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge by one and the same Physicall acte, and that acte is diuine worship, though not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine as referred to the Image, but onely as referred vnto Christ. A thing so easely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by learned men, as I meruaile Ministers vnderstand it not, or wrangle in a matter so cleer, if they <hi>sincerely seeke truth.</hi>
                           <pb n="146" facs="tcp:2259:186"/>
And though the ignorant vnderstand not the tearmes of Theology, by which Deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes declare the manner of honoring the Prototype, and the Image, both by one acte, yet may they honour an Image, as securely &amp; with as little danger of erring as any that vnderstands them. For as the Clowne who knowes no more of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of motion, then that he is to set one foote before another, doth moue in the very same manner as Philosophers, who explicate that action by tearmes most obscure, of intrinsecal and extrinsecall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending, and <hi>per vltimum non esse, &amp; primum non esse</hi>; so likewise a catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that vnderstands no more of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Christ his Image, then that he is by beholding the Image to remember Christ, and with pious &amp; affectuous imagination to adore him, doth honour our Sauiour &amp; his Image by one and the same acte, as truly, verily, &amp; religiously as the greatest Diuine that can learnedly explicate the manner how that adoration is performed as being done outwardly, relatiuely, and transitorily vnto the Image, affectuously, absolutely, finally vnto Christ.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, wheras he saieth, That the councell of <hi>Nice</hi> brought in the worship of Images, yet forbad that any Image should be adored with Diuine honour, he both contradicts himselfe, and vttereth another manifest falshood. He contradicts
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2259:186"/>
himselfe in saying that the <hi>Nicene</hi> councel forbad diuine worship of any Image, seing in another place he thus writeth, <hi>Defence pag.</hi> 453. <hi>Both the Councell of Nice, and the Deuines of the Church of Rome hold the Images of God, and our Sauiour, and the Crosse must be adored with Diuine adoration</hi>

And the scope of the whole chapter is to declare, that the reason why in the old Testament the Fathers mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliked the worship of Images of God, was because they could not paint him aright, <hi>Cùm Deum nemo vidisset vnquam,</hi> because then no man had seen God <note n="(k)" place="margin">The Minister saith, that the Iewes at least might haue adored the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Prophets, if such adoration had bene lawfull, as the Papists hold.

Let him, I say, shew that Images of Prophets were set in the beginning of their Prophesies, as his is set in the frontispice of this his Reply, and I promise him to proue the same were honoured. This is the thinge wherof we require example in Scripture, and wherin the Minister is as dumbe as a fish, not able to shew one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Image of an adored person, lawfully made, that might not lawfully be adored.</note>. <hi>Afterwards</hi> God (saith <hi>Polidore) hauing taken flesh, and being become visible to mortall eyes, men flocked to him, and did without doubt behold and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his face shining with the brightnes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine light, and euen then they began to paint, or carue his image already imprinted in their mindes. And these Images they receiued with great worship and veneration, as was reason, the honour of the Image redounding to the original (as Basill writes:) which custome of adoring Images, the Fathers were so farre from repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, as they did not onely admit therof, but also decreed, and commanded the same by Generall Councells in the time of Constantine the fourth and Iustinian the second his sonne. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

what man is there so dissolute &amp; audacious as can dreame of the contrary, and doubt of the Lawfulnes of this Worship established so long ago by decree of most holy Fathers?</hi> Thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Polidore,</hi> and much more to the same purpose in the very place where the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Citeth him to the contrary; which shewes, how notoriously his credulous readers are abused in matters of most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hence appeareth the third falshood, that in Gregoryes dayes images began to be set vp in Churches; which to haue bene in the Churches longe before, the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes of <hi>S.

                        <p>Neither can our Aduersary bringe any cleere testimony of antiquity against this custome.

For may not Images painted on tables, be in Churches, and yet neither made in the Church, nor painted on walls? which kind of Images the Councell doth not forbid. And why doth the Councel forbid
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2259:188"/>
Images to be made in the Church as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the fabricke therof, or to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on Walls, but out of reuerence vnto Images? for they being holy things, and so to be honoured for their prototypes sake, the Councel thought it vnworthy of their dignity, that they should be made on walls where they may easily be defaced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and by Persecutours (for that Councell was held in time of persecution) abused.

this was the Image of some prophane man hanging in the Church, as if it had been a sacred Image of Christ, or of some Saint, which is gathered by his reason: When I saw, saith he, against the authority of the Scriptures, the Image of a man hanging in the Church; not absolutely any Image (as <hi>M.

of a thing doth also forbid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention therof.

In like manner, Gods precept, <hi>Thou shalt not adore Images,</hi> doth sufficiently forbid intention to adore them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequenly forbids the making of Images with such an intention, so that if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept not to make Images be nothing else then not to haue purpose to adore them, a whole longe sentence in the Decalogue is superfluous, &amp; without any speciall sense. Besides, as to make an Image to adore it is Idolatry, so likewise to take it in hand, or looke on it to that purpose; why then was not such looking, or touching with purpose of adoration expressely forbidden aswell as making? Or if looking on them with intention to adore be so included in the precept, <hi>Thou shalt not adore,</hi> as there needes not that expression; what need was there that making of images with purpose of adoration should be so largely and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly expressed? Wherfore whosoeuer is a religious follower of Gods pure word
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2259:191"/>
must either, without explication, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the makinge of images, together with their worshippe, or els allow the worship of Images (if the Prototypes be adorable) the making wherof he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. Hence I gather, that the most naturall and truest exposition of that precept is, that it forbids not onely the worshippe, but also the making of any Grauen image. But how? to wit, of false Gods, or to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent God accordinge to his Diuine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <note n="(l)" place="margin">
                              <p>This exposition is shewed to be good by the two rules of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues appoynt. The first is, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a word is ambiguous and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, we are to looke to the antecedent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the same with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to them. This text, thou shalt not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke any image, is difficil, as sounding ouer vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally, euen in Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants iudgements: By lookinge vnto the words immediatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, this vniuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is restrained to a true sense. For the words immediatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent are, <hi>Thou shalt not haue false Gods before me.</hi> Now, if we expound what followeth, thou shalt not make any Ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge, by refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto this, to wit, Thou shalt not make any image of false Gods, the sense is cleer truth.</p>
                              <p>The second rule is, when a place is difficil, we must expound the same by another spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is cleere, but the Scripture treating of this precept, doth in the same Chapter <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.13. cleerly declare these forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> images, to be the images of false Gods, saying, <hi>Non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietis Deos argenteos, nec Deos aureos facietis vobis,</hi> you shall not make to your selues Gods of gold or of siluer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what is meant by grauen Images.</p>
                           </note>. This sense is gathered out of the words precedent, Thou shalt not haue strange Gods before me, which is explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the consequent verse, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image,</hi> to wit, of false Gods; for he that makes to himselfe the image of any thinge, as apt to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent God according to his Diuine substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and to conuey our Imaginations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to him, doth make, and hath false Gods, because the true God is not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, nor is truely apprehended by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination conformable vnto any Image.</p>
                        <p>Wherfore the pictures of the Holy Ghost in forme of a Doue, and of God the Father in forme of an Old Man, be not proper &amp; direct Images of the two diuine persons, but onely of the Doue that desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

shadowed. Nor do Catholiks vse them as proper images standinge for their proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types, &amp; conueyinge our actions by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vnto them, for no Catholike doth kisse the feete of the Doue, or lye prostrate at them, referring by imagination that outward subiection to the feete of the holy Ghost, who hath no feet but meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall, not imaginable, nor such as can be represented by Image.</p>
                        <p>Wherfore seing this text is thus cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explicable, and not being explicated at all, doth make no lesse against Protestants, then against vs; I see no reason why they should be so much out of loue with the worshippe of the Image of Christ Iesus their Lord, to which Nature &amp; Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity binds them.</p>

To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere first, that this may seeme a great wrong not onely to the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, but also to Christ himselfe, to thinke that men indued with his knowledge &amp; fayth,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2259:192"/>
and made partakers of the light, wherby they belieue most high, diuine, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible mysteries which he reuealed to the world, should so easily be carried away into such blockish Errours, as to thinke a stocke, or a stone to be God; a blindnes scarce incident vnto men, except they be wholy destitute of all heauenly conceipts, and nuzzelled vp from their cradles in that persuasion, as Paynims were (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely <hi>S. Augustine</hi> speaks,) for they did not onely want this light of Christian instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but also were taught by their Auncestors, that in their Idolls a kind of Diuine vertue, or Godhead was lodged, and affixed vnto them; wheras Catholik Doctrine teacheth the contrary, that our Images are bare resemblances of holy persons, no Diuinity, no Vertue, no Dignity, no Sanctity that makes them venerable being in them, but in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, such Idolls as the Paynims adored, many of them did by Diuels mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ordinarily speake, giue answeres, moue and exercise other actions of life, so that their speaking was not accounted miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and extraordinary, but rather their silence; which speakings were very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente to perswade men to belieue what their Auncestours told them, that those very stocks, and stones were Gods, or had a Godhead affixed vnto them. Now these

kind of things seldome happen in our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, scarce once in a age, and when they happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Miracles wrought, not by the images, or any vertue residing in them, but by Gods infinite power, nor are they brought to proue any excellency affixed vnto the image, but onely that God liketh that we should honour our Sauiour and his Saints in their images.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I dare say, vulgar &amp; ordinary Protestants in England, by reading <note n="(p)" place="margin">The Minister sayth <hi>pag.</hi> 272. that the Creed is as dangerous in this respect as the Scripture, because it names the right hand of God. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi> The Creed ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Catholicks nor vnto Protestants.

Not vnto Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, because they must belieue the Creed no further then they see the same conforme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scripture, and so the Scripture attributing Humane shape vnto God is only dangerous vnto them. For the Scripture perpetually attributes humane shape vnto God, and their common people reade it by themselues, without any guide whom they be bound to belieue further, then by their skill in Scripture they shall find reason.</note> the Bible in their mother tongue are in greater danger, to belieue that God is a body, and hath all the parts therof euen as hath a man, then any the simplest Catholike is to thinke an image to be God.

For it was madnes and folly to paynt Christ &amp; honour him as Crucifyed, &amp; not to thinke that by his death vpon the Crosse he redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the world.

Crucifyed before their eyes. For to forsake Christ crucifyed, pictured by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching as the Sauiour of the world, though it be impious, yet not senseles, yea rather saluation by the crosse of Christ did seeme folly vnto the Gentils. But for men to haue Christ painted, as crucifyed before their eyes, honouring him by Christian deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in regard of his crucifixion and death, and not to expect saluation by his Crosse and death, is sottish and <note n="(s)" place="margin">The Minister is much vexed with the euidence of this Text, not finding which way to euade, as you may see <hi>pag.</hi> 280.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable with any creature, and such is the comprehension of his diuine Essence.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Minister seing the Iesuite to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate his purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst Protestants, to wit, the knowledge of thinges done in all parts of the world, and of secrets of hart to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municable vnto B. Creatures, and this so cleerly as he had not what to reply, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth all these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, affirming pag. 305. l. 1. <hi>That the Iesuite argueth in this sort: Saints see the face of God.</hi> Ergo, <hi>They behold the secrets of harts.</hi> and lin. 17. <hi>That his argument is, They which know or see the greater, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and behold the lesse. But the Saints behold the Essence of God which is greater. Ergo.</hi> These be the Ministers fictions, not the Iesuits arguments. For to proue that the blessed may see secrets of hart, and all thinges done in the world, the Iesuite argueth in this manner vnanswerably. They that haue sufficient vnderstanding for greater and more excellent knowledge, haue sufficient vnderstanding for lesser knowledge; and if greater knowledge be not aboue the eleuated capacity of a creature, then lesser is not. But Saints haue sufficient vnderstanding for the cleere vision of God, and so this knowledge, the greatest of all others, is not perfection aboue that of which creatures are capable by grace. Therfore, knowledge of all things done in all parts of the world, and of secrets of hart, which is lesse high, excellent, and difficill then the vision of God, is communicable by grace vnto creatures: and consequently the Protestants vulgar Argument, that Catholikes make Saints equall vnto God, by teaching that they see mens harts, and all thinges done in the world, is friuolous.</note> vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to behold things done in this inferiour world, as far as they belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to their state? Secondly as for the secrets of harts, God is without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison more spirituall, more secret, more inuisible, and out of the sight of naturall vnderstanding then is any the most secret thought of man, or Angell; and yet the Saints haue so cleere penetrating, &amp; all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering light, as they do most perspicuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly discerne the diuine, hidden, &amp; vnsear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable Essence. What reason is there then why Christians should think the secrets of mens harts inuisible and vnsearchable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? If we looke into Scripture, as the heart <note n="(p)" place="margin">

                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 35.10.</note> In thy light we shall see the light. If there were a <note n="(s)" place="margin">This doctrine of the Glasse, or Mirrour, is brought to shew the possibility how things may be seene in God, not to prooue that of necessity they are seen: and so the Minister might haue spared the paper in citing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of Schooleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the doctrin of the Volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary glasse.</note> glasse of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant so cleere and excellent that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is done in London in secretest corners should therein particularly and distinctly appeare, surely he that hath eyes to see that glasse, may likewise discerne what is done ouer the Citty.

Therefore speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all honour proportionall to the excellency, and superior vnto humane and ciuill, is due vnto them.</hi> To this argument he answereth, <hi>That in Saints there is dignity of grace and glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due in respect of the same, but not religious worship.</hi> Thus he: what is this but to trifle &amp; talke in the ayre? who doubts (<hi>M. White</hi>) but there is the dignity of grace and glory in Saints, and honour due vnto it? Speake plainly and mutter not betwixt the teeth. Is the honour due to Saints proportionall to their excellency, that is, more then ciuill? Is it superhumane &amp; super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall as their excellency is? Is it superiour vnto that kind of honour which is due vnto ciuill magistrates and other human honourable perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages in regard of meere naturall perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? If you grant, that worship su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perhumane, and more then ciuill is due vnto Saints, you grant as much as we desire to proue.

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times religious worship is taken for that which is an elicitiue &amp; formall act of Religion, &amp; of diuine worship due vnto the increated excellency of the Creatour. In this sense the worship of Saints is not religious. At other tymes it is taken for worship which is an imperatiue act of Religion, that is, worship done to Saints out of inward Religion and deuotion towards God, whose seruants and friends they are. In this sense the worship of Saints is Religious, because it doth still proceed, and must needes flow fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inward reuerence towards God. For how can one worship Saints purely and only as they are the friends, seruants, and temples of God, but out of the instinct of Religion vnto God? Hence S. <hi>Augustine</hi> tearmes the honor of Saints <hi>Religious solemnity.</hi> And S.

                           </note>.

                              <p>His answere is large, but all is reduced <hi>to six euasions.</hi> First he saith, that <hi>we may request the prayers of liuing Saints but not inuocate them:</hi> this is ridiculous. For what is it <hi>to inuocate</hi> but to cal vpon, but to implore, but to request? specially with submission, and acknowledging of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perhumane dignity in the person prayed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he saith: <hi>That the liuing Saints be present with the liuing.</hi> What is this to the purpose? be not many mediatours present, more then one onely, aswell as many mediatours absent? If the onely mediatour may haue many subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate mediatours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, without preiudice vnto the onelynes and singularity of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour-ship, why not many subordinate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours absent? Nor is it true, that glorious Saints be not present vnto vs, seing they see as hath been proued, <hi>all things done in the world that belong to their state</hi>; in which respect the holy Fathers of better credit then any Minister, say, <hi>Vniuersi sancti vbique sunt &amp; omnibus prosunt.

For where doth the Scripture say that Christ is the onely mediatour that knowes the secretts of hartes, but that besides him there may be other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours, so they see not the hart? If Christ the onely mediatour may haue the company of many subordinate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, that be clothed with misery and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, why not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of many glorious mediators that see God and in God our harts?

Did they therby ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the only media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour-ship of Christ? God forbid.

The Maister of Requests, is an office of authority made by the kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without whose special order he cannot be appointed. But the office of mediator, that is, of a freind for vs with the king, is an office of grace and fauour, and made by the kings gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce &amp; fauour, bestowed on a man without any further authority. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce if the king make one his familiar Freind or Fauourite, we may (if we can) make him our freind and mediatour vnto the king, without further warrant or authority. Yea sometimes Kings are not willing that their Fauourites should haue so many suitors, which yet they cannot hinder if they will haue Fauourites, the right of being mediatours for others to the King, being inuolued in the grace of Princely fauours. Now to say, that men seeking grace of the king by his Fauorite, do constitute without his order a Maister of Requests, is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Yea rather it were folly, presumption, clownishnes for a poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar vnknowne in the Court to intrude his suites into the Kings audience without the mediation of some that are familiar about him. Wherfore seing God hath made Saints his especiall freinds, and heauenly fauourites, and able to helpe vs, what further warrant is needfull, besides our owne necessityes, to seeke their intercession? Sixtly, the Minister saith, <hi>That liuing Saints are ioint-suitors with vs, who likewise pray for their owne needes, and so are not meere mediatours. But Saints deceased be not ioint-suitors, but meere mediatours, because they pray and intercede for vs, and not for themselues.</hi> Answer. First the Saints in heauen do pray for themselues, to wit, for the glorious resuscita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their bodyes, and that God will reueng their deathes vpon their persecutours, Apoc. 5. Secondly, though Saints do not deprecate for their owne sinnes, and needes, this doth not shew that they are meere mediatours and suitors of higher kind then liuing Saints, but onely that they are growne vnto greater perfection in the same kind of grace, and vnto the consummation therof, vnto which we are not yet arriued. Euen as a growne man doth not need so many things as doth the Child, and yet is he a creature of the same nature and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ind as the Child.</p>
                           </note>.</p>
                        <p>I adde, that to make Saints mediatours subordinate vnto, &amp; dependent of Christ, is to increase his glory. For first, if only Christ Iesus is worthy to haue <hi>immediate accesse vnto God,</hi> and all other Saints men &amp; Angells be mediatours and intercessours, not hauing accesse vnto God but by him, then certainly that Saints mediate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for vs, is exceeding glorious vnto Christ Iesus. But Catholikes teach that Saints be such intercessours as haue no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse vnto God, but through Christ Iesus, by mediation of his merits, passion, and death, <hi>there being no other name in heauen or in earth by which we are to be saued.</hi> Therfore the doctrine that maks Saints subordinate mediatours vnto Christ by him approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vnto God, doth magnify and extoll the supremacy of Christs mediatourship, more then if in this kind of mediation he had none depending on him.</p>
                        <p>Whence I inferre, that Protestants mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake our doctrine when they say we teach that Saints are fellow-mediatours with Christ, and that we bring them in to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of his intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would not be sufficient. This we doe neither teach, nor belieue, but that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2259:222"/>
of Christ are infinite, euery drop of his pretious bloud able to pay the full ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of a millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of worlds. That the Saints mediate and intercede for vs vnto Christ, is for his greater glory, by whose merits they are made worthy of that dignity, and whom by their intercessions they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be the fountayne of all good that comes vnto mankind. If it be a glory to the roote of a tree to haue many boughes and branches loaden with excellent fruite, the Saints being but branches of Christ Iesus the true Vine-tree, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.15. surely the honour of all their meritts springs origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, &amp; is referred finally vnto him. And as it is impossible to honour and prayse the boughes without honouring and praysing of the roote: So likewise it is not possible that Catholikes, who acknowledge that Saints haue all their grace merit &amp; fauour with God from Christ Iesus, should honor them, or pray vnto them, without honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Christ, &amp; without praying finally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto him.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore Saints when they pray for vs that God would forgiue vs our sinnes, grant vs fauours that help vs towards eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, they do not alleadge their merits as a sufficient motiue of the grant, but the merits of Christ. And when holy ancient Fathers in their prayers alleadge vnto God the merits of Saints, this is because their merits make them gracious in Gods sight,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2259:223"/>
and worthy that the graces they craue for vs be graunted vnto vs, not by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their merits, but only through the application of the merits of Christ. Put case, that a Prince should ransome a great multitude of his subiects taken prisoners, and held in miserable thraldome, paying for them a sufficient and aboundant ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, yet so, that none should haue the fruit of that Redemption but those whom the King should singularly choose, and make worthy of that fauour. Suppose that some noble man in the Court (whome his Merits made gracious with the King) should by his interceding obtayne that the benefit of that ransome should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to some one whome he particularly affects: Surely this Captiue should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed &amp; deliuered through the ransome payd by the King, not by the merits of the Noble man interceding for him, whose merits concurred thereunto only remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a farre off.</p>
                        <p>To apply this similitude, Christ Iesus hath payd an aboundant price for mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, yet none enioy the benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but they to whome by speciall grace he applyeth the same. Sinners beseech him by the merits of Saints that made them graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his sight, that he will vouchsafe to apply the merit of his Passion vnto them for the obtayning of fauours conducing vnto eternall life. Christ grants their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2259:223"/>
and request, and thereupon applyes his merits vnto them: These men cannot be properly sayd to be saued through the merits of Saints, but only through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ, specially because euen the merits of Saints that concurred thereunto, proceed originally from the merits of CHRIST.</p>

So as I dare say that the prayers of that office of our Lady that are directed vnto her, make not the hundred part thereof. And seing it is most certayne that the Christian Church in her best times did frequently pray vnto Saints, what reason haue we to thinke that in her set forme of prayers, she did not vse to craue their intercession?</p>

This Religion in respect of being in the world was primitiue in the dayes of the Apostles, and of them that saw the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and were conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them. But in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of free publike pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fession, the same was neuer Primitiue, till the fourth Age, that is, vnder Constantine. Now, the monuments of the first and second Age after the Apostles in regard of persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are few, &amp; many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Historyes &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, yea in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner al, were made away by Dioclesian. So that the best way to know what Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed immediately vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, is to examine what forme of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the dayes of Constantine came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; secret meetings, into the free view of the world.

But if they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance say that they do not so much dislike set formes vnto Saints, as some Phrases or speaches in our Prayer-bookes, that seeme to giue too much vnto Creatures, as our calling the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mother of Grace, Mother of mercy,</hi> saying to her, <hi>Lady protect vs from the Diuell, receaue vs in the houre of death, giue light to the blind, pardon to the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, remooue from vs all euill &amp;c.</hi> I answere, these speaches cannot iustly be disliked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are vnderstood in a pious sense knowne to Catholikes; a sense obuious &amp; playne according to the phrase of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which the words may well beare euen according to the custome of speach. The nature of thinges being various, and the answerable conceipts of men copious, but words to expresse such conceyts scant and in great paucity, necessity doth inforce vs to vse words applyable to diuers senses. For example, one man may deliuer another from death, either by authority pardoning him as do Kings, or by Iustice defending him as do Aduocates, by force taking him out of his enemyes hands as do Souldiers, or paying his ransome to them that keep him captiue, as Almoners, finally by beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his life of them that haue power to

Secondly, in a language vnknowne to most, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the better sort of the Church, yet some know it, and others with facility may learne it. To vse a language in the Church for publike prayer in this sort vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2259:230"/>
cannot be proued vnlawfull, nor forbidden by the Apostle, seing the reasons brought by him agaynst a language vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne make not agaynst this. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reprehends in the publike Liturgy a language so vnknown, as the Minister or the Church that supplyes the place of the Idiot &amp; Ignorant, cannot vpon his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the goodnes of the prayer say ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>Amen,</hi> in the name of them all. But when the language is knowne by some of the Church &amp; may with facility be learned by others, there is, or may easily be found one able to supply the place of the Idiote and ignorant, and answere in their person <hi>Amen,</hi> out of his intelligence of the prayer in that vnknowne tongue.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding the Roman Church doth not approue the vse of a language in this sort vnknowne, as appears by the late dispensation of <hi>Paulus</hi> the <hi>fift,</hi> vnto Iesuits to turne the Liturgy of the Masse, into the vulgar language of <hi>China,</hi> and to vse the same till the Latine language grow more knowne and familiar in that countrey. For though publike prayers in a language thus vnknowne cannot be proued vnlawfull, yet it is vndecent to vse a language which to the whole multitude of hearers, may seeme barbarous and vncouth. Thirdly, a language may be tearmed vnknowne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not the vulgar <note n="(z)" place="margin">The Minister pag. 370. argueth in this sort. <hi>The old rule was,</hi> Barbarus hic ego sum qui non intelligor vlli; <hi>&amp; accordingly your Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preists are meere barbaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the ordinary sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Answer.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.

But the Catholike Priest saying the Latin masse in the Latin Church is vnderstood of many. How then can he be a Barbarian by this old rule? The latin tongue is knowne of the best, most ciuill, and most principall persons in the Westerne parts of the world. Wherfore he that speakes it is not Barbarous, but accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rather learned to him that vnderstands not Latin: for the cause why the Latin in these parts is not vnderstood is not the strangenes of the language, but the rudenes of the hearer, and want of the best education. But in a country where the best, ciuillest, and most learned know not Latin, the Latin is Barbarous.</note>, though most men of better sort vnderstand it. Such was
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2259:230"/>
anciently the latin language in the whole Roman Empire, and now is in the Latine Church. For not only Priests vnderstand the same (or if some few do not, it is the fault of Bishops that ordayne them) but also an innumerable company of Laymen, not only addicted to learning, but also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gentlemen, yea many of the vulgar, partly by reason of the affinity their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue hath with the Latin, partly out of education, which commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly when they are children they haue <note n="(A)" place="margin">What the Minister here bringeth out of Suarez that it is not necessary the Minister or Preist vnderstand the language, in which masse is said, is mis-vnderstood by him.

Secondly, it is false, that the Apostle doth prohibite all prayer that doth not edify the vnderstanding. For though the Apostle prefer pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that doth edify the vnderstanding, yet doth he not prohibite prayer of meere affection without new instruction of the vnderstanding, but saith that in such <hi>prayers men pray with their spirit and affection, though not with their vnderstanding.</hi>

Now, for this end there is no need, that euery one shold vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d word by word the prayers that are sayd in the publike Liturgy, but it sufficeth that the Church in generall, and in particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours and Ecclesiasticall persons dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the Ministeryes of the Church, <hi>and who watch, being bound to giue an account of soules committed to their charge,</hi> haue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of all the prayers that are sayd, and that all who will may be taught &amp; instructed in particular, if they will vse diligence &amp; desire it.</p>

For Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks praise God in all languages, and meet to pray with Preists as much as Protestants, &amp; yet our publike seruice is not said in all vulgar tongues. More imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent are his allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Fathers, speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst distraction of mind, &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in prayer. As though men could not be recollected in prayer by attentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, vnto their ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne needes, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of their prayers, though they do not vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word by word.</note> vulgar multitude only knew their owne mother tongue, as may be cleerly gathered out of the same Saint Augustin, who writes that he pleading in Latine agaynst Crispinus a Bishop of the Donatists for possession of a village in Africa, wherunto the consent of the Villagers was required, they did not vnderstand his speach till the same was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted vnto them in their vulgar Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage. So that the Christian Church
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:2259:233"/>
did neuer iudge it requisite, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike Liturgy should be commonly turned into the mother language of euery nation, nor necessary that the same should presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly be vnderstood word by word by euery one of the vulgar assistants, neyther doth the end of the publike Seruice require it.</p>
                     <p>As for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort that some few want, in that they do not so perfectly vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the particulars of diuine Seruice, it may by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly be supplied without turning the publik Liturgyes into innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vulgar la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guages, which would bring a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion into the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church. First, The Church should not be able to iudge of the Liturgy of euery country whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> differences arise about the Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So diuers errors &amp; heresies might creep into particular countreyes, and the whole Church neuer able to take notice of them. Secondly, particular countreyes could not be certayne, that they haue the Scripture truly translated, for therof they can haue no other assured proofe, but only the Churches approbation, nor can she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue what she doth not vnderstand. Thirdly, were vulgar Translations so many as there be la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guages in the world, it could not be otherwayes, but some would be in many places ridiculous, inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruous, &amp; full of mistaking, to the great preiudice of soules, specially in languages that haue no great extents, nor many learned men
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2259:233"/>
that naturally speake them. Fourthly the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy would be often changed, togeather with the language, which doth much alter in euery age. Fiftly, in the same Countrey by reason of different dialects, some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces vnderstand not one another. And in the Island of Iaponia, (as some write) there is one language for Noble men, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Rustikes, another for men, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for women; Into what language shold then the <hi>Iaponian</hi> Liturgy be turned? Finally, by this vulgar vse of the Liturgy the study of the learned languages, would be giuen ouer, &amp; in short tyme come to be extinct, as we see that no ancient language now remaynes in humane knowledge, but such as haue been (as it were) incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Liturgyes of the Church; &amp; the common vse of learned tongues being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, there would follow want of meanes for Christians to meete in Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells to communicate one with another in matters of fayth. In a word extreme Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisme would be brought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world.</p>

Thirdly, the Creed is no prayer or tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing formally or virtually. Fourthly, they thinke pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without vnderstanding the words, without present actuall attention, to be pious and effectuall.</hi> Answer. To auoyd the shame of not being able to reply something, at least in shew, you runne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Maiesty &amp; disgrace his questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. His Maiesty proceding most iudiciously, know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the Pater noster to be pious deuotion; first questioned the Aue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, or praying vnto Saints, &amp; also praying in an vnknowne ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, &amp; then supposing by way of argument, that the saying of Paters Aues &amp; Creeds is pious, he doubts about repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, as iudging repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen of pious and Godly prayers, in a fixed number, to be questionable, specially affixing merit vnto the number. You conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Iesuit, grant repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of pious pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in certaine numbers to be pious, and so haue granted what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty questioned; &amp; yet not to seeme to grant it, you make his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styes question to be, whether repetition of vnlawful prayers in an excessiue number, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attention, be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Which question is vnworthy of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styes Iudgement; yea his Maiesty seing the impertinency of this question did first mooue doubt about the lawfulnes of Inuocation of Saints, that the lawfulnes therof might be supposed in this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, knowing the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion without this supposition to be senselesse &amp; foolish. Secondly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your reply, his Maiesty doth not dislike our saying 33. <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> in memory of 33. yeares our Sauiour liued vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, affixing merit vnto that number. For neither is the number excessiue, nor the prayer vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor is there any amongst vs that doth not vnderstand the sense ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And yet I thinke his Maiesty was not of this mind, which sheweth that he questioned repetition of pious prayers in a fixed number, and so your Reply grants what he questioned. Thirdly, the <hi>Aue Maria</hi> is not a prayer directed vnto any Creature, as prayer signifyes petition of grace and fauour, because in the <hi>Aue Maria</hi> we aske not grace, nor any gift of the B. Virgin, but only that she will pray for vs, <hi>Holy mary pray for vs, now and in the hower of death.</hi> If petition made vnto Creatures that they will be comprecants with vs, be prayer directed vnto Creatures; then is crauing the comprecation of liuing Saints, prayer finally directed vnto a Creature. Fourthly, your saying that the Creed is no prayer neither formally nor virtually, is the bare word of a Minister against the perpetuall practise of the Christian Church, which vsed the Creed as a prayer a thousand yeares agoe, defining it in <hi>Concil. Quinosexto Can.</hi> 7. <hi>Let euery Christian pray, at the least twice a day, saying the CREED, or the Lords Prayer, or, Qui plasmasti me mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serere mei, or, Deus propitius esto mihi peccatori.</hi> Thus the Councell. And who doth not see the Creed, said vnto God with inward deuotion of faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his diuine perfections, and mercyes toward mankind there declared, to be a prayer either of praise, or thankesgiuing, or obsecration, according to the affection of him that prayeth. Finally, your Cauill that our prayers are said in a tongue vnknowne, and so without present attention, is in your supposition often false (seing they that pray in these numbers most commonly either vnderstand Latin, or else pray in the vulgar tongue) &amp; in the illation ridiculous: For they that vnderstand not the <hi>Pater, Aue,</hi> and <hi>Creed</hi> in Latin, may by memory know the substance thereof, and so be actually attent.</note> no merit to prayers in regard of their number, further then the number awakes in vs deuout thoughts, which is the only thing that by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we ayme at. We say <hi>Paters, Aues, Creeds,</hi> to the number of three in memory of the Blessed Trinity, seeking Gods fauour and grace by glorifying that incomprehensible mystery. To the number of fiue, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the fiue speciall wounds our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour receaued, that pierced into, &amp; throgh his sacred body. To the number of 33. in remembrance of 33. yeares our Sauiour wrought our Saluation vpon earth, giuing him thankes for all his labours, desiring the application of his merits, stirring vp our selues to the imitation of his vertues. The like reason moueth vs to pray in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

of 63. Angelicall salutations, to call to mind the yeares the Mother of God liued, according to one probable opinion. And because the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that she liued 72. yeares now begins to be much followed, many Catholikes, particularly in Spayne, haue thereupon increased the crowne of our B. Lady to 72. <hi>Aue Maria's:</hi> A manifest signe that they neuer attributed merit vnto the number of 63. but only to the deuout me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the B.

The Psalter of our Lady, &amp; the Iesus Psalter contayne one hundred &amp; fifty repetitions of prayers, the one of <hi>Aue Maria's,</hi> the other <hi>Iesu, Iesu, Iesu,</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the deuout Royal Prophet, whose Psalter contaynes Psalmes in Gods prayse, to the same number.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>A Three-fold presence of Christs Body in the Sacrament, is confessed on all sides. The first, <hi>Figuratiue,</hi> or in a <hi>Sacramentall</hi> signe, bread sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying his body, and wine his bloud. The second, <hi>Imaginatiue,</hi> or by the pious apprehension of the faithfull receauer, who for more deuotions sake doth, or may imagine as if he saw the body of our Lord in the Eucharist truly, really, and bleedingly present, vnder the signes of bread and wine.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2259:238"/>
The third, <hi>Effectuall,</hi> or according to the Spirituall effects of grace purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Body and Bloud of our Sauiour, and giuen by vertue of this Sacrament vnto the soule, to nourish the ghostly life therof.</p>
                        <p>As all proceed thus farre, so <hi>Zuinglians</hi> will proceed no further. They grant the body and bloud of Christ to be present in the Sacrament <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely</hi> in a signe, <hi>imaginatiuely</hi> by fayth, <hi>effectually</hi> by grace; but deny them to be present according to their corporall substance, or further then in the outward signe to the mouth, and in the inward effect to the soule. So that they grant the Sacramentall signe to be bare and empty in respect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning the body of Christ, though full and effectuall in respect of affo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arding soule-nourishing grace.</p>
                        <p>Caluinists seeme in their words to maintaine a more reall presence. For though they maintayne the substance of the body of Christ in respect of place, to be in heauen only and not in the Sacrament, yet they teach that the same body without being present vpon earth is giuen vs on earth, not only by the apprehension of fayth; <hi>Non solùm dum fide amplectimur Iesum Christum pro nobis crucifixum, &amp; à mortuis excitatum</hi>; Not only in the inward spirituall effects of soule-nourishing grace, purchased by the death of his body; <hi>Non solùm dum bonis eius omnibus quae nobis acquisiuit corpore suo efficaciter communicamus,</hi> but realiter, <hi>really, &amp; truly; Dum habitat in nobis, dum vnum fit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biscum, dum eius membra sumus de carne eius, dum in vnam, vt ita loquar, cum ipso substantiam coalescimus. Caluin. in cap.</hi> 11.1. <hi>ad Cor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence we may discouer the Caluinian iugling, and playing fast &amp; loose about this Mystery, when they so often say that the body of Christ is really present, but <hi>Spiritually</hi>: for the word <hi>Spirituall</hi> may be vsed in this Mystery for two ends. First, to expresse <hi>the substance</hi> of the thing present, &amp; to signify the reall Presence, not of the corporall substance of our Lords body, but only of the spiritual effect therof, to wit, of soule-feeding grace. This sense is false, as shall be proued, and the very same which <hi>Caluin</hi> doth condemne in the <hi>Zwinglians, as execrable blasphemy, opusculo de Coena Domini.</hi> Secondly, to expresse the <hi>manner</hi> of the Presence, and to signify that the corporall substance of our Lord is present truly, yet in a spirituall, that is, secret, inuisible, &amp; indiuisible manner; this doctrine is true, and herein not differing from the Catholike. In like manner their Phrase of Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce by Fayth is <hi>equiuocall,</hi> and may haue a threefold sense. First, <hi>Presence by Fayth,</hi> may signify Presence by pious imagination of Fayth, the Receauer conceauing the body of our Lord, as if he saw the same corporally and bleedingly present. If by Presence by fayth, Caluinists meane no more
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2259:239"/>
then this, then they doe not differ from the <hi>Zwinglians,</hi> nor do they put any more reall presence then imaginatiue, that is, presence of things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to pious representation and apprehension, though not really &amp; in truth. Secondly, Presence by Fayth may signify, that Fayth, doth dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se and prepare the soule, and that then, vnto the soule prepared by Fayth our Sauiour is vnited really and truly, not according to the corporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his body, but only according to the spirituall effect of his grace. This sense is also Zuinglian, and condemned by Caluin, as hath been shewed. Thirdly, <hi>Presence by Fayth,</hi> may signify, presence according to the iudgment of Fayth, or a presence which only Fayth can find out, feele, &amp; behold. This sense is true, and Catholike, and doth suppose the body of Christ to be present absolutely, and independently of Fayth. For were not the body of Christ afore hand present, Fayth should not be true, that iudgeth his body to be present.</p>
                        <p>Whether our Minister be <hi>Zuinglian</hi> or <hi>Caluinist</hi> in this point, God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowes, he speakes obscurely of purpose. He neuer sayth as Caluin doth <hi>li. 4. Institut. c.</hi> 17. <hi>n.</hi> 7. <hi>That by substantiall communication the body and blood of Christ are vnder the signes of the supper deliuered vnto the fayth full,</hi> yet he sayth and often repeates, that <hi>the body of Christ is truly, really, &amp; effectually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</hi> These words sauour more of the Caluinian then of the Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glian phrase. Notwithstanding his adding <hi>effectually,</hi> after <hi>truly and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> may draw the speach to be Zuinglian in sense, to wit, that the body of Christ is giuen <hi>truly really effectually,</hi> that is, really accordinge to the truth and reality of the <hi>Spirituall effect,</hi> not really according to the truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>corporall substance.</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Zuinglian doctrine that the body of Christ is present only in an effectuall signe of grace, not in substance, is against the plaine &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse words of our Sauiour. <hi>For he did not say this is the signe or figure of my body, nor this is the benefit or effect of my body, but, this is my body,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is his body in substance and essence, if the substantiall <hi>Verbe Est,</hi> do sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify substance and essence. Hence Luther (<hi>Epist. ad Argent.</hi>) sayth, that the words are <hi>nimis clara,</hi> toto cleer, and much more cleere then he could haue wished. Caluin also in <hi>cap.</hi> 11.1. <hi>ad Cor. I heare</hi> (saith he) <hi>what the words of the supper import. For Christ doth giue vs not only the benefit of his death and resurrection, but also the very body wherin he died, and arose againe from death.</hi> Yea

                           <hi>libro de Coena, inter eius opuscula pag.</hi> 133. he saith, that, <hi>Negare veram corporis &amp; sanguinis substantiam, to deny the true substance of the body and blood of Christ to be giuen in the supper, is execrabilis blasphemia, auditu indigna, an execrable blasphemy against which we ought to stoppe our eares.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Caluinian</hi> Doctrine, that Christs body being only in heauen is Spiritually present, not only by fayth, not only according to the effects of his grace, but also in his bodily substance, yet only vnto the faythfull receauer, not vnto the Sacramentall signe, is both against Gods word, and implicatory in reason. First, it is no lesse then the Zuinglian against the plaine &amp; expresse words of our Sauiour. For our Sauiour by saying, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body; drinke yee all of this, for this is my blood (Matth.</hi> 26.) doth auerre the Sacrament to be his body and blood, in respect of that taking and eating, vnto which by these words he doth inuite and exhorte. But by this speach he doth inuite, and exhorte vnto Sacramentall and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall taking and eating. This appeareth by the immediat practise of the Apostles, who vpon these words of our Lord tooke the Sacrament with their corporall mouth. This also our aduersaryes cannot deny, seing they vrge by vertue of these wordes corporall receauing in both kinds. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the words of our Sauiour auerre the reall presence of his body in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in respect of corporall taking and eating with the mouth of flesh, which Doctrin Caluinists stiffely deny, only holding the substantiall communication of Christs body, in respect of spirituall receauing by the facultyes of the soule.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, their Reall Presence is a fiction to no purpose. For there is no reason to put the Reall Presence of Christs body in the Sacrament, but only in respect of verifying the word of our Sauiour, <hi>This is my body,</hi> in a true, and reall sense, so making the thinge Christ had in his hand, and which was demonstrated by the Pronowne <hi>This,</hi> to be truly &amp; real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his body. But Caluinists put not a <hi>Presence,</hi> which maketh the thinge Christ had in hand, and demonstrated by the Pronowne <hi>This,</hi> to be truly and really <hi>his body,</hi> but only <hi>by figure.</hi> This I proue. That which is the body of Christ in figure and shew, and not in substance, is not truly, &amp; really Christ his body. Euen as what is a man in shew and figure not in essence and substance, is not truly and really a man. But Caluinists say that <hi>This,</hi> or the thinge which Christ hath in his hands, was Christs body in shew &amp; figure, and not in substance. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they put not a Reall presence which makes that which Christ had in his hand, &amp; did demonstrate by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>This,</hi> to be truly his body. It is therefore a fiction deuised to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2259:240"/>
the Caluinian fancy, not the Christian fayth, or the rigurous truth of Gods word.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, by this Doctrine they bind themselues and others to belieue an high and incomprehensible Mystery, without any necessity or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion from Gods word. For what can be more vnintelligible, then that there should be true and reall vnion according to substance, betwixt two distinct indiuiduall substances, that be distant the one from the other, as farre as heauen is from earth. Hence Caluin saith <hi>libro de Coena,</hi> that this is <hi>sublime &amp; arduum, quod neque quidem cogitatione complecti possimus. &amp; in Cap.</hi> 11.1. <hi>ad Cor. arcanum &amp; mirificum Spiritus sancti opus, quod intelligentiae nostrae modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo metiri nefas sit.</hi> But the word of God doth not inforce this Caluinian Mystery, nor is there sufficient ground to affirme it. This is proued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the mystery of their Reall Presence either hath no ground in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or is grounded on these words of the Institution <hi>Take eate, this is my body.</hi> But Caluinists on these words cannot ground the incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mystery of their reall presence: For they vnderstand these words of our Sauiour in a <hi>Figuratiue</hi> sense, and say, that they <hi>are not true properly, and literally.</hi> Now a mystery of Fayth cannot be grounded vpon the <hi>Figuratiue</hi> sense of a place of Scripture, yea vpon meere <hi>Figuratiue</hi> construction of Scripture, to obtrude vnto others an article of necessary beliefe, is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, as saith <hi>S. Augustine Epist. 68. Non nisi impudentiss mè nititur quis aliquid in Allegoria positum pro se interpretari, nisi habeat &amp; manifesta testimonia, quorum lumine illustrentur obscura.</hi> Therfore the Caluinian Reall Presence is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery incomprehensible, grounded on meere figuratiue construction of Gods word, not backed by any literall text, and consequently it is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without necessity, or any Diuine and supernaturall warrant.</p>
                        <p>Hence I Inferre two things: first, that the belieuers of the Caluinian Reall Presence are vnwise. For what greater folly then for men to deny their wits, and breake their heads, to belieue an hard and difficill matter, in belieuing wherof ther is no merit of fayth? In belieuing the Caluinian Reall Presence there is no merit of Fayth: For the merit of Fayth is to captiuate our Vnderstanding vnto mysteryes, cleerly deliuered by the word of God, not vnto mans figuratiue expositions therof, yea no figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue exposition aboue reason is to be belieued, except it be proued by some literall text, or be deliuered by the full Tradition as Gods word vnwritten.</p>
                        <p>Secondly I inferre, that Caluinists beare more reuerence vnto <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> then vnto <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> for Caluins mystery is belieued by Caluinists
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2259:240"/>
being confessedly a Doctrine most hard, difficill, incomprehensible, and yet not the literall sense of Gods word, but Caluins figuratiue comment ther-vpon: On the other side, <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> being acknowledged by them to be <hi>the litterall and proper</hi> sense of the word of Christ Iesus, so that without Transubstantiation, his word, <hi>this is my body,</hi> cannot be literally true, as our Minister doth confesse <hi>pag. 397.</hi> yet because it is hard, difficill, incomprehensible, Caluinists cannot be brought to belieue it. What is this but to be more ready to belieue Caluin then Christ? Specially seing the mystery of Christs literall sense is not so hard and vn-intelligible as Caluins figuratiue construction. For one may more easily conceaue a body to be in two places at once, which the litteral sense of Christs word doth inforce, then a body to be truly and substantially giuen, where truly and substantially it is not, which is the article of fayth by Caluins figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue construction obtruded.</p>

                              <p>First it is not absurd that our Sauiour deliuering some precept, article, or Sacrament, should vse words that are figuratiue and exorbitant, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of Grammer, if they be not figuratiue nor vnusuall, but ordinary, playne, manyfest, perspicuous, according to the common phrase and vulgar manner of speach. This speach, <hi>This is the cuppe of my bloud which is shed for you,</hi> if it be figuratiue according to Grammer, yet is it playne, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, &amp; cleere according to common speach; for no man hearing these words <hi>This is the cup of my bloud shed for you,</hi> can thinke, that <hi>the cuppe,</hi> and not <hi>the bloud</hi> contayned therein, was shed for vs.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, I deny that any word of this speach, <hi>This is the cuppe of the new Testament in my bloud which is shed for you,</hi> is figuratiue. <hi>This is the cup of my bloud,</hi> is not figuratiue, seing Christ had in his hand a true cup, not the figure of a cup, and the thing contayned therein was truly and properly bloud. The bloud of Christ is also truly and properly sayd to be the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for it is <hi>the thing required by the new Testament,</hi> &amp; Couenant for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes; but commonly and vulgarly men say of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Couenant, this is our Couenant. Finally, the <hi>cup in his bloud is</hi> properly sayd to be <hi>shed,</hi> seing the bloud was truly and properly shed, &amp; so the cup properly shed in that respect, as to say of a cup of wine, this cup is spilt in the wine therof, is not figuratiue, but rather a speach vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily playne.</p>

                              <p>Thousand instances might be brought that shew your grosse Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Theology who thus argue. For example, the Ghospell Iohn 1.10. sayth, <hi>the Word was made flesh.</hi> Is this Argument good, <hi>Flesh,</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of speach, is a distinct and diuerse thing from bloud and from soule, <hi>Ergo,</hi> eyther these words be figuratiue, and do not prooue that the word tooke substantially Flesh, or els we must say that he tooke dead flesh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloud &amp; soule? S. <hi>Peter</hi> sayth, that Christ <hi>did beare our sinnes in his body vpon the wood,</hi> were he not simple that would argue as you do, <hi>Body in propriety of speach is a thing distinct from the soule, and from the God-head</hi>; Therefore eyther the wordes are figuratiue, and do not proue that Christ did truly suffer in body, or els we must say that his body without soule, and without his Deity suffered on the Crosse. Not so: For though the body be a thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and diuerse from the soule, yet it is a thing vnited and ioyned with the soule, when the person liueth, and so the body of a liuing person ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now take what part you will, let the Sacrament be the body &amp; bloud of CHRIST broken and shed for vs, that is sacrifyced for vs on the Crosse, or broken and shed, that is sacrifyced for vs in the Eucharist, still it followes that the Eucharist is the true body and bloud of our Lord, &amp; not bread and wine, seeing Christ neyther in his Supper, nor on his Crosse did sacrifice bread and wine, for the remission of sinnes, but his body and bloud only.</p>

Hence the finall conclusion is, that you haue no ground in Scripture not to take these words of our Lord, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> in the litterall sense, and that the true reason you do not litterally vnderstand them, is the difficulty of the matter, and the Infidelity of your hart.

For Tertullian is to shew, that wheras in the old Testament bread was a figure of the body of Christ, as appeares by the words of the Prophet <hi>Mittamus lignum in panem eius, id est, crucem in corpus eius</hi>; Christ in the new Testament <hi>made this figure to be truly and really</hi>

This manner of presence is cleerly consequent vpon the precedent,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2259:245"/>
and that graunted, this cannot be denyed. For the reason vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which Christians hold the body of Christ to be really and truly present in the Sacrament, is, because they cannot otherwise in proper &amp; plaine sense verify the word of Christ, who sayd of bread, <hi>This is my body</hi>? Wherefore we must eyther put no <hi>Reall Presence</hi> at all, or else put such a Reall Presence as is able to verify the foresayd speach in proper and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous sense. But if the body of Christ be not in the same place with the consecrated bread, contained vnder the formes therof, it cannot be said to be verily and really the body of Christ. For though we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the body of Christ to leaue heauen, &amp; to be substantially present in the Church where the Sacrament is giuen, yet this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Presence would no wayes further the verifying of the words of Christ, <hi>This is my body,</hi> except his body be veyled &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the sensible accidents of bread, so that it be demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strated by them, &amp; poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto them one may truly say, This is the body of Christ.

denyed and taken away, the words of Christ <hi>This is my body,</hi> cannot be true taken in the literal sense, in which sense they are to be taken, as hath been shewed. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out granting Transubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation the words of Christ cannot be true, taken in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sense, <hi>Ergo,</hi> transubstantiation belongs to the substance of this mystery of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence. The minor is proued, because the speach, <hi>This is my body,</hi> doth signify that the thing the Priest holds in his hands is truly, really, and substantially the body of Christ. For in the proposition, <hi>This is my body,</hi> the verbe <hi>Est</hi> signifyes a coniunction betweene <hi>This</hi> in the Priests hands, &amp; the body of Christ; and being a <hi>Verbe substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> in his proper signification, signifyes a substantiall Identity betweene <hi>This</hi> in the Priests hands, and the body of Christ. But <hi>This</hi> in the Priests hands being before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration bread, a thing substantially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the body of Christ, cannot by consecration be made substantially the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ (as the Fathers teach it is) without some substantiall alteration, or change. And what other substantiall cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge can make bread to become truly the body of Christ besides substantial conuersion of the same into his body <note n="(q)" place="margin">
                              <p>The Minister flyes vnto the figuratiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, choosing rather to deny the truth of Gods word according to the letter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> admit Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation. Against which he hath three arguments scattered in his Reply, which I wil here ioyne togither and answere. The first is <hi>pa.</hi> 434. <hi>the consecrated bread is tearmed very bread,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.26.28. <hi>Answere.</hi> This is a very vntruth. For it is still in those places, tearmed bread, <hi>cum addito,</hi> with such an addition as sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly bread, but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours body, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The bread we breake,</hi> that is Sacrifice vnto God, <hi>is the communication of the body of our Lord.</hi> And <hi>1. Cor. 11.26. as often as you eate</hi> THIS <hi>bread, &amp;</hi> 27. <hi>Whosoeuer shall eate</hi> THIS <hi>bread vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. &amp;</hi> 28. <hi>So let him eate of</hi> THAT <hi>bread,</hi> to wit wherof he had said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Christ by the verity of his word doth make it his body. Now he that eateth bread tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Christs body, or made his body doth not truly eate bread. As the Maister of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-feast in Cana, <hi>who tasted water made wine, Iohn.</hi> 2.9. did not tast water truly. For as <hi>water made wine</hi> is not water, euen so bread consecrated and made our Lords body, is not bread.</p>
                              <p>The second is <hi>pag.</hi> 447. which he setteth out magnificently in a distinct letter, and ech proposition in a seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall line. The substance is this: If the words of our Sauiour, <hi>This is my body,</hi> cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the <hi>substance</hi> of bread into his body, then also they change the <hi>quantity &amp; accidents:</hi> For our Sauiour tooke the whole bread into his handes, and sayd, this is my body, as wel vpon the accidents as vpon the substance of bread. But they proue not the conuersion of accidents. For Popish Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a conuersion of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance not of accidents. Therefore they proue not the conuersion of the substance.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Answere.</hi> The wordes of our Sauiour <hi>this is my body,</hi> change not euery thing <hi>into his body</hi> ouer which they be spoken by way of breathing, (for then they should cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the ayre into his body) but only that, ouer which they are so spoken by way of sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification that their sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification can not be true in the litteral sense, except that be hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap> body. Now, the words of Christ <hi>This is my body,</hi> cannot be true in the litterall sense, except the substance of bread be changed into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as the Minister doth confesse <hi>pag.</hi> 397. <hi>lin.</hi> 17. But they may be true according to the letter, the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce being cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged though the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts remayne. For if the Sacrament outwardly cloathed with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and accidents of bread, be inwardly in nature and substance Christs body, then is it truly and substantially his body, and may be sayd to be his body, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the word, <hi>to be,</hi> in the proper sense for <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiue being:</hi> euen as Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob cloathed with the garments of Esau was truly and substantially Iacob, and not Esau, though in outward shew and shape he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Esau. Therfore the litterall truth of Christs words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> inforceth vs to say, that the substance of bread is cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged into his body, but not that the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity of bread is so changed. And thus the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of your argument is marred &amp; proued to be but an empty shew.</p>
                              <p>The third argument is <hi>pag.</hi> 422.423. In all miraculous substantiall conuersions a new sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is produced, but the body of Christ doth preexist &amp; so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be produced. Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. The maior is false, as appeareth by mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of miraculous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersions which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue beene, partly shall be. For in the resuscitation of the dead when carcasses are conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into men, no new thing <hi>is produced,</hi> but old things and substances which formerly had been, are <hi>reproduced.</hi> It is true, the power of nature being limited according to time &amp; place, cannot <hi>reproduce,</hi> but onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce at one time, and in one place. But the power of God being infinite, eternall, immense and independent of time and place, can <hi>reproduce</hi> things that preexist, according to different times and places, as often, and in as many places, as he is pleased. Hence he can, and doth reproduce vpon earth the body of our Sauiour preexisting in heauen, as the Fathers auerre. <hi>S.

                        <p>But some may obiect, that as a man shewing a Leather-purse full of gold may truly say, this is gold; or a paper wrapped vp full of siluer, may say, this is siluer; so
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:2259:248"/>
the body of Christ being vnder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated bread, we may truly say, this is the body of Christ, though the substance of bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne I answer, that when substances are apt of their nature, and ordayned by vse to contayne other substances, then shewing the substance which containes, we may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the substance contained, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer examples. The reason is, because their naturall aptitude to contayne other things being vulgarly knowne, mans vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding straight passeth from the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the substances contayning, to thinke of the thing contayned therein. But when substances are not by nature and custome ordayned to contayne others, we cannot by shewing them demonstrate another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their outward forme, signifyes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly the substance contained in them. For exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, one puts a piece of Gold in an apple, &amp; shewing it, cryes, this is Gold; in rigour of speach he sayth not true, because the sense of his words is, that the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated immediatly by the formes and accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of that apple, is Gold; yea put case that one should say, this is gold, shewing a peece of paper vnfolded, in a manner not apt to contayne any thing in it, he should not say true, though by some deuise he had put secretly into it a peece of gold. Because when the paper is shewed displayed, and not as contayning something in it, and yet is tearmed Gold, the proper sense of that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2259:248"/>
speach is, that the substance immediatly contayned vnder the accidents of paper, is gold, although it be couered with other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents then those that vsually accompany the nature of gold.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the proposition of Christ, <hi>This is my body,</hi> being spoken of a thing that naturally is not apt, nor by custome ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to contayne an humane body, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnderstood literally but of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect immediatly contayned vnder, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by the accidents and outward semblance of bread. Now, the thing that lyes hidden immediatly vnder the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of bread, which was once substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bread, cannot become substantially the body of Christ except it be substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into his body, or personally assumed by the same body. And seeing this second manner of vnion between bread &amp; Christs body is impossible, and reiected by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants aswell as by Catholiks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the mystery of Christs Real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence cannot be belieued in truth by them that deny Transubstantiation; Specially se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Sauiour did not say, <hi>Heere is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> which speach may be verifyed by the Presence of his body locally within the bread, but, <hi>This is my body,</hi> which imports that not only his body is truly, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially present, but also that it is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance contayned immediatly vnder the accidents of bread.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="270" facs="tcp:2259:249"/>If any man say, that by this argument it appeares that the doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation is not expressed in Scripture, but from the wordes of the Institution subtilly deduced, and so may perchance be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred <hi>inter scita Scholae,</hi> not <hi>inter dogmata Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei.</hi> I answere that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is not good, as is euident in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Incarnation. The doctrine that the vnion of natures in Christ is <hi>proper</hi> not metaphoricall, <hi>substantiall</hi> not acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, <hi>personall</hi> not essentiall, is no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely set downe in the Scripture, but by subtill deduction inferred from the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which Scripture and Tradition deliuer. Notwithstanding, because these subtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions are proposed by the Church as pertinent vnto the substance of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd mystery, they cannot be denyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice of fayth. In this sort the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Transubstantiation, though not in tearmes deliuered by the Scripture, but deduced by subtile and speculatiue infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, may not be denyed by them that wil be perfect Belieuers, because the Church hath declared the same to pertayne to the proper sense of Christ his wordes and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the mystery. <hi>Concil.

                              <hi>Answere.</hi> The falshood and inanity of this Shift is conuinced by these foure arguments, which shew <hi>Transelementation</hi> to import the same as <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The First is drawne from the notion of the word <hi>Elements,</hi> &amp; <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elementation.</hi> For <hi>Transelementation</hi> of bread and wine, into the body and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2259:252"/>
bloud of our Lord, signifyes, that there is a change betwixt them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their <hi>eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Elements</hi> import the primordiall simples, the original principles, the substantiall parts of which a thing is fundamentally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. Hence Fire, Ayre, Water, Earth, as also the Letters of the Alphabet be tearmed <hi>Elements,</hi> because both are primordiall simples and substantial parts, the one of mixed substances, the other of wordes and sentences. Now, the body and bloud of Christ, as also bread &amp; wine being corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall substances, the primordiall simples and substantiall principles wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their nature is originally composed, be substantiall matter &amp; forme, as euery Philosopher knowes. <hi>Ergo, Transelementation</hi> of bread &amp; wine into Christs body and bloud, doth import that bread and wine be changed into Christs body &amp; bloud, according to their <hi>Elements,</hi> that is, matter &amp; forme. Is not this Transubstantiation?</p>
                           <p>The second reason is, because in <hi>Transelementation</hi> matter doth no more remayne then in <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi> &amp; so your deuised difference betwixt them is false. For as when <hi>Transelementation</hi> is partiall, that is, according to forme only, the matter remaynes; so likewise in <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> For example, when wood is turned into fyre, the forme being destroyed, the matter remayneth. As wood by this change may be sayd to be <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elemented</hi> into fire, because it is changed into fire according to the forme, which is one element of wood; so likewise, it may be sayd to be Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiated into fire, because it is changed into fire, according to the forme which is one part of the substance of wood. Though Christians do not vse so to speake, because aswel the word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> by the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Church, as the word <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> by the latin, be consecrated to signify the substantiall change in the Eucharist, which is totall accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both elements &amp; substantiall parts.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, I thus argue. The Minister grants, that Transelementation doth import an <hi>esse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tial change, or a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge according to the essentiall forme of bread</hi> into Christs body; but this cannot be according to the essentiall forme only, &amp; not also according to the essentiall matter of bread, else the body of Christ should be made bigger by the matter of bread changed into it, as we see the fire to be made bigger by the matter of wood remayning after the conuersion therof into fire. <hi>Ergo,</hi> seing the Minister grants that Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selementation imports an essentiall cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, he must (if he will not be ridiculously absurd) consequently grant, that this change is to tall; else the body of Christ shal be augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the material additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bread vnto it.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, this is proued by the Fathers appropriation of this word
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2259:253"/>
vnto the mystery of the holy Eucharist. For did not Transelementation of bread &amp; wine into Christs body &amp; blood import a substantiall chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, but only an accidental, mystical, &amp; significatiue conuersion of them, I aske; First, why do the Fathers neuer say, that the water of Baptisme is Transeleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted into Christs bloud, as wel as they say, that wine is Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elemented into his bloud? For thus they might haue spoken of Baptisme as well as of the Eucharist, had they been of the Protestants Religion, which is, that water is mystically and significatiuely made Christs bloud in Baptisme, as much as wine in the Eucharist. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, why do the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neuer say, that our bodyes in the day of iudgment are Transeleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Christs body, but only (as the Minister cites <hi>S. Nissen. orat. Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chist. c.</hi> 34.) <hi>transmutantur,</hi> they be transmuted? why this, but because trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation being a Generall tearme, signifyes any mutation whether sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial or accidental; whereas Transelementation cannot import but a substantial change? Finally, why do the Fathers neuer say, that mans soule is by grace &amp; charity Transelemented into Christ, into whome the same is mystically changed? Theophilact indeed cited by the Minister in <hi>Ioan. c. 6. v. 56.</hi> saith, that a man is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>in a manner Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elemented into Christ,</hi> as he might no lesse truly haue sayd, <hi>in a manner Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiated into Christ</hi>; but that men are by grace Transelemented into Christ, they neuer say. Which be manifest signes, that the Fathers vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by Transelementation, according to the proper &amp; naturall signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word, a substantiall conuersion, &amp; not only an accidental, much lesse a meere mysticall change.</p>
                           <p n="3">[III.] <hi>S. Cyrill</hi> (sayth the Minister) <hi>by the words, Conuerting bread and wine into the verity of his owne flesh, vnderstandeth not Popish Transubstantiation, but mysticall &amp; Sacramentall Conuersion, to wit, Conuersion of signification, vse, &amp; operation. For he speaketh of bread &amp; wine, according to their whole nature contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning substance &amp; accidents, but the accidents are only mystically conuerted into Christ his body. Answere.</hi> This myst which the Minister would cast vpon this matter by the tearme of <hi>mystical co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion,</hi> serues only to catch Woodcocks; for euery man of iudgment may presently see, that this sense cannot stand with the words of S. <hi>Cyrill.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For <hi>S. Cyrill</hi> sayth, that did men see and feele what is inwardly done in consecrated bread &amp; wine, men should <hi>find horrour to feed theron, because they should see and feele, that they eate and drinke flesh &amp; bloud.</hi> Hence that this may not be perceaued, he sayth, the conuersion of bread &amp; wine, is done inwardly <hi>by Christs penetratiue power, conuerting them into the verity of his
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2259:253"/>
flesh and bloud.</hi> But did men see, what is inwardly done in bread &amp; wine by the Protestant significatiue conuersion, they would feele no horrour: for in their Tenet, no change at all is made inwardly in bread, but the whole outward substance is assumed as an Instrument to sanctify the soule. If a Christian should see this conuersion of vse &amp; operation; should he see, I say, that bread is eleuated to produce sanctifying grace in his soule, why should he feele horrour to feed thereon? So that it is not only willfulnes against the light of truth, but also folly to expound this place of <hi>S. Cyrill,</hi> of meere mysticall &amp; significatiue change.</p>

What disagreement in respect of sense is there between these two sentences which you say be <hi>contrary</hi>; When wax is put into the fire, nothing of the substance thereof is left; When wax is put into the fire nothing of the substance thereof goeth away? Certainly they disagree as much as these two, which for sense are iust the same; When meate is set on the Table before the hungry persons nothing is left; When meate is set on the table before hungry persons, nothing goeth away. For when <hi>S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> sayth, waxe being put into fire, <gap reason="foreign">

His meaning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, nothing of the substance goeth away from the fire vnconsumed, but the whole substance is conuerted into fire, as the Iesuit expounds.</p>
                           <p>Also what difference betwixt these two translations which you make <hi>Contrary</hi>; The mysteries are togeather consumed by the substance of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2259:254"/>
body: The mysteries are coabsumed with the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the body? They be punctually the very same in regard of sense, as much as these two are; Wood and Coale are coabsumed with fire: Wood &amp; Coale are togeather consumed by fire. For without question <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> saying, that the mysteries are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed with the substance of the body, as waxe is by fire, doth intend, that the body is the Instrument wherby the mysteryes are consumed, as fire is the Instrument to consume waxe.</p>
                           <p>As concerning the sense of this place, that <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> doth intend to teach that the substance of bread is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed by the body of Christ, not by the body of the receauer, is euident by the drift of his discourse. Which because it is cleere &amp; pregnant for Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I will set it downe in Greeke, as it is in <hi>M. Sauells Edition,</hi> in the 7.

                              <hi>After</hi> (these vanities) <hi>with what confidence doest thou approach vnto the Mysteries, with a conscience so polluted? If thou did'st hold dunge in thy hands, durst thou touch the hemme of the garment of an earthly King? No, thou durst not. Do not regard that it is bread</hi> (in outward shew,) <hi>do not thinke that it is wine, for it is not meate that is cast out by egestion as others are. God forbidd, do not so thinke. But as when waxe is ioyned to the fire, nothing of the substance thereof goeth away</hi> (out of the fire inconsumed;) <hi>so do thou thinke the mysteryes are consumed by the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the body. Wherfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to receaue, do not thinke you take the diuine body as from the hand of a man, but as fire from the tonges of the Seraphim.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus <hi>S.

                           <p>The conceyt insinuated by the Minister, that <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> meanes that the mysticall Elements, are indeed consumed, but by the body of the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2259:254"/>
receauer, is most seely. For S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> because the Sacramentall bread and wine be consumed by the substance of the body, concludes that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we receaue, we must not <hi>thinke we receaue bread and wine in</hi> truth, <hi>nor ordinary meate such as is cast out by egestion.</hi> What discourse can be more sottish then this of S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> did he meane, as you would make him, that the mysticall elements be by digestion consumed into the flesh of the receauer, and that therefore when we take them they be not truly bread and wine, nor such meate as is cast out by egestion; for his reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the playne contrary of what he would prooue. Agayne, <hi>S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> hauing sayd, that the mysteryes are consumed by the substance of the body as waxe is by fire, inferres that therefore when we receaue, we ought to receaue Christs diuine body, as FIRE from the hand of the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim, which cleerely shewes, that the diuine body of Christ is by him said to be, as FIRE consuming into it selfe the substance of bread &amp; wine, and not the body of the receauer.

                           <p>Finally, what he sayth, <hi>that the substance of bread is not consumed by the body of Christ, according to the Tenet of many Scholemen,</hi> shewes his want of skill to vnderstand Scholasticke Authours. For they all agree, that the body of Christ made present in the Eucharist by vigour of his word <hi>This is my body,</hi> doth destroy and consume the substance of bread, at the least <hi>morally,</hi> that is, by binding God to destroy it, that his word may be true, which without the destruction of bread, cannot be true in the sense by him intended. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the question is, whether the body of Christ as present, haue also phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall opposition with the substance of bread, destroying the same by phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall impression made vpon it; wherein some hold the affirmatiue, some the negatiue part, whome the Minister in his margent citeth saying, <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiam corporis Christi non pugnare cum substantia panis</hi> SVAPTE NATV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA. Is not this impertinent?</p>
                           <p n="5">[V.] The Minister heere sayth: <hi>It is inconsequent to argue, they are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in nature:</hi> Ergo, <hi>their naturall substance is destroyed. For S. Peter speaking of Regenerate persons</hi> 2. Pet. 1.5. <hi>sayth, they are made partakers of the Diuine Nature,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2259:255"/>
and yet his meaning is not, that their former substance is abolished.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answere.</hi> First the Minister doth not set downe the true force of the argument: For the argument is not, Bread is changed in nature, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the substance thereof is destroyed; but thus we argue. What is so changed in nature, that it is no longer the thing or substance nature framed, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed according to the substance thereof. This is manifest, for were not the nature thereof destroyed, it should be still the thing and substance nature framed. But S. Ambrose sayth, &amp; bringeth many conuincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments out of Scripture to proue, that by consecration bread is so chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in nature, as, <hi>Non est quod natura formauit,</hi> it is no longer the thing and substance nature framed, but the body of Christ: <hi>Ergo,</hi> according to Saint Ambrose, bread in the Eucharist is so changed, as the nature thereof is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished into the body of Christ.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the example you bring about Regenerate persons, is by you vsed impertinently; and truly pondered &amp; applyed, serueth our purpose. For in Regeneration the substance of man is not abolished, because by Regeneration man is changed to be participant of the Diuine Nature, not from what he is originally by the constitution of nature, but from what he is by the corruption of the Diuell and sinne. Hence by vertue of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration a man ceaseth to be, not according to the substantiall Origen of his nature, but only according to the superinduced peruersion thereof by the Diuell. But in the Eucharist Saint Ambrose sayth, that bread by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration passeth into the sacred body of Christ, from the thing it was by the framing &amp; constitution of nature: <hi>Ergo,</hi> bread according to S. Ambrose ceaseth to be according to the thing it is, by the framing of nature, to wit the essence of bread.</p>
                           <p n="6">[VI] The Minister Replyes: <hi>That to a mysticall change the omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God is required, as appeareth in Baptisme. Therefore, although some Fathers require an omnipotent power to eleuate, and change the creatures of bread and wine, yet it followeth not, that they maintayned Transubstantiation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answere.</hi> The Fathers indeed require the omnipotency of God in Baptisme, not to change the nature of water into the nature and verity of Christs bloud, but to the end, that water remayning water vnchanged in nature, be eleuated to produce sanctifying grace in the soules of men. Thus Saint <hi>Leo</hi> (by you often cited) <hi>serm. 4. de natiuit.</hi> sayth, <hi>Virtus altissimi quae fecit vt virgo pareret Saluatorem, eadem facit vt regeneret vnda credentem.</hi> He doth not say (as you would make fooles belieue the Fathers vse to speake) that the Diuine omnipotency doth change the water into the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2259:255"/>
nature and verity of his bloud; but, <hi>That the same power of the Highest makes water, being water, to bring forth regenerate persons, which caused a virgin, remayning a virgin, to bring forth the Sauiour.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But about the holy Eucharist the Fathers speake in another manner: They require the Omnipotency of God, not to eleauate bread &amp; wine, that remayning still in nature bread and wine, they may sanctify mens soules, but to change them into Christs body and bloud, by which change they become in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues without further eleuation, proportioned meanes to sanctify soules, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining within themselues the fountaine of grace. Yea the Fathers speeches about the water of baptisme, be so different from their speeches about the bread and wine of the Eucharist, as this alone might suffice to conuert the Minister were he not obstinate. What Fathers say, that Christ at the Mariage of soules with him in Baptisme can, &amp; doth conuert water into his blood by his omnipotency, as he could, and did conuert water into Wine at the carnall Mariage of Cana, as <hi>S. Cyrill,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Gaudentius</hi> cited by the Iesuit, say of the wine of the Eucharist? What Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth say, that water <hi>changed not in shape but in nature, is by the omnipotency of</hi> the word, <hi>made his flesh,</hi> as is sayd of the Eucharisticall bread by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the booke <hi>De Coena Domini?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="7">[VII.] Though some question be made, whether this Authour was <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> yet learned men both Catholicks and Protestants agree, he was an holy ancient Father: <hi>The Authour of the booke de Coena Domini</hi> (sayth M. Fulke agaynst the <hi>Rhem. Testam in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>fol.</hi> 282.) <hi>was not in tyme much inferiour to Cyprian. Erasmus</hi> in his Annotatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vpon <hi>S.

Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian his age,</hi> as Pamelius doth demonstrate by many euident reasons; so that we haue Transubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation as ancient as <hi>S. Cyprian.</hi> For what the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister sayth that this Authour meaneth only a mysticall and Sacramental change to be made, is idle, as I thus demonstrate. The change this holy Father teacheth, is made not <hi>in the shape,</hi> quantity, &amp; accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of bread, but only in the inward <hi>nature</hi> and essence thereof, <hi>panis non effigie sed natura mutatus.</hi> But the Ministers mysticall conuersion is made vpon the shape, quantity, &amp; accidents of bread, as he sayth <hi>pag. 425. it passeth vpon the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and accidents of bread, as well as vpon the substance. Ergo,</hi> the conuersion of bread into Christs flesh taught by this holy ancient Father, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward substantiall conuersion, and not the Ministers mysticall change.</p>
                           <p n="8">[VIII.] What the Minister sayth to this Argument, that the Fathers affirme, the water of Baptisme to be changed into Christs blood, by the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2259:256"/>
vertue of his word, is false; nor hath he cited any Father that doth so affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Yea such speaking of the water of Baptisme were ridiculous, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impious, as affirming thinges about the mysteryes of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which may make them seeme senselesse and ridiculous, without any ground so to affirme in Gods word. For Christ neuer sayth of the water of Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, <hi>Be washed herewith, for this is my blood,</hi> as he sayth often in Scripture of the wine of the Eucharist, <hi>drinke yee of this, for this is my bloud.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="9">[IX.] To the fourth argument the Minister replyes, that, <hi>the Fathers exhort People to abnegate their senses in Baptisme, wherein they mantayne no Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi> I Answere. The Minister still singes the same songe that the fathers speake in the same manner of the conuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of water into Christs blood in Baptisme, as they speake about the conuersion of wine in the Eucharist, which is most false; and the Minister hath not cited the wordes any Father so affirming. The Fathers about Baptisme, exhort men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that God can by water wash and purify the soule, and this to be a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall worke aboue the naturall force of water, which one may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue without contradicting the euidence of any of his senses, yea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great difficulty in reason. For what great matter is it to belieue, that God being omnipotent, at the presence of water washing the body, can inwardly by grace wash the soule? But about the Eucharist they say, that we must firmely and indubitately belieue, that that which seemeth bread and wine is not bread &amp; wine, but the body &amp; bloud of Christ, so that vnder the forme of bread and wine is giuen vs the bloud of our Lord; and though sense suggest the contrary that it is wine, we must abnegate, and not belieue our senses herein: Shew one Father (I say) that doth thus affirme of the water of Baptisme, that we must firmely, and indubitately belieue the same not to be water in truth, though it be water in shew; and because our sight, feeling, and tast suggest that it is water, that we must <hi>with full Fayth</hi> abnegate and deny this iudgment framed by sense.</p>
                           <p n="10">[X.] The Minister heere pag. 429. bringeth three triuiall argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to prooue the Fathers held the substance of bread to remayne after conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, which are not worth the answering; yet I will say a word to each of them, not to omit any thing that may seeme substantiall in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
                           <p>The first, <hi>The Fathers teach that the creatures of bread and wine remayne, but the abstracted shapes of bread and wine be not Gods creatures, but Popish fancyes.</hi> I Answere, the force of this argument doth consist in two lyes, the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon the Fathers, the other vpon vs. For first, the Fathers you cite
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2259:256"/>
do not say that the Creatures of bread and wine remayne in the Eucharist after consecration, but that the holy Eucharist is made of the Creatures of bread and wine, they being conuerted &amp; turned into the body and bloud of Christ, saying: <hi>Before consecration it is bread, but after Consecration, of bread is made the flesh of Christ.</hi> Ambros. lib. 4. de Sacram. cap. 4. Secondly we say, that the true, solide, and reall quantity of bread, endued with all the true qualityes and naturall propertyes remayne, and not onely abstracted shapes and fancyes, as you maliciously or dreamingly misrelate our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Hence true is the saying of <hi>Irenaeus (l 4. c.</hi> 34.) <hi>that the holy Eucharist is composed of two thinges, the one heauenly,</hi> to wit the body of Christ, <hi>the other earthly,</hi> to wit the quantity of bread endued with the sensible and earthly propertyes thereof.</p>
                           <p>The second, <hi>The Fathers teach, that the signes and elements are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and haue power to feede, and nourish the body; but Mathematicall bread and wine haue not power no nourish the body, for there is in them only the shadow of grayne and grapes; and Papists may as well say, That paynted bread hath power of feeding. Answere.</hi> This argument is like the former, grounded on the Ministers false slandering o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> dreaming misprision of our Doctrine. For we hold that the quantity of bread, endued with the sensible vertues, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of bread remaynes truly, really, substantially, and not only in a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and picture of bread. Now the quantity of bread and wine endued with the actiue qualityes, can please, delight, alter and change the body of the receauer, and be agayne altered and changed by the nutritiue power therof, and so nourish the body, as the Iesuit hath declared in the second Consideration.</p>
                           <p>The Third, <hi>The Fathers affirme, that the elements of the Eucharist, resemble the mysticall vnion betwixt Christ &amp; Christian people, to wit, bread confected of many graynes of wheat, and wine of many grapes; but Popish fictions, and Mathematicall shadowes of grayne and grapes, cannot resemble this mysticall vnion. Answere.</hi> The Fathers do not say, as you impose vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, that the Eucharisticall bread and wine, resemble the mysticall vnion betwixt Christ and Christian people, but the vnion Christians must haue betwixt themselues, that they may be vnited vnto Christ, as the mysticall body to their head. To repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this vnion, the sacred signes must be truly bread and wine, not after consecration, but before. For as no substances be conuerred into the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body and bloud of Christ, but such as are made of many graynes and grapes vnited togither in one masse, so none can be vnited vnto Christ by grace, and made partakers of his sauing gifts, but such as being many by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2259:257"/>
nature, are vnited by Charity, concord, and due subordination in one mysticall body, the holy Church. So that not the Eucharisticall signes, but your arguments be fictions and shadowes, without any truth, substance or solidity in them.</p>
                           <p n="11">[XI.] To the fifth argument, the Minister sayth; <hi>Because this Iesuit produceth no new matter, but only repeateth what we haue formerly confuted; and especially because Reseruation concludeth not Transubstantiation, I forbeare further examination of the particular Testimonyes produced by him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Answere. With what forehead could you say, that <hi>this Iesuit</hi> heere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth no new matter, but ONELY repeateth what you haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly confuted? Might not I with truth say, this is more then <hi>onelye?</hi> For where haue you answered formerly the testimonyes of the Fathers here cited by the Iesuit, that hold the Eucharist to remayne the body of Christ out of vse; and that it is to be worshipped and adored as such? Where haue you answered the Confession the Iesuit doth here produce of Protestants, euen of your <hi>Kemnitius</hi> (to whom you here refer vs in your margent,) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, Reseruation of the Sacrament (which you detest as Idolatry) to haue been the continuall custome of the primitiue Christian Church lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely diffused ouer the world, <hi>Antiqua consuetudo latè patens &amp; diu propagata</hi>; thereby granting Christian Antiquity, Vniuersality, and Continuance to stand for vs, agaynst you?</p>
                           <p>But you say, that Reseruation concludes not Transubstantiation. This proueth your shallow insight into these matters, as by these two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I shew. First, the Fathers reseruing the Sacrament, shew they held such <hi>a Reall Presence,</hi> as by vertue thereof the body of Christ must of necessity be present so longe as the accidents of bread remayne: For they would not haue bound Christians to adore the Sacrament as Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so longe as the proper accidents of bread remayne, had they not held, that the same is the body of Christ infallibly, and by diuine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, so longe as the foresayd accidents remayne. But neyther the Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glian presence by figure, nor the Caluinian presence by Fayth, nor the Lutheran presence by Consubstantiation, doth (as themselues teach) of necessity inforce the Sacrament to be the body of Christ so longe as the accidents of bread remayne, but only the presence by Transubstantiation hath this nature &amp; force: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Fathers held neither the Zwinglian, nor the Caluinian, nor the Lutheran Presence, but the Catholicke Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the Fathers as hath been shewed, do perpetually affirme
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2259:257"/>
that bread and wine are <hi>conuerted, transelemented, changed into the nature and verity of Christs flesh and bloud,</hi> so that Protestants haue no shift to auoyde the euidence of this their Christian consent for our Religion agaynst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by saying they speake only of <hi>mysticall conuersion,</hi> to wit, of <hi>signification, vse, and operation,</hi> as sayth our Minister <hi>pag.</hi> 422. <hi>lin.</hi> 1. But their reseruing the Sacrament, and adoring the same reserued as Christs body, perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and out of vse, doth conuince, that they mayntayned another conuersion then meere <hi>significatiue of operation and vse,</hi> as is manifest. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Fathers by reseruing the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shew manifestly, two things. First that they held the Catholike doctrine of substantiall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion: Secondly, that Ministers willingly, &amp; against their conscience expound their sayings as teaching no more but Conuersion, of meere significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vse, &amp; operation.</p>

For thus he writeth: <hi>Christ did conioyne his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with bread and wine, that so by thinges that are common, and to which we are vsed, we may attayne to thinges diuine and aboue nature, for verily the body borne of the Virgin, is a body vnited vnto the Deity, not that his body assumpted into heauen doth agayne descend</hi> (in the Eucharist) <hi>from heauen, but that bread it selfe, and wine are conuerted into the flesh and bloud of God.</hi> And a little after: <hi>A coale is not only wood, but wood ioyned to fire; so the bread of the holy Communion is not simple bread, but bread vnited vnto the Deity. But the body vnited to the Deity, is not any single nature, but the nature of flesh and the nature of the Deity be conioyned together in it.</hi> Thus he, most cleerly shewing, not that the bread of the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, remaining bread in nature, is vnited to the Deity, to make togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it a personall compound of two natures (it were blasphemy so to thinke) but that bread cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged into Christs flesh, is vnited to the Deity, because the flesh into which it is changed is not meere and only flesh, but also flesh vnited with the Deity.

                           <p>The first is grounded vpon the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of two thinges most certayne. First, that the Primitiue Church preaching vnto Pagans, Iewes, and other Infidells the rest of Christian mysteryes, as the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Resurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, did most carefully keepe as much as might be from their knowledge the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Eucharist, yea Catechumens and Nouices were not before Baptisme fully taught or instructed therein. Secondly, the reason moouing the primitiue Church to be carefull in this point was, least Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens &amp; Infidells being fully acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the whole mystery, the one shold be scandalized, &amp; the other mocke therat.

For a true Christian desires to belieue, and firmely cleaue vnto the reall Presence that was belieued by the primitiue Church.

For not know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing what you say, you grant vnto your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary as much as he would proue, because you vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not the Philosophicall tearmes you vse. He did not say that the winge of the fly, is <hi>physically or actually</hi> diuided into so many thinne parts, as would couer the world, but only, that it is <hi>diuisible</hi> into so many thinne parts; but you do not deny, but there is so much potential or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the flyes winge. And if the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a flyes winge into so many thinne parts as will couer the world, be <hi>potentiall</hi> and possible, I hope you will not deny but God can make the same <hi>actuall</hi>; except you will say, that there is in the quantity of a flyes winge more potentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to be deuided, then in God power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, so denying him to be Omnipotent.</p>
                                 <p>Secondly, your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth with Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles <hi>minima caro, sed non minimum corpus,</hi> doth more &amp; more bewray your Ignorance. For the Philosophicall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation <hi>de termino par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitatis,</hi> is <hi>de minimo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali,</hi> whether a thinge homogeneous, that is, whereof euery particle is of the same kind with the whole, as water, fire, flesh, can be so little as it cannot be lesser or thinner by the course of nature; wherein many learned Deuines hold the Negatiue part, that no flesh is so little, but it may be lesse by the course of nature. But in respect of the Diuine power, no Christian Philosopher doth hold there is <hi>minima caro,</hi> flesh so litle and thine, that God can not make the same lesser and thinner without end, and so with a flyes winge co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the world.

                              </note>. For if it be the part of a prudent &amp; intelligent man, not to permit imagination to preuayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst his reason, what a disgrace is it for a Christian that his fayth should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by these kind of difficultyes? For that the seeming absurdityes of this myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be not in respect of naturall reason, but meerly of imagination, may hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that some naturall truthes be in a manner as difficill and incredible; which wil be seene, if we compare the foure aboue mentioned difficulties, with the difficulties some truthes, euident in nature, haue.</p>
                           <p>First, we cannot imagine, that the whole body of Christ can be contayned in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe of a small hoast. But it is not more incredible, that in a thing of small quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for example in the winge of a fly, there should be so many parts, as vnfolded and layd togeather would couer the whole face of the world, both of heauen and earth: And yet it is demonstrable in Philosophy, that euen in the wing of a fly, there are so many parts, as broad &amp; long as the wing, though still thynner and thinner, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God separating and vnfolding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may therewith couer the whole world. For certayne it is, that some finite number of such parts so separated, each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as long, and as broad as a flyes winge, would couer
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2259:262"/>
the face of the whole world. Certayne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it it that the winge of a fly is stil diuisible into more &amp; more such parts that no finite number of them is assignable, but God may still separate from that winge a greater nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without end. Therefore it is certayne, that in the wing of a fly there is so much quantity as is sufficient to couer the face of the whole world both of heauen &amp; earth, if God would but separate and vnfold the same. Is not this secret of Philosophy as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to carnall imagination, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christs body within a small hoast? We that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not comprehend thinges we see with eyes, and feele with hands, certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we shall haue much adoe at the day of Iudgement to iustify our not belieuing any part of Gods word, by reason of the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming absurdityes therof.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, we cannot imagine the body of Christ to be really combined vnto the consecrated formes, and not to be polluted by such indignityes as may happen vnto the formes; yet we haue seene, or may see thinges able to make this not to seeme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. For holy men often by prayer so purify their soules, and by contemplation bring their spirits to such an independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their senses, that neyther bitter meats offend their tast, nor loathsome sents their smell, nor shrill cryes their hearing; yea burnings &amp; torturings are not perceaued, their spirit being eloyned, through diuine
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:2259:262"/>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE doctrine of Concomitancy is, that vnder the forme of bread, not only the body of Christ, but also his pretious bloud and blessed soule are truly, and really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned; the body directly and by vertue of the wordes of consecration, the bloud and the soule consequently. For being contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the body of Christ, they must needs concomitate, that is, follow the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in what place soeuer the same be <note n="(t)" place="margin">The Minister <hi>pag.</hi> 460. sayth, <hi>The bloud of Christ cannot properly he sayd to be in his body by Concomitancy, (for then it were accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally therein) but as a part in the whole.</hi> Answere. We do not say, bloud is accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the body of Christ or by concomita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, but that it is by concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy in the same place with the body. As the soule is not by conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy in the body of a liuing man, but as a part in the whole, yet as Philosophy teacheth <hi>Mouetur per accidens cum corpore,</hi> it is moued, and remoued accidentally, and by concomitancy with the body; You must then distinguish, To be in the body, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> To be in the same place with the body. The soule is in the body by direct substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall vnion therwith, but in the place of the body the soule is not directly, but by concomitancy, in regard of her coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the body, which is directly in place. In this maner the soule, and bloud of Christs be directly and substantially in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet only by conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnder the forme of bread, where the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy only is directly by vertue of the words. In this sense also the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by Concomitancy. For the Deity is not expressely signifyed to be in the Sacrament by vertue of the words, which only affirme <hi>Christ his body</hi> to be present; yet is the Deity present vnto, and vnited with the body present by the vertue of the word. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Deity is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>comitancy, so that though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yet should it be heere present by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy, because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably ioyned with a thing that is present.</note>. Neyther can any that acknowledgeth the Reall presence, deny this Concomitancy without falling into many absurdities, as I proue by three Arguments.</p>
                        <p>First, he that acknowledgeth the Reall presence of Christs sacred Body vnder the forme of bread, and denyes Concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, doth in his beliefe separate the bloud, &amp; soule of Christ from his body: But to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate eyther Christs Diuinity from his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, or soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his body, or his bloud from his flesh, is vnlawfull. For such a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuer doth dissolue and destroy Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and so is one of the number of them that <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> condemneth, <hi>Omnis spiritus qui soluit Iesum non est ex Deo, &amp; hic est Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christus</hi>
                           <pb n="307" facs="tcp:2259:267"/>
                           <note n="(u)" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioan. 4.3.</hi>
                           </note>. And this Argument hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test force in their opinion, who shall think that Christ leaues heauen for the tyme, &amp; comes downe really according to his body and bloud; for how can the body of Christ come downe from heauen without bloud and soule, vnles he come down dead? And so Christ should be not only mystically &amp; figuratiuely, but truly &amp; really massacred in the Sacrament, and the Eucharist be a bloudy sacrifice, and not incruent, as the Fathers tearme it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Priest in the person of Christ who is glorious in heauen, or rather Christ being glorious in heauen, by the mouth of the Priest, sayth, <hi>This is my body</hi>: but a body deuoyd of bloud without soule, and consequently dead and senselesse, is not the body of Christ as he is now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in heauen, which hath bloud in the veines, and is informed and glorifyed by a most excellent soule. Therfore Christ glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in heauen cannot say truly, that a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy voyd of bloud sense and soule is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but soule, life, and bloud must needes follow, and concomitate his body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it be.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if vnder the forme of bread were only the body of Christ, and his soule and bloud were not by Concomitancy there, the Communicants should receaue the body of Christ, but not truly Christ, as our Aduersaryes graunt; <hi>Caluin</hi> specially

                              <p>The Minister pag. 462. proposeth this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument agaynst <hi>Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy,</hi> which he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to be so stronge and glorious, as he sets the same in a distinct let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; ech proposition in a distinct line, to call the eye of the Reader vpon it.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Whatsoeuer is receaued in the Sacrament was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore offered to God on the Crosse. But the body of Christ hauing soule and bloud in it by Concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was not offered to God vpon the Crosse.</hi> Ergo, <hi>at this day soule and bloud be not in the body of Christ by Concomitancy &amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>I answere. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment serues as a myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, wherein Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men may see and admire our Ministers want both of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>Logicke.</hi> His want of Philosophy in not distinguishing the being by <hi>Concomitancy</hi> in the body, from being by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy</hi> in the place where the body is. The body of Christ neyther on the Crosse, nor in the Eucharist hath soule &amp; bloud in it, and vnited with it by Concomitancy, yet the body of Christ not only in the Sacrament, but also on the Crosse had soule and bloud present with it by Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, or consequence. For the soule being substantially vnited with the body, and bloud contayned within the body, they were conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inforced to be togeather with the body in the same place on the Crosse.</p>
                              <p>Hence the Ministers argument is turned agaynst himselfe: <hi>That body is receaued in the Eucharist, which was offered to God on the Crosse</hi>; but Christs body hauing soule and bloud in the same place with it by Concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was offerred to God on the Crosse. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the body of Christ hauing soule in the same place with it by Concomitancy, is in the Sacrament.</p>
                              <p>His ignorance in Logicke is likewise very specious and notable, to present vnto the world, with so great solemnity, an idle Sophisme, and Fallacy, tearmed by the Logitians, <hi>Figurae dictionis.</hi> Of which fallacy one kind is, when from the <hi>substantiall</hi> word one argueth vnto the <hi>accidentall.</hi> As for example, this Sophisme: What meate soeuer thou didst buy in the market, thou dost eate at dinner: but thou did'st buy raw flesh in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: <hi>Ergo,</hi> thou dost eate raw flesh at dinner. And this likewise: What fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers soeuer thou had'st being a Childe, thou hast now being a man: thou had'st little fingers being a Child: <hi>Ergo,</hi> thou hast little fingers now being a man. Iust of the same frame &amp; fashion is our Ministers argument. What soeuer is receaued in the Sacrament was offered on the Crosse: A body that had not blood in it by Concomitancy, was offered on the Crosse: <hi>Ergo,</hi> a body not hauing blood in it by Concomitancy is receaued in the Sacrament. If this forme be good, one may proue that we do not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the body of Christ risen from death. Whatsoeuer is receaued in the Sacrament was offered on the Crosse: A body hauing soule and blood in it by vertue of resurrection from death to life, was not offered on the Crosse: <hi>Ergo,</hi> a body risen from death, or hauing soule and blood in it by vertue of resurrection from death, is not receaued in the Sacrament. Here your Ladyes may see with what Baberyes you delude their Ignorance arguing from the Substantiall vnto the Accidentall tearme. For though Christs body receaued in the Sacrament be the same that was offered on the Crosse in respect of <hi>substance,</hi> it doth not follow that therefore it is the same also in respect of <hi>accidents,</hi> qualityes, and circumstances. Hence his body may now haue blood and soule by Concomitancy with it in the Sacrament, though it had not had blood &amp; soule by Concomitancy with it on the Crosse.</p>

                        <p>This principle supposed, which is no lesse certayne then the true real presence, I inferre the lawfulnes of Communion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kind (to wit vnder the sole forme of bread) by this Argument. If communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnder one kind be not agaynst the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance eyther of Christs institution, or of

his Sacrament, or his precept, or of the practise of the primitiue Church, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, iustifiable, &amp; for iust reasons may be commanded by the Church. This proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because there neyther are other causes of dislike that may not be reduced to these foure; neyther doth Christs Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or Precept, or the Primitiue practise binde vs to keep them, further then in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the accidentall circumstances of institutions, Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, precepts, primitiue Customes being variable according to the variable disposition of thinges vnto which the Church militant in this life is subiect. Now I assume, Concomitancy being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, it may be made euident that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vnder one kind is not agaynst the substance eyther of Christs institution, or of the Sacrament, or of his precept, or of the primitiue practise. For the substance of these foure obligations is one &amp; the same, to wit, that we be truly &amp; really partakers
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:2259:269"/>
of the body and bloud of our Sauiour, which is <note n="(e)" place="margin">The Minister p. 467. saith: <hi>Though Concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be granted, yet Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in one kind, is not iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed, because the blood by Concomitancy is receaued in the veines of the body, not as shed out of the veynes: But people must receaue the blood of Christ repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as shed, which is not done, but by receauing the Cuppe.</hi> Answere.

                        </head>
                        <p>DIVINE Institution is an action of God, whereby he giues Being vnto things, with reference vnto some speciall end. This end is twofold, the one corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and temporall for which God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted agreable and conuenient meanes. That men may be borne into this world, he did institute marriage: and for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the sayd life being had, he orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many sorts of meate. The other end is spirituall, for which God hath instituted Sacraments; as, for the first obtayning of grace and spirituall life, the Sacraments of Baptisme &amp; Pennance; for the preseruing of grace &amp; increasing therein, particularly the Sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>
                        <p>That a man be bound to vse the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, two things are required. First that the end thereof be necessary, and he bound to endeauour the attayning therof. Hence it is that though marriage be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of God appointed to propagate mankind; yet euery man is not bound to marry, because he is not bound to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate mankind, when there be others that do aboundantly comply with that duty to which mankind is in generall bound, <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicamini, &amp; replete terram [Gen.</hi> 1.18.] Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, where the end of the institution is
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2259:270"/>
such as euery man must endeauour the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning thereof, to the end that a man be bound to vse that institution, it is further required, that the thing instituted be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for atteyning of that end. For if there be other meanes ordeined sufficient for the atteyning of that end, a man is not bound to vse such particular diuine institutions. For example, man is bound to mainteyne his corporall life so long as Nature will permit, and to this end God created varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fruites, yet no man is bound by diuine institution to eate fruits, there being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes instituted for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of life <note n="(f)" place="margin">The Minister not being able to refell, what the Iesuit heere sayth, That because Christ did Institute the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in both kinds for the refectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of souls, it doth not follow that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are bound by force of this Institution, to receaue in both kinds, as men are not bound to eate both fruite and flesh, though God did institute both, for the maintenance of mans life: Not being, I say, able so refell this, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to proue, that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one kind is agaynst the substance of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: which is impertinent in this place, that controuersy being handled in the next Paragraffe; and what the Minister here saith is there answered, as in the proper place.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Applying this to our purpose, It is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that by the force of diuine institution no man is bound to vse Communion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kindes. For though the end why Christ did institute the Sacrament in both kinds be necessary, and all must endeauour the atteyning thereunto, to wit, maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and increase of grace the life of the soule, yet there be other meanes by which we may atteyne to this end. Whence it is, that learned Deuines hold that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Eucharist, is not <hi>necessarium, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate medij</hi> (as they speake) that is, the vse thereof is not a necessary meanes for the maintenance of spirituall life, but a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wanting meanes of sacred Communion may by other meanes preserue himselfe in the state of grace. And though we should
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2259:270"/>
suppose that actuall communion were a necessary meanes to preserue spiritual life, yet communion vnder one kind is aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly sufficient thereunto. For the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the sole forme of bread, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Authour and fountayne of life, whole &amp; entyre according to body, soule, bloud, and his infinite person, is aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly sufficient for the refection of the soule, yea no lesse sufficient then Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vnder both kindes.

For he doth not dispute as you fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne, but in this sort.

But such is the Sacrament in one kind, as he doth largely proue, descending vnto the particular ends. Is this a discourse to be smiled at, or answered by laughing?</note>.</p>
                        <p>First, there is required some Element that is, a visible &amp; sensible thing or action without which no Sacrament can subsist, tearmed by Deuines <hi>Materia Sacramenti.</hi> This substantiall part is not wanting in the Sacrament giuen in one kind, in which there is consecrated bread visible and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in the accidents thereof, and mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, an action also visible and apparent to sense.</p>
                        <p>The second thing required to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is <hi>Verbum,</hi> the word, that is, a forme of speach shewing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and supernatuall purpose vnto which the element is consecrated. Neyther is that part wanting in the Sacrament giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kind, which is consecrated by the wordes of Christ, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and the Theologicall principle taken out of Saint Augustin verifyed, <hi>accedit verbum ad eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp; fit Sacramentum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third thing is Signification, euery
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:2259:272"/>
Sacrament signifying some diuine effect of grace, which God worketh by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof, and the sensible signe euen by nature hath, as Saint <hi>Augustine [Epist.</hi> 23.] noteth, some proportion, &amp; analogy to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that diuine effect which to produce, it is assumed by Gods omnipotency as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument. This sacred signification which the holy Eucharist hath, is of three kinds, and all three are found in the Sacrament giuen vnder one kind. First this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is a signe of spirituall food for the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and refection of the Soule, which signification is manifestly found in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder one <note n="(n)" place="margin">
                              <p>The Minister very often (though out of place as <hi>pag.</hi> 470. <hi>li.</hi> 20. &amp; pa. 442.) obiects. <hi>If Communion in both kindes, be not of the substance of the Sacrament, why should Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion in bread, or wine be of the substance of the Sacrament? Why may not Communion in Cheese be truly a Sacrament, as well as Communion in one kind?</hi> Answere. First diuers Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts namely <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Caluin (see Beza epist.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; epist.</hi> 25.) teach, that though Christ did institute the Sacrament in bread and wine, yet in case that bread and wine be wanting, one may vse some other proportionable Element, as Cheese and Beere. Might you not imploy your talent in rayling vpon these men, better then on the Councell of Constance?</p>
                              <p>Secondly, The Protestants allowing of Cheese in lieu of Bread, and beere in lieu of wine, is to change the substance of the Element, wherin Christ did institute the Sacrament, and consequently to change the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Institution and Sacrament, bringing in an Institution and Sacrament of another substance. But to receaue the Sacrament in the kind of bread without wine, is not to change the substance of the Element, but only (whereas the Sacrament for more complete signification was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in two elemte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as for the same reason it was instituted after supper) to vse the one element without the other, the whole nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sufficient for all the functions thereof, being found in one kind, as the Iesuit doth heere demonstrate.</p>
                           </note> kind. For the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist doth signify this effect of spirituall nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, because it is a signe of Christ, the bread of life, the food of Angells, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:2259:272"/>
of grace; but by the sole forme of bread Christ is signifyed, as present accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his most Sacred body, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as most sufficient to feed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh the soule.</p>
                        <p>Another signification of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is vnion and coniunction betweene the faythful, as being members of the same body wherof Christ is head, &amp; fellow-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one with another, as S. Paul declares [<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4.] which coniunction the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the forme of bread doth signify. For bread being a compound of many graynes of wheate massed togeather in one loafe, &amp; also made of floure and water mingled one with another, signifyes the perfect vnion both of the Church with Christ, &amp; of the faythfull that are in the Church one with another, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. testifyes, <hi>vnum corpus sumus quotquot de vno pane parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipamus,</hi> where he makes no mention of <hi>Wine,</hi> the Sacrament in the forme of bread being alone able to shew &amp; worke this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.</p>
                        <p>This Sacrament doth also signify the passion and death of our Sauiour, which death and passion is shewed and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Communion vnder one kind <note n="(o)" place="margin">The Minister sayth <hi>pag. 479. That both kinds do more liuely represent Christs Passion, then one only.</hi> Answere. What is this to the purpose, to proue the Sacrament in one kind substantially imperfect? Baptisme by plunging the Childe into water, represents Christs death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, more liuely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Baptisme by sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; yet is Baptisme by aspersion a full and entyre Sacrament.</note>. For receauing the Sacrament in the forme of wine only, we haue a sufficient ground to remember the bloud of Christ that was in his passion shed, and separated from his body. Likewise by participating of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:2259:273"/>
bread we may liuely conceaue the body of Christ, as it was depriued of the most precious bloud by the effusion therof on the Crosse; wherupon Christ (as Saint Paul <note n="(p)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 14.15.</note> testifyes, did after the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ech kind, particularly recommend the memory of his passion, as knowing that in ech of them alone was a sufficient monument and memoriall thereof.</p>
                        <p>The fourth thing required to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a Sacrament, is <hi>Causality,</hi> to wit, to worke in the soule the spirituall effects it signifyes. This Causality cannot be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Sacrament vnder one kind, wherein is conteyned the fountayne of spirituall life. For the cause why the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in both kindes giueth grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth the soule, is, that Christ is assistant vnto them, bound by his promise at the presence of sensible signes, to worke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably spirituall effects in disposed soules. But Christ is in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnder the forme of bread, &amp; he is able through infinite power, and bound by inuiolable promise, to worke the effect of grace, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing vnto life eternall the worthy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipant of this Sacrament <note n="(q)" place="margin">Hence is refuted what the Minister saith pag. 478. without any proofe: That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of grace is not made to one kind only.</note> vnder the forme of bread, <hi>Qui manducat hunc panem, viuit in aeternum.

Not any doubt then may be made, but the Sacrament in one kind is full, entyre, complete in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, &amp; by participation thereof prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red consciences do receaue the benefit of

Secondly, This is impertinent: for the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not whether Communion in both kinds be of greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but whether it be necessary vnto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kindes giue more grace, yet this excesse may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily equalled by other diligences, as by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten receauing in one kind, and by obedience to the Church &amp;c. The Minister <hi>472.</hi> proueth Communion in both kinds to be of greater profit, because it is an act of obedience vnto Christs precept, <hi>Drinke yee all of this, but obedience is better then Sacrifice,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.<hi>22.</hi> His argument supposeth, without proofe, what the Iesuit hath shewed to be most false, and so may be with more truth turned to the contrary: for to receaue in one kind is an act of obedience vnto the Church, whereof Christ sayth, <hi>He that heareth not the Church, let him be to thee as an heathen and a publican.</hi> But obedience is better then Sacrifice: Therefore more spirituall profit, and merit is gotten by Communion in one kind.</note>.</p>

vnder one kind. Secondly, suppose Christ spake these Imperatiue wordes <hi>Do this,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the giuing of the Cup, yet are they to be vnderstood with this restriction, Do this, that is, all things that belong to the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and substance of this action in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of me.

Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by other texts of Scripture we prooue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue by eating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bread. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>doe this in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of mee,</hi> was spoken only after the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bread, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the Gospell, But your selfe say pag. <hi>490. lin.</hi> 7. <hi>That these wordes were spoken to the People respectiuely, and in part,</hi> to wit, that they receaue, though not consecrate, &amp; admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Sacrament in the forme of bread. Therefore though the word <hi>Manducate,</hi> do not, yet other wordes of the Institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force a precept to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue in the forme of bread.</note> 
                           <hi>mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, bibite; Take, eate, drinke,</hi> were certainly
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:2259:276"/>
spoken vnto the same persons; and they runne so togeather in ranke, that no man can with probability make the one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne the other. But the Commaund <hi>Accipite,</hi> which signifyes take with your hands (for it is a precept distinct from <hi>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacate,</hi> which is, <hi>take with your mouth</hi>) was giuen to the Apostles only, not vnto al the faythfull; else we must say, that all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants are bound to take the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated bread &amp; Cup <hi>with their hands.</hi> Who euer heard of such a precept in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church?</p>
                        <p>The third reason is, because there was a peculiar, and personall cause, why Christ should giue that peculiar counsell or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition (for the Imperatiue word doth not euer signify a precept, but often an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, or a permission, as your Maiesty well knowes) to his Apostles at that tyme <note n="(x)" place="margin">When the finall cause &amp; end of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is personall, then the sense of precept is personall.

This is more manifest in the Protestants o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, who thinke the Chalice whereof Christ sayd in <hi>S.

For Christs words, <hi>deuide this Cup a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst you</hi> import drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke yee all of this indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduall Cuppe.

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany should drinke vp that whole indiuiduall quart, &amp; being challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dged by the other to haue done agaynst the order of the giuer, who would not laugh, should they answere (as our Minister teacheth them) that <hi>Deuide this Cupp amongst you, imports not, drinke all of this indiuiduall Cupp, but of a Cupp of the same kind?</hi> So that howsoeuer the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in this place doe rayle bitterly, and bragg mightely, yet his Reply is ridiculous, and agaynst common sense.</note>. What, all men in the world? Or all Christians that should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them to the worlds end?

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore referring my sayings to your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties learned censure, I conclude that to me it seemes cleere, that the precept, or rather direction, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> was but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, confined vnto the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of all there then present. <note n="(*)" place="margin">
                              <p>The Minister pag. 489. bringes foure arguments to proue that the wordes of Christ, Drinke yee all of this, command all the faythfull to drinke: which arguments though very poore ones, shall be answered. The first is, <hi>What Christ sayd to the Apostles, Paul sayd to the whole multitude of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. Answere. <hi>S. Paul</hi> neuer sayd the wordes, <hi>drinke yee all of this to all the faythfull,</hi> yea the same are not found in all the Epistles of S. Paul: for 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. he only sayth, <hi>let a man proue himselfe, and so eate of that bread, and drinke of that Cupp,</hi> which wordes (as euery man in his senses must needes perceaue) do not import a precept to receaue in both kinds, <pb n="326" facs="tcp:2259:277"/> but only that no man receaue in both kinds, or in one kind, without first trying himselfe, whether he be worthy. What you cite out of S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms commentary, <hi>Coenam Domini oportet esse communem,</hi> only signifyes that the Sacrament is for all men, aswell for the poore as for the rich, agaynst which some Corinthians erred, scorning to receaue in the Company of the poore.</p>
                              <p>The second. <hi>If Communion in both kinds hath no foundation in Gods word, then Communion in one kind hath no foundation in Gods word.</hi> Answere. The lawfullnes of Communion in both kinds, &amp; the lawfullnes of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in one kind, haue foundation in Gods word, and so to vse the one or the other is not agaynst the Diuine law. But a Diuine precept to receaue in one kind, or in both kinds hath no foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Gods word, as being but a fond Ministeriall fancy. The word of God doth command to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, at least vnder the forme of bread, but to receaue in the same only without the Cupp, is no Diuine precept.</p>
                              <p>The third Argument. <hi>If the reason why the Apostles receaued the Cupp was, because they were Priests, then all Priests being present at Communion ought to receaue in both kinds though they administer not.</hi> Answere. If the reason why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles receaued the Cup, was not because they were Priests, but as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit proueth by the Gospell, because Christ would haue it so, saying vnto them, <hi>Drinke yee all of this</hi> indiuiduall Cupp, then is the Ministers argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t idle and impertinent. Such also is his fourth argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherein he would proue, that the Apostles were not made Priests by the wordes <hi>Doe this</hi>: For suppose they were not made Priests by that speach, how will he thence conclude that the words <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> were not spoken per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally vnto the twelue, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding them to drinke all of the same indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidual Cupp? Besides in the two arguments to proue the Apostles were not made Priests by the word <hi>Do this,</hi> he shews intolerable ignorance.</p>
                              <p>The first is, <hi>what force is there in these wordes,</hi> Do this, <hi>to conclude Priestly ordination?</hi> Answere. Are you a Doctour, and do not know that the word of the Almighty hath force to giue men power, commission, authority to do what he doth command them to doe? Christ by the word <hi>Do this,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Apostles, to do what he had done, that is, to consecrate bread and wine into his body and blood, to receaue and consume the same, to giue them to the faythfull. <hi>Ergo,</hi> by saying <hi>Do this,</hi> he gaue them power commission, authority, not only to receaue themselues, but also to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, and giue vnto others his holy body and blood, which is the power and office of Priesthood.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="327" facs="tcp:2259:277"/> Secondly, <hi>If</hi> (say you) Do this, <hi>proueth Priesthood, then lay men are Priests when the wordes</hi> Doe this, <hi>be spoken to them in part, or respectiuely.</hi> Answere. Doe not you feele, how you bewray the weakenes and vanity of your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in your very proposition thereof? You say the wordes <hi>Do this,</hi> be spoken vnto lay men but in part, that is, they command them to receaue, but not to consecrate and giue the Sacrament vnto others. But the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or commission only to receaue the Sacrament is not Priesthood, but the commission to consecrate &amp; administer the same vnto others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wordes Doe this, do not make them Priests, to whome in part &amp; respectiuely, but to whom they are spoken absolutely, &amp; in the full sense.</p>

For, as we distinguish in the Sacrament, the substance &amp; the manner, the substance being to receaue the body of Christ, the manner, in both kindes by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall eating and drinking: So the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is to be made in our Sauiours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept about this Sacrament. For howsoeuer
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2259:278"/>
his words may sound of the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing in both kinds, yet his intention is to commaund no more then the substance, to wit, that we really receaue his body and bloud, which may be done vnder one kind.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the same no further, then it was necessary to this end.

For, seeing in the verse 59.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2259:279"/>
of this Chapter he promiseth life eternall to eating only, <hi>Qui ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducat hunc pane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, viuit in aeternum.</hi> If in the 94. verse of the same Chapter, he require vnto life euerlasting eating and drinking both, he should in the space of a few lines speake contraryes. And because this is impossible,<note place="margin">
                              <p>THIs last answer is truest, &amp; may be inuincibly proued by Scripture. First, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be denyed that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture the particle <hi>Et, and</hi> is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> disiunctiuely as the Iesuit proueth in the text, &amp; the Minister gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. Secondly, whensoeuer two thinges are required to one &amp; the same end, for which ech a part is sufficient, then the particle <hi>Et, and,</hi> must needs be vnderstood disiunctiuely to signifye the same as <hi>Or.</hi> Because to strike Father apart, and to strike mother apart is worthy of death in a sonne, therefore the Scripture <hi>Exod. 21.</hi> saying, <hi>He that striketh his Father &amp; mother let him dye the death,</hi> is to be vnderstood disiunctiuely, his Father or mother. This might be proued by other innumerable instances, nor can so much as one example be brought where this rule fayleth.</p>
                              <p>This supposed, I assume: But the Scripture teacheth that the eating of Christs body a part by it selfe is sufficient vnto eternall life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.52. <hi>The bread which I will giue is my flesh, for the life of the world.</hi> And 58. <hi>he that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me shall liue by me</hi>: and 59. <hi>he that eateth this bread shall liue for euer.</hi> Ergo, the precept, <hi>Except you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud you shall not haue life in you,</hi> is vnderstood disiunctiuely, Except you eate his flesh, or drinke his bloud.</p>
                              <p>Hence the Fathers when they say, the Gospell commands drinking of bloud, they meane disiunctiuely, because they ground the precept vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this text. The Authour of the booke <hi>De Coena Domini</hi> sayth, <hi>the law forbad the eating of bloud, but the Gospell commands drinking thereof,</hi> to wit disiuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely: &amp; <hi>S. Austine. q.</hi> 57. <hi>In Leuit. In the law men are forbidden so tast of the bloud of the Sacrifices, but in the new law from taking the bloud of our Sacrifice by way of nourishment, no man is forbidden, yea rather all are inuited thereunto that will haue life,</hi> to wit disiunctiuely, that is, they are inuited, if they will haue life, to eate the flesh, or drinke the bloud of our Sauiour. Other places brought <pb n="331" facs="tcp:2259:279"/> out of the Fathers by you, are partly from the purpose, partly falsifyed.

You haue corrupted his testimony two or three wayes. First by omission, for S. Iustin doth mention not only wine, but also water. <hi>The Deacons</hi> (sayth he) <hi>distribute vnto euery one present consecrated bread, wine, and water,</hi> 
                                 <gap reason="foreign">

                                 </gap>: Wherfore if by this testimony you can proue it is a Diuine precept to giue wine, you proue also that it is a Diuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to giue water, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently your selues to be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressors of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine precept who giue it not. That this your peruersity to vrge vs with the testimony of <hi>S. Iustin,</hi> which makes not to the purpose, or else by the same your selfe are condemned, might not appeare, you falsified the place, citing what pleased you, and leauing out what serued not your turne. Secondly, these words of <hi>S. Iustine, The Apostles taught that Iesus commanded them so to doe,</hi> are not ioyning vpon the wordes that mention the giuing of consecrated bread, wine, &amp; water, as you would haue men belieue, but follow some 16. or 17. lines after, &amp; are referred to another matter, to wit that Christ gaue a Command to belieue the reall presence. <hi>S. Iustine</hi> his true words are these: <hi>We are taught, that as Iesus Christ is made truly flesh by the word of God, in the same manner the Eucharisticall foode, by the prayer of the word proceeding from him, is the flesh and blood of Iesus incarnate: for the Apostles in their writings tearmed the Gospells, do deliuer, that Iesus gaue that preception vnto them. For taking bread into his hands, and hauing giuen thankes he sayd</hi>; Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me, this is my body. <hi>In like manner taking the Cup after thansgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing he sayd</hi>; This is my bloud. Thus <hi>S. Iustine,</hi> by which it is euident that he sayth that Iesus gaue a precept not of communion in both kinds, but of belieuing the Reall Presence. Whence your third corruption is discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, making S.

The discourse then of <hi>Gelasius</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these men are <hi>superstitiously</hi> conceyted, that the creature of wine is the Diuells gall, therefore by them the deuiding of the holy mystery, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the consecrated Bread without the Cup, <hi>sine grandi sacrilegio fieri non potest,</hi> cannot be done without great Sacriledge.

                              <p>The Minister also in this place keepeth a styrre, and would make the world belieue, that the <hi>Iesuit Vasquez</hi> doth maynly oppose himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the <hi>Iesuit Answerer,</hi> about this place of <hi>Gelasius. The Iesuit</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is confuted by a learned and intelligent man of his owne Society, to wit</hi> Vasquez, <hi>who sayth, that some of his party apply the place of Gelasius agaynst Manichees, but this exposition agreeth not with the last clause of the Canon.</hi> Answere. You shew great desire to discredit your aduersary, yet cannot you doe it, so much as in this trifle, with truth. For in citing the censure of Vasquez you leaue out the principal word, which being set down would haue marred your market. Vasquez not only sayth, that some of his side explicate the place of <hi>Gelasius of lay Manichees,</hi> but also addeth his Iudgment about the same saying, <hi>probabiliter explicant,</hi> this their explication is probable. Do not you see your falshood in citing and vanity in vrging this censure of Vasquez? If this explication be probable euen by the Iudgment of Vasquez, how is the Iesuit confuted by Vasquez of his owne Society, as not answering your argument sufficiently? Is it not sufficient, that Catholicks bringe probable solutions vnto your arguments agaynst Christian customes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in Councells and receaued in the Church before you, or your <hi>Luther</hi> were borne? You your selfe say <hi>pag.</hi> 11. That <hi>no man is to reiect</hi> the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and custome of the Church, <hi>or the exposition of Scripture, commonly and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently receaued vpon vncertayne and probable reasons.</hi> If the Iesuit hath answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your arguments probably, as euen by this censure of Vasquez he hath, then be your arguments at the most but probable, and consequently your reuolt from the Church of Rome grounded thereon da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable. Who now is condemned by <hi>Vasquez</hi> his Censure?</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="335" facs="tcp:2259:281"/> But <hi>Vasquez</hi> sayth, that the Iesuits explication, <hi>though it agree fitly to the rest of the decree of Gelasius, yet cannot be fitted to the last branch thereof, where Gelasius</hi> sayth, <hi>that the diuision of the one and same mystery is Sacrilegious in it selfe, and in nature:</hi> Quare mihi magis placet altera explicatio: <hi>Wherefore,</hi> sayth Vasquez, <hi>vnto me another explication seemeth more probable.</hi> I Answere. First <hi>Gelasius</hi> doth not say, that the diuision of the mystery is in itselfe &amp; in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Sacriledge, nor can it be very probably sayd that he did so meane. For what sense is there in this discourse, To deuide the Sacrament by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing in one kind is a Sacriledge of his owne nature, and absolutely in it selfe, therefore let not these men be permitted in any case to receaue in one kinde, <hi>quoniam nescio qua superstitione docentur astringi,</hi> because they are conuinced to hold superstitious Doctrine about the impurity of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of wine? Besides, had <hi>Gelasius</hi> meant that Communion in one kind is a sacriledge absolutely in it selfe, he would haue decreed that not only superstitious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but absolutely all men should be kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same <hi>procul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubio,</hi> without any question. Wherfore <hi>Gelasius</hi> his decree cannot be better sensed then thus. Because these men are conceyted superstitiously agaynst the creature of wine, their receauing in one kind without the Cup, can not but be impious; Therefore <hi>proculdubio arceantur,</hi> let not Communion in one kind be giuen vnto them in any case, though vnto Orthodoxe people vpon iust reasons the same may be granted. Secondly, suppose all that Vasquez would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, to wit, that another exposition is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, what haue you gayned? Surely nothing; for this other exposition better liked by Vasquez is, that <hi>Gelasius</hi> spake not of laymens receauing, but of Priests that celebrate and consecrate, affirming, that it is sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious in it selfe for Priests to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate without receauing in both kinds. If the Iesuit Vasquez in this exposition and doctrine seeme to you <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; intelligent,</hi> be it so in Gods name, you are satisfyed, and your Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary contented; for he did neuer meane to say, that this explication is improbable, specially the same being giuen by Gratian, who read that Epistle of <hi>Gelasius,</hi> which now it not extant.</p>

                        <p>The fourth Argument is drawne from many signes and tokens, that the primitiue Church did sometymes vse Communion vnder one kind.

But that he carryed the blood of our Sauiour in a glasse out of the Church about him, <hi>S. Hierome</hi> doth not say, yea he signifies that this vse of Osier-baskets, &amp; glasse-Cups was in the Church, saying, <hi>Nihil ditius Exuperio nostro, qui corpus Domini canistro vimineo &amp; Sanguine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> portat in vitro, qui auaritiam eiecit ETEMPLO:</hi> nothing is more rich then <hi>Exuperius</hi> who doth carry the body of our Lord in an Osier-basket, and his bloud in a glasse, who hath cast Couetousnes out of the CHVRCH. Nor is it probable that he carryed the bloud about him in a glasse, when he went any iourney, exposing the same to manifest danger of being irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently spilled, specially glasse being so brittle and easely broken, and the ancients exceeding sollicitous and anxious, that the bloud might not be shed, nor any particle of the sacred bread fall to the ground. <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> sayth of his sister Gorgonia praying earnestly for the recouery of her health, <hi>That whatsoeuer of the Antitypes or Images of the pretious body and bloud her hand had hidden, that shee did bath &amp; mingle with her teares</hi>: which place Vasquez whome you so commend, as learned and intelligent, doth shew to be spoken of holy Images of Christs Passion and death, not of the blessed Sacrament. For Women were neuer permitted to touch the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Chalice with their hand, nor to keepe consecrated Cups in their houses for the bloud, but only white linen corporalls for the body. It had been also agaynst the Reuerence ancient Christian deuotion did beare to the pretious bloud of our Sauiour, for her to haue powred her teares into the sacred Chalice, mingling them with the pretious bloud: so that there is no signe in Antiquity that laymen did keep in their priuate houses, or did carry about them the bloud of our Sauiour in the forme of wine. Therfore in their priuate houses, and out of the Church they still receaued in one kind.</note> was carryed away, and consequently that the Church did not then esteeme of Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder one kind, as of a sacrilegious mayming of the Sacrament, as Protestants now doe.

causes that might be pretended. For how could the <hi>Manichees</hi> still refusing the cup, haue been hidden amongst these ancient Christians, if they had byn perswaded as now Protestants are, that receauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kind is a sacriledge. If one in the Church of England should refuse the Cup but once in a publike Communion in the Church, would he not be incontinently noted? <note n="(i)" place="margin">The Minister <hi>pag.</hi> 560. <hi>First the Manichees were espyed, else how could the Pope reproue their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise Secondly Vasquez the Iesuit sayth, That these Heretikes receaued the Cup into their hand, but dranke no wine: And amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a great multitude, some few might hold the Cup to their mouth, &amp; make shew of drinking, and yet receaue no wine.</hi> Answere. The Pope did reproue that practise of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> because he knew it was their Heresy so to doe, in that they held wine to be the gall of the Diuell, and that Christ did not shed his bloud on the Crosse; which also to be their practise such as were conuerted from that heresy did witnesse. Vasquez doth not say, that the Manichees did only put the Cup to their mouth without drinking, and so lay hidden and vnknowne; (for he was not so simple, but he did see this could not be done, but the Deacons that gaue the Cup to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants one by one, would presently haue perceaued it.) He sayth that they did drinke of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated wine, but kept the same in their mouth, till they came to some place, where without being noted they might spit is out. Which I can not thinke to be probable. First the Manichees hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wine to be a thing so impure and detestable as the Diuells gall, how would they take the same into their mouth? Secondly, how could they keepe the wine in their mouth so longe, but that some part therof would goe downe? Thirdly, <hi>S. Leo</hi> bids Catholickes to note the men that <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> altogeather refrayne from the Cup, signifying that they might by this their perpetuall abstinence be distinguished from Catholicks, that sometymes refrayned. But if they tooke still the wine into their mouth, kept the same there till they came to a solitary place, where they might spit it out securely, how could they be discerned by their abstayning from the Cup, more then any other Catholicks did vse to doe? Hence euen Vasquez doth acknowledge, that this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t drawne from the dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of heretikes, namely of the Macedonian woman related by <hi>Sozom. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c. 5.</hi> is <hi>probabile, &amp; valde apparens,</hi> probable and very apparent to proue that Communion in one kind was arbitrary, and a thinge indifferent in the ancient Church.</note>

                        <p>The last Argument, is practise of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, that is, of the first Christians vnder

                        <p>The first grace is <hi>diuine Preordination,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God out of his owne goodnes ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man and his actions vnto a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall last end, aboue that he might attayne

                        <p>The second is, <hi>the grace of Redemption by Christ Iesus,</hi> without whome we and our workes are defiled, we being by nature the children of wrath, &amp; should be so still, had not he by his passion and death appeased God, giuing vs the inestimable treasure of his merits, so that, <hi>In illo benedixit nos Deus omni benedictione spirituali in caelestibus, in quo habemus redemptionem per sanguinem eius, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum diuitias gratiae suae, quae superabundauit in nobis.

                        <p>The third is, <hi>grace of Adoption in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi> wherby soules are supernaturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autifyed by participation of the diuine Nature.

But his infinite benignity remitting this rigour, moued thereunto through the merits of Christ, is content that we make vse of our good workes for the gayning of glory, &amp; doth not exact them wholly and totally, as otherwise due.</p>
                        <p>The sixt is, the grace of <hi>liberal promise,</hi> by which he obligeth himselfe to reward the good workes of his Children according to the desert of their goodnesse. Did not God bind himselfe by his word in this manner, no worke of Saints, though neuer so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and excellent, were able to bind him to reward it, as all Deuines teach, though

some disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be, whether, Gods liberall premission supposed, the goodnes of the work concurre partially with his promise to oblige him, which is a disputation of no great moment.</p>
                        <p>Finally, that Merit attayne reward, is required <hi>the grace of Perseuerance,</hi> without which no man is crowned. And though good workes strengthened with so many supernaturall excellencyes be good stayes of conficence in themselues considered, yet because we are not sure of our perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, no nor altogeather certayne that we haue good works adorned with the former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,<note place="margin">
                              <p>THE Minister pa. 511. <hi>Can any thing be more arrogant &amp; foolish then for miserable beggars &amp; sinners to mintayne, that God should be vniust if he rendred not heauen to mans good workes? And yet this proud Doctrine is deliuered by the Rhemists, Annotat. Heb. 6.4.</hi> Answere. In your hoat-spur-zeale you wound the Blessed Apostle with the tytle of arrogant Foole. It is he who doth suppose as certaine, &amp; who taught the Rhemysts to say, that God should be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust did he not reward the good workes of his Children: for to assure the Hebrews their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes should not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded of God, he sayth Hebr. 6.10. <hi>God is not vniust to forget your workes, and loue which you shewed in his name in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string vnto the Saints.</hi> As if he had said, God should be vniust, did he forget your workes &amp; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them: But God cannot be vniust. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be sure he will not forget your works. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to assure men of Gods word, sayth <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19. <hi>God is not as man that he should lye,</hi> the same doth tacitely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue in this sort: If God should not keepe his word, he should be a liar as men are. God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

You should be more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and not thus ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely runne tilting with bul-rush-inuectimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the holy Ghost himselfe, in your splene agaynst the Pope. For this sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, God shold be vniust did he forget to reward good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, is the Scriptures, though about the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Iustice that is in God, whether the same be proper or improper, a question is made by Deuines: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Rhemists say, God should be properly vniust, but only vsed the very words of <hi>S. Paul.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Minister pag. 512. <hi>If the Iesuit should maintayne that Good workes meret iustification or perseuerance, not by their Nature, but by Grace, this distinction would not free his Tenet from errour: so likwise it is erroneous to mayntayne that Good workes merit by grace. Answere.</hi> If Good works should merit iustification, they must do it by the force of the goodnes inherent in their nature, and not as eleuated by the grace of adoption, seing before iustification they be not Gods Children. But to say that men merit with God by the sole naturall goodnes of their workes, not eleuated by the grace of adoption, is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous. The workes of Gods Children cannot merit the grace of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance, because they be not eleuated vnto that end by the grace of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine preordination, and Gods liberall promise. Besides the workes of the iust be condignely rewarded with the Crowne of Glory and so nothing of their value can be spared to merit any thinge Condignely, but only glory. If the workes of Gods Children were not otherwise Condignely rewarded, they might merit the grace of perseuerance, should God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se the same vnto Good workes done in a certayne number and quality; so your instance bewrayes your ignorance.</p>
                              <p>The Minister pag. 512. <hi>S. Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. I thinke the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of this tyme be not Condigne to the glory to come, that shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in vs. <hi>The Passions here expressed were Martyrdomes iustifyed by grace,</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. 1.29. <hi>spirituall Sacrifices of a sweet smelling odour,</hi> 2. Tim. 46. <hi>and Condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or worthines equall in desert or value is denyed vnto them. Answere.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sayth that the Passions of time be not Condigne of their owne <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> and fleeting nature vnto infinit eternall glory. Therfore to the end they may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>digne, they must be eleuated by the grace of diuine adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For thus goeth the whole discourse, <hi>The spirit himselfe giueth testimony to our spirit, that we are the Children of God. If his Children then his heyres, the heyres of God, fellow-heyres with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him that we may be glorifyed with him. For I thinke the Passions of this time not to be condigne vnto the future glory.</hi> By this it is cleere <hi>S. Paul</hi> meaneth that the Passions of tyme be not proportionable in their nature which is temporall &amp; fleeting, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eternity of glory; &amp; therfore they must be aduanced &amp; made deare and pretious to God by the grace of adoption, which is a grace proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vnto glory; for if we be the Children of God, we be the heyres of his glory.</p>
                              <p>And if the Ministers Argument were good, it would otherthow the merit of inward inherent congruity which he doth acknowledge. For Saynt Paul might truly haue sayd, Passions of tyme, or which are of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory and fleeting nature, are not congruous in respect of the eternity of glory, yea the Passions of Christ being temporall, and short were not by their owne nature condigne, or Congruous vnto eternall glory, nor could haue been condigne, had they not been eleuated by the dignity of Gods naturall sonne, from whome they proceeded.</p>
                              <p>Minister pag. 517. <hi>The Iesuit hath set fire on his owne house: for if we owe our works vnto to God</hi> (as he sayth we doe) <hi>by the titles of iustice, Religion &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, what peeping hole, I pray you, is left for merit, to creepe in at? Answere.</hi> Our workes by the titles of iustice, Religion and gratitude are due vnto God, so farre as he doth please to exact them by his law, and no further: but he is pleased not wholly and totally to exact them by the aforesayd titles, but to leaue them vnto men, to vse them for the gayning of the crowne of glory, as we are taught by his word. Hence mans merit is not in rigour of iustice, but grounded vpon Gods mercifull indulgence, in not exacting vpon workes with vttermost rigour. This mercifull indulgence is a wide gate, by the which Merit makes entrance into Gods Children, shewed you by the Iesuit; yet so blind you are as you see it not, but goe peeping about to find an hole for Merit to creep in at.</p>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theron.

                              <p>What the Minister cauilleth agaynst this truth, is reduced to two heades. Minister pag. 522. <hi>First to the definition of workes of supererogation is required, that all which the Diuine law commandes be fullfilled. But if iust men haue sinne, they performe not all the Diuine law doth require. For euery sinne is a transgression of the Diuine law,</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.4,</p>
                              <p>Answere. The law of God bindeth men to performe the workes thereof, so farre as they are necessary vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation, vnto which the obseruance of the law is ordayned, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the commandments, Math.</hi> 19.17. Hence veniall sinne is not properly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the law of God, but against the decency and perfection of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the law of God supposed, and his goodnes towards man. The place you cite, as Saint Iohns, <hi>Euery sinne is a transgression of the diuine law,</hi> is by you falsifyed, as I haue shewed in the Censure, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. §. 9. though also that text speake of mortall sinne, not of veniall. The testimony of S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <hi>serm.</hi> 2. <hi>de Vig. Nat.</hi> by you cited p. 522. affirming that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands his law to be kept exceedingly, that when we cannot doe it, finding our imperfection, we may flye to his mercy, is vnderstood of veniall sinner, <pb n="353" facs="tcp:2259:290"/> which, no man can totally auoyd, which sinnes though they be not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against the Diuine law, nor properly agaynst any law, yet they are agaynst the decency of reason the Diuine law supposed as hath been said. Hence it followes, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting of veniall sinnes doth not hinder, but we may do works of supererogation; not works of supererogation in rigour of iustice, but through Gods merciful indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in not exacting of vs so much as he might. Suppose a slaue being bound to worke 8. houres a day, worke only seauen: If his master forgiue him this fault, without any new obligation, but that henceforward he worke 8. houres a day, this slaue if he worke afterward 10. houres a day, doth he not a worke of supererogation? Yes certaynly, though a worke of supererogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on his maisters benignity. In this manner, seeing God forgiueth his Children their dayly faults vpon their dayly crauing perdon, without putting new obligations vpon them, more then that they keepe still his law, if they doe workes more then his law exacts, they truly do workes of supererogation.</p>
                              <p>Minister <hi>pag.</hi> 526. <hi>No man though he giue all to the poore &amp;c. can exceed the highest and strictest measure of Charity and obedience in this life. For the Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call law commandeth vs</hi> to be perfect, as our heauenly father is perfect, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. and to loue, as Christ loued vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7.8. <hi>and through the obligation of gratitude we owe vnto God, according to S. Bernard, Omne quod sumus, omne quod possumus, Answere.</hi> The Euangelicall law doth not require that we should be perfect as God is in equality, but only in similitude, that as he loueth his enemyes and doth them good turnes, that we likewise loue our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes and doe them the good turnes we are bound to doe by his law, which the Children of God by Diuine grace may do, and more also. Nor are we bound to haue charity equal vnto our Sauiours, but only like vnto his, to wit, that as he loued vs so as he dyed for vs, that we likewise dye for our brethren, when need requires, which many Saynts haue done and dayly do practise. By the band of gratitude we owe vnto God all that we are, and all that we can, so fare as it is required by his law, and no further. We are bound by gratitude also <hi>in pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>

                              <p>Hence it is manifest, that the band of gratitude doth not hinder the possibility of doing works of supererogation, as may be declared by this example. Suppose the King pardon a gentleman condemned of treason and remit vnto him the forfeyture of his lands and goods, whereby he <pb n="354" facs="tcp:2259:291"/> oweth all he is, and hath to the King in Gratitude. Suppose also that the King exacting a Subsidy of his subiects, require no more of this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then he takes of another of his quality; Verily this subiect is bound to giue no more then another; and if he giue an hundred pound more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other, it is a gratuity, a worke of supererogation, which he might haue omitted without any iust offence or ingratitude, yet a gratuity grounded on the Kings manifold gracious liberalityes, towardes him. Such is our case with God. He doth not exact of vs by the title of gratitude so much as he might, by which his goodnes we are inabled to offer gratuityes vnto him, which we might without offence or ingratitude not haue offered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By the light of this annotation the mist of the Ministers Cauills is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wherewith he would obscure the consent of Fathers about workes of superogation set downe in the next Paragraffe.</p>

                        <p>Neyther is there any arrogancy as I said before, in this doctrine. For neyther the Fathers, nor we attribute more vnto man then Protestants doe; but only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one kind of diuine liberality towards man, which Protestants be some-what backward to belieue: for supposing that God exacteth much lesse then he might, &amp; much lesse then man is able by his grace to performe, Protestants will not deny but a man may offer vnto God some volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary seruices beyond commaunded duties; Catholikes also graunt, that had God vsed the vttermost seuerity of charging vs with debts, as he might haue done, we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by any measure of grace that now is ordinarily affoarded vnto men, haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with all our obligations, much lesse haue performed vnrequired offices. The difference therfore betweene them and vs
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2259:293"/>
is this: They thinke that God seuerely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth of man, that euer, &amp; in all occasions he worke according to the vtter most of his power, yea commaunds him thinges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him to performe.</p>
                        <p>Contrariwise, we hold, that God, to the end his Law may be vnto men a sweet yoke, a light loade, and his Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not difficile, doth not exact of man all that man is able to doe with his grace, but much lesse, and so much lesse as man is able through this remission to offer him liberalityes. What pride is it for man, to acknowledge this sweet prouidence of his Creatour, to prayse his mercyfull In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, in not exacting so much as he might; specially belieuing, that this diuine Indulgence not to exact of man, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly mans ability to present vnto God, more perfect and excellent seruice then he requires, is giuen him through the merits of CHRIST IESVS?</p>

                        <p>This doctrine of Satisfaction is like vnto the former of Merit, much spoken against, &amp; by many disliked in the highest degree, who yet perchance doe not much vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what they so earnestly impugne, as may appeare by this briefe declaration of our doctrine in this point.</p>
                        <p>First we doe not thinke, that any sinner can make satisfaction by works vnto God, for the guilt of Mortall or damnable sinne. The reason is, because works of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are such as merit pardon, and obtayne it, by some kind of Iustice from God. The works of his Children, may merit in this sort, as being the workes of them that are instruments of the holy Ghost, dwelling &amp; operating within them, &amp; liuing members of Christ his mysticall body, receauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of life and operation from him, as from their head. Sinners are neyther the Children of God, nor the Temples of the Holy Ghost, nor liuing members of Christ, so their workes cannot be so gracious, as they may deserue any thing as due to them in any kind of Iustice from God, much lesse can they deserue so great a reward, as remission of mortall sinne, and of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall punishment due thereunto.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we doe not teach, that any Saint or Angell, can make satisfaction vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:2259:294"/>
God for the mortall sinne of any man, no not all Saints &amp; Angells putting togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all their good works and satisfactions. The reason is, because an Iniury is so much the greater, by how much the person that offers it, is Base, and the person to whome it is offered is Noble, as the light of reason &amp; the estimation of mankind sheweth. But God whome man casteth away &amp; abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by sinne, &amp; consequently wronges, is of infinite dignity, and man offending him comparatiuely with him infinitely base: wherfore mortall sinne which is an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of God for some transitory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, is iniury done vnto God incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly grieuous. On the other side satisfaction is the lesse esteemed, by how much the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son satisfying is meane, and the person of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended great. Men and Angells what are they, being compared with God? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing; therfore certainly their works &amp; satisfactions are inestimably dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to satisfy for any the least mortall sinne, the guilt wherof is so great a debt as it is vnsatisfiable, but only by the precious bloud of the Sonne of God. He being a person Coequall &amp; Consubstantiall with his Father, to satisfy Gods anger by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the infinite dignity of his perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto the most disgracefull death of the Crosse, offered satisfaction full and complete, yea superabundant; the person satisfying in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Diuinity being infinitly more
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:2259:294"/>
honorable, then the person offending was contemptible by reason of his basenes.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the Roman Church teacheth, that those that haue byn made the Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God by Baptisme, if they sinne mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afterward, when they repent God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giues them the guilt of sinne, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the eternall punishment by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Pennance, bountifully &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously through the meer merits of Christ, without their satisfaction; only they must by Fayth, by feare, by hope, by Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by purposes of amendment prepare &amp; make themselues capable of that gracious and grace-infusing pardon.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the Roman Church holdes, that God by Pennance forgiuing the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall punishment, doth in lieu thereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes appoint a taske of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall paine, to be endured by the Penitent. This reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued penalty is greater or lesser according to the multitude, and grieuousnes of the sinnes committed, and is that for which penitents may and must satisfy. And why may not the penall workes, performed by the Children of God, beautifyed by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aforenamed excellent graces be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to deserue of God the remission of this temporall mulct, and cancell the debt of enduring transitory payne? I could bring testimonyes of the most ancient Fathers in great number, for the necessity we haue of suffering these voluntary afflictions for
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:2259:295"/>
sinnes, and of the efficacity therof, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate sinne with the very name of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <note n="(*)" place="margin">
                              <p>The Minister would fayne elude this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Fathers by diuers Shifts, but two be the chiefe, which I will heere fully refute. <hi>Pag. 544.</hi> he saith: <hi>The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists in their course of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine about Satisfaction, peruert all that which the Fathers taught. First, that which the Fathers speake of the fault and guilt of sinne, they wrest to the temporall payne of mortall sinne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning after the remission of the euerlasting guilt.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. You are according to the Ministerial wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, proud, &amp; bold in your accusations, but poore and miserable in your proofs. You say the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers spake not of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall payne of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sinne, but of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry guilt thereof. And in another place pag. 547. yet more boldely, WHAT SOEVER <hi>is spoken in holy Scripture, or by the ancient Fathers, concerning redeming sinnes by satisfaction, belonges to the fault and eternall payne of sinne; and this satisfaction, must be performed by the delinquent himselfe in this present life.</hi> This you say, but <pb n="363" facs="tcp:2259:295"/> proue it not, yea the contrary is cleere truth, and proued by these 4. or 5. Arguments.</p>
                              <p>First, if after the remission of the euerlasting guilt, there remayne a temporall payne to be mitigated, and taken away by penitential workes, then there is no reason to thinke but the Fathers spake something thereof. But your selfe <hi>p.</hi> 540. <hi>lin. vlt.</hi> say, <hi>That there is a remaynder of Temporall affliction after the remission of the guilt of sin.</hi> And <hi>pag</hi> 541. <hi>lin.</hi> 7. <hi>That this temporall payne may be remoued, or mitigated by workes of mortification and pennance.</hi> Therefore you haue no reason to thinke the Fathers neuer spake thereof.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, The Fathers spake of that kind of satisfaction which Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid made vnto God for his adultery and murder of Vrias, yea they make this satisfaction of Dauid the prototype and perfect patterne of that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they require. <hi>Hilarius in Psal.</hi> 118. <hi>&amp; alij.</hi> But Dauid his satisfaction by patient enduring penaltyes inflicted, was satisfaction for the temporal payne, and not for the staine and eternal guilt of sinne, which was remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted longe before, presently vpon his inward contrition and repentance, <hi>Dominus à te transtulit peccatum tuum, 2. Reg. 12.13.</hi> Therefore the satisfaction which Scriptures, and the Fathers require, is for the temporall payne, not for the guilt of mortall sinne.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, the Fathers teach, that after inward griefe, and contrition for sinne, (by which they knew the guilt of sinne and of eternall payne was remitted, according to the truth of Gods word <hi>Ezechiel 18.22.</hi>) long continued satisfaction must be done, to pacify Gods wrath, <hi>Cyprian. Epist.</hi> 40. <hi>Dominus longa &amp; continua satisfactione placandus est.</hi> But the guilt of sinne and eternall paine being remitted, men need not, nor cannot satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye but for the temporall.</p>
                              <p>Fourthly, the Fathers teach, that men must seeke to satisfye for their sinnes, euen after they be iust, and Gods adopted Children (<hi>Hierom. in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph. Paulae.</hi>) but in the Children of God the euerlasting guilt is remitted, and nothing can remayne to be remoued by satisfaction but <hi>the guilt of Temporall payne.</hi> Finally, the Fathers teach, that after this life, often there remayneth something of sinne to be expiated by Purgatory paynes, from which soules may be released and relieued by the pious workes of their liuing friends. So sayth S. Augustine expressely <hi>l.</hi> 21. <hi>de Ciuit. c.</hi> 24. <hi>serm.</hi> 32. <hi>de verbis Apostol.</hi> and many others.</p>
                              <p>I omit other demonstrations of this truth. To what you so much obiect that Fathers say, men must redeeme their sinns and satisfy for their offences to God, I Answere: By sinne, they meane the payne due vnto <pb n="364" facs="tcp:2259:296"/> sinne, which is tearmed sinne, because it is the effect of sinne. Hence sinne is sayd after the remission thereof to remayne in the soule, to wit, in his effect, nor can the soule be sayd to be fully cleansed vntill this debt be satisfyed.</p>
                              <p>Minister <hi>pag.</hi> 544. Secondly, <hi>that which the Fathers stiled Satisfaction impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and by way of deprecation, the Romists make satisfaction of condignity, yea of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Iustice.</hi> Nazarius <hi>in</hi> 3 <hi>p.

Verily you may as well accuse S.

Philip.</hi> 4.13. Suarez sayth that the inward contrition inhering in the sinners hart, is more effectuall to expell veniall sinne by way of formall opposition therewith, then Christs satisfaction; <hi>tamen satisfactio Christi in ratione meriti perfectior est</hi>; yet the satisfaction of Christ is more perfect and efficacious to expell sinne by way of merit.

                              <p>Neyther do we teach, that condigne satisfaction may be made vnto God in respect of the offence agaynst the Diuine Maiesty, nor can we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In which respect men may make vnto God satisfaction <hi>iust, condigne, equal, compensant,</hi> the Fathers say expressely. <hi>Tertullian libro de poenitentia: Christ proposeth pardon of sinnes to be</hi> REDEEMED <hi>by the</hi> COMPENSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION <hi>of pennance.</hi> Origen <hi>homil.</hi> 15. <hi>in Leuit.

                        <p>The first, that good works of Saints that are penall and afflictiue doe not only merit heauen, but also satisfy for sinne. This is proued.

                        <p>These manifold afflictions endured by Saints, far aboue measure of the temporall penalty, which after the eternal was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously remitted did remayne due to their offences, did not perish, nor were forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but were layd vp in the memory of God.</p>
                        <p>The third Proposition. The treasure of the Church consisteth principally of the superabunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t satisfactions of Christ, who did endure much more then was necessary for the Redemption of man; wherewith are ioyned the satisfactions of Saints. We ioyne the satisfactions of Saints with the satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ, in the Churches trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, not because we belieue the bloud of Christ to be insufficient alone, to satisfy for sinnes, <hi>nisi velut arescentis &amp; exhausti de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus aliunde suppleatur &amp; sufficiatur:</hi> (as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakingly, not to say calumniously, <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin [lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Instit. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 39.] reporteth of vs.) For Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 6. (whome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants accuse as the first Authour of this
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:2259:298"/>
Treasure) affirmes euen in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitution about this matter, that the bloud of Christ is of an infinite price, and euery drop ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of sufficient to ctncell the sinnes of the whole world. The reasons of this coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are these three.</p>
                        <p>First, That penall workes of Saints as they are satisfactory, be not without fruit, for being satisfactory, and not hauing the effect of satisfaction in their owne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent &amp; vndefiled persons, they wilbe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this fruit and effect, except they be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto others that are poore and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in whome satisfaction is scant, and the debt of temporall payne abounds.</p>
                        <p>The second is, The glory of Christ, whose meritts were so powerfull, as to purchase to the church of God, such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent &amp; admirable Saints, so pure of life, so feruent in pennance, as their satisfactions might suffice to pay the debt of temporall payne due vnto others.</p>
                        <p>The third reason is, to make men loue the Church and society of Saints, wherby they come to be partakers of the abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her treasures to pay their grieuous debts.

                              <p>MINISTER pa. 554. <hi>It is remarkable how the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Higlars with one breath, both magnify, &amp; debase the price of Christs bloud. For one while they say, That one drop thereof is sufficient to sasisfy for all the sinnes of the world; and then agayne they inferre, That it is fit it should be ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out with an addition of Saintly satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to raise a stocke to redeeme soules out of Purgatory. Else why stint they not this treasure vpon the mayne Reuenew of Christs Passions only? Their detected meaning is: Christs Bloud alone is all-sufficient to saue soules; but the same is insufficient to impregnate his Holinesse his Coffers. The bloud of Christ hath abundant vertue in it to cleanse sinnes, but it must emendicate vertue to fill purses, and to satisfy the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice of the Horse-leeches of Rome.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Answer. You speake in the proper Tune of <pb n="373" facs="tcp:2259:301"/> your Ghospell, which was euer the Note of Heresy, to wit, to barke &amp; raile at the chayre of Peter, the roote &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice of the Catholike Church, <hi>Cyprian ep.</hi> 88. The Angell sayd vnto Iacob, in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his constancy, thou hast been strong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, how much more wilt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle agaynst men? and I may say of you in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of your ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at vs, What wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der though you spare not Christs Vicar on earth, who in your ignorant zeale about this matter, rayle and blaspheme euen God himselfe? For thus you write in the precedent pag. <hi>553. If the Bloud of Christ be infinit, it is foolish to ioyne to the same the Bloud of Martyrs &amp; passions of Creatures. Is any man so foolish as to add the light of a candle to the cleere light of the Sunne?</hi> Thus you. Is not this Blasphemy agaynst God? For hence I thus argue. He that ioyneth the bloud of Martyrs and passions of Creatures to the infinit price of Christs bloud, is a foole by your censure. God, that men may attaine vnto heauen, doth to the infinite merit of Christs bloud, ioine the passions of Martyrs &amp; of creatures, saying vnto men, that except they suffer with Christ, they shall not be glorifyed with him. <hi>Rom</hi> 8.17. What followeth of this your saying, but the most horrible blasphemy that may be, that God is like a foole which ioyneth the light of a Candle with the light of the Sunne? Hence your calumniation of the Roman Church is detected, the folly wherewith you charge her, being the very same wherwith you charge God. For as the ioyning of Saynts workes and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to the merits of Christ, for the full purchasing of heauen, is not eeking out of his merits by addition vnto them, but to performe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which God requires, that the merits of Christ may haue their effects: So to ioyne to the satisfactions of Christ, the satisfactions and <pb n="374" facs="tcp:2259:302"/> mortifications done by Saynts, for the abolishing of the debt of Temporal payne, is not to <hi>eeke out the price of his bloud with addition,</hi> but to comply with Gods will and pleasure, who wil haue vs to be cleansed from the reserued temporall guilt of payne, not only by Christs satisfactions and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but also by our owne, as Scriptures and Fathers teach.</p>
                              <p>Besides Catholicks teach, as you may see in Suarez, <hi>Tom. 4. in 3. p. disp.</hi> 51. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. <hi>conclus.</hi> 3. That the superaboundant satisfactions of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour is a sufficient and infinite stocke &amp; reuenew, out of which the Pope may grant Indulgences ordinarily and without any stint, though there be not any saintly satisfactions remayning in the treasury of the Church, [<hi>Sola satisfactio Christi esset sufficiens ad indulgentiarum efficaciam, etiam secundum legem ordinariam</hi>] Whence two things are consequent. First, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister belyeth the Church in saying, that we ioyne to Christs bloud the satisfactions of Saints to impregnate his Holynes his coffers, as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded that Christs bloud alone is not sufficient for this end. For if selling and buyng of Indulgences were lawfull (as it is detested in our Church, and acccursed as a most horrible and damnable crime, <hi>Concil. Lateran. sub Inno.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Vienn. sub Clem. 5.</hi>) If I say we held it were lawful for the Pope to enrich his coffers by the sale of pardons, according to our <hi>Tenet,</hi> the Pope might fill his purse &amp; coffers by selling Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of Christs passions only, they being infinite and vnexhaust. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Ministers so often repeated assertion, that the Doctrine of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences is vsed vnto filthy lucre, is a mere Ministeriall slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der. For the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is no more to be belieued in saying, that by this doctrine the Pope filleth his Coffers, then in his saying, That he doth for this end teach that Saintly satisfactions must be ioyned vnto Christs, as iudging Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to <hi>impregnate his Coffers.</hi> But this is a manifest slaunder, seing the Pope holds that the price of Christs bloud is infinite, out of which infinit Indulgences might ordinarily be giuen, and also sold to enrich his coffers if that practise were law full. Therefore, a most false an impudent slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is what the Minister here so often repeates, that the Doctrine of the treasure of Saynts superaboundant satisfactions, is <hi>deuised by Roman Prelats for filthy lucre.</hi>

                                 </gap>ure the Sonne of God, is not only free from sinne, but also his soule in the moment of his Conception was aduanced vnto the highest degree of glory and beatificall vision any soule can possibly attayne vnto. Hence his works, not only as satisfactory for sinne, haue not effect in his person by nature impeccable, but also as meritorious of glory they superabound in respect of his soule, which independently of workes is erected vnto the highest degree of glory. Hence also his works being not only as satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions. but also as merits superfluous in respect of himselfe, be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable vnto other, not only as satisfactory for their sinnes, but also as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of glory for them. In the Saynts liuing vpon earth it is not so: For they be not in glory, nor can they in this life be so perfect, but they may merit still more &amp; more glory; and as they merit more and more, so their reward is greater and greater. Hence their workes as meritorious of heauen, can neuer be superfluous, nor without the effect of a full and condigne reward in their owne persons; whereby it cometh also to passe, that nothing of their merits superabounds to be communicated vnto others. But of their workes as satisfactory for Temporall reserued payne, there is not the same reason. For some Saints may be preserued by speciall grace from al actual sinne, as the Blessed Virgin was, or from any greuous sinne, as was S. Iohn Baptist: Others though they committed some mortall sinnes, when they repent, the penalty reserued after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission thereof, being finit &amp; temporall, they may by voluntary assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or diuine infliction endure more payne then is the reserued. Hence Saynts may haue satisfaction which superabou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, that is, which hath not the reward of remission of temporall payne in their owne persons, and consequently satisfactions that be communicable vnto others, though the merit of their workes be still proper to themselues and incommunicable. If the Minister will continue his rayling agaynst this reason, he may, but I doe not doubt, could he deliuer reasons for his Protestant Doctrine so drawne out of the bowells and principles of Christian Theology as this is, he would not rayle so much as he doth, but yield his Reader some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <pb n="376" facs="tcp:2259:303"/> discourses, in lieu of so many bitter inuectiues.</p>
                              <p>Minister pag. 555. <hi>Though the superabundant satisfactions want the proper fruite and reward of satisfaction, yet this (being recompensed by a large increase and surplasage in an other kind) can be no dishonour to God. As prayer though sometimes the same want the most proper fruite and effect thereof, which is to obtayne the thinge requested, yet is the same otherwise sufficiently rewarded. ANSWERE.</hi> Your Example makes agaynst your selfe, for pious and Godly prayer being both meritorious of heauen, and impetratory of what is reques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neuer wants eyther of these two fruites. For as it doth still merit new increase of glory, so doth it still obtayne the thinge requested so farre as it is requested; for the thinge is requested by Godly prayer so farre as it is profitable for the soule according to Gods holy will, but so farre it is still impetrated. And if the particular thinge requested be not for the soules greater good, another thing is obtained in lieu therof that is better. Hence I thus argue: You grant, if there be superabondant satisfactions of Saynts, the same must be rewarded by the proper fruite of satisfaction, as much as prayer hath still the reward of impetration. But prayer is still rewarded with the fruite of impetration, eyther in the person of him that prayeth, or in some other person for which it is offered. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the superaboundant sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions of Saints, must haue the reward of satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; which seing they cannot haue in their persons, they must haue it in some other partyes, to whome it is applyed.</p>
                              <p>The Minister pag. 556. <hi>If one should affirme, It is more for Christs glory to purchase to himselfe a people which in this life is perfectly innocent, then to purchase a people carrying alwayes about them the remaynder of sinne; he should not honour Christ but proue himselfe a lyer,</hi> 1. Iohn 1.8. <hi>so likewise to affirme, It is a greater honour to Christs merits to purchase Saynts that can make condigne and superabondant satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for their sinnes, carryeth a shew of honouring Christ, but is in truth a Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious errour.</hi> Answere. First the power and strength of the Diuine grace is better seen in infirmityes, and in men compassed about with the remayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and incombrances of sinne, as <hi>S.

To shew the weakenesse of your Reply I aske, whether Christs sufferings on the Crosse as exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples were imperfect or not? If you say they were imperfect, &amp; perfectible by Creatures, you blaspheme: &amp; also you may as truly say, his satisfaction was imperfect and suppliable by the addition of Saints. If you say, his sufferings, as examples, were perfect and full, &amp; yet were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by Saint Paul, why may not the same sufferings, as satisfactions, be supplyed by S. Paul, without being imperfect? For Saint Paul is sayd to supply the sufferings of Christ as satisfactory, not because they were not of infinit value, but because God will haue the satisfactions of his seruants to be ioyned with Christs, that Christs may haue their full effect, euen to the cancelling of the debt of temporall payne.</p>

For what more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t falshood then this you vent, <hi>That Indulgences had not any being in the dayes of Peter Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard?</hi> The Waldensian Sect was in being in the dayes of Peter Lombard, (as doth witnesse <hi>Illyricus in catalog.

Not only S. Thomas, &amp; many Catholikes write, that Saint Gregory the Great before the yeare six hundred, graunted Indulgences, but also Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, as Fryar <hi>Bale Act.

But whensoeuer the vse of such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences began, certayne it is, that Personall Indulgences graunted vnto particular persons, vpon particular examination of their cause, were euer in vse since the Apostles tyme, as doth appeare by the former testimony of S.

                              <p>Minister <hi>pag. 566. The holy Scripture teacheth expressely, that all spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is immediatly wrought by the bloud of Christ, who purged sinne by himselfe,</hi> Hebr. 1.3. <hi>But our Aduersaryes restrayne this, and the like place, to the stayne and eternall guilt of sin, saying, that the guilt of temporall payne is redeemed by Christ only mediatly, by the satisfaction of Saynts. Which is agaynst the Apostle,</hi> Coloss. 2.12. <hi>affirming, that Christ blotted out the handwriting of decrees (contayned in the Law) that was agaynst vs, and that by himselfe; but the temporary punishment is contayned within the latitude of the law. Leuit.</hi> 26.14. Answere. You do not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Doctrine of your Aduersaryes, or else wittingly misrelate the <pb n="380" facs="tcp:2259:305"/> same. For Catholikes distinguish the merit of Christs redemption, and the conditions by meanes of which, the same is applyed vnto particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. All spirituall guifts of this life &amp; of the future, all remissions of sinne eyther mortall or veniall, all releasement of punishment eyther eternall or temporall, is wrought by way of redemption immediatly, &amp; only by the bloud &amp; Passion of our Sauiour. But the condition which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the same be applyed vnto particular persons, is not only the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Christ, nor is the same kind of condition required in respect of euery grace. Some be giuen vpon condition of meere mercy, some not otherwise then according to mens works. The guift of iustifying grace is applyed vnto men by the vertue of Sacramtts through Gods only mercy, the sinner by fayth, pennance, and contrition disposing his soule for the reception thereof. But the grace and guift of eternall life, purchased by Christ his bloud, is not applyed vnto men through Gods only mercy, but by merit of Good workes, done by the power of grace; by workes I say, so good and gracious, as God may according to them giue eternall life, as a crowne, proceeding as a iust Iudge, as the Scripture teacheth 2. <hi>Tim. 4.8.</hi> and in a thousand other places.</p>
                              <p>In the same manner, the remission of the stayne of mortall sinne &amp; of the eternall guilt, purchased by the death of Christ, is applyed vnto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons by meere grace, by vertue of the Sacraments, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners humble preparation to receaue the same. But the releasement of Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishment reserued, is not giuen of meere mercy, but penitents being now Gods Children, after the gracious pardon of the sinne &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall guilt, must, to obtaine full remission, do <hi>fructus dignos poenitentiae,</hi> Matth. 3.8. Luc. 3.8. <hi>condigne workes of pennance, satisfactions, compensations iust, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, condigne, equall vnto the quantity of the reserued sinne, or penalty,</hi> as hath been proued by the Fathers. Hence, as eternall Glory though it be an effect of Christs merits only, yet is it not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but vnto such works as God may as a iust Iudge reward therewith; so likewise, remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Temporal payne though purchased immediatly by the merits of Christ only, yet is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto the penitent Saynts, without satisfaction equall &amp; condigne, eyther done by the penitent himselfe, or applyed vnto him out of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant satisfactions of others, by the vertue <hi>of Communion of Saynts.</hi>

                                 <q>Daniel a sanctifyed person &amp; a Prophet, able to communicate his satisfactions, praying for the remission of the eternall and temporall guilt of sin, presents not his owne satisfactions to God, nor yet the super abundant merits and satisfactions of any Patriarkes, <pb n="381" facs="tcp:2259:305"/> but resteth wholly vpon the free mercy of God, and the future satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of the Messias to come, <hi>Daniel.</hi> 9.7.</q> Answere. First, your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Daniel in this prayer did not offer vnto God the superabundant sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions of Saynts, <hi>Ergo</hi> they may not be offered, is idle.
For though there be superabundant satisfactions of Saynts, yet it is not necessary that in euery prayer we obsecrate God by them. Secondly, you cannot proue that Daniel did not offer superabundant Saintly satisfactions. If you say the Scripture doth not mention any such oblation, and therfore he made no such oblation, your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is reproued by your own assertion. Your selfe say that Daniel did obsecrate God, not only by his <hi>mercies, but also by the future satisfaction of the Messias to come,</hi> and yet these future satisfactions be not mentioned by the Scripture as any part of his prayer, but only Gods mercyes, <hi>not for our owne righteousnes, but for thy great mercyes.</hi> Why then may not we say, Daniel alleadged the superabundant satisfactions of Saynts, though the Scripture make not mention that he did? Thirdly, no doubt Daniell was of the same Religion that the three Children his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were, who praying for the remission of their sinnes, and of their whole people, offered vnto God the merits of the Patriarkes, saying; <hi>For A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham thy beloued, for Isaac thy seruant, for Israel thine holy One. (Daniel</hi> 3.35.)</p>
                              <p>The Minister <hi>pag 567. lin.</hi> 23. being angry at the Iesuit that he doth so sleight the Protestant arguments in this poynt, sayth: <hi>If the Iesuit be so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gide as to admit no argument on our part which may receaue any colourable answer, I intreate him to deliuer so much as one probable Argument (I will not require a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration) that the Roman Bishops haue power ouer the soules of Purgatory.</hi> Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. When you shal find in the Iesuits writings that the Pope hath power ouer the soules of Purgatory, or can by way of authority dispose of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I wil promise you that he shal bring ten thousand demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strations in proofe thereof. The meane while the world may see your vanity &amp; desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude them. You know that the Iesuit can bring euident proofes, for euery point of his Religion, and therfore you charge him to prooue, what is no part of his fayth, &amp; to bring probable arguments for that doctrine which he doth not hold as probable, to wit, that the Pope can by way of power and authority deliuer soules out of Purgatory.</p>
                              <p>The Pope by the power of his Keyes, may grant pardon vnto the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, out of the treasury of Christ his satisfaction, and the satisfactions of the liuing may be applyed to releeue the dead, as the Fathers most cleerly and vniformely teach. But the Keyes of <hi>Peter,</hi> can only bind and loose v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth, and absolue from sinne and penalty the liuing. Ministers when <pb n="382" facs="tcp:2259:306"/> they dispute with Catholikes, be like vnto a man that sitteth on thornes, so pricked and vrged with the euidencyes of the present argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as they would fayne be remoouing to some other Controuersy they care not to what. Thus you, in this place, are so galled to see your vanity displayed by the Iesuit, as you wish your selfe euen in Purgatory to be rid of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits vrging. (<hi>pag.</hi> 563. <hi>lin.</hi> 23.) I dare say had his Maiesty proposed the question, Whether some soules be purged by Temporall payne after this life, their state being releeuable by the suffrages of the liuing; the Iesuit would haue so scorched your Infidelity with the cleere testimonyes of Scriptures and Fathers, as you would haue runne as fast from Purgatory, as you now would fayne be in it. Whether the Pope haue authority in Purgatory or no, you need not greatly care, being sure, belieuing as you do, neuer to come thither, nor after death, within the precincts of Peters Dominion, who beares the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen. No doubt you are to fall into a lower place, except you repent of that heauy sinne so cleerly discouered in this your Reply, to impugne known truths, &amp; to falsify our Authors of purpose, to make the doctrine of the Church seeme odious. Of which damnable and hardly remissible crime, I beseech sweet Iesus of his infinit mercy to giue you grace to be purged in this present life, that so there may be some hope you may be saued, at the least by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory in the next.</p>

might (were they feruent) obtayne by their owne industry, ioyned with diuine grace, to wit, the Remission of temporall payne; which vertue also comes from the meritts of Christ, and his most pretious bloud, in, and by the satisfactions of Saints applyed to worke the aforesayd temporall releasement: from which temporall serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the Children of God, may through his gracious assistance, by good works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme themselues, or by satisfactions of their fellow-Cittyzens &amp; Saints be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, though this temporary Redemption compared with the redemption of Christ, deserues not that tytle.</p>

                        <p>FIRST, wheras the Iesuit sayth; <hi>Regall &amp; Papall, be two powers institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, both soueraygne and supreme ech in his kind, both Venerable and Honoured by me in the inmost affections of soule</hi>; after the triuiall trish-trash of a thousand tymes confuted obiections, agaynst the Popes spirituall Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, thus you write <hi>pag.</hi> 570. <hi>in fine.

                        </p>
                        <p>This is your first Assault, so strong, as if bold slaundering, and idle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing may winne the field, the day must be yours. You lay two crimes to the Iesuits charge. First, that he is ready to obey and follow the Pope though the Pope lead him to Hell. Can any Censure be more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian? The Iesuits suffering persecution for his Religion, may conuince any reasonable man that he is not so desperate, as to runne for any mans pleasure wittingly to Hell; nor were he so mad, is he such a
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:2259:307"/>
foole, as to goe thither disgraced and persecuted with the Pope. Were he so minded, he would rather go agaynst his conscience to please the King, whereby he might perchance get a Deanery, or some rich Benefice, and so goe to Hell with Wife, Children, Seruants, worldly Contents, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as you doe.</p>
                        <p>But what strong reason haue you to iudge so strangely of the Iesuit? Marry, The Canon <hi>Si Papa d.</hi> 40. sayth, <hi>If the Pope by being of bad life, &amp; negligent in his office, drawe thousands to hell, yet let no man presume to correct him</hi> (to wit iuridically, by deposing him) <hi>except also he do deuiate from the Fayth.</hi> This is the Canon; which supposed, your discourse hath this force and forme. The Iesuit receaues the Canon <hi>Si Papa</hi>: But the Canon <hi>Si Papa</hi> sayth, the Pope (not being an Heretike) may not be deposed for scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous life, though he lead by his example thousands to hell: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Iesuit is ready to follow and obey the Pope, though he lead him to Hell. It is hard to say, whether your iudging be more voyd of Charity, or your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing of Reason. I perceaue, if we feare your censuring, we must not mantayne, that the King is not to be deposed for scandalous life, though he lead thousands to Hell: For if we doe, you will thence conclude, that we are desperate, and ready to follow and obey the King, though he lead vs to hell: So wise a disputant and Censurer you are.</p>
                        <p>But let vs heare your second crimination, and your proofe thereof. The Iesuit sayth, <hi>I honour Regall Power, as in his kind Supreme and Soueraigne</hi>: that is, (say you) <hi>as the Popes Vassall.</hi> A goodly Comment vpon the Iesuits Text; what warrant haue you so to expound? Forsooth, <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> writes, that <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the third sayd of our King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Is not the King of England our Vassall?</hi> What is this to the Iesuit? Is he bound to belieue euery tale of <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> his writing? Though had you any skil in Histories you might know, that the Pope sayd so of that King, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he thought that Kings be by diuine Institution his Vassals in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Affayres, but because that King had done vnto him voluntary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for his Kingdome. For this <hi>Henry</hi> the third, was Son of our King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who gaue his Kingdome in vassalladge vnto this Pope Innocent, to protect the same from the incursion of the French, as he did. Hence at his Coronation being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his Non-age, sayth <hi>Matthew Paris, fecit homagium Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae, &amp; Innocentio Papae,</hi> he did homage to the holy Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, and vnto Pope <hi>Innocent.</hi> After ward comming to riper age, in the 29. yeare of his Raigne, he sent an Embassadge of foure Noble men, togeather with his Attourney <hi>William Powicke,</hi> to the Councell of <hi>Lyons,</hi>

and vnto Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4. to contradict the sayd donation of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, alleadging many reasons, (sayth <hi>Walsingam Ypodigm. Neust. Anno</hi> 1245.) that the King could not make his Realme Vassall vnto any, without the full consent thereof. The Pope answered, <hi>Rem indigere morosa consideratione,</hi> &amp; so the matter rested. Now I pray you consider, how fond, &amp; far fetcht your Discourse is. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> (as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> reports) foure hundred yeares agoe, sayd of a King that had done voluntary homage vnto him, <hi>He is our Vassall: Ergo</hi> the Iesuit doth not honour the King, as Soueraigne in his kind: Or, <hi>Ergo,</hi> his saying, <hi>I honour the King as Soueraigne,</hi> is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, <hi>as the Popes Vassall?</hi>

                        <p>First, <hi>Iesuits</hi> (say you pag. 573.) <hi>are taxed, and censured by many of their owne Part for singularity of opinions.</hi> This is your Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in so many words. I pray you if any Doctrines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preiudiciall vnto Princes, be singular vnto Iesuits, that is, held by the consent of Iesuits, and by Iesuits only, why do you not name these opinions what they are? Why do you dwell vpon generalyties, according to the custome of cosening Companions, <hi>Dolosus versatur in Generalibus?</hi> Why, but because you know, that descending vnto particulars, your falshood would presently be displaied? Hence you talke in the ayre, and in effect thus you discourse. I know there be certayne opinions mayntayned singularly by Iesuits agaynst Royall Soueraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nety, what they are I doe not know. For they be written in bookes, as inuisible as was our Church before <hi>Luther,</hi> no where to be found, but in the Globe of the Moone, and are no wayes to be read, but by the light therof.</p>
                        <p>The opinion for which some Catholicks at whome you glance (as appeares by your margent) haue taxed Iesuits of singularity is, that God hath assured Prescience of thinges contingent, not only of which shall in time actually happen, but also of what, vpon suppositions which neuer
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:2259:308"/>
were, might haue beene. For example God knoweth certaynly whether these conditionall propositions be true or false: If King Henry the eight had neuer seene <hi>Anne Bullen, England</hi> had been Catholicke at this day: If Queene <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> had fled into <hi>France</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she came into <hi>England,</hi> shee had recouered her Kingdome agaynst the Rebells: If the miracles Christ did in <hi>Iewry</hi> had been done in <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> those Cityes would haue done pennance. This doctrine some Deuines mislike, and say the same was first inuented by Iesuits. Which if it be true, then haue Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants done Iesuits wronge, that relate this very doctrine of Gods condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Prescience, as the doctrine of their Reformed Gospell. [<hi>Field of the Church l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 23. <hi>pag.</hi> 122.] But, I pray you, what is this to your Scope? The doctrine, that God knowes the state of things conditionally contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, what makes it agaynst the Soueraignty of Princes? Do you not see, you are ridiculous?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>If Iesuits be not singular in their doctrines, to the depression of Kings, wherefore was Iesuit Suarez his Booke,</hi> contra sectam Anglicanam, <hi>condemned at Paris in France, and burnt by the hand of the Hang-man?</hi> Answere. I likewise demand of you, if Iesuit <hi>Suarez</hi> his booke be preiudiciall to Princely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, why is the same allowed in all other Catholicke kingdoms; so as the King by his sollicitations could not get the same to be condemned? Do not other kingdomes know the Catholike Extent of Royall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, zealously mantaining the Soueraignty therof? How can that doctrin be singular of Iesuits, vnto which Bishops, secular Doctours, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of other Orders haue set their names by way of Approbation, as is to be seene in the beginning of that Treatise? And if your Argument be good, Iesuit <hi>Suarez</hi> his booke was in France burnt by the hand of the Hangman: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Order of the Iesuits holds doctrine to the preiudice of Princes; surely this Argument is strong, and vnanswerable: Minister <hi>Paraeus</hi> his booke was in <hi>London</hi> publickly burnt by the hand of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by Order of the Kinge, wherein no Papist had his hand: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Protestant Ministry holds doctrines pernicious vnto the State of Princes.</p>
                        <p>The third Argument: <hi>Wherefore were Iesuits banished out of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Venetians, professing the Roman Fayth, if they are guilty of no singularity about the matter of Regall, and Ciuill Authority?</hi> Answere. Why are Iesuits per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, desired, and sought for by all other Catholick Kingdomes, and States of the world, if they be guilty of singularity agaynst Regall, and Ciuil Authority? Should one dispute in this sort: Wherefore was <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome [Socrat. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 26. <hi>&amp; alij.]</hi> banished out of the Catholicke Citty of
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:2259:308"/>
                           <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the Catholicke Emperour <hi>Arcadius,</hi> at the instance of the Catholicke Empresse, in a Councell of Catholicke Bishops, but that he was guilty of treason agaynst Royall Authority? What would a learned Answerer say? He would laugh at the Disputants folly, and tell him, that Kings and States may be put into displeasure and Passion against the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Gods holy Word, &amp; so banish them their Dominions, not only for singularity agaynst Ciuill Authority, but for other reasons, as for their ouer zealous inueighing agaynst vitious life, &amp; constant crossing of their disordinate humours. I could bring many examples of iust, &amp; holy men banished by Catholicks, yea by pious and godly Kings, and States vpon mistakings, suspitions, false informations. <hi>S. Athanasius,</hi> that mirrour of sanctity &amp; learning, vnto whome the Church of God is more beholding then to the whole world which then liued besides, was he not for suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about temporall Affayres, banished by Constantine the Great, the first Christian Emperour, the patterne of Religious Princes? [<hi>Ruffin. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 17.] God permits such trialls to fall on his Seruants for the exercise of their Patience, vntill time discouer the truth, which being sufficiently cleered, if men still remayne obdurate, his Iustice will not sleepe.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Argument. <hi>Mariana the Iesuits worke,</hi> de Institutione Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipis, <hi>wherin he maintayneth Regicide, is extant in many hands.</hi> Answere. The example of <hi>Mariana</hi> proueth not, that Iesuits hold singular opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst others, but only that <hi>Mariana</hi> was singular agaynst the rest of his Order, which through the ouersight of Reuisors passed to the print. A thinge that may sometymes happen; which to preuent the Generall of the Iesuits gaue that seuere Order about reuiewing of Bookes in that kind, which the Iesuit hath set downe in his Answere. That Iesuit <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> was singular agaynst the rest, appeares, in that he was confuted by name of some of his own Order for this doctrine, euen before the censure of Paris. [<hi>See the letter of Cotton.</hi>] And if you will allow, agaynst the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prouerbe, <hi>One swallow makes not a Summer,</hi> that the errour of one be sufficient be condemne a whole Society, then the Minister <hi>Paraeus</hi> his Worke, wherein he mantaynes Deposition, and Regicide, must make all Ministers guilty, specially seing not one of them wrote agaynst <hi>Paraeus</hi> his booke, before the same was publickely burnt in <hi>London.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor was <hi>Mariana</hi> his doctrine in the behalfe of the Popes, as you ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ignorantly suppose, but of the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wealths Power agaynst Tyrants. A Doctrine which Iesuits condemne, but Protestants commonly follow. I could name twenty of their Authours, that peremptorily affirme what
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:2259:309"/>
                           <hi>Mariana</hi> did only doubtingly propose, yea much more. For do not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants teach [<hi>See the booke of Dangerous positions lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1.] <hi>That Iudges ought by the law of God so summon Princes before them, for their crimes, and to proceed agaynst them, as agaynst all other offenders: That it is lawfull to kill wicked Kings and Tyrants: That God to the people hath giuen the sword, from which no person King, Queen, Emperour is exempt: Being an Idolater he must dy the death?</hi> An hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the like Theorems of your Gospell and Gospellers, could I alleadge to stop your mouth, the opinion which <hi>Mariana</hi> did doubtfully insinuate being farre short of these horrible doctrines your Ministry doth resolutely define.</p>
                        <p>The fifth Argument. In this kingdome, <hi>the seditious and murtherous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Campian, Persons, Garnet &amp;c. remayne to this houre in bleeding memory.</hi> Answere. The memory of your cruelty towardes <hi>Fa. Campian</hi> makes Christian harts bleed, that such barbarous Inhumanity should be vsed by men that beare the name of Christians. You condemned him who was a man (to say nothing more) ciuill, mild, courteous, and completely lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Vir suauis &amp; politissimus [Cambd. Elizab. p. 209.]</hi> for meeting togeather with others to plot the Q death, vpon a day when they were a thousand miles asunder the one from the other, as it was there proued at the Barre. The Queen ashamed thereof, after his condemnation, would by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes permit his execution, but you by your importunity at last forced her to yield to the murthering of this Innocent Iesuit, as the Scribes &amp; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises wonne <hi>Pilate</hi> to deliuer vnto their bloudy pleasure our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, as your owne Historiographer doth testifye, <hi>Importunis precibus euicta permisit. [Camden. Elizab. pag.</hi> 326.] Out of this your <hi>Caluinian</hi> immense desire of innocent bloud, you neuer ceased to vent bloudy fables, and to father them vpon <hi>Father Persons,</hi> but neuer was, nor could any be proued agaynst him, nor agaynst <hi>Father Garnet,</hi> but barely the hearing in Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the barbarous attempt of others.</p>
                        <p>But suppose your Antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were true about these three Iesuits, how foolish is your Inference? Some Iesuits haue gone about murtherous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Order of the Iesuits mantayne singular opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Regall authority? If your argument be of good Consequence, then this is of necessary importance: Many Ministers haue been hanged in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> for most bloudy, and barbarous murthers, yea commonly at the Assisses euery yeare some goe to preach from the Gallowes. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Ministry holds singular opinions about the lawfulnes of murther? Can you proue that one of the Society of Iesus, spread ouer the world,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:2259:309"/>
was euer executed for any such crime by some Catholicke Prince? If you could, how would you insult?</p>
                        <p>So the vanity of your fifth Argument being apparent, let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the solidity of your last. <hi>Lastly</hi> (say you) <hi>Iesuits heere among vs at this day be prime Oppugners &amp; Disswaders of the Oath of Allegiance, &amp; it wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth them to the gall, that secular Priests propugne the lawfullnes therof.</hi> Answer. That Oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes not only Temporall Allegiance, which Iesuits are most willing to sweare, but also the Abnegation of the Catholicke Fayth, to wit, of the Authority giuen vnto Peter in the Gospell, deuolued by course to his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour. What you say, that Iesuits herein be singular, that secular Priests propugne the lawfullnes of this Oath; their writings, their deeds, their deaths testify the contrary. Which slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der they would not let passe with silence, did they not know your word to be of no credit: yea by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of your Brother, they be well assured, that the venting of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent falshoods comes to you by kind.</p>

                        <p>IN your third Assault, you vndertake to sift &amp; winnow, (as the Diuell doth Gods Elect) these wordes of the Iesuit, <hi>I disclayme from enlarging the Popes power ouer the Temporalityes of Princes by any singular opinion of mine, or more then the definitions of Councells, and consent of Deuines doth force mee to hold.</hi> Thus you pleade agaynst him <hi>pag.</hi> 174. <hi>Marke heere, You that shall reade this; A sly Foxe that would seeme a sheepe, and yet his tayle bewrayes him, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>But euen <hi>Popish Synods</hi> (say you) <hi>are not farre to seeke which haue exalted the Popes Temporall Soueraignty, as farre ouer Princes, as Heauen is aboue Earth?</hi> How proue you this?

Where I might say with <hi>S. Augustine, O stultitia hominis cogitare se dictorem, &amp; neminem contradictorem</hi>! O the folly of a man, to say what he will, neuer thinking he shall be gaynsayd, and heare what he would not.

                        <p>But the King hath had long experience, that at least the Protestants of England will not lift vp their heads agaynst the Lords Annoynted vpon any occasion whatsoeuer.

That Iesuits more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other Romists are obliged by speciall Vow to mantayne Papall dignity.</hi> And pag. 579. <hi>If his Holynes send another wind, you which haue Vowed strict Obedience vnto the Pope, must turne your sayles, your Votes and Prayers must be bound to execute the Popes pleasure</hi> (in killing the King.) And agayne pag. 577. <hi>What safety and security can Princes inioy by relying vpon such seruants, which stand Centinell vpon an houres warning, to follow their greater Maister? If your Maisters hand cast Crosse insteed of Pile, what shall we expect from such Gamesters,</hi> Quibus Ludus sunt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pita &amp; Diademata Regum?</p>
                        <p>This is your Cauill, vttered with all possible gall, which yet is clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the words in your margent out of the Bull of Confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Institute of the Iesuits by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third.

                        </p>
                        <p>These be the words, contayning the matter of the Iesuits speciall Vow. By which it appeareth, that their Vow is not to <hi>enlarge Papal power,</hi> but <hi>to propagate the Christian Name,</hi> to find out, not new opinions to put men vnder the Pope, but new Nations, neuer heard of before, to exalt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Heauen, by teaching them the sauing Truth. Nor are Iesuits bound by this Vow to obey the Pope absolutely in all things, but in things <hi>that are according to their Institute,</hi> which is to follow (as neere as by diuine grace they may) the life of Iesus. If the Pope command them, they must obey in thinges that pertayne vnto the <hi>Saluation of soules,</hi> not in thinges which belonge vnto the destruction of bodyes. If the Pope bid, they be bound to go begging in Apostolicall manner, not fighting in military sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to carry the Crosse, not to brandish the sword; to sound the Gospell of peace, not the Trumpet of Warre; to giue in the defence of truth their owne Bloud, not to shed the bloud of others; to help men vnto eternall Crownes, not to take temporall Crownes from any.</p>
                        <p>Hence you may see, Iesuits stand indeed Centinell at an houres war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to be sent vnto Iewes, Turkes, Infidells, Indians, Caniballs, to preach the Gospel, and in preaching thereof to expose their liues to dayly dangers of death, destitute of all comfort that the world can affoard. In execution whereof they haue by their labours brought to the knowledge of blisfull life, and to the hope of euerlasting Crownes, many Princes &amp; Kingdoms in the <hi>Indyes</hi>: whereas your Gospell the meane while did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but tumultuate, rayse seditions, murther, and put Kings from their Thrones in Europe. In so much as Beza (<hi>Epist. Theol.</hi> 63.) sayth; <hi>What Churches should we now haue, had we not erected them by force of armes, agaynst the will of Kings?</hi> Whence it is cleere, that the Iesuits Vow to be ready at an houres warning to goe vnto any Country of Infidels to preach the Gospell, is not against the safety and security of Kings.</p>
                        <p>If some Ministers in England, could so eloyne themselues from all affections of this life, as to bind themselues by Vow vnto their Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to be ready at an houres warning, to goe when he sends them without tergiuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or excuse, to preach the Gospell, whether to Iewes,

                  <p>Although I be confident, that examining Religion by the meere rigour of onely Scripture, the Catholicke Doctrines would get the victorie, more cleere and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse testimonies standing on our side, then any that Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts can bring for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, <note n="(*)" place="margin">This is further made cleere by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder,</hi> so that it is but the face of a Minister to say in this place <hi>That our relying on Scripture is Vanitas vanitatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
                     </note> as by the former discourse may appeare: Although also, I be much more confident in the tradition and perpetual practise of the Church interpreting Scripture, which by so full co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent deliuers the Roman Doctrine, that partialitie it selfe duely pondering the weight of thinges, can hardly in hart, and inwardly iudge against them; yet my chiefest hope is in these Charitable thoughtes, and desires of peace and vnitie in the whole Christian world, which the holy Ghost hath inspired into your Brest.</p>
                  <p>For suppose, that Preconceipts instilled into tender myndes agaynst the faith of Auncestours, might so farre preuaile, as to make them thinke (comparing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes with Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts) that Scriptures stand equally

on both sides, yea (sifting the matter by Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that Protestants may seeme to haue the vpper hand, yet Charitie will moue this question, Whether the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies and arguments they bring from Scripture, are so vndeniably cleere, and so vnauoydably strong, that no answere or euasion may be found, but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note n="(*)" place="margin">The Minister sayth we giue see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and appering solutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but this is done by Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. I aske who shall be Iudge? Or how can this by tryed by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</note> Church must be refused, notwithstandinge so much discord and dissention, so much inconstancy &amp; incertainty about religion, which (as reason proueth) must, and (as experience sheweth) doth thereupon ensue.</p>
                  <p>For, if you cast away the Roman Church and her authority, noe Church is left in the world, that can with reason, or dares for shame challenge to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in her definitions; &amp; if such a Church be wanting, what meanes is left either to keepe the learned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in peace, or to giue vnto the ignorant assurance what is the Doctrine of Saluation the Apostles first preached?</p>
                  <p>A Church fallible in her teaching, is by the learned to be trusted noe further, then they do see her Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes consonant vnto Scripture, and so they may neglect her Iudgment when they seeme to haue euidences of Scripture against her. And if this libertie of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be granted, what hope of Vnity remaines, when a priuate man may wrangle eternally with the whole Church, &amp; neuer be conuinced apparantly of teaching against the Scriptures? Whereof we haue to many day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examples.</p>
                  <p>If we take out of the world a Church infallible, whence shall ignorant men learne which is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of saluation that the Apostles deliuered? It is as euident, as the Sunne shyning at noone Day, and the

                  </p>
                  <p>If there be no Church in the world besides the the Roman, that can with any colour pretend Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Iudgement: If the most part of men cannot by their examining of Controuersies be resolued in faith, and therfore must perish eternally, except they finde a Church that is an infallible mistresse of truth, in whose Iudgment they may securely rest; Certainly those that haue bowells of Charity, will accept of any probable answere vnto Protestants obiections and accusations, rather then discredit the authority of so necessary a Church, which being discredited no Church remaines in the world of credit, sufficient to sustaine the waight of Christian, that is, infallible Beliefe.</p>
                  <p>What a misery will it be if it fall out (as it is most likely it will fall out) that at the Day of Iudgement the most part of English Protestants be found to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued points of Doctrine necessary to saluation, not out of their owne certaine skill in Scripture, as they should by the principles of their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but <note n="(*)" place="margin">The Minister here ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, but dares not directly answere the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, What shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of ignorant me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who belieued the truth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the credit of their Church, &amp; not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</note> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the credit of the Church that teacheth them, which doth acknowledge her selfe no sufficient stay of assured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe?
