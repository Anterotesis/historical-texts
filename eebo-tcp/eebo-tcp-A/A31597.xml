            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HENRY the Third of that Name, (a man more pious then prudent; a better man then King) ſwayed the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Kingdome 56. yeares. The former part of his Reigne was very calme, the latter as tempeſtuous.</p>
            <p>The main tempeſt was thus raiſed. The King for many years, during that high calme, had ſequeſtred himſelfe wholly to his harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſports and recreations, and intruſted the whole managery of the <hi>State</hi> to his officers and miniſters. Theſe taking advantage of his Majeſties careleſſeneſſe (the maine fault of this King) inſenſibly ſuck't and drayned the revenues of Crowne and Kingdome; till the King awakened by extreame neceſſitie, began to enquire, not how he came in (for his neceſſities would not permit that) but how he might get out.</p>
            <p>The beſt way that his evill Counſellors could find to releeve their Maſter, and ſave themſelves, was (the ordinary way of ſupply in Parliament declined) to have recourſe to Monopolies, Patents, and other extraordinary and illegall Taxations. But (praeter-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall courſes are never long-lived) the free-borne <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not long endure ſuch ſlavery.</p>
            <p>When the King ſaw there was no other remedy, hee throwes himſelfe into the boſome of his people for reliefe, and adviſe in

            <p>Here the warre grew hot, each ſide fortifying towns and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, plundering and driving all round about to ſtore the garriſons: Mens houſes (which were wont to be their own caſtles) were now made caſtles, but the owners were leaſt Maſters; all left to the mercy of the rude ſouldier, the poor Countrymans dwelling houſe pillaged every where and ſearcht, <note n="*" place="margin">Riſhanger.</note>

ſuch extraordinary lightening, thunder, and thicke darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that it ſtruck a generall horrour and amazement into the hearts of the Rebels, as if the King of Kings would now at laſt viſibly revenge the Kings quarrell, or as if they had ſeen Gods immediate hand againſt them, as once againſt <hi>Corah,</hi> and the 250.

            <p>The Earles Corps was ſtrangely (though not undeſervedly) handled by the people, who were ſo inraged againſt him, the chief actour and authour of their ſo much miſchiefe and miſery, that (in deſpight of him) they lopt off his head, hands, feet, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie members, and ſent them (in ſcorn) for tokens to ſeverall places; his body was buried in <hi>Eveſham</hi> Church.

            <p>Afterward the King marcht with a great power to <hi>Windeſore.</hi> reſolving (as the fame then went) to deſtroy the whole City of <hi>London:</hi> Many of the Rabble and wild Commoners (ſaith <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>) were as reſolved to defend the City againſt him: but the wiſer ſort thought better to become humble petitioners for their pardon of what was paſt, then to incenſe his Majeſtie any farther; and to that end, drew up an humble Petition, and preſented it to the King: but their late rebellious carriage had ſo farre provoked his Majeſties patience, that he would not ſo much as admit of their Petition, or hearken to any that endeavoured to mediate for them.</p>
            <p>Hereupon they were adviſed to draw up an Inſtrument or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whereby they ſhould yeeld themſelves wholy, both bodies and goods to the Kings mercie, which was done accordingly, and ſealed with the Common Seale of the Citie.</p>

but (contrary to their expectation, though not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts) were all delivered into the cuſtody of the Conſtable of <hi>Windeſore</hi> Caſtle, and ſhut up there in a large Tower, where they had ſmall cheere, and worſe lodging.

            <p>For the Government of this unruly City, the King appointed one <hi>Othon</hi> a forreiner, or ſtranger, firſt Conſtable of the Tower, and then <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> or Warden of the Citie, to pull downe their haughty rebellious ſpirits, and that his Peace for the future might be ſurely kept, he required the beſt mens ſonnes in the City for Hoſtages.

            <p>Daily ſuit was made unto his Majeſtie for his Pardon and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but in vaine: then they petition the King to know his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pleaſure, what Fine he would demand of the whole City, for their offences againſt him.

At length, after much ſuit and ſubmiſſion, and a fine of twenty thouſand Marks, the King received them to mercy, and ſent them under his great Seale a generall Pardon (thoſe onely excepted, whoſe eſtates were already beſtowed) granting and allowing that their former Charter, and ancient Priviledges ſhould be reſtored unto them, <hi>notwithſtanding all the tranſgreſſions</hi> (they are the words of the Pardon) <hi>and treſpaſſes done to Vs, to our Queene, to our noble brother,</hi> Richard <hi>King of</hi> Almaine <hi>and the Prince, our firſt begotten ſonne.</hi>

their foule Rebellion againſt their Soveraigne was not more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, then their humble ſubmiſſion to their Soveraigne was commendable.</hi> And therefore in the Ordinance, called <hi>Dictum de Kenelworth,</hi> made for the ſetling of the Kingdome, we find them (notwithſtanding, all their diſloyalty) commended, as ſhall be ſeen in the enſuing Story.</p>
            <p>After the proud ſtomach of this City was brought down, and all tumultuous ſpirits quelled, the King calls his Parliament (<hi>in feſto Sancti Edvardi Regis</hi>) to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein thoſe that aided and aſſiſted the Earle were all (excepting the <hi>Londoners)</hi> attainted, and that all their Lands and goods were forfeited.</p>
            <p>But this Sentence (though it was leſſe then they deſerved) yet was more then they would endure, and therefore the fire (that was not yet quencht, but ſmothered) breakes forth againe.

               <note place="margin">The Barons of Cinque Ports ſeeing the King pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſper, made their peace with the King.</note>About two Months after the publication of this Ordinance, <hi>viz.</hi> upon Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> Eve, the Caſtle was delivered up, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions (too good for thoſe that had ſo barbarouſly uſed the Kings Meſſenger, contemned the King, and impoveriſhed the countrey) to march away with their goods, and to undergoe no fine for taking up Armes.</p>
            <p>This Caſtle had the King beſtowed upon the Earle of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> in franke marriage with his ſiſter <hi>Elionor</hi>; but when the Earle by his Rebellon had forfeited, and the King had now won it, he gave it to his own Sonne, <hi>Edmund</hi> Earle of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who by this time had reduced the Iſle of <hi>Axholme,</hi> and all thoſe rude igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, that flockt thither, pillaging and plundering the Kings friends round about.</p>
            <p>The Prince alſo met with <hi>Adam Gurdon,</hi> a famous ſturdy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, that lay lurking in <hi>Aulton</hi> Wood in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> robbing and ſpoyling the adjacent parts, <hi>Pracipuè terras corum qui parti Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae adhaerebant</hi>;<note place="margin">Riſhanger.</note> the Prince upon his approach, hearing of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſent him a Challenge for a ſingle Combate. <hi>Gurdon</hi> accepts it, and performed it ſo gallantly, that the Prince aſſured him of his life and eſtate, if he would ſubmit: which he did, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into great favour with the Prince; but divers of his men were there executed.</p>
            <p>But now the Iſle of <hi>Ely</hi> was ſtrongly fortified by a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude got together, that refuſed to ſubmit to the Ordinance of <hi>Kenelworth.</hi> Upon the naturall ſtrength of this Iſle, and the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all proviſion therein, ſeditious Rebels have often preſumed, and from hence have moleſted more Kings then one, as they did now the neighbouring Counties, robbing, and pillaging <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> plundering the City of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and carrying away the richeſt Citizens, made them redeem themſelves: at length a meſſage was ſent unto them, requiring them to ſubmit to the Ordinance of <hi>Killingworth,</hi> to leave off robbing their fellow ſubjects, and to return to their alleigeance: Hereto they return this inſolent anſwer, that <hi>they had taken up arms to defend the good of Church and State, and therefore ought to be reſtored to their lands without paying any fine.</hi> In briefe they require hoſtages into the Iſland, and that they might hold it five yeers peaceably, till they ſaw how the King would performe

his promiſes, (perfidious ſubjects ever ſuſpect their Princes fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) which high inſolency of theirs (unheard of till our times) ſo exaſperates the King, that he reſolves to try the utmoſt to reduce them to their obedience; for that purpoſe marches with a mighty Armie againſt them, the Prince alſo joyns with a conſiderable power; after many aſſaults, at length (after they had held it above two yeers) by the helpe of new made bridges and boates, they ſtormed it on every ſide that they were forced to yeeld.</p>
            <p>And now men thought that the fire was quite out.

            <p>The King by a ſpeedy march came to the place at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; but they inſtead of meeting his Majeſty, ran about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in a tumultuous manner.

            <p>Then the King removed his campe to the other ſide of the City, and had his head-quarters at <hi>Straiſord,</hi> three miles off the Citie, the reſt of his Army lay at <hi>Ham,</hi> a village hard by. The wiſer Citizens foreſeeing the danger that hung over them, deſired a treaty with the King, wherunto (though they were moſt unworthy of ſo much clemency) His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to condeſcend, and upon theſe eaſie termes they were vain received to mercy.</p>

            <p>And now after this furious dreadfull Tempeſt, after ſo many ſtorms and ſhowers of blood, began a joyful long-expected Calm, which that they might enjoy without any intervening of more ſtormes, and for the better ſetling and quieting the Kingdome, the King gives expreſſe command for the razing of divers in-land Caſtles; as <hi>Farnham, &amp;c.</hi> That ſo if another Rebellion ſhould be begotten, it might no where find a Nurſe, and then it could not be long lived.</p>

               <p>OUt of this briefe Narration may be extracted ſomewhat for KING and <hi>Commons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the KING.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for preventing Seditions and Rebellions; then for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Kingdome after the Rebellion ſuppreſt.</p>
               <p>For the firſt; That he beware how hee entruſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Kingdome to others. How he ſuffer His Favourites, and great Officers of State, to ſuck him into neceſſities, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall Him by indigency, and be thereby drawne, by extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry illegall Impoſitions and Taxes, to vexe and alienate the hearts and affections of His Subjects, and then (as he muſt) be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to flie to them for reliefe and counſell in Parliament; where (he may then be ſure) he muſt be Subject to his Subjects, and they will be kings over their King: where Hee muſt be content to be leſſe then he ſhould be, and the Subject will be more: where (he may be ſure) they will make advantage of his neceſſity, and Hee muſt undergoe many hard cenſures, and be vexed with undutifull demands, before they will relieve him. But whether they part with their money or not, let the King take heed of ever parting with his Power.</p>
               <p>Then after the heat and heart of a Rebellion be broken, not to be ſevere againſt any, leſt the reſt grow deſperate. Severity may blow up, never blow out the flames of Rebellion.</p>
               <p>Yet to ſhew ſome acts of Juſtice and power as well as grace and mercy; not to uſe the extremity of Juſtice, leaſt he thereby renew the preſent rebellion; yet to ſhew ſome Juſtice to prevent a future.</p>
               <p>By a ſweet mixture of mercy and juſtice, the King ſhall at once both humble and oblige his delinquent Subjects. By mercy, in not taking the rigour of the Law; by Juſtice, in taking a part of the Law: by this, he ſhall humble them in taking ſo much; by that,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104271:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he ſhall oblige them in taking no more.</p>
               <p>Next, to take ſpeciall care in rewarding and cheriſhing, and countenancing, and remembring (before others) all thoſe that ſtuck cloſe unto him, that by their perſons, or their purſes, ſhewed themſelves really for him, and, without all fallacie, loyall.</p>
               <p>After this, to prepare ſpeedily for ſome Forraigne Expedition, wherein to imploy all the late Active Spirits, and working heads, who will quickly make worke againe at home, if they have not worke abroad.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to place ſome one (as a Scavenger) in every County, to carry away the dreggs that are left behinde. Such as will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond. Sea, cannot work, and are aſhamed to begg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the People this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that they ſuffer not themſelves to be abuſed and miſ-led into diſloyalty, by any ambitious, unquiet, cunning Spirits, upon what pretences ſoever, &amp; when Liberty, Religion, or any publique good is pretended, then moſt of all to ſuſpect their private ends.</p>
               <p>Next, that the people never get by this courſe, but often looſe their former ancient Liberties and Priviledges, according to that obſervable (though not obſerved) <hi>Maxime,</hi> EVERY REBELLION SUPPREST MAKES THE KING MORE KING, AND THE SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECT MORE SUBJECT.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that taking Armes without Soveraigne Authority, upon what pretences ſoever (be they never ſo faire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for Religion, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; never ſo fooliſh, as that it is not againſt the King, but for the King) is moſt abominable in the eyes of God, and though it ſeem to proſper for a time, yet moſt ſurely and ſeverely is it puniſhed in the end, ending commonly in a generall impoveriſhment (if not in the end) of the people, and ſome dreadfull Judgment upon the Contrivers.</p>
