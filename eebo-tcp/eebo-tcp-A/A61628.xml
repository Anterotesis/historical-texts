            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE design of this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> is only to give thee an Account of the occasion of publishing both parts of the following <hi>Book:</hi> The first contains in it several <hi>Sermons,</hi> Two whereof were made publick before, which the Stationer intending to re-print, I was not unwilling upon his
<pb facs="tcp:62152:3"/>
desire, that some others should be joyned with them. The substance of those I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, either respects the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Doctrine of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> in general; or that part of it which relates to the <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> for us. The former I look upon as our great concernment in this <hi>Age,</hi> viz. to vindicate our <hi>Religion</hi> not only from the Assaults of <hi>Atheists,</hi> but of another sort of men who acknowledge a <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> but have very mean thoughts of the <hi>Christian Religion:</hi> Against whom three <hi>Sermons</hi> are especially designed, wherein I have endeavoured
<pb facs="tcp:62152:3"/>
to prove, that the three grand <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Wisdom, Power,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> are as clearly discover'd in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance and management of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> as in the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> The latter concerning the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a <hi>Sermon</hi> preached in this <hi>City</hi> upon a Solemn Occasion most suitable to the subject. The matter whereof, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the <hi>Reason of Christs Suffering for us,</hi> having met with some opposition from a busie promoter of the contrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and that debate being with some heat of late broken
<pb facs="tcp:62152:4"/>
forth among us (not without unworthy reflections on the present <hi>Rulers</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> as giving too much <hi>Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> to it) I thought my self obliged, so just an occasion being given, to vindicate the <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>Controversie.</hi> In the management of which I have passed by the slighter Attempts of some meaner though later <hi>Adversaries;</hi> but I have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully considered, the utmost strength which hath been given to that <hi>Cause</hi> by the great <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> for it, I mean <hi>Crellius</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:62152:4"/>
his famous <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>Grotius.</hi> Had I intended this at first, as a full <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>Grotius</hi> against him, it must have appeared in another <hi>Language,</hi> and would have taken up more time, than I can at present allow. But as it is, I hope it may be usefull at this time to those of our own Nation, who dispute fiercely in this <hi>Controversie,</hi> without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it clearly on either side.</p>
                  <p>It may be some will be dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that I give our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi> no harder names; but I never found any men convinced by ill <hi>Language;</hi> and those we have to deal with, are too subtle not to distinguish between <hi>loud
<pb facs="tcp:62152:5"/>
clamours,</hi> and <hi>demonstrations.</hi> I leave that method of confuting them to those who have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Abilities</hi> in that way. It is enough for me to prove they are mistaken, others may call them what they please for being so. But I think it very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous for us, while we mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>meekness</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in his <hi>Sufferings</hi> to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our <hi>passion</hi> in disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that there are two persons in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> who have written some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wherein they would think me to be more concerned, than as yet I can think my self. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb facs="tcp:62152:5"/>
I had more leasure than meerly to <hi>kill Flies,</hi> viz. to run after them to make <hi>sport</hi> with them. When a just <hi>Answer</hi> shall be given me, (which I have been long threatned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) I may then probably to give weight, throw in the small grains scattered in many leaves, which may deserve any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. But for those who think that these need a present <hi>Answer,</hi> they discover the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their judgements too much for me ever to hope to do good upon them: And if I have any store of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition</hi> left, as it is hard to want it in such a <hi>Cause,</hi> I am
<pb facs="tcp:62152:6"/>
very loth to spend it upon <hi>Wooll-sacks.</hi>

In what sense <hi>Crellius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the sins of men, to have been the impulsive cause of the death of Christ. The

sufferings of Christ proved to be a punishment, from Scripture. The importance of the phrase of bearing sins. Of the Scape-Goats bearing the sins of the people into the Wilderness. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his sense of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. vindicated against <hi>Crellius</hi> and himself. <gap reason="foreign">

The Argument from <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 17. answered. <hi>Grotius</hi> constant to himself in his notes on that place. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5, 6, 7. cleared. Whether Christs death be a proper <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, and whether that doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that it was <hi>a</hi> punishment of sin? How far the punishments of Children for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faults, are exemplary among men. The distinction of calamities and punishments, holds not here. That Gods hatred of sin could not be seen in the sufferings of Christ, unless they were a punishment of sin, proved against <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius. Grotius</hi> his Arguments from Christ being made sin and a curse for us, defended. The liberty our Adversaries take in changing the sense of words. The particles <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>CHAP.</hi> III. The words of Scripture being at last ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by our Adversaries to make for us, the only pretence remaining is, that our Doctrine is repugnant to reason. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate managed upon point of reason. The grand difficulty enquired into, and manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Adversaries concessions, not to lye in the greatness of Christs sufferings, or that our sins were the impulsive cause of them, or that it is impossible that one should be punished for anothers faults: or in all cases unjust: the cases wherein <hi>Crellius</hi> allows it, instanced. From whence it is proved that he yields the main cause. The Arguments propounded, whereby he attempts to prove it unjust for Christ to be punished for our sins. <hi>Crellius</hi> his principles of the justice of punishments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. Of the relation between desert and, punishment. That a person by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent may be punished beyond the desert of his own actions. An answer to <hi>Crellius</hi> his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. What it is to suffer undeservedly. <hi>Crellius</hi> his mistake in the state of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. The instances of Scripture considered.
<pb facs="tcp:62152:9"/>
In what sense Children are punished for their Parents sins. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 20. explained at large. Whether the guilty being freed by the sufferings of an innocent person makes that punishment unjust or no? <hi>Crellins</hi> his shifts and evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this matter discovered. Why among men the offenders are not freed in criminal matters, though the sureties be punished. The release of the party depends on the terms of the Sureties suffering, therefore delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance not <hi>ipso facto.</hi> No necessity of such a translation in criminal, as is in pecuniary matters. <hi>p.</hi> 378</item>

The Promises made to the Jews under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected them as a People, and therefore must be temporal. The typical nature of Sacrifices asserted.

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The notion of a sacrifice belongs to the death of Christ, because of the Oblation made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to God. <hi>Crellius</hi> his sense of Christs Oblation proposed. Against him it is proved, that the Priestly Office of Christ had a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary respect to God, and not to us. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifices did divert the wrath of God. Christ not a bare Metaphorical High-Priest. <hi>Crellius</hi> destroys the Priesthood of Christ, by confounding it with the exercise of his Regal power. No proper Expiation of sin belongs to Christ in Heaven, if <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his Doctrine be true. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. proves the death of Christ an Expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and an Oblation to God. The Phrase of <hi>A sweet-smelling Savour,</hi> belongs to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifices; <hi>Crellius</hi> his gross no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. His mistakes about the kinds of Sacrifices. Burnt-offerings were Expiatory Sacrifices both before and under the Law. A new distribution of Sacrifices proposed.

                           </gap> Christs Priesthood did not begin from his entrance into Heaven. The mactation in Expiatory Sacrifices, no bare preparation to a sacrifice, proved by the Jewish Laws, and the Customs of other Nations. Whether Christs Oblation of himself once to God, were in Heaven or on Earth? Of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of Oblations under the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law. Several things observed from thence to our purpose. All things necessary to a Legal Oblation, concur in the death of Christ. His entrance into Heaven hath no correspondency with it; if the blood of Christ were no Sacrifice for sin. In Sin-offerings for the People, the whole was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed; no eating of the Sacrifices allowed the Priests, but in those for private Persons. Christs exercise of Power in Heaven, in no sense an Oblation to God. <hi>Crellius,</hi> his sense repugnant to the circumstances of the places in dispute. Objections answered. <hi>p.</hi> 450</item>

                  <p>And what then can we propose to our selves as arguments of <hi>Gods</hi> severe displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against us, which we have not either already felt, or have just cause to fear are coming upon us without a speedy and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere amendment?

not) we shall all surely think we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son enough this day to lay to heart <hi>the evil of our doings which have brought all these things upon us, and abhor our selves, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in dust and ashes.</hi> That would seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to bear some analogy with the present ruines of the City, and the calamities we lie under at this time; but <hi>God</hi> will more easily dispense with the pompous shews, and solemn garbs of our humiliation; if our hearts bleed within for our former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, and our repentance discovers its sincerity, by bringing us to that temper; that, <hi>though we have done iniquity, we will do so no more.</hi> That is the true and proper end, which <hi>Almighty God</hi> aims at, in all his Judgements: he takes no delight in hurl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World into confusions, and turning Cities into ruinous heaps, and making whole Countreys a desolation: but when he sees it necessary to vindicate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Justice to the World, he doth it with that <hi>severity</hi> that may make us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his displeasure, and yet with that <hi>mercy</hi> which may incourage us to repent and <hi>return unto the Lord.</hi> Thus we finde in the instances recorded in the Text, when some <hi>Cities</hi> were <hi>consumed by him;</hi> so that as far as concerned them, they were made <hi>like to Sodom and Gomorrah:</hi> yet he doth

it with that kindness to the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> that <hi>they are pluckt as firebrands out of the burning:</hi> and therefore he looks upon it as a frustrating the design both of his <hi>Justice,</hi> and of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> when he is fain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with that sad reflection on their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibleness; <hi>Yet have ye not returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me saith the Lord.</hi> Thus ye sec what the design and scope of the words is, which I have read unto you, wherein we may consider,</p>

say of the two former parts of the Text, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth in another case, <hi>This day hath this Scripture been fulfilled among you:</hi> we have seen a sad instance of <hi>Gods seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, a City</hi> almost wholly <hi>consumed</hi> as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and a great expression of his kindness, <hi>the Inhabitants saved, as firebrands pluckt out of the burning:</hi> O let it never be said that the last part of the words is fulfilled too, <hi>Yet have ye not returned unto me, &amp;c.</hi> which, that it may not be, I shall first consider <hi>the severity of God in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> this day, and then discover <hi>the mixture of his kindness with it,</hi> and the result of both will be the <hi>unreasonableness of obstinate diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> after them.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The severity of the Judgement</hi> here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: which, though we take it not in reference to the persons of men, but to the Cities wherein they dwelt: as it seems to be understood not only by the <hi>Original,</hi> wherein the words relating to persons are left out: but by the following clause, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing their preservation: yet we shall finde the Judgement to be severe enough, in regard 1. Of the <hi>nature and kind</hi> of it. 2. The <hi>series and order</hi> of it. 3. The <hi>causes</hi> moving to it. 4. The <hi>Author</hi> of it. <hi>I have overthrown some of you, as God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw, &amp;c.</hi>

1. <hi>The nature and kind of it:</hi> We can imagine nothing more severe when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it is set forth by, the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld Judgement we read of, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah</hi> by a fire from Heaven. Although in all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the instance might not come up to the parallel, yet in several respects there might be so sad a desolation, that any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample but that might fall beneath the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and severity of it. And we may better understand of how sad and dreadfull a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture such a Judgement must be, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it with relation to the <hi>suddenness and unexpectedness</hi> of it, to the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> of it, and to all that <hi>sad train of circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> which attend and follow it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The suddenness and unexpectedness</hi> of it; <hi>as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, i. e.</hi> when they least of all looked for such a desolation. For <hi>thus it was in the dayes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 17. 28, 29.</note> 
                     <hi>of</hi> Lot (as our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us) <hi>they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they builded; but the same day that</hi> Lot <hi>went out of</hi> Sodom, <hi>it rained fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone from Heaven, and destroyed them all.</hi> They were all immersed either in their pleasures or in their business, they little thought of destruction being so near them as it proved to be; Thus it was with the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62152:17"/>
                     <hi>Jews</hi> in their first and latter destruction both of their City and Countrey, they were as high and as confident of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as might be to the very last; nothing could perswade them that their Temple or <note place="margin">Hv <gap reason="foreign">

Thus <hi>Josephus</hi> observes of his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>that in the midst of all their miseries they had no kind of sense at all of their sins, but were as proud, presumptuous and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, as if all things went well with them; and were like to do so.</hi> They thought God could not possibly punish such a people as they were in such a manner; they could easily have believed it of any other people but themselves: but that <hi>God</hi> should punish his own people in <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, that Judgement should begin at the house of <hi>God,</hi> that they who had loved to be called by his Name, should be made examples to all other Nations; this seemed so harsh and incredible that by no means could they entertain it. But <hi>God</hi> and Wise men too thought otherwise of them than they did of themselves: they could not but see an outward shew of Religion joyned with a deep and subtil hypocrisie; there being among them an heap of pride and luxury, of fraud and injustice, of sedition and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62152:18"/>
faction gilded over with a fair shew of greater zeal for <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Glory:</hi> which that impartial Historian (as one who knew them well) hath described at large: and although they could not believe that such heavy Judgements should befall them, yet others did not only <hi>believe,</hi> but <hi>tremble</hi> at the apprehensions of them.</p>
                  <p>Who among all the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> could have been perswaded, but the day before the <hi>Fire</hi> brake out, nay when they saw the <hi>Flames</hi> for near a day together, that ever in four dayes time, not a fourth part of the City should be left standing? For when were they ever more secure and inapprehensive of their danger than at this time? they had not been long return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Houses, which the <hi>Plague</hi> had driven them from, and now they hoped to make some amends for the loss of their Trade before; but they returned home with the same sins they carried away with them; like new <hi>Moons,</hi> they had a new face and appearance, but the same <hi>spots</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained still: or it may be, increased by that <hi>scumm</hi> they had gathered in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys where they had been. Like Beasts of prey that had been chained up so long till they were hunger-bitten, when they once got loose they ran with that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62152:18"/>
and greediness, to their wayes of gain, as though nothing could ever satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them. But that which betrayed them to so much security, was their late delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from so sweeping a Judgement as the <hi>Plague</hi> had been to the City and Suburbs of it: they could by no means think, when they had all so lately escaped the <hi>Grave,</hi> that the City it self should be so near being buried in its own ruines; that the <hi>Fire</hi> which had missed their blood, should seize upon their houses; that there should be no other way to purge the infected air, but by the <hi>Flames</hi> of the whole City. Thus when the Mariners have newly escaped a wreck at Sea, the fears of which have a long time deprived them of their wonted rest, they think they may securely lye down and sleep, till it may be another storm overtake and sink them. We see then there is neither piety nor wisdom in so much security when a great danger is over, for we know not but that very security it self may provoke <hi>God</hi> to send a greater. And no kind of Judgements are so dreadful and amazing, as those which come most unexpectedly upon men; for these betray the succours which reason offers, they infatuate mens councils, weaken their courage, and deprive them of that presence of mind which is necessary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62152:19"/>
at such a time for their own and the publick interest. And there needs no more to let us know how severe such a Judgement must be, when it comes upon men in so sudden and unexpected a manner; but that is not all, for the severity of it lyes further,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In the force and violence of it:</hi> and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that was very great which consumed four Cities to nothing in so short a time, when <hi>God</hi> did <hi>pluere Gehennam de coelo</hi> as one expresses it, rained down <hi>hell-fire upon</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah. And this is that which some think is called <hi>the vengeance of eternal fire, which all those in</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jude 7.</note> Gomorrah <hi>are said to suffer;</hi> i. e. <hi>a Fire</hi> which consumed, till there was nothing left to be consumed by it. Not but that those wicked persons did justly suffer the <hi>vengeance of an eternal fire</hi> in another life, but the <hi>Apostle</hi> seems to set out and paint forth to us that in the life to come, by the force and violence of that <hi>fire</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed those Cities; and it would be harsh to say, that all who were involved in that common calamity (who yet were innocent as to the great abominations of those places, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Infants</hi> there destroyed) must be immediately sentenced to eternal misery.

How great must we conceive the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62152:20"/>
force of this Fire to have been, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at first gotten a head where there was little means of resisting it, and much fuel to increase it; from thence it spread it self both with and against the wind; till it had gained so considerable a force, that it despised all the resistance could be made by the strength of the buildings which stood in its way; and when it had once subdued the strongest and the tallest of them, it then roared like the waves of the Sea, and made its way through all the lesser obstacles, and might have gone on so far, till it had laid this <hi>City</hi> level with the ruines of the other, had not he who sets the bounds to the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and saith, <hi>thus far shalt thou go and no farther,</hi> put a stop to it in those places which were as ready to have yielded up themselves to the rage of it, as any which had been consumed before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The severity of it will yet more appear from all <hi>the dreadful circumstances which attend and follow it.</hi> Could you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your selves in the midst of those Cities which were consumed by <hi>Fire</hi> from heaven, when it had seized upon their dwellings, O what cryes and lamentations, what yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and shriekings might ye then have heard among them! We may well think how dreadful those were, when we do but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62152:21"/>
consider how sad the circumstances were of the <hi>Fire</hi> we mourn for this day. When it began like <hi>Sampson</hi> to break in pieces all the means of resisting it, and carried before it not only the <hi>Gates,</hi> but the <hi>Churches</hi> and most <hi>magnificent structures</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> what horrour and confusion may we then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine had seized upon the spirits of the <hi>Citizens;</hi> what distraction in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, what paleness in their countenances, what pantings at their hearts, what an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal consternation might have been then seen upon the minds of men? But O the sighs and tears, the frights and amazements, the miscarriages, nay the deaths of some of the weaker Sex at the terrour and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of it! O the hurry and useless pains, the alarms and tumults, the mutual hinderances of each other that were among men at the beholding the rage and fury of it! There we might have seen Women weeping for their children, for fear of their being trod down in the press, or lost in the crowd of people, or exposed to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the flames; Husbands more soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous for the safety of their Wives and Children, than their own; the Souldiers running to their Swords, when there was more need of Buckets; the Tradesmen loading their backs with that which had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62152:21"/>
gotten possession of their hearts before. Then we might have heard some complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus of themselves: O that I had been as carefull of laying up treasures in Heaven, as I have been upon Earth, I had not been under such fears of losing them as now I am! If I had served <hi>God</hi> as faithfully as I have done the world, he would never have left me as now that is like to do. What a fool have I been which have spent all my precious time for the gaining of that which may be now lost in an hours time! If these flames be so dreadful, what are those which are reserved for them who love the world more than <hi>God!</hi> If none can come near the <hi>heat</hi> of this <hi>Fire,</hi> who can dwell with <hi>everlasting burnings!</hi> O what madness then will it be to sin any more wilfully against that <hi>God</hi> who is <hi>a consuming fire,</hi> infinitely more dreadful than this can be! Farewell then all ye deceitful vanities: now I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thee and my self better, O bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing world, then to fix my happiness in thee any more. I will henceforth learn so much wisdom to lay up my treasures there where neither moths can corrupt them, nor Thieves steal them, nor Fire consume them. O how happy would <hi>London</hi> be, if this were the effect of her flames on the minds of all her inhabitants! She might then rise with a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62152:22"/>
greater glory, and her inward beauty would outshine her outward splendour, let it be as great as we can wish or imagine.</p>
                  <p>But in the mean time who can behold her present ruines, without paying some tears as due to the sadness of the spectacle, and more to the sins which caused them? If that City were able to speak out of its ruines, what sad complaints would it make of all those impieties which have made her so miserable. If it had not been (might she say) for the pride and luxury, the ease and delicacy of some of my inhabitants, the covetousness, the fraud, the injustice of others, the debaucheries of the prophane, the open factions and secret hypocrisie of too many pretending to greater sanctity, my <hi>beauty</hi> had not been thus <hi>turned into ashes,</hi> nor my glory into those ruines which make my enemies rejoyce, my friends to mourn, and all stand amazed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of them. Look now upon me, you who so lately admired the greatness of my Trade, the riches of my Merchants, the number of my people, the conveniency of my <hi>Churches,</hi> the multitude of my Streets, and see what desolations sin hath made in the earth. Look upon me, and then tell me whether it be nothing to dally with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62152:22"/>
Heaven, to make a mock at sin, to slight the judgements of <hi>God,</hi> and abuse his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and after all the attempts of Heaven to reclaim a people from their sins, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main still the same that ever they were? Was there no way to expiate your guilt but by my misery? Had the <hi>Leprosie</hi> of your sins so fretted into my Walls, that there was no cleansing them, but by the slames which consume them? Must I mourn in <hi>my dust and ashes</hi> for your iniquities, while you are so ready to return to the practice of them? Have I suffered so much by reason of <hi>them,</hi> and do you think to escape your selves? Can you then look upon my ruines with hearts as hard and unconcerned as the <hi>stones</hi> which lye in them? If you have any kindness for me, or for your selves, if you ever hope to see my breaches repaired, my beauty restored, my glory advanced, look on <hi>Londons</hi> ruines and <hi>repent.</hi> Thus would she bid her inhabitants not weep for her miseries, but for their own sins; for if <hi>never any sorrow were like to her sorrow,</hi> it is because never any sins were like to their sins. Not as though they were only the sins of the City, which have brought this evil upon her; no, but as far as the judgement reaches, so great hath the compass of the sins been, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62152:23"/>
have provoked <hi>God</hi> to make her an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his justice. And I fear the effects of <hi>Londons</hi> calamity will be felt all the Nation over. For, considering the present lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing condition of this Nation, it will be no easie matter to recover the <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>spirits</hi> which have been lost by this <hi>Fire.</hi> So that whether we consider the sadness of those circumstances which accompanied the rage of the fire, or those which respect the present miseries of the City, or the general influence those will have upon the Nation, we cannot easily conceive what judgement could in so <hi>critical</hi> a time have befallen us, which had been more severe for the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of it, than this hath been.</p>

When all this would not do, those whom they trusted most to,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62152:24"/>
betrayed them, and rebelled against them, by whose means, not only <hi>the Cities were burnt with Fire,</hi> but the whole <hi>Island</hi> was turned almost into <hi>one continued flame.</hi> The issue of all which at last was, that their <hi>Countrey</hi> was turned to a desolation, the ancient <hi>Inhabitants</hi> driven out, or destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their former servants, but now their bitter enemies, <hi>possessing</hi> their <hi>habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> May <hi>God</hi> avert the <hi>Omen</hi> from us at this day. We have smarted by <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> and the dreadful <hi>effects</hi> of them; we yet complain of <hi>great discontents</hi> and <hi>poverty</hi> as great as them, we have <hi>inveterate enemies</hi> combined abroad against us, we have very lately suffered under a <hi>Pestilence</hi> as great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as any we read of, and now the <hi>great City</hi> of our <hi>Nation burnt down by a dreadful Fire.</hi> And what do all these things mean? and what will the issue of them be? though that be lockt up in the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet we have just cause to fear, if it be not our speedy amendment, it may be our ruine. And they who think that incredible, let them tell me whether two years since, they did not think it altogether as improbable, that in the compass of the two succeeding years, above <hi>a hundred thousand persons</hi> should be destroyed by the <hi>Plague</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and other places, and the City it self
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62152:24"/>
should be burnt to the <hi>Ground?</hi> And if our <hi>fears</hi> do not, I am sure our <hi>sins</hi> may tell us, that these are but the fore-runners of greater calamities, in case there be not a timely reformation of our selves. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>God</hi> may give us some intermissions of punishments, yet at last he may, as the <hi>Roman Consul</hi> expressed it, pay us <hi>interca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latae poenae usuram,</hi> that which may make amends for all his abatements, and give us full measure according to that of our sins, <hi>pressed down, shaken together, and running over.</hi> Which leads to the third particular.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Causes moving God to so much seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in his Judgements,</hi> which are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>sins</hi> committed against him. So this <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us, that the true account of all <hi>Gods</hi> punishments is to be fetched from the <hi>sins</hi> of the <hi>people,</hi> Amos 1. 3. <hi>For three transgressions of</hi> Damascus, <hi>and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof:</hi> so it is said of <hi>Gaza, v.</hi> 6. of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> v. 9. of <hi>Edom, v.</hi> 11. of <hi>Ammon, v. 13. Moab,</hi> ch. 2. 1. <hi>Judah, v.</hi> 4. and at last <hi>Israel, v.</hi> 6. And it is observable of every one of these, that when <hi>God</hi> threatens to punish them for the <hi>greatness</hi> of their <hi>iniquities,</hi> and the <hi>multitude</hi> of their <hi>transgressions,</hi> (which is generally supposed to be meant by the <hi>three transgressions and the four)</hi> he doth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62152:25"/>
particularly threaten to send a <hi>fire</hi> among them to consume the Houses and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of their Cities. So to <hi>Damascus,</hi> chap. 1. 4. to <hi>Gaza,</hi> v. 7. to <hi>Tyrus,</hi> v. 10. to <hi>Edom,</hi> v. 12. to <hi>Ammon,</hi> v. 14. to <hi>Moab,</hi> ch. 2. v. 2. to <hi>Judah,</hi> v. 5. <hi>I will send a fire upon</hi> Judah, <hi>and it shall devour the Palaces of Jerusalem:</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> in the words of the text. This is a judgement then, which when it comes in its <hi>fury,</hi> gives us notice to how great a height our sins are risen; especially when it hath so many dreadfull fore-runners, as it had in <hi>Israel,</hi> and hath had among our selves. When the <hi>red horse</hi> hath marched furiously before it all <hi>bloody</hi> with the <hi>effects</hi> of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> and the <hi>pale horse</hi> hath followed after the other with <hi>Death</hi> upon his back, and the <hi>Grave</hi> at his heels, and after both these, those come, <hi>out of whose mouth issues fire, andsmoak, and brimstone,</hi> it is then time for the inhabitants of the earth, <hi>to repent of the work of their hands.</hi> But it is our great unhappiness, that we are apt to impute these great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities to any thing rather than to our <hi>sins;</hi> and thereby we hinder our selves from the true remedy, because we will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the cause of our distemper. Though <hi>God</hi> hath not sent <hi>Prophets</hi> among us, to tell us for such and such sins, I will send such

But there is a sort of men much more common than the other; the faculties of whose minds are so thin and aiery, that they will not bear the consideration of any thing, much less of <hi>Religion;</hi> these throw out their bitter scoffs, and prophane jests against it. A thing never permitted that I know of in

any civilized Nation in the world; whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their <hi>Religion</hi> was, the reputation of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> was always preserved sacred: <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (saith <hi>Josephus)</hi> would not suffer the <hi>Jews</hi> to speak evil of other <hi>Gods,</hi> though they were to destroy all those who tempted them to the worship of them. And shall we suffer the most excellent and reasonable <hi>Religion</hi> in the world, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Christian,</hi> to be profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the unhallowed mouths of any who will venture to be damned, to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed witty? If their enquiries were deeper, their reason stronger, or their arguments more perswasive, than of those who have made it their utmost care and business to search into these things, they ought to be allowed a fair hearing; but for men who pretend to none of these things, yet still to make Religion the object of their <hi>scoffs</hi> and <hi>raillery,</hi> doth not become the gravity of a Nation professing wisdom to permit it, much less the sobriety of a people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing <hi>Christianity.</hi> In the mean time such persons may know, that wise men may be argued out of a <hi>Religion</hi> they own, but none but <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>mad men</hi> will be <hi>droll'd</hi> out of it. Let them first try whether they can laugh men out of their Estates, before they attempt to do it out of their hopes of an Eternal happiness. And I am sure
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62152:30"/>
it will be no comfort to them in another world, that they were accounted <hi>Wits</hi> for deriding those miseries which they then feel and smart under the severity of: it will be no <hi>mitigation</hi> of their <hi>flames</hi> that they go <hi>laughing</hi> into them; nor will they endure them the better because they would not believe them. But while this is so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing a <hi>humour</hi> among the vain men of this Age and Nation, what can we expect but that <hi>God</hi> should by remarkable and severe judgements, seek to make men more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in <hi>Religion,</hi> or else make their <hi>hearts to ake,</hi> and their <hi>joynts to tremble,</hi> as he did <hi>Belshazzars,</hi> when he could find nothing else to carouse in but the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Temple.</hi> And when men said in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zephany,</hi> chap. 1. 12. <hi>that God neither</hi>

For even the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>London</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves who have suffered most in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, have cause to acknowledge the <hi>mercy</hi> of <hi>God</hi> towards them, that they are escaped themselves; though it be (as the <hi>Jews</hi> report of <hi>Joshua,</hi> the <hi>High Priest,</hi> when thrown into the fire by the <hi>Chaldaeans)</hi> with <hi>their cloaths burnt about them.</hi> Though their habitations be consumed, and their losses otherwise may be too great, yet that in the midst of so much danger by the <hi>flames,</hi> and the press of people, so very few should suffer the loss of their <hi>lives,</hi> ought to be owned by them and us as a miraculous <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> towards them. And therefore <hi>not unto us, not unto us, but to his holy Name be the praise of so great a preservation</hi> in the midst of so heavy a Judgement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The unexpectedness of such a deliverance;</hi> they are not saved by their own skill and counsel, nor by their strength and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, but by him who by his mighty hand did <hi>pluck them as firebrands out of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Though we own the <hi>justice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the calamities of this day, let us not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his <hi>mercy</hi> in what he hath unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rescued from the fury of the flames; that the <hi>Royal Palaces</hi> of our <hi>Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,</hi> the <hi>residence</hi> of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> the

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62152:34"/>
the removing of one judgement had not been as it were only to make way for the coming on of another. For the <hi>grave</hi> seemed to close up her mouth, and <hi>death</hi> by degrees to withdraw himself, that the <hi>Fire might</hi> come upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> to act its part too in the <hi>Tragoedy</hi> our sins have made among us: and I pray <hi>God</hi> this may be the last <hi>Act</hi> of it. Let us not then provoke <hi>God</hi> to finde out new methods of vengeance, and make experiments upon us of what other unheard of severities may do for our cure. But let us rather meet <hi>God</hi> now by our repentance, and returning to him, by our serious humiliation for our former sins, and our stedfast resolutions to return no more to the practice of them. That, that much more dangerous <hi>infection</hi> of our souls may be cured as well as that of our bodies, that the impure <hi>flames</hi> which burn within may be extinguished, that all our <hi>luxuries</hi> may be retrenched, our debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries punished, our vanities taken away, our careless indifferency in Religion turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a greater seriousness both in the profession and the practice of it. So will <hi>God</hi> make us a happy and prosperous, when he finds us a more righteous and holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So will <hi>God</hi> succeed all your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the honour and interest of that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62152:35"/>
people whom you represent. So may he add that other Title to the rest of those you have deserved for your Countreys good, to make you <hi>Repairers of the breaches of the City</hi> as well as of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>Restorers of paths to dwell in:</hi> So may that <hi>City</hi> which now sits solitary like a <hi>Widow,</hi> have her tears wiped off, and her beauty and comeliness restored unto her. Yea, so may her present ruines, in which she now lyes <hi>buried,</hi> be only the fore-runners of a more joyfull <hi>resurrection.</hi> In which, though the <hi>body</hi> may remain the <hi>same,</hi> the <hi>qualities</hi> may be so altered, that its present deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation may be only the putting off its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inconveniencies, weakness, and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that it may rise with greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, strength and proportion: and to all her other qualities, may that of <hi>incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> be added too, at least till the general Conflagration. And I know your great <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> will take care, that those who have suffered by the ruines, may not likewise suffer by the rising of it, that the glory of the <hi>City</hi> may not be laid upon the <hi>tears</hi> of the <hi>Orphans</hi> and <hi>Widows,</hi> but that its foundations may be setled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Justice and Piety. That there be no complaining in the Streets for want of Righteousness, nor in the City for want
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62152:35"/>
of <hi>Churches,</hi> nor in the <hi>Churches</hi> for want of a settled maintenance. That those who attend upon the service of <hi>God</hi> in them may never be tempted to betray their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to gain a livelihood, nor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the factious humours of men, that they may be able to live among them. And thus when the City through the blessing of Heaven shall be built again, may it be a Habitation of <hi>Holiness</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> towards our <hi>Gracious King</hi> and his <hi>Successors,</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> towards Men, of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> among all the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> till not Cities and Countries only, but the World and Time it self shall be no more.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN <hi>God</hi> by his infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had contrived, and by a power and goodness, as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite as his Wisdom, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the creation of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible world, there seemed to be nothing wanting to the glory of it, but a creature endued with reason and understanding, which might comprehend the design of his wisdom, enjoy the benefits of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and employ it self in the celebration of his power. The Beings purely intellectuall were too highly raised by their own order and creation, to be the <hi>Lords</hi> of this inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our world: and those whose natures could reach no higher than the objects of sense, were not capable of discovering the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perfections of the great Creator: and therefore could not be the fit <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of his praise and service. But a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62152:38"/>
conjunction of both these together was thought necessary to make up such a sort of beings, which might at once command this lower world, and be the servants of him who made it. Not as though this great fabrick of the world were meerly raised for man to please his fancy in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of it, or to exercise his dominion over the creatures designed for his use and service: but that by frequent reflections on the author of his being, and the effects of his power and goodness he might be brought to the greatest love and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him. So that the most natural part of <hi>Religion</hi> lyes in the grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we owe to that excellent and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being, who hath shewed so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar a kindness to man in the creation and Government of the world. Which was so great and unexpressible, that some have thought, it was not so much pride and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of a greater height, as envy at the felicity and power of mankind, which was the occasion of the fall of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Spirits.</hi> But whether or no the state of man were occasion enough for the envy of the <hi>Spirits</hi> above; we are sure the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Heaven was so great in it, as could not but lay an indispensable obligation on all mankind to perpetual gratitude and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62152:38"/>
obedience. For it is as easie to suppose, that affronts and injuries are the most sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table returns for the most obliging fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that the first duty of a <hi>Child</hi> should be to destroy his Parents; that to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for kindnesses received, were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the unpardonable sin; as that man should receive his being and all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which attend it from <hi>God,</hi> and not be bound to the most universal obedience to him.</p>
                  <p>And as the reflection on the author of his being, leads him to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his duty towards <hi>God,</hi> so the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the design of it, will more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily acquaint him with the nature of that duty which is expected from him. Had man been designed only to act a short part here in the world, all that had been required of him, had been only to express his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to <hi>God</hi> for his being, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of it: the using all means for the due preservation of himself; the doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beneath the dignity of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nothing injurious to those who were of the same nature with himself; but since he is designed for greater and nobler ends, and his present state, is but a state of tryal, in order to future happiness and misery; the reason of good and evil is not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62152:39"/>
to be taken meerly from his present, but from the respect, which things have to that eternal state he is designed for. From whence it follows, that the differences of good and evil are rooted in the nature of our beings, and are the necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of our relation to <hi>God,</hi> and each other, and our expectations of a future life. And therefore according to these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, the estimation of men in the world hath been while they did preserve any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for <hi>God</hi> or <hi>themselves.</hi> Wisdom and folly was not measured so much by the subtilty and curiosity of mens speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the fineness of their thoughts, or the depth of their designes, as by their endeavours to uphold the dignity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; by their piety and devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God;</hi> by their sobriety and due Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their actions; by the equality and justice, the charity and kindness of their dealings to one another. Wisdom was but another name for goodness, and folly for sin; then it was a mans glory to be religious; and to be prophane and vitious, was to be base and mean: then there were no <hi>Gods</hi> worshipped because they were bad, nor any men disgraced because they were good. Then there were no <hi>Temples</hi> erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the meanest passions of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

nor men became <hi>Idolaters</hi> to their own infirmities. Then to be betrayed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sin, was accounted weakness; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it, dishonour and baseness; to justifie and defend it, infamy and reproach; to make a mock at it, a mark of the highest folly and incorrigibleness. So the Wise man in the words of the Text assures us, that they are <hi>Fools,</hi> and those of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est rank and degree of folly, <hi>who make a mock at sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is well for us in the Age we live in, that we have the judgement of former ages to appeal to, and of those persons in them whose reputation for wisdom is yet unquestionable. For otherwise we might be born down by that spightful enemy to all vertue and goodness, the impudence of such, who it is hard to say whether they shew it more in committing sin, or in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it. Men whose manners are so bad, that scarce any thing can be imagined worse, unless it be the wit they use to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them with. Such who take the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of mans perfections downwards, and the nearer they approach to beasts, the more they think themselves to act like men. No wonder then, if among such as these the differences of good and evil be laughed at, and no sin be thought so unpardonable,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62152:40"/>
as the thinking that there is any at all. Nay the utmost they will allow in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin, is, that it is a thing that some live by declaiming against, and others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without the practice of.</p>
                  <p>But is the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Scorners</hi> at last proved the only chair of Infallibility? Must those be the standard of mankind, who seem to have little left of humane nature, but laughter and the shape of men? Do they think that we are all become such fools to take scoffs for arguments, and raillery for demonstrations? He knows nothing at all of goodness, that knows not that it is much more easie to laugh at it, than to practise it; and it were worth the while <hi>to make a mock at sin,</hi> if the doing so would make nothing of it. But the nature of things does not vary with the humours of men; sin becomes not at all the less dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous because men have so little Wit to think it so; nor <hi>Religion</hi> the less excellent and advantageous to the world, because the greatest enemies of that are so much to themselves too, that they have learnt to despise it. But although that scorns to be defended by such weapons whereby her enemies assault her, (nothing more unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the <hi>Majesty</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> than to make it self cheap, by making others laugh)
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62152:40"/>
yet if they can but obtain so much of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to attend with patience to what is serious, there may be yet a possibility of perswading them, that no <hi>fools</hi> are so great as those who laugh themselves into misery, and none so certainly do so, as those <hi>who make a mock at sin.</hi>

                  <p>But if our authority be too mean and contemptible to be relyed on, in a matter wherein they think us so much concern'd (and so I hope we are to prevent the ruine of mens souls) we dare with confidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the general sense of mankind in the matter of our present debate. Let them name but any one person in all the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of former ages, to whom but the bare suspicion of Vice was not a diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to an esteem that might otherwise have been great in the world. And if the bare suspicion would do so much among even the more rude and barbarous Nations, what would open and professed wickedness do among the more knowing and civil? Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature retains an abhorrency of sin, so far that it is impossible for men to have the same esteem of those who are given over to all manner of wickedness, though otherwise of great sharpness of wit, and of such whose natural abilities may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the other, but yet do govern their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62152:41"/>
actions according to the strict rules of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> And the general sense o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> mankind cannot be by any thing better known, than by an universal consent of men, as to the wayes whereby they express their value and esteem of others. What they all agree on as the best character of a person worthy to be loved and honoured, we may well think is the most agreeable to humane nature; and what is universally thought a disparagement to the highest accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ought to be looked on as the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and imperfection of it. Did ever any yet, though never so wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane themselves, seriously commend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person for his rudeness and debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? Was any mans lust or intemperance ever reckoned among the Titles of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Who ever yet raised <hi>Trophies</hi> to his vices, or thought to perpetuate his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the glory of them? Where was it ever known, that sobriety and temperance, justice and charity were thought the marks of reproach and infamy? Who ever suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in their reputation by being thought to be really good? Nay, it is so far from it, that the most wicked persons do inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteem them whether they will or no. By which we see, that even in this lapsed and degenerate condition of mankind, it is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62152:41"/>
only goodness which gains true honour and esteem, and nothing doth so effectually blast a growing reputation, as wickedness &amp; vice.</p>
                  <p>But if it be thus with the generality of men, who were never yet thought to have too much partiality towards goodness, we may much more easily find it among those, who have had a better ground for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their wisdom, than the meer vogue of the people. He who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the <hi>Heathen Oracle,</hi> to be the wisest among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was the person who brought down Philosophy from the obscure and uncertain speculations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in all his discourses recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Vertue as the truest wisdom.

But as there are degrees of sinning, so there are of folly in it. Some sin with a blushing countenance, and a trembling Conscience; they sin, but yet they are afraid to sin, but in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62152:42"/>
act of it they condemn themselves for what they do; they sin, but with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in their faces, with horror in their minds, and an earthquake in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences: though the condition of such persons be dangerous, and their unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shews the greatness of their folly, yet because these twitches of Conscience ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue there are some quick touches left of the sense of good and evil, their case is not desperate, nor their condition incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: But there are others who despise these as the reproach of the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,</hi> because they are not yet attained to those heights of impiety which they glory in: such who have subdued their Consciences much easier than others do their sins; who have almost worn out all the impressions of the <hi>work of the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts;</hi> who not only make a practice, but a boast of sin, and defend it with as much greediness as they commit it: these are the men, whose folly is manifest to all men but themselves; and surely, since these are the men, whom <hi>Solomon</hi> in the words of the <hi>Text</hi> describes,</p>

For as if men intended to make some recompence for the folly they betray in the acts of sin, by the wit they employ in the pleading for them, there is nothing they shew more industry and care in, than in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to baffle their own Consciences, and please themselves in their folly, till death and eternal flames awaken them. That we may not therefore seem to beg all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men for <hi>Fools,</hi> till we have heard what they have to say for themselves, we shall first examine the reasonableness of their fairest Pleas for their evil actions, before we make good the particular impeachment

Or is it as fatal for man to believe himself free when he is not so, as it is for him to act when his choice is determined? but what <hi>series</hi> of causes is there that doth so necessarily impose upon the common sense of all mankind; It seems very strange, that man should have so little sense of his own interest to be still necessitated to the worst of actions, and yet torment himself with the thoughts that he did them freely. Or is it only the <hi>freedom of action,</hi> and not of <hi>choice,</hi> that men have an experience of within themselves? But surely, however men may subtilly dispute of the difference
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62152:44"/>
between these two, no man would ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve himself to be free in what he does unless he first thought himself to be so, in what he determines? And if we suppose man to have as great a <hi>freedom of choice</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that either it is impossible for man to know when his choice is free; or if it may be known, the constant experience of all evil men in the world will testifie, that it is so now. Is it possible for the most intemperate person to believe, when the most pleasing temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to lust or gluttony are presented to him, that no consideration whatever could restrain his appetite, or keep him from the satisfaction of his bruitish incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? Will not the sudden, though groundless apprehension of poyson in the Cup, make the Drunkards heart to ake, and hand to tremble, and to let fall the supposed fatal mixture in the midst of all his jollity and excess?

their ends, through some sudden thoughts which have surprized them, almost in the very act, been diverted from their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purposes? Did ever any yet imagine that the charms of beauty and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of lust were so irresistible, that if men knew before hand they should surely dye in the embraces of an adulterous bed, they could not yet withstand the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to it? If then some considerations, which are quite of another nature from all the objects which are presented to him, may quite hinder the force and efficacy of them upon the mind of man (as we see in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> resisting the importunate Caresses of his Mistris) what reason can there be to imagine that man is a meer <hi>machine</hi> moved only as outward objects determine him? And if the considerations of present fear and danger may divert men from the practice of evil actions, shall not the far more weighty considerations of eternity have at least an equal, if not a far greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and efficacy upon mens minds, to keep them from everlasting misery? Is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal soul and the eternal happiness of it so mean a thing in our esteem and value, that we will not deny our selves those sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual pleasures for the sake of that which we would renounce for some present dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62152:47"/>
do finde (rather than make) friends enough to shelter themselves under the <hi>protection</hi> of them.

But if we either consider the nature of the command, or the promises which accompany it, or the large experience of the world to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we shall easily discover that this pretence is altogether as unreasonable as either of the foregoing. For what is it that <hi>God</hi> requires of men as the condition of their future happiness which in its own

Is it <hi>to be patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sufferings, moderate in our desires, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in our actions, contented in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi> yet these are things which those have pretended to who never owned <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and therefore surely they never thought them impossible. Is it <hi>to be charitable to the poor, compassionate to those in misery?</hi> is it <hi>to be frequent in Prayer, to love God above all things, to forgive our enemies as we hope God will forgive us, to believe the Gospel, and be ready to suffer for the sake of Christ?</hi> There
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62152:48"/>
are very few among us but will say they do all these things already, and therefore surely they do not think them impossible. The like answer I might give to all the other precepts of the <hi>Gospel</hi> till we come to the <hi>denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,</hi> and as to these too, if we charge men with them, they either deny their committing them, and then say they have kept the command; or if they confess it, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise amendment for the future; but in neither respect can they be said to think the command impossible. Thus we see their own mouths will condemn them when they charge <hi>God</hi> with laying impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>Laws</hi> on mankind. But if we enquire further then into the judgements of those (who it may be never concerned themselves so much about the precepts of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> as to try whether they had any power to observe them or not); nay, if we yield them more (than, it may be, they are willing to enquire after, though they ought to do it) <hi>viz.</hi> that without the <hi>assistance of divine grace,</hi> they can never do it: yet such is the unlimited nature of divine goodness and the exceeding riches of Gods Grace, that (knowing the weakness and degeneracy of humane Nature when he gave these commands to men) he makes a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62152:49"/>
large and free offer of assistance to all those who are so sensible of their own infirmity as to beg it of him. And can men then say the command is impossible when he hath promised an assistance suitable to the nature of the duty and the infirmities of men? If it be acknowledged that some of the duties of <hi>Christianity</hi> are very difficult to us now; let us consider by what means he hath sweetned the performance of them. Will not the proposal of so excellent a reward, make us swallow some more than ordinary hardships that we might enjoy it? Hath he not made use of the most obliging motives to perswade us to the practice of what he requires, by the infinite discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his own love, the death of his Son, and the promise of his Spirit? And what then is wanting, but only setting our selves to the serious obedience of them, to make his commands not only not impossible, but easie to us? But our grand fault is, we make impossibilities our selves where we finde none, and then we complain of them: we are first resolved not to practise the commands, and then nothing more easie than to finde fault with them: we first pass sentence, and then examine eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; first condemn, and then enquire into the merits of the Cause. Yet surely none
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62152:49"/>
of these things can be accounted impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which have been done by all those who have been sincere and hearty Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and <hi>God</hi> forbid we should think all guilty of hypocrisie, who have profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it to this day. Nay more than so, they have not only done them, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to have that joy and satisfaction of minde in the doing of them, which they would not exchange for all the pleasures and delights of the world. These were the men, who not only were patient, but rejoyced in sufferings; who accounted it their honour and glory to endure any thing for the sake of so excellent a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; who were so assured of a future happiness by it, that they valued Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms above Crowns and Scepters. But God be thanked, we may hope to come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on easier terms than these, or else ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others might never come thither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those who think to make this a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for their sin, that now when with encouragement and honour we may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise our Religion, the commands of it are thought impossible by them. Thus we have made good the general Charge here implyed against wicked men, in that they are called <hi>Fools,</hi> by examining the most
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62152:50"/>
plausible pretences they bring for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>I now come to the particular impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their folly, because <hi>they make a mock at sin.</hi> And that I shall prove espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by two things: 1. Because this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues <hi>the highest degree of wickedness.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it betrayes the <hi>greatest weakness of judgement and want of consideration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it argues <hi>the highest degree of wickedness.</hi> If to sin be tolly, to make a mock at it is little short of madness. It is such a height of impiety, that few but those who are of very profligate conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences can attain to, without a long custom in sinning. For Conscience is at first modest, and starts and boggles at the appearance of a great wickedness, till it be used to it and grown familiar with it. It is no such easie matter for a man to get the mastery of his conscience; a great deal of force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence must be used to ones self before he does it. The natural impressions of good and evil, the fears of a <hi>Deity,</hi> and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of a future state are such curbs and checks in a sinners way, that he must first sin himself beyond all feeling of these, before he can attain to the <hi>seat</hi> of the <hi>scorners.</hi> And we may justly wonder how any should ever come thither, when they must break
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62152:50"/>
through all that is ingenuous and modest, all that is vertuous and good, all that is tender and apprehensive in humane nature, before they can arrive at it. They must first deny a <hi>God,</hi> and despise an immortal soul, they must conquer their own reason, and cancell the <hi>Law written in their hearts,</hi> they must hate all that is serious, and yet soberly believe themselves to be no better <hi>than the beasts that perish,</hi> before men can come to make a <hi>scoff at religion,</hi> and <hi>a mock at sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And who now could ever imagine that in a Nation professing <hi>Christianity,</hi> among a people whose <hi>genius</hi> enclines them to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and religion, yea among those who have the greatest advantages of behaviour and education, and who are to give the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>civility</hi> to the rest of the Nation, there should any be found who should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride religion, make sport with their own profaneness, and make so light of nothing, as being damned? I come not here to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse any, and least of all those who shew so much regard of <hi>religion</hi> as to be present in the places devoted to sacred purposes; but if there be any such here, whose consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences accuse themselves, for any degrees of so great impiety; I beseech them by all that is dear and precious to them, by all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62152:51"/>
that is sacred and serious, by the <hi>vows</hi> of their <hi>Baptism,</hi> and their <hi>Participation</hi> of the <hi>Holy Eucharist,</hi> by all the kindness of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which they either enjoy or hope for, by the death and sufferings of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that they would now consider how great folly and wickedness they betray in it, and what the dreadful consequence of it will be, if they do not timely repent of it. If it were a doubt (as I hope it is not among any here) whether the matters of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> be true or no, they are surely things which ought to be seriously thought and spoken of. It is certainly no jesting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to affront a <hi>God</hi> of infinite <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> (and he judges every wilfull sinner to do so) nor can any one in his wits think it a thing not to be regarded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be eternally happy or miserable. Methinks then among persons of civility and honour, above all others, <hi>Religion</hi> might at least be treated with the respect and reverence due to the concernments of it; that it be not made the sport of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, nor the common subject of <hi>Playes</hi> and <hi>Comedies.</hi> For is there nothing to trifle with, but <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>service?</hi> Is wit grown so <hi>schismatical</hi> and <hi>sacrilegious,</hi> that it can please it self with nothing but <hi>holy ground?</hi> Are prophaneness and wit grown
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62152:51"/>
such inseparable companions, that none shall be allowed to pretend to the one, but such as dare be highly guilty of the other? Far be it from those who have but the name of <hi>Christians,</hi> either to do these things themselves, or to be pleased with them that do them: especially in such times as ours of late have been, when <hi>God</hi> hath used so many wayes to make us serious if any thing would ever do it. If men had only slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>made a mock at sin,</hi> when they had grown wanton through the abundance of peace and plenty, and saw no severities of <hi>Gods justice</hi> used upon such who did it; yet the fault had been so great, as might have done enough to have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their peace and destroyed that <hi>plenty,</hi> which made them out of the greatness of their pride and wantonness to kick against Heaven: but to do it in despight of all <hi>Gods</hi> judgements, to <hi>laugh in his face</hi> when <hi>his rod is upon our backs,</hi> when neither Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence nor Fire can make us more afraid of him, exceedingly aggravates the impiety, and makes it more unpardonable.

distemper have wholly deprived of the use of their reason and understandings: But wisdom does not lye in the rambling imaginations of mens minds (for <hi>fools</hi> may think of the same things which wise men practise) but in a due consideration and choice of things which are most agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the end they design, supposing the end in the first place to be worthy a wise mans choice; for I cannot yet see why the end may not be chosen as well as the means, when there are many stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition for our choice, and men first deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, and then determine which is the fittest to be pursued. But when the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men discover, that either they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand or regard not the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent end of their beings, or do those things which directly cross and thwart their own designs, or else pursue those which are mean and ignoble in themselves, we need not any further evidence of their folly, than these things discover.</p>
                  <p>Now that those who <hi>make a mock at sin</hi> are guilty of all these, will appear; if we consider whom they provoke by doing so, whom they most injure, and upon what reasonable consideration they are moved to what they do.</p>

For sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they had a just esteem of his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> they never durst make so bold with him, as all those do who not only commit sin themselves, but laugh at the scrupulosity of those who dare not. When <hi>Dionysius</hi> changed <hi>Apollos</hi> Cloak, and took off the <hi>Golden Beard</hi> of <hi>AEsculapius,</hi> with those solemn jeers of the unsuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the one to the Son of a beardless Father; and the much greater convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a cheaper garment to the other; it was a sign he stood not much in awe of the severity of their looks, nor had any dread at all of the greatness of their power. But although there be so infinite a dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the artificial <hi>Deities</hi> of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and the <hi>Majesty</hi> of him who made and governs the whole world; yet as little reverence to his power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is shewed by all such who dare affront him with such a mighty confidence, and bid the greatest defiance to his <hi>Laws</hi> by scoffing at them. What is there, the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the earth do more
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62152:53"/>
justly resent, and express the highest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation against, than to have their <hi>Laws</hi> despised, their persons affronted, and their authority contemned? And can we then imagine, that a <hi>God</hi> of infinite <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> the honour of whose <hi>Laws</hi> is as dear to him as his own is, should sit still unconcerned, when so many indignities are continually offered them, and never take any notice at all of them? It is true, his patience is not to be measured by our fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and peevish natures, (and it is happy for us all that it is not) he knows the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can never escape his power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bears the longer with him: but yet his lenity is alwayes joyned with his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and justice, and the time is coming when patience it self shall be no more. Is it not then the highest madness and folly to provoke one whose power is infinitely greater than our own is, and from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of whose wrath we cannot secure our selves one minute of an hour? How knowest thou, O vain man, but that in the midst of all thy mirth and jollity, while thou art boasting of thy sins, and thinkest thou canst never fill up fast enough the measure of thy iniquities, a sudden fit of an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> or the breaking of an <hi>Aposteme,</hi> or any of the innumerable instruments of

No doubt, nothing can more gratifie them than to see men sport themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own destruction, and go down so pleasantly to Hell: when eternal flames become their first awakeners, and then men begin to be wise, when it is too late to be so: when nothing but insupportable torments can convince them that <hi>God</hi> was in earnest with them, that he would not alwayes bear the affronts of evil men, and that those who derided the miseries of another life, shall have leisure enough to repent their folly, when their repentance shall only increase their sorrow without hopes of pardon by it.</p>

3. But if there were any present felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or any considerable advantage to be gained by this <hi>mocking at sin,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing Religion, there would seem to be some kind of pretence, though nothing of true reason for it. Yet that which heightens this folly to the highest degree in the last place is, that there can be no imaginable consideration thought on which might look like a <hi>plausible temptation</hi> to it. The covetous man, when he hath defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his neighbour, and used all kinds of arts to compass an Estate, hath the fulness of his baggs to answer for him; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may do in another world, he is sure they will do much in this. The vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous man hath the strong propensities of his Nature, the force of temptation which lies in the charms of beauty, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse his unlawfull pleasures by. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious man, hath the greatness of his mind, the advantage of authority, the examples of those who have been great before him, and the envy of those who condemn him, to plead for the heights he aims at. But what is it which the person who despises Religion, and laughs at every thing that is serious, proposes to himself as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of what he does? But alas! this were to suppose him to be much more serious
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62152:56"/>
than he is, if he did propound any thing to himself as the ground of his actions. But it may be a great kindness to others, though none to himself; I cannot imagine any, unless it may be, to make them thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full they are not arrived to that height of folly; or out of perfect good nature, lest they should take him to be wiser than he is. The <hi>Psalmists fool</hi> despises him as much as he does Religion: for he only <hi>saith it in his heart, there is no God;</hi> but this though he dares not think there is none, yet shews him not near so much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward respect and reverence as the other does. Even the <hi>Atheist</hi> himself thinks him a <hi>Fool,</hi> and the greatest of all other, who believes a <hi>God,</hi> and yet affronts him and trifles with him. And although the <hi>Atheists Folly</hi> be unaccountable, in resisting the clearest evidence of reason, yet so far he is to be commended for what he sayes, that if there be such a thing as <hi>Religion,</hi> men ought to be serious in it. So that of all hands the <hi>scoffer at Religion</hi> is looked on as one forsaken of that little reason, which might serve to uphold a slender reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being above <hi>the beasts that perish:</hi> nay, therein his condition is worse than theirs, that as they understand not <hi>Religion,</hi> they shall never be punished for despising it:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62152:56"/>
which such a person can never secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from, considering the <hi>power,</hi> the <hi>justice,</hi> the <hi>severity</hi> of that <hi>God,</hi> whom he hath so highly provoked. <hi>God</hi> grant, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of this danger may make us so serious in the profession and practice of our Religion, that we may not by slighting that, and <hi>mocking at sin,</hi> provoke him <hi>to laugh at our calamities, and mock when our fear comes;</hi> but that by beholding the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our repentance, and the hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our devotion to him, he may <hi>turn his anger away from us, and rejoyce over us to do us good.</hi>

For since he came to fulfill all the Prophesies which had gone before concerning him, and was himself the great Prophet foretold by all the rest, none might in humane probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have been judged more likely to have received and honoured him, than those to whom the judgement of those things did peculiarly belong; and who were as much concern'd in the truth of them as any

else could be. Thus indeed it might have been reasonably expected; and doubtless it had been so, if interest and prejudice had not had a far more absolute power and dominion over them, than they had over the rest of the people. If Miracles, and Prophesies, if Reason and Religion; nay, if the interest of another World could have prevailed over the interest of this among them; the <hi>Jewish Sanhedrin</hi> might have been some of the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to Christianity, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> had been all Proselytes to Christ, and the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had been the first Christian Church. But to let us see with what a jealous eye Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest looks on every thing that seems to offer at any disturbance of it, how much greater sway partiality and prejudice hath upon the mindes of men than true Reason and Religion; and how hard a matter it is to convince those who have no minde to be convinced; we finde none more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in their opposition to the person of Christ, none more obstinate in their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity as to his Doctrine, than those who were at that time in the greatest reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them for their authority, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and knowledge. These are they, whom our Saviour, as often as he meets
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62152:58"/>
with, either checks for their ignorance, or rebukes for their pride, or denounces woes against for their malice and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie: These are they who instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Christ persecute him; instead of following him seek to destroy him: and that they might the better compass it, they reproach and defame him, as if he had been really as bad as themselves. And although the people might not presently believe what they said concerning him, yet that they might at least be kept in suspence by it, they endeavour to fasten the blackest calumnies upon him; and suit them with all imaginable arts to the tempers of those they had to deal with.</p>
                  <p>If any appeared zealous for the present peace and prosperity of the Nation; and for paying the duty and obedience they owed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, which then govern'd them: to them he is represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a factious and seditious person, as an enemy to <hi>Caesar,</hi> as one that intended to set up a Kingdom of his own, though to the ruine of his Countrey: That it was nothing but ambition and vain-glory, which made him gather Disciples, and preach to multitudes; that none could foretell what the dangerous consequences

To the great men, they need no more than bid them, behold the train of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who being generally poor, the more numerous they were, the more mouths they might see open, and ready to devour the Estates of those who were above them. The Priests and Levites they bid consider what would become of them all, if the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was abrogated, by which their interest was upheld; for if the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fell, it was impossible for them to stand. But the grand difficulty was among the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62152:59"/>
people, who began to be possessed with so high an opinion of him by the greatness of his Miracles, the excellency of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the innocency of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that unless they could insinuate into their mindes some effectual preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices against these, all their other attempts were like to be vain and unsuccessefull. If therefore they meet with any who were surprized by his Miracles, as well as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished by his Doctrine; when they saw him raise the dead, restore sight to the blinde, cure the deaf and the lame, and cast out Devils out of possessed persons, they tell them presently that these were the common arts of Impostors, and the practice of those who go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the people; that such things were easily done by the power of Magick, and assistance of the evil Spirits. If any were admirers of the Pharisaical rigours and austerities (as the people generally were) when mens Religion was measured by the sowerness of their countenances, the length of their Prayers, and the distance they kept from other persons; these they bid especially beware of our Saviours Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for he condemned all zeal and devotion, all mortification and strictness of life, under the pretence of Pharisaical
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62152:60"/>
hypocrisie; that he sunk all Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to short Prayers and dull morality; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                  <p>Thus we see the most perfect innocency could not escape the venom of malicious tongues; but the less it enter'd, the more they were enraged, and made up what wanted in the truth of their calumnies, by their diligence in spreading them. As though their mouths indeed had been open Sepulchres by the noysom vapours which came out of them; and we may well think no less a poyson than that of Asps could be under their lips, which so secretly and yet so mischievously convey'd it self into the hearts of the people. The only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which malice hath against the greatest Virtue, is, that the greater it is, the less it takes notice of all the petty arts which are used against it; and will not bring its own innocency so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to suspicion as to make any long Apologies
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62152:60"/>
for it self. For, to a noble and generous spirit, assaulted rather by noyse and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, than any solid reason or force of argument, neglect and disdain are the most proper weapons of defence: for where malice is only impertinent and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, a punctual answer seems next to a confession. But although innocency needs no defence as to it self, yet it is necessary for all the advantages it hath of doing good to mankinde, that it appear to be what it really is; which cannot be done, unless its reputation be cleared from the malicious aspersions which are cast upon it. And from hence it was that our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, though he thought it not worth the while to use the same diligence in the vindication of himself, which his enemies did in the defamation of him; yet when he saw it necessary in order to the reception of his Doctrine among the more ingenuous and tractable part of his auditors, he sometimes by the quickness of his replyes, sometimes by the sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sharpness of his questions, and sometimes by the plain force of argument and reason, baffles his adversaries, so that though they were resolved not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, they thought it best for the time to be quiet. This was to let them see
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62152:61"/>
how easie it was for him to throw off their reproaches as fast as their malice could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them; and that it was as impossible for them by such weak attempts to obscure the reputation of his innocency, as for the spots which Astronomers discern near the body of the Sun, ever to eclipse the light of it. So that all those thinner mists which envy and detraction raised at his first appearance, and those grosser vapors which arose from their open enmity when he came to a greater height, did but adde a brighter lustre to his glory, when it was seen that notwithstanding all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of his enemies, his innocency brake forth like the light, which shineth more and more to the perfect day.</p>
                  <p>But it pleaseth God, for the tryall of mens minds so to order the matters of our Religion, that as they are never so clear, but men of obstinate and perverse spirits will finde something to cavil at; so they were never so dark and obscure in the most difficult circumstances of them, but men of unprejudiced and ingenuous minds might find enough to satisfie themselves about them. Which is the main scope of our Saviour in the words of the Text, (and shall be of our present discourse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them) <hi>but Wisdom is justified of all her
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62152:61"/>
Children.</hi> Where without any further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, by <hi>Wisdom</hi> we understand the method which God useth in order to the salvation of mankinde; by the <hi>Children of Wisdom,</hi> all those who were willing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the end by the means which God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth, and by <hi>justifying,</hi> not only the bare approving it, but the declaring of that approbation to the World by a just vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it from the cavils and excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men. Although the words are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of various senses; yet this is the most natural, and agreeable to the scope of what goes before. For there our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour speaks of the different wayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>John Baptist</hi> and himself appeared among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in order to the same end, <hi>v.</hi> 32.

But what could we have sooner thought than that those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who made the Devil the author of so much mortification and severity of life, should presently have entertained Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a more free and pleasing humour; but this would not take neither, for <hi>the

So impossible it was by any means which the wisdom of Heaven thought fit to use, to perswade them into any good opinion of the persons who brought the glad tidings of salvation to them: and therefore our Saviour, when he sees how refractory and perverse they were, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting every thing to the worse, and censuring the wayes which infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thought fittest to reclaim them by, he tells them that it was nothing but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and obstinacy which was the cause of it; but if they were men of teachable spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (who by an usual Hebraisme are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Children of Wisdom) they would see reason enough to admire, approve and justifie all the methods of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the good of Mankind. <hi>For Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is justified of all her Children.</hi>

That which I mainly design to speak to from hence is, <hi>That although the wisest Contrivances of Heaven for the good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are lyable to the unjust cavils and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of unreasonable men, yet there is enough to satisfie any teachable and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Minds concerning the wisdom of them.</hi> Before I come more particularly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine those which concern our present subject, <hi>viz.</hi> the life and appearance of our Lord and Saviour, it will take very much off from the force of them, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that thus it hath alwayes been, and supposing humane nature to be as it is, it is scarce conceivable that it should be otherwise. Not that it is necessary or reasonable it should be so at all, any more than it is necessary that men should act foolishly or inconsiderately; but as long as we must never expect to see all men either wise or pious, either to have a true judgement of things, or a love of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; so long we shall alwayes find there will be some, who will be quarrelling with Religion when they have no minde to practise it. I speak not now of those who make a meer jest and scoff at Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (of which our Age hath so many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances) but of a sort of men who are of a degree above the other, though farr
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62152:63"/>
enough short of any true and solid wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; who yet are the more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, because they seem to make a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der offer at reason in what they say. Some pretend they are not only unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the particular wayes of institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Religion, any further than they are subservient to their present interest (which is the only God they worship) but to make all sure, the foundations even of Natural Religion it self cannot escape their cavils and exceptions. They have found out an <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> for those impressions of a Deity which are in the hearts of men; and use their utmost arts to obscure, since they cannot extinguish those lively characters of the power, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodness of God, which are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to be seen in the large volume of the Creation. Religion is no more to them but an unaccountable fear; and the very notion of a spiritual substance (even of that without which we could never know what a contradiction meant) is said to imply one. But if for quietness sake, and it may be to content their own minds as well as the World, they are willing to admit of a Deity, (which is a mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from those who have so much cause to be afraid of him) then to ease their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62152:63"/>
minds of such troublesom companions as their fears are, they seek by all means to dispossess him of his Government of the World, by denying his Providence, and care of humane affairs. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented he should be cal'd an excellent Being, that should do nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore signifie nothing in the World; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then he might be styled an Almighty <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> that is so fond of ease and pleasure, that the least thought of business would quite spoyl his happiness. Or if the activity of their own spirits may make them think that such an excellent Being may sometimes draw the Curtains and look abroad into the World, then every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which another hath got above them, and every cross accident which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals themselves (which by the power of self-flattery most men have learnt to call the Prosperity of the wicked, and the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of good men) serve them for mighty charges against the justice of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Thus either God shall not govern the World at all, or if he do, it must be upon such terms as they please and approve of, or else they will erect an High Court of Justice upon him, and condemn the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of the World, because he could not please his discontented subjects. And
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62152:64"/>
as if he were indeed arraign'd at such a barr, every weak, and peevish exception shall be cryed up for evidence; when the fullest and clearest vindications of him shall be scorn'd and contemned. But this doth not in the least argue the obnoxiousness of him who is so accused, but the great injustice of those who dare pass sentence; where it is neither in their power to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the reason of his actions, nor if it were, to call him in question for his proceedings with men. But so great is the pride and arrogance of humane Nature, that it loves to be condemning what it cannot comprehend; and there needs be no greater reason given concerning the many disputes in the world about Divine Providence, than that God is wise, and we are not, but would fain seem to be so. While men are in the dark they will be alwayes quarrelling; and those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the most, do it that they might seem to others to see, when they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they do not. Nay, there is nothing so plain and evident, but the reason of some men is more apt to be imposed upon in it, than their senses are; as it appeared in him who could not otherwise confute the Philosophers argument against motion, but by moving before him. So that we
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62152:64"/>
see the most certain things in the world are lyable to the cavils of men who imploy their wits to do it; and certainly those ought not to stagger mens faith in matters of the highest nature and consequence, which would not at all move them in other things.</p>
                  <p>But at last it is acknowledged by the men who love to be called the men of wit in this Age of ours, that there is a God and Providence, a future state, and the differences of good and evil, but the Christian Religion they will see no further reason to embrace than as it is the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the State they live in. But if we demand what mighty reasons they are able to bring forth against a Religion so holy and innocent in its design, so agreeable to the Nature of God and Man, so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for the advantages of this and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, so fully attested to come from God by the Miracles wrought in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, by the death of the Son of God, and of such multitudes of Martyrs, so certainly conveyed to us, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Tradition of all Ages since the first delivery of it; the utmost they can pretend against it is, that it is built upon such an appearance of the Son of God which was too mean and contemptible,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62152:65"/>
that the Doctrine of it is incosistent with the Civil Interests of men, and the design ineffectual for the Reformation of the World. For the removal therefore of these cavils against our Religion, I shall shew,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there were no circumstances in our Saviours appearance or course of life, which were unbecoming the Son of God, and the design he came upon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Doctrine delivered by him is so far from being contrary to the Civil Interests of the World, that it tends high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the preservation of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the design he came upon was very agreeable to the Infinite Wisdom of God, and most effectual for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankinde.</p>
                  <p>For clearing the first of these, I shall consider, (1.) The Manner of our Saviours appearance. (2.) The Course of his Life; and what it was which his enemies did most object against him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Manner of our Saviours Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; which hath been alwayes the great offence to the admirers of the pomp and greatness of the World. For when they heard of the Son of God coming down from Heaven, and making his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress into this lower world, they could
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62152:65"/>
imagine nothing less, than that an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels must have been dispatched before, to have prepared a place for his reception; that all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns and Princes of the World must have been summon'd to give their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and pay their homage to him: that their Scepters must have been immediately laid at his feet, and all the Kingdoms of the earth been united into one universal Monarchy under the Empire of the Son of God: That the Heavens should how down at his presence to shew their obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance to him, the Earth tremble and shake for fear at the near approaches of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; that all the Clouds should clap to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one universal Thunder, to welcome his appearance, and tell the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the World what cause they had to fear him whom the Powers of the Heavens obey: that the Sea should run out of its wonted course with amazement and horror; and if it were possible, hide it self in the hollow places of the earth: that the Mountains should shrink in their heads, to fill up the vast places of the deep; so that all that should be fulfilled in a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense, which was foretold of the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Messias, That every Valley should</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 3. 5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>be filled, and every Mountain and Hill brought
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62152:66"/>
low; the crooked made straight, and the rough wayes smooth, and all flesh see the salvation of God.</hi> Yea, that the Sun for a time should be darken'd, and the Moon withdraw her light, to let the Nations of the Earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that a Glory infinitely greater than theirs did now appear to the World. In a word, they could not imagine the Son of God could be born without the pangs and throws of the whole Creation; that it was as impossible for him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as for the Sun in the Firmament to disappear, without the notice of the whole World. But when instead of all this pomp and grandeur he comes <hi>incognito</hi> into the World, instead of giving notice of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to the Potentates of the Earth, he is only discovered to a few silly Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards and three wise men of the East; instead of choosing either <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> for the place of his Nativity, he is born at <hi>Bethleem</hi> a mean and obscure Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage: instead of the glorious and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Palaces of the East or West, which were at that time so famous; he is brought forth in a Stable, where the Manger was his Cradle, and his Mother the only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant about him: who was her self none of the great persons of the Court, nor of any fame in the Countrey; but was only
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62152:66"/>
rich in her Genealogy, and honourable in her Pedigree. And according to the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Birth was his Education too: his youth was not spent in the Imperial Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor in the Schools of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers at <hi>Athens,</hi> nor at the feet of the great Rabbies at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> but at <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> a place of mean esteem among the <hi>Jews,</hi> where he was remarkable for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much as the Vertues proper to his Age, Modesty, Humility and Obedience. All which he exercises to so high a degree, that his greatest Kindred and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance were mightily surprized when at 30 years of age, he began to discover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by the Miracles which he wrought, and the Authority which he spake with. And although the rayes of his Divinity began to break forth through the Clouds he had hitherto disguised himself in, yet he persisted still in the same course of humility and self-denyal; taking care of others to the neglect of himself; feeding others by a Miracle, and fasting himself, to one: shewing his power in working miraculous Cures, and his humility in concealing them: Conversing with the meanest of the people, and choosing such for his Apostles, who brought nothing to recommend them but innocency and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62152:67"/>
Who by their heats and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance were continual exercises of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in bearing with them, and of his care and tenderness in instructing them. And after a life thus led with such unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd humility, when he could adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to it by his actions, he doth it by his sufferings; and compleats the sad Tragedy of his Life by a most shamefull and ignominious Death. This is the short and true account of all those things which the admirers of the greatness of this world think mean and contemptible in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours appearance here on earth. But we are now to consider whether so great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility were not more agreeable with the design of his coming into the World, than all that pomp and state would have been which the Son of God might have more easily commanded than we can imagine. He came not upon so mean an errand, as to dazzle the eyes of Mankinde with the brightness of his Glory, to amaze them by the terribleness of his Majesty, much less to make a shew of the riches and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of the World to them: But he came upon far more noble and excellent designs, to bring life and immortality to light, to give men the highest assurance of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness and misery in the World to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62152:67"/>
come, and the most certain directions for obtaining the one, and avoiding the other: and in order to that, nothing was judged more necessary by him, than to bring the vanities of this World out of that credit and reputation they had gained among foolish men. Which he could never have done, if he had declaimed never so much against the vanity of worldly greatness, riches and honours, if in the mean time himself had lived in the greatest splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and bravery. For the enjoyning then the contempt of this world to his Disciples in hopes of a better, would have looked like the commendation of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of fasting at a full meal, and of the conveniencies of Poverty by one who makes the greatest haste to be rich. That he might not therefore seem to offer so great a contradiction to his Doctrine by his own example; he makes choice of a life so remote from all suspicion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs upon this world, that <hi>though the foxes had holes, and the birds of the air had nests, yet the Son of Man,</hi> who was the Lord and Heir of all things, <hi>had not whereon to lay his head.</hi> And as he shewed by his life how little he valued the great things of the World, so he discovered by his death how little he feared the evil things of it:

And who now upon any pretence of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son dare entertain the meaner apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sious of our Blessed Saviour, because he appeared without the pomp and greatness
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62152:68"/>
of the world, when the reason of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so was, that by his own humility and self-denyal he might shew us the way to an eternal happiness? Which he well knew how very hard it would be for men to attain to, who measure things not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their inward worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, but the splendour and appearance which they make to the world: who think nothing great but what makes them gazed upon; nothing desireable but what makes them flatter'd. But if they could be once perswaded how incomparably valuable the glories of the life to come are above all the gayeties and shews of this; they would think no condition mean or contemptible, which led to so great an end; none happy or honourable which must so soon end in the grave, or be changed to eternal mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And that we might entertain such thoughts as these are, not as the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly effects of discontent and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but as the serious result of our most deliberate enquiry into the value of things, was the design of our Saviour in the humility of his appearance, and of that excellent Doctrine which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the World by it. Were I to argue the case with Philosophers, I might then at large shew from the free acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62152:69"/>
of the best and most experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced of them, that nothing becomes so much one who designs to recommend Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to the World, as a reall and hearty contempt of all the pomp of it, and that the meanest condition proceeding from such a principle is truely and in it self more honourable, than living in the greatest splendour imaginable. Were I to deal with the <hi>Jews,</hi> I might then prove, that as the Prophecyes concerning the <hi>Messia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> speak of great and wonderfull effects of his coming, so that they should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in a way of suffering and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. But since I speak to Christians, and therefore to those who are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the great kindness and love of our Saviour in coming into the World, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, and that by convincing men of the truth and excellency of a future state, no more need be said to vindicate the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of him from that meanness and contempt, which the pride and ambition of vain men is apt to cast upon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But not onely our Saviours man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Appearance, but the manner of his Conversation gave great offence to his enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was too free and familiar among persons who had the meanest reputation, <hi>the Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:62152:69"/>
and in the mean time declaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the strictest observers of the greatest rigours and austerities of life. And this no doubt was one great cause of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hatred of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> against him, though least pretended, that even thereby they might make good that charge of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie which our Saviour so often draws up against them. And no wonder, if such severe rebukes did highly provoke them, since they found this so gainfull and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all so easie a trade among the people, when with a demure look and a sowre counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance they could cheat and defraud their Brethren; and under a specious shew of devotion could break their fasts by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Widows houses, and end their long Prayers to God with acts of the highest injustice to their Neighbours. As though all that while, they had been only begging leave of God to do all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they could to their Brethren. It is true, such as these were, our Saviour upon all occasions speaks against with the greatest sharpness, as being the most dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to true Religion: and that which made men whose passion was too strong for their reason abhorr the very name of Religion, when such baseness was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed under the profession of it. When they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62152:70"/>
saw men offer to compound with Heaven for all their injustice and oppression, with not a twentieth part of what God chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged as his due; they either thought Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be a meer device of men, or that these mens hypocrisie ought to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the World. And therefore our Blessed Saviour, who came with a design to retrieve a true spirit of Religion among men, findes it first of all necessary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask those notorious hypocrites, that their deformities being discovered, their wayes as well as their persons might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understood and avoided. And when he saw by the mighty opinion they had of themselves, and their uncharitableness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all others, how little good was to be done upon them, he seldom vouchsafes them his presence; but rather converses with those who being more openly wicked were more easily convinced of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, and perswaded to reform. For which end alone it was that he so freely conversed with them, to let them see there were none so bad, but his kindness was so great to them, that he was willing to do them all the good he could: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this could be no more just a reproach to Christ, that he kept company some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with these, than it is to a Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62152:70"/>
to visit Hospitals, or to a Physician to converse with the sick.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But when they saw that his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness did appear in another way, by the authority of his Doctrine, and the power of his Miracles, then these wise and subtle men apprehend a further reach and design in all his actions: <hi>Viz.</hi> That his low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was a piece of Popularity, and a meer disguise to ensnare the people, the better to make them in love with his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and so by degrees to season them with Principles of Rebellion and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Hence came all the clamors of his being <hi>an Enemy to Caesar,</hi> and calling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>the King of the Jewes,</hi> and of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to erect a Kingdom of his own, all which they interpret in the most malicious though most unreasonable sense. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is so politick as malice and ill will is; for that findes designs in every thing; and the more contrary they are to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations of the persons concerned, the deeper that suggests presently they are laid, and that there is the more cause to be afraid of them. Thus it was in our Blessed Saviours case; it was not the greatest care used by him to shew his obedience to the Authority he lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it was not his most solemn disavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62152:71"/>
having any thing to do with their civil Interests, not the severe checks he gave his own Disciples for any ambitious thoughts among them, not the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the doctrine of Obedience to them, nor the rebuke he gave one of his most forward Disciples for offering to draw his sword in the rescue of himself, could abate the fury and rage of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but at last they condemn the greatest Teacher of the duty of Obedience as a Traytor, and the most unparallel'd exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of innocency as a Malefactor. But though there could be nothing objected against the life and actions of our Blessed Saviour, as tending to sedition and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Civil Peace, yet that, these men (who were inspired by malice, and prophesied according to their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest) would say, was because he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away in time, before his designs could be ripe for action, but if his doctrine ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that way, it was enough to justifie their proceedings against him. So then, it was not what he did, but what he might have done: not Treason but Convenience which made them take away the life of the most innocent person: but if there had been any taint in his doctrine that way, there had been reason enough in such an
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62152:71"/>
Age of faction and sedition to have used the utmost care to prevent the spreading it. But so far is this from the least ground of probability that it is not possible to imagine a Religion which aims less at the present particular interests of the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of it, and more at the publick inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of Princes than Christianity doth, as it was both preached and practised by our Saviour and his Apostles.</p>
                  <p>And here we have cause to lament the unhappy fate of Religion when it falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the censure of such who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Masters of all the little arts whereby this world is governed. If it teaches the duty of Subjects, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Princes, if it requires obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Laws, and makes mens happiness or misery in another life in any measure to depend upon it; then Religion is suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a meer trick of State, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to keep the world in awe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men might the better be moulded into Societies, and preserved in them. But if it appear to inforce any thing indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably on the Consciences of men, though humane Laws require the contrary; if they must not forswear their Religion, and deny him whom they hope to be saved by, when the Magistrate calls them to it, then
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62152:72"/>
such half-witted men think that Religion is nothing but a pretence to Rebellion, and Conscience only an obstinate plea for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. But this is to take it for granted that there is no such thing as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the World; for if there be, there must be some inviolable Rights of Divine Soveraignty acknowledged, which must not vary according to the diversity of the Edicts and Laws of men. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the profession and practice of the Christian Religion to be allowed invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, there was never any Religion, nay, never any inventions of the greatest Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, which might compare with that for the preservation of civil Societies. For this in plain and express words tells all the owners of it, that they must live in subjection and obedience; <hi>not only for wrath, but for Conscience sake; that they who</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>do resist receive unto themselves damnation, and that because whosoever resisteth the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, resisteth the Ordinance of God.</hi> Than which it is impossible to conceive argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of greater force to keep men in obedience to Authority; for he that only obeys because it is his interest to do so, will have the same reason to disobey when there is an apprehension that may make more for his advantage. But when the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62152:72"/>
reason of obedience is derived from the concernments of another life, no hopes of interest in this world can be thought to ballance the loss which may come by such a breach of duty in that to come. So that no persons do so dangerously under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the foundations of civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as those who magnifie that to the contempt of Religion; none so effectually secure them as those <hi>who give to God the things that are Gods,</hi> and by doing so, are obliged <hi>to give to Caesar the things that are Caesars.</hi> This was the Doctrine of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity as it was delivered by the first author of it; and the practice was agreeable, as long as Christianity preserved its primitive honour in the world. For, so far were men then from making their zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion a pretence to rebellion, that though Christianity were directly contrary to the Religions then in vogue in the world, yet they knew of no other way of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, but by patience, humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, prayers for their persecutors, and tears when they saw them obstinate. So far were they then from fomenting suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions and jealousies concerning the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Governours they lived under, that though they were generally known to be some of the worst of men as well as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62152:73"/>
of Princes, yet they charge all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the strictest manner, as they loved their Religion and the honour of it, as they valued their souls and the salvation of them, that they should be subject to them. So far were they then from giving the least encouragement to the usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the rights of Princes under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of any power given to a head of the Church: that there is no way for any to think they meant it, unless we suppose the Apostles such mighty Politicians, that it is because they say nothing at all of it; but on the contrary, <hi>bid every soul be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher powers;</hi> though an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, Evangelist, Prophet, whatever he be, as the Fathers interpret it. Yea so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and uniform was the doctrine and practice of Obedience in all the first and purest ages of the Christian Church, that no one instance can be produced of any usurpation of the rights of Princes under the pretence of any title from Christ, or any disobedience to their authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of promoting Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, through all those times wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity the most flourished, or the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were the most persecuted. And happy had it been for us in these last ages of the World, if we had been Christians
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62152:73"/>
on the same terms which they were in the Primitive times; then there had been no such scandals raised by the degeneracy of men upon the most excellent and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Religion in the world, as though that were unquiet and troublesome, because so many have been so who have made shew of it. But let their pretences be never so great to infallibility on one side, and to the Spirit on the other, so far as men encourage faction and disobedience, so far they have not the Spirit of Christ and Christianity, and therefore are none of his. For he shewed his great wisdom in contriving such a method of saving mens souls in another world, as tended most to the preservation of the peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this; and though this wisdom may be evil spoken of by men of restless and unpeaceable minds, yet it will be still justified by all who have heartily embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Wisdom which is from above, who are pure and peaceable as that Wisdom is, and such, and only such are the Children of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I come to shew, That the design of Christs appearance was very agreeable to the infinite Wisdom of God; and that the means were very suitable and effectual for carrying on of that design for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind.</p>

1. That the design it self was very agreeable to the infinite Wisdom of God. What could we imagine more becoming the Wisdom of God, than to contrive a way for the recovery of lapsed and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Mankind? who more fit to employ upon such a message as this, than the Son of God? for his coming gives the greatest assurance to the minds of men, that God was serious in the management of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, than which nothing could be of greater importance in order to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of it. And how was it possible he should give a greater testimony of himself, and withall of the purpose he came about, than he did when he was in the world? The accomplishment of Prophesies, and power of Miracles shewed who he was; the nature of his Doctrine, the manner of his Conversation, the greatness of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, shewed what his design was in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing among men: for they were all managed with a peculiar respect to the convincing mankinde, that God was upon terms of mercy with them, and had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent his Son into the world, that he might not only obtain the pardon of sin for those who repent, but eternal life for all them that obey him. And what is there now we can imagine so great and desireable

It is true, we see a great discovery of it in the works of Nature, and might do in the methods of Divine Providence if par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and interest did not blinde our eyes; but both these, though great in themselves, yet fall short of the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of bringing to an eternal happiness man who had fallen from his Maker, and was perishing in his own folly. Yet this is that which men in the pride and vanity of their own imaginations either think not worth considering; or consider as little as if they thought so; and in the mean time think themselves very wise too. The <hi>Jews</hi> had the wisdom of their Traditions which they gloried in, and despised the Son of God himself when he came to alter them. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had the wisdom of their Philosophy which they so passionately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, that whatever did not agree with that, though infinitely more certain and usefull, was on that account rejected by them. The <hi>Romans,</hi> after the conquest of so great a part of the World, were grown all such Politicians and Statesmen, that few of them could have leisure to think of another world, who were so busie in the management of this.

And yet upon a true and just enquiry ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Religion could be found, which could more fully satisfie the expectation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the reason of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or the wisdom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> than that which was made known by Christ, <hi>who was the Wisdom of God, and the Power of God.</hi> Here the <hi>Jew</hi> might find his <hi>Messias</hi> come, and the Promises fulfilled which related to him, here the <hi>Greek</hi> might find his long and vainly looked for certainty of a life to come, and the way which leads to it, here the <hi>Roman</hi> might see a Religion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to another world and this toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Here are Precepts more holy, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises more certain, Rewards more desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than ever the wit or invention of men could have attained to. Here are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions far more pious, usefull and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to mankinde; than the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Laws of the famous Legislators of <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi> Here are no popular designs carried on, no vices indulged for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62152:75"/>
the publick interest, which <hi>Solon, Lyourgus</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> are charged with. Here is no making Religion a meer trick of State, and a thing only usefull for governing the people, which <hi>Numa</hi> and the great men at <hi>Rome</hi> are lyable to the suspicion of. Here is no wrapping up Religion in strange figures and mysterious non-sense, which the <hi>AEgyptians</hi> were so much given to. Here is no inhumanity and cruelty in the sacrifices offer'd, no looseness and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness allowed in the most solemn mysteries, no worshipping of such for Gods who had not been fit to live if they had been men, which were all things so commonly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Idolatries of the Heathens. But the nature of the Worship is such as the mindes of those who come to it ought to be, and as becomes that God whom we profess to serve, pure and holy, grave and serious, solemn and devout, without the mixtures of superstition, vanity or osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The precepts of our Religion are plain and easie to be known, very suitable to the nature of Mankinde, and highly tending to the advantage of those who practise them, both in this and a better life. The arguments to perswade men are the most weighty and powerfull, and of as great importance as the love of God, the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62152:76"/>
death of his Son, the hopes of happiness, and the fears of eternal misery can be to men. And wherein is the contrivance of our Religion defective, when the end is so desireable, the means so effectual for the obtaining of it?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which is the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. There are two things which in this degenerate estate of man are necessary in order to the recovery of his happiness; and those are Repentance for sins past, and sincere Obedience for the future: now both these the Gospel gives men the greatest encouragements to, and therefore is the most likely to effect the design it was intended for.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Repentance for sins past. What more powerfull motives can there be to perswade men to repent, than for God to let men know that he is willing to pardon their sins upon the sincerity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but without that, there remains nothing but a fearfull expectation of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fiery indignation? that their sins are their follies, and therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is to grow wise: that he requires no more from men, but what every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderative man knows is fitting to be done whenever he reflects upon his actions: that there can be no greater ingratitude
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62152:76"/>
or disingenuity towards the Son of God than to stand at defiance with God when he hath shed his blood to reconcile God and Man to each other: that every step of his humiliation, every part of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of his life, every wound at his death, every groan and sigh which he utter'd upon the Cross, were designed by him as the most prevailing Rhetorick to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men to forsake their sins, and be happy: that there cannot be a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable folly, than by impenitency to lose the hopes of a certain and eternal happiness for the sake of those pleasures which every wise man is ashamed to think of: that to continue in sin with the hopes to repent, is to stab a mans self with the hopes of a cure: that the sooner men do it, the sooner they will finde their minds at ease, and that the pleasures they enjoy in forsaking their sins, are far more noble and manly than ever they had in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them: but if none of these arguments will prevail with them, perish they must, and that unavoidably, insupportably, and irrecoverably: And if such arguments as these will not prevail with men to leave their sins, it is impossible that any should.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Holiness of Life: For Christ did not come into the World, and dye for us,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62152:77"/>
meerly that we should repent of what is past, <hi>by denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, but that we should live soberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and godly in this present world.</hi> And <note place="margin">Titus 2. 12.</note> what he doth expect, he hath given the greatest encouragements to perform: by the clearness of his precepts, the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his own example, the promise of his Grace, and the proposition of eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and punishments, whereby he takes off all the objections men are apt to make against obedience to the Commands of Christ: the pretence of ignorance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Laws are so clear; the pretence of impossibility by his own example; the pretence of infirmity by the assistance of his Grace; the pretence of the unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sariness of so great care of our actions by making eternal rewards and punishments to depend upon it. Let us then reflect upon the whole design of the Gospel, and see how admirably it is suited to the end it was intended for, to the condition of those whose good was designed by it, and to the honour of the great contriver and manager of it. And let not us by our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and the unholiness of our lives, dishonour God and our Saviour, reproach our Religion, and condemn that by our lives which we justifie by our words. For
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62152:77"/>
when we have said all we can, the best and most effectual vindication of Christian Religion is to live according to it: But oh then how unhappy are we that live in such an Age wherein it were hard to know that men were Christians, unless we are bound to believe their words against the tenour and course of their actions! What is become of the purity, the innocency, the candour, the peaceableness, the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and devotion of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians! What is become of their zeal for the honour of Christ, and Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion! If it were the design of men, to make our Religion a dishonour and reproach to the <hi>Jewes, Mahumetans,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> could they do it by more effectual means than they have done? Who is there that looks into the present state of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, could ever think that the Christian Religion was so incomparably beyond all others in the world? Is the now <hi>Christian Rome</hi> so much beyond what it was while it was <hi>Heathen?</hi> Nay, was it not then remarkable in its first times for justice, sincerity, contempt of riches, and a kind of generous honesty, and who does not (though of the same Religion, if he hath any ingenuity left) lament the want of all those things there now? Will not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62152:78"/>
the sobriety of the very <hi>Turks</hi> upbraid our excesses and debaucheries? and the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in defence and practice of their Religion, condemn our coldness and indifferency in ours? If we have then any tenderness for the honour of our Religion, or any kindness for our own Souls, let us not only have the Name, but let us lead the Lives of Christians; let us make amends for all the reproaches which our Religion hath suffer'd by the faction and disobedience of some, by the Oaths and Blasphemies, the impieties and profaneness of others, by the too great negligence and carelesness of all, that if it be possible, Christianity may appear in its true glory, which will then only be, when those <hi>who name the Name of Christ depart from iniquity, and live in all manner of holy conversation and godliness.</hi>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62152:79"/>
Nay, so great was the change which was wrought in him, that from a Bigot of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion he becomes an Apostle of the <hi>Christian,</hi> and from breathing flames against the Christians, none more ready than he to undergo them for Christ. If he had only given over his persecution, it might have been thought, that he had meerly run himself out of breath, and grown weary of his former fury, (as greater persons than he did afterwards) but to retain the same fervour of spirit in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ, which he had before in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him, to have as great zeal for making Christians, as he had for destroying them, must needs proceed from some great and unusual cause. Whilest the <hi>Jews</hi> thought he had too much learning and interest to become their enemy, and the Christians found he had too much rage and fury to be their friend, even then when they least expected it, instead of continuing an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> for punishing the Christians, he declared himself an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle and servant of Jesus Christ. And that no ordinary one neither; for such was the efficacy of those divine words, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me,</hi> that they not only presently allay his former heat, but quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and animate him to a greater zeal
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62152:79"/>
for the honour of him whom he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted before. And the faster he had run when he was out of his way, the greater diligence he used when he found it, there being none of all the followers of Christ who out-stript him in his constant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to advance the Christian Religion in the World. And if an unwearied dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to promote it, an uncessant care for preserving it, an universal concern for all who owned it, and an undaunted spirit in bearing the affronts and injuries he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent for it, be any perswasive argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the love a man bears to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there was never any person who made a clearer demonstration than S. <hi>Paul</hi> did of the truth of his Religion, and his sincerity in embracing it. For his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were suitable to the greatness of his spirit, his care as large as the Horizon of the Sun of righteousness, his courage as great as the malice of his enemies. For he was neither afraid of the malice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or of the Wisdom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or of the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but he goes up and down preaching the Gospel in a sphere as large as his minde was, and with a zeal only parallel with his former fury. He encounter'd the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, he disputed with the <hi>Greeks</hi> in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62152:80"/>
their most famous Cities, at <hi>Athens, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Ephesus,</hi> and elsewhere, and every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where raising some Trophies to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Gospel; nothing now remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that he should do the same at <hi>Rome</hi> also. And for this he wants not spirit and resolution, for <hi>he even longed to be there, vers.</hi> 11. nay, <hi>he had often purposed to goe thither,</hi> but waited for a convenient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, <hi>v.</hi> 13. But while God was pleased otherwise to dispose of him, he could not conceal the joy which he had for the ready entertainment of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion by those to whom he writes, and that their faith was grown as famous as the City wherein they dwelt. v. 8. <hi>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ, for you all, that your Faith is spoken of throughout the whole World:</hi> and he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifests the greatness of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, <hi>that without ceasing he made mention of them alwayes in his Prayers,</hi> v. 9. And among the rest of the blessings he pray'd for, for himself and them; he was sure not to forget <hi>his coming to them,</hi> v. 10. Not out of an ambitious and vain-glorious humour that he might be taken notice of in that great and Imperial City, but that he might be instrumental in doing them service as he had done others, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 13.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62152:80"/>
And to this end he tells them, what an obligation lay upon him to spread the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ in all places and to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>v. 14. I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise.</hi> So that neither the wisdom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor the ignorance of the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> could hinder S. <hi>Paul</hi> from discovering to them the contrivances of infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the excellent methods of divine Goodness in order to mens eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. And although <hi>Rome</hi> now thought it self to be the seat of Wisdom, as well as Empire and Power, yet our Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <hi>his readiness to preach the Gospel there too,</hi> v. 15. for which he gives a sufficient reason in the words of the Text; <hi>for I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the Power of God to salvation,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein we have considerable these two things, 1. The Apostles boldness and freeness in declaring the doctrine of Christ, <hi>For I am not ashamed,</hi> &amp;c. 2.

                  <p n="1">1. The Apostles boldness and freeness in declaring the doctrine of Christ. It was neither the gallantry of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, nor the splendor of the City, not the greatness of her Power, or wisdom of her

Statesmen could make S. <hi>Paul</hi> entertain the meaner opinion of the doctrine he hoped to preach among them. Had Christ come <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, with a great deal of pomp and state into the World, subduing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Nations under him; had S. <hi>Paul</hi> been a Generall for the Gospel instead of being an Apostle of it, the great men of the World would then allow he had no cause to be ashamed either of his Master, or of his employment. But to preach a crucified Saviour among the glories and triumphs of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Doctrine of so much simplicity and contempt of the world among those who were the Masters of it, and manag'd it with so much art and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; to perswade them to be followers of Christ in a holy life, who could not be like the gods they worship'd, unless they were guilty of the greatest debaucheries, seems to be an employment so lyable to the greatest scorn and contempt, that none but a great and resolved spirit would ever undertake it. For when we consider after so many hundred years profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, how apt the greatness of the world is to make men ashamed of the practice of it; and that men aim at a reputation for wit by being able to abuse the Religion they own; what entertainment might we
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62152:81"/>
then think our Religion met with among the great men of the Age it was first preached in, when it not only encounter'd those weaker weapons of scoffs and raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but the strong holds of interest and education? If our Religion now can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly escape the bitter scoffs, and profane jefts of men who pawn their souls to be accounted witty, what may we think it suffer'd then, when it was accounted a part of their own Religion to despise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ours? If in the Age we live in, a man may be reproached for his piety and virtue, that is, for being really a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, when all profess themselves to be so, what contempt did they undergo in the first Ages of the Christian World, when the very name of Christian was thought a sufficient brand of infamy? And yet such was the courage and magnanimity of the Primitive Christians, that what was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted most mean and contemptible in their Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> their believing in a crucified Saviour, was by them accounted the matter of their greatest honour and glory.

                     </gap> which is contained in these words, when he saith, <hi>God forbid that I should glory in any thing,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62152:82"/>
save in the Cross of Christ, by whom the World is crucifyed to me, and I unto the World.</hi> Gal. 6. 14. i. e. Although he could not but be sensible how much the world despised him, and his Religion together, yet that was the great satisfaction of his minde, that his Religion had enabled him to despise the World as much. For neither the pomp and grandeur of the World, nor the smiles and flatteries of it, no nor its frowns and severities could abate any thing of that mighty esteem and value which he had for the Christian Religion. For in his own expression, <hi>he accounted all things else but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus his Lord,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. Which words are not spoken by one who was in despair of being taken notice of for any thing else, and therefore magnifies the Profession he was engaged in; but by a person as considerable as most of the time and Nation he lived in both for his birth and education. So that his contempt of the World was no sullen and affected se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, but the issue of a sober and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial judgement; and the high esteem he professed of Christianity was no fanatick whimsey, but the effect of a diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and the most serious consideration. And that will appear,</p>

2. By the grounds and reasons which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here gives why he was not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, 1. From the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent end it was designed for, and that is no less than <hi>salvation.</hi> 2. From the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectualness of it in order to that end, <hi>it is the Power of God to salvation.</hi> 3. From the necessity of believing the Gospel by all who would attain that end; <hi>to every one that believes, the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the excellent End it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for, the recovery and happiness of the souls of men, both which are implyed in the term <hi>salvation.</hi> For, considering the present condition of humane Nature, as it is so far sunk beneath it self, and kept under the power of unruly passions; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tends to make it happy, must do it by delivering it from all those things which are the occasions of its misery. So that whatever Religion should promise to make men happy, without first making them ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and good, might on that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be justly suspected of imposture. For the same reasons which make the acts of any Religion necessary, <hi>viz.</hi> that we may please that God who commands and governs the World, must make it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for men to do it, in those things which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62152:83"/>
are far more acceptable to him than all our sacrifices of what kind soever, which are the actions of true vertue and goodness. If then that accusation had been true, which <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Julian.</hi> charged Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with, <hi>viz. That it indulged men in the practice of vice, with the promise of a future happiness notwithstanding;</hi> I know nothing could have render'd it more suspicious to be a design to deceive Mankinde. But so far is it from having the least foundation of truth in it, that as there never was any Religion which gave men such certain hopes of a future felicity, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more encouragement to be good, so there was none ever required it on those strict and severe terms which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity doth. For there being two grand duties of men in this world, either towards God in the holiness of their hearts and lives, or towards their Brethren, in a peaceable carriage among men (which cannot be without justice and sobriety) both these are enforced upon all Christians, upon no meaner terms than the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loss of all the happiness our Religion promises. <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</hi> Heb. 12. 14. This is then the grand design of Christianity, to make men happy
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62152:83"/>
in another world, by making them good and vertuous in this: It came to reform this world that it might people another; so to purifie the souls of men, as to make them meet to enjoy the happiness designed for them. This is that <hi>great Salvation</hi> which the Gospel brings to the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. and thence it is cal'd <hi>the Word of salvation,</hi> Acts 13. 26. <hi>the way of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Acts 16. 17. <hi>the Gospel of salvation,</hi> Ephes. 1. 13. So that though Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be of unspeakable advantage to this world, there being no Religion that tends so much to the peace of mens minds, and the preservation of civil Societies as this doth; yet all this it doth by way of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the great end of it, which is the promoting mens eternal happiness. And the more we consider the vast conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and importance of this end to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, the greater reason we shall finde that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had why <hi>he should not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Gospel of Christ.</hi> For can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any end more noble that any doctrine can aim at than this? Supposing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles of all Religion to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> the Being of God, and Immortality of our Souls, there can be nothing more becoming that God to discover, or those Souls to be imploy'd about, than the way
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62152:84"/>
to a blessed immortality. And if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire those discourses of the Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, wherein they speak more darkly and obscurely concerning those things, what admiration doth the Gospel deserve, which hath brought life and immortality to light? If we commend the vertuous Heathens, who according to those short and obscure notices which they had of God and themselves, sought to make the world any thing the better for their being in it, what infinitely greater esteem do those blessed Apostles deserve, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted not their lives dear to them that they might make even their enemies happy? If those mens memories be dear to us who sacrifice their lives and fortunes for the sake of the Countrey they belong to, shall not those be much more so who have done it for the good of the whole world? Such who chearfully suffer'd death while they were teaching men the way to an eternal life, and who patiently endured the flames if they might but give the greater light to the world by them. Such who did as far out-goe any of the admired <hi>Heroes</hi> of the Heathens, as the purging the World from sin is of greater consequence than cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Augaean</hi> Stable from the filth of it, and rescuing men from eternal flames is a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62152:84"/>
more noble design than clearing a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from pyrats and robbers. Nay, most of the Heathen Gods who were so solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worshipped in <hi>Greece</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> owed their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to such slender benefits to mankinde; that sure the world was very barbarous or hugely gratefull when they could think them no less than Gods who found out such things for men: If a Smiths forge, and a Womans distaffe, if teaching men the noble arts of fighting and cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another were such rare inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they only became some of the most celebrated Deities which the grave and demure <hi>Romans</hi> thought fit to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; sure S. <hi>Paul</hi> had no cause to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his Religion among them, who had so much reason to be ashamed of their own; since his design was to perswade them out of all the vanities and foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their Idolatrous Worship, and to bring them to the service of the true and ever living God, who had discovered so much goodness to the world in making his Son a propitiation for the sins of it. And was not this a discovery infinitely greater and more suitable to the nature of God, than any which the subtilty of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or wisdom of the <hi>Romans</hi> could ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to concerning any of their Deities?
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62152:85"/>
Thus we see the excellent end of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was that which made S. <hi>Paul</hi> so far from being ashamed of it; and so it would do all us too, if we did understand and value it as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did. But it is the great dishonour of too many among us, that they are more ashamed of their Religion than they are of their sins. If to talk boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Heaven, to affront God in calling him to witness their great impieties by frequent oaths, to sin bravely and with the highest confidence, to mock at such who are yet more modest in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, were not to be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, we might finde S. <hi>Pauls</hi> enough in the Age we live in, and it would be a piece of gallantry to be Apostles. But this is rather the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavour to put Religion out of countenance, and make the Gospel it self blush and be ashamed, that ever such bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced impieties should be committed by men under the profession of it, as though they believed nothing so damnable as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and a Holy life, and no sin so unpardonable as Modesty in committing it. But to use S. <hi>Pauls</hi> language when he had been describing such persons h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mself, <hi>Heb. 6. 9. We are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany that salvation
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62152:85"/>
the Gospel was designed for, though we thus speak.</hi> For certainly nothing can argue a greater meanness of spirit, than while wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and profane persons are not ashamed of that which unavoidably tends to their ruine, any should be shye of the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practice of that which conduces to their eternal happiness. What is become of all that magnanimity and generous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which the Primitive Christians were so remarkable for, if while some are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in sinning, others are ashamed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or doing good? If we have that value for our immortal souls, and a future life, which we ought to have, we shall not trouble our selves much with the Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal scoffs and drollery of prosane persons, who while they deride and despise Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, do but laugh themselves into eternal misery. And thus much for the first ground of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> confidence, <hi>viz.</hi> The excellent end the Gospel was designed for.</p>

                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:62152:86"/>
1. The inefficacy of any other Doctrine for this end of promoting the eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mankinde. If the world had been acquainted with any doctrine before which had been sufficient for the purposes the Gospel was designed for, there would have been no such necessity of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it among men; nor had there been reason enough to have justified the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in exposing themselves to so great hazards for the preaching of it. If the notion of an eternal God and Providence, without the knowledge of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> had been sufficient to reform the World, and make men happy; it had not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the wisdom or goodness of God to have imploy'd so many persons, with the loss of their lives, to declare the Doctrine of Christ to the World. So that if Christianity be true, it must be thought necessary to salvation, for the necessity of it was declared by those who were the instruments of confirming the truth of it. I meddle not with the case of those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons who had no means or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to know Gods revealed will, and yet from the Principles of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion did reform their lives, in hopes of a future felicity (if any such there were) but whether there were not a necessity of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62152:86"/>
such a Doctrine as the Gospel is to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to the world, in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of it? For some very few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons either through the goodness of their natures, the advantage of their educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or some cause of a higher nature, may have led more vertuous lives than others did; but it is necessary, that what aims at the general good of Mankinde, must be suited to the capacities of all, and enforced with arguments which may prevail on any but the most obstinate and wilfull persons. But when we consider the state of the World at that time when Christianity was first made known to it, we may easily see how insufficient the common Principles of Religion were, from working a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, when notwithstanding them man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde was so generally lapsed into Idolatry and Vice, that hardly any can be instanced in, in the Heathen World, who had esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped both of them. And there was so near an affinity between both these, that they who were ingaged in the rites of their Idolatry, could hardly keep themselves free from the intanglements of vice; not only because many of their villanies were practised as part of their Religion, (and there was little hopes certainly of their being good, who could not be Religious
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62152:87"/>
without being bad) but because the very Gods they worship'd were represented to be as bad as themselves. And could they take any better measure of Vertue, than from the actions of those whom they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have so divine an excellency in them, as to deserve their adoration? So that if there were a design of planting wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness in the world (which need not be, for it grows fast enough without it) it could not be done more successefully than by worshipping those for Gods, who did such things which good men would abhorr to think of. And yet this was the state of the world then, when the Gospel was preached, and not only of the more rude and barbarous Nations, but of the most civilized and knowing people, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> themselves; as our Apostle at large proves in the remainder of this chapter, wherein he shews, that though they had means enough of knowing the Eternal God and Providence, yet they were so fallen into Idolatry, and the most vicious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that there was no means of recovering them, but by a fuller discovery both of the justice and goodness of God.</p>
                  <p>I know it will be here objected, that though the generality of men were bad then (as when were they otherwise) yet
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62152:87"/>
the Heathens had a kind of Apostles among them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Philosophers, who sought to amend the manners of men by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral instructions they gave them, so that if men were bad, it was not for want of good counsel, but for not observing it, which is all (they say) we have to say for our selves, when we are charged with the great debaucheries of the Christian world.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, That our business is not now to enquire whether there hath not been an incomparably greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the world by Christianity, in the reforming mens lives, than ever was by any of the <hi>Heathen Morals;</hi> but whether these, taking them in the fairest dress, were so sufficient for the bringing men to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness, that there needed not any such Doctrine as Christianity be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that end? And there are two great things we may charge the best of their discourses with an insufficiency in, for the accomplishment of this end, which are Certainty, and Motives, or the want of Arguments to believe, and Encouragements to practise.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were destitute of sufficient Certainty; for what a man ventures his eternal state upon, he ought to be well
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62152:88"/>
assured of the truth of it. But how was it possible for the World to be reformed by such wise Apostles (if they must be call'd so) who were perpetually disputing among themselves about those things which were the most necessary foundations of all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion? As though the best Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments they had to prove their Souls immortal, was because their disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them were so. And those seemed among them to gain the greatest reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for wit, who were best able to dispute against common Principles; and they mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their business with greatest advantage, who only shewed the weakness of others principles, but established none of their own; which was an unavoidable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the way they proceeded in, for offering at no such way of proof as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity doth, they rather taught men to dispute, than to live eternally. Besides, their discourses were too subtle and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the common capacities of men; how long might a man live before an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telechia</hi> would make him know the nature of his Soul the better, or an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> perswade him to believe its immortality? Insomuch that it is hard to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the arguments used by them, did not rather hinder assent, than perswade to it;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62152:88"/>
and it seems probable that the honest minded, illiterate Heathens believed those things more firmly than the greatest Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers. For plain truths lose much of their weight, when they are ratified into subtilties, and their strength is impaired when they are spun into too fine a thread. The arguments which must prevail with Mankinde, must be plain and evident, easie and yet powerfull. The natural sense of good and evil in men is oft-times dull'd by disputes, and only awaken'd by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull representation of an infinite Being, and a future Judgement: and that by such a way of proof as all persons are equal Judges of the truth and validity of it; such as the Resurrection of Christ is in the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But let us suppose the arguments cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and suitable, yet what sufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives or encouragements could they give to lead a holy and vertuous life, who after all their endeavours to perswade others, remained so uncertain themselves as to a future happiness? So <hi>Tully</hi> tells us of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> himself when he was just dying, <hi>That he told his friends, that only the Gods knew whether it was fitter for men to live or die, but he thought no man did.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some would excuse this as his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62152:89"/>
usual way of disputing, yet of all times one would think it was fittest for him then to declare his minde in the most express terms, not only for the full vindication of himself, but for the comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of his friends. We are sure, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity proceeds on those terms, that if a future happiness be supposed uncertain, it declares expresly there can be no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reason given for men to part with the conveniencies of this present life; nay, it supposes <hi>the best men to be the most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of all others, if there be not a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 19.—32. Again, what probability was there they should ever perswade the World to vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, when the severest of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, made it lye in things so repugnant to humane nature, as goodness is agreeable to it. As when they made it an equal fault for a man to be angry, and to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Soveraign; and that all passions are to be destroy'd, that pain and grief are nothing, that vertue in all conditions is a sufficient reward to it self. Which are so contrary to the common sense of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that the only way to perswade men to believe them, is first to perswade them they are not men. So that he was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wisest man among the Heathens,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62152:89"/>
who concluded, <hi>that we ought to expect a higher Master to teach us these things,</hi> and to acquaint us with the happiness of a future life. And hereby an answer may be given to <hi>Porphyries</hi> grand objection against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, <hi>viz. If it were so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the good of Mankinde, why was it so long before it was discovered?</hi> Because God would thereby discover the insufficiency of all the means the wit of man could finde out to reform the world, without this. That not only the <hi>Jews</hi> might see the weakness of that dispensation they were under, but the <hi>Gentile</hi> world might groan with an expectation of some more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full means to goodness than were yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. For when Philosophy had been so long in its height, and had so little influence upon Mankinde, it was time for the Sun of righteousness to arise, and with the softening and healing influence of his beams to bring the World to a more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous temper.</p>
                  <p>And that leads to the Second thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, which is the peculiar efficacy of the Gospel for promoting mens salvation, <hi>for it is the Power of God to salvation,</hi> and that will appear, by considering how many wayes <hi>the power of God</hi> is engaged in it. These three especially. 1. In confirmation
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62152:90"/>
of the Truth of it. 2. In the admirable Effects of it in the World. 3. In the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Assistance which is promised to those who embrace it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In confirmation of the Truth of it. For the World was grown so uncertain, as to the grand foundations of Religion, that the same power was requisite now to settle the World, which was at first for the framing of it. For though the Precepts of Christian Religion be pure and easie, holy and suitable to the sense of mankind, though the Promises be great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, proportionable to our wants and the weight of our business, though the reward be such that it is easier to desire than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, yet all these would but seem to baffle the more the expectations of men, unless they were built on some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary evidence of divine power. And such we assert there was in the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these things to us, not only in the miraculous birth of our Saviour, and that continual series of unparallel'd miracles in his life, not only in the most obliging cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of his death; nor only in the large effusion of divine gifts upon his Apostles, and the strange propagation of Christian Religion by them against all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power; but that which I shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62152:90"/>
instance in, as the great effect of divine power, and confirmation of our Religion, was his Resurrection from the dead. For, as our Apostle saith, <hi>Rom. 1. 4. Christ was declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of Holiness, by the Resurrection from the dead.</hi> No way of evidence could be more suitable to the capacities of all, than this, it being a plain matter of fact; none ever better attested than this was, not only by the unanimous consent of all the witnesses, but by their constant adhering to the truth of it, though it cost almost all of them their lives; and no greater evidence could be given to the World of a divine power, since both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> agreed in this, that such a thing could not be effected but by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand of God. So far were they then from thinking a resurrection possible by the juyce of herbs, or an infusion of warm blood into the veins, or by the breath of living Creatures, as the great martyr for <hi>Atheism</hi> would seem from <hi>Pliny</hi> to perswade us; when yet certainly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be of higher concernment to those who believe not another life, than to have try'd this experiment long ere now; and since nothing of that nature hath ever happened since our Saviours resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62152:91"/>
it only lets us know what credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous men in other things the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels as to Religion are. But so far were they at that time from so fond an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they readily yielded, that none but God could do it, though they seem'd to question whether God himself could do it or no. As appears by the Apostles Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, <hi>Why should it be thought a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible with you, that God should raise the dead?</hi> Acts 26. 8. This was therefore judged on both sides to be a matter of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that all the disputes concerning Christian Religion were resolved into this, Whether Christ were risen from the dead? And this the Apostles urge and insist on, upon all occasions, as the great evidence of the truth of his Doctrine, and this was the main part of their Commission, for they were sent abroad to be <hi>witnesses of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</hi> Which was not designed by God as a thing strange and incredible to puzzle mankinde with, but to give the highest assurance imaginable to the World of the truth and importance of Christianity. Since God was pleased to imploy his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in so high a manner to confirm the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods power was seen in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects of Christian Religion upon
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62152:91"/>
the minds of men: which was most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable by the strange alteration it soon made in the state of the world. In <hi>Judea</hi> soon after the death of Christ, some of his Crucifyers become Christians, 3000 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts made at one Sermon of S. <hi>Peters,</hi> and great accessions made afterwards both in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and other places. Yea in all parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, where the Christians came, they so increased and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed, that thereby it appeared that God had given a Benediction to his new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion suitable to what he gave to the first. So that within the compass of not a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after our Saviours death, the World might admire to see it self so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed from what it was. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> destroy'd, and the <hi>Jews</hi> under a sadder dispersion than ever, and rendred uncapable of continuing their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Worship of God there: The Heathen Temples unfrequented, the Gods derided, the Oracles ceased, the Philosophers puzzled, the Magistrates disheartned by their fruitless cruelties, and all this done by a few Christians who came and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World <hi>Righteousness, Temperance, and a Judgement to come,</hi> whereof God had given assurance to the World, by raising one <hi>Jesus</hi> from the dead. And all this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62152:92"/>
not by the power of Wit and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, not by the force and violence of rebellious subjects, not by men of hot and giddy brains, but by men sober, just, humble and meek in all their carriages, but withall such as might never have been heard of in the world, had not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine made them famous. What could this then be imputed to less than a Divine Power, which by effectual and secret wayes carries on its own design against all the force and wit of men. So that the wise <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> at whose feet S. <hi>Paul</hi> was bred, seem'd to have the truest apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of these things at that time, when he told the <hi>Sanhedrin, If this counsel, or this work be of men, it will come to nought, but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, least haply ye be found to fight against God.</hi> Acts 5. 38, 39.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the Divine Assistance which is promised to those who embrace it: in which respect it is properly <hi>the power of God to salvation;</hi> and therein far beyond what the Philosophers could promise to any who embraced their opinions. For, the Gospel doth not only discover the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a Principle superiour to Nature, which we call <hi>Grace,</hi> in order to the fitting our Souls for their future happiness, but
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62152:92"/>
likewise shews on what terms God is pleased to bestow it on men, <hi>viz.</hi> on the consideration of the death and passion of our Lord and Saviour. <hi>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Christ our Saviour,</hi> Titus 3. 5. There being nothing in humane nature which could oblige God, to give to Mankinde that assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his grace whereby they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to work out this salvation the Gospel is designed for, with fear and trembling. The whole tenor of the Gospel importing a divine power which doth accompany the preaching of it, which is designed on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to heal the wounds, and help the weakness of our depraved and degenerate nature. Through which we may be <hi>kept to salvation:</hi> but it must be <hi>through Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Which is the last particular of the words; the necessity of <hi>believing the Gospel</hi> in order to the partaking of the salvation promised in it; <hi>it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</hi> An easie way of salvation, if no more were required to mens happiness but a fancy and strong
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62152:93"/>
opinion which they will easily call Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. So there were some in S. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s time, I could wish there were none in ours, who thought nothing necessary to salvation but a strong Faith, let their lives be what they pleased. But this is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the main design of Christian Religion, that they who think themselves the strongest Believers, are certainly the weakest, and most ungrounded. For they believe scarce any other proposition in the New Testament, but that <hi>Whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth shall be saved.</hi> If they did believe that Christ came into the world to reform it, and make it better, that <hi>the wrath of God is now revealed from Heaven against all unrighteousness,</hi> as well as <hi>that the just by Faith shall live,</hi> that the design of all that love of Christ, which is shewn to the World, is <hi>to deliver them from the hand of their enemies, that they might serve him in righteousness and holiness all the dayes of their lives,</hi> they could never imagine, that salvation is entailed by the Gospel on a mighty confidence or vehement perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of what Christ hath done and suffered for them. And so far is S. <hi>Paul</hi> from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting this, that as far as I can see, he never meddles with a matter of that nicety, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a single act of Faith be the condition
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62152:93"/>
of our justification as it is distinguished from Evangelical obedience, but his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course runs upon this subject; whether God will pardon the sins of men upon any other terms than those which are declared in the Christian Religion, the former he calls <hi>Works,</hi> and the latter <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know, the subtilty of later times hath made S. <hi>Paul</hi> dispute in the matter of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, not as one bred up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but of the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> but men did not then understand their Religion at all the worse because it was plain and easie; and, it may be, if others since had understood their Religion better, there would never have needed so much subtilty to explain it, nor so many distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to defend it. The Apostle makes the same terms of justification and of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for as he saith elsewhere, <hi>We are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom 5. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>justified by Faith,</hi> he saith here, <hi>the Gospel is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes;</hi> if therefore a single act of Faith be sufficient for one, why not for the other also? But if believing here be taken in a more large and comprehensive sense, as a complex act relating to our undertaking the conditions of the Gospel; why should it not be taken so in the subsequent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Apostle? For we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62152:94"/>
that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epistle is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting against any sort of Christians that thought to be saved by their obedience to the Gospel from the assistance of divine grace; but against those who thought the Grace and indulgence of the Gospel by no means necessary in order to the pardon of their sins, and their eternal happiness. Two things therefore the Apostle mainly designs to prove in the beginning of it: First, the insufficiency of any other way of salvation besides that offer'd by the Gospel; whether it were the light of Nature which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> contended for, but were far from living according to it; or that imaginary <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> fancyed to themselves (for it will be a very hard matter to prove that ever God entred into a Covenant of Works with fallen Man, which he knew it was impossible for him to observe) but they were so highly opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated of themselves, and of those legal observations which were among them, that they thought by vertue of them they could merit so much favour at Gods hands, that there was no need of any other sacrifice, but what was among themselves to expiate the guilt of all their sins. And on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they rejected the Gospel, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us, <hi>that they being ignorant of Gods
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62152:94"/>
righteousness, and going about to establish their</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>own righteousness, have not submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the righteousness of God.</hi> Against these therefore the Apostle proves, that if they hoped for happiness upon such strict terms, they laid only a foundation of <hi>boasting</hi> if they did all which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27.</note> but of misery if they did not; for then, <hi>Cursed is every one that continues not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>in every thing written in the Law to do it. i. e.</hi> if they failed in any one thing, then they must fail of all their hopes; but such a state of perfection being impossible to humane Nature; he shews, that either all mankind must unavoidably perish, or they must be saved by the Grace and Favour of God, which he proves to be discovered by the Gospel: and that God will now accept of a hearty and sincere obedience to his will declared by his Son; so that all those who perform that, though they live not in the nice observance of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> shal not need to fear the penalty of their sins in another life. Which is the second thing he designs to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That those who obeyed the Gospel, whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> were equally capable of salvation by it. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>is God the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Gentiles also:</hi> because both <hi>Jew</hi> and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62152:95"/>
                     <hi>Gentile</hi> were to be justified upon the same terms, as he proves afterwards. So that, Gods justifying of us by the Gospel, is the solemn declaration of himself upon what terms he will pardon the sins of men; that is, deliver them from the penalties they have deserved by them. For the actual discharge of the person is reserved to the great day; all the justification we have here is only declarative from God, but so as to give a right to us, by vertue whereof we are assured, that God will not only not exercise his utmost rigour, but shew all favour and kindness to those who by belief of the Gospel do repent and obey. God doth now remit sin as he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears to punish it; he remits the sinner as he assures him by the death of Christ he will not punish upon his repentance; but he fully remits both, when he delivers the person upon the tryall of the great day, from all the penalties which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by his sins. So that our compleat justification and salvation go both upon the same terms, and the same Faith which is sufficient for one, must be sufficient for the other also.</p>
                  <p>What care then ought men to take, lest by mis-understanding the notion of Believing, so much spoken of as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62152:95"/>
of our salvation, they live in a neglect of that holy obedience which the Gospel requires, and so believe themselves into eternal misery. But as long as men make their obedience necessary, though but as the fruit and effect of Faith, it shall not want its reward: for those, <hi>whose hearts are purified by Faith</hi> shall never be condemned for mistaking the notion of it; and they who live as those that are to be judged according to <hi>their works,</hi> shall not miss their reward, though they do not think they shall receive it <hi>for them.</hi> But such who make no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Gospel but Believing, and will scarce allow that to be call'd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ought to have a great care to keep their hearts sounder than their heads, for their only security will lye in this, that they are good though they see no necessity of being so. And such of all others I grant have reason to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the irresistible power of Divine Grace, which enables them to obey the will of God against the dictates of their own judgements. But thanks be to God, who hath so abundantly provided for all the infirmities of humane Nature, by the large offers of his Grace, and assistance of his Spirit, that though we meet with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62152:96"/>
so much opposition without, and so much weakness within, and so many discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on every side of us; yet if we sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely apply our selves to do the will of God, we have as great assurance as may be, that <hi>we shall be kept by the power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</hi>

For if either the worth of the Person, or the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Message might prevail any thing towards a kinde and honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62152:97"/>
among men; there was never any person appeared in any degree comparable to him, never any Message declared which might challenge so welcome an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from men, as that was which he came upon. If to give Mankinde the highest assurance of a state of life and immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if to offer the pardon of sin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God upon the most easie and reasonable terms, if to purge the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate World from all its impurities by a Doctrine as holy as the Author of it; were things as becoming the Son of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, as the Sons of men to receive: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more unaccountable than that his Person should be despised, his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity slighted, and his Doctrine contemned. And that by those whose interest was more concerned in the consequence of these things, than himself could be in all the affronts and injuries he underwent from men: For the more the indignities, the greater the shame, the sharper the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which he did undergo, the higher was the honour and glory which he was advanced to: but the more obliging the instances of his kindness were, the greater the salvation that was tendered by him, the more prevailing the motives were for the entertainment of his Doctrine, the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62152:97"/>
more exemplary and severe will the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment be of all those who reject it. For it is very agreeable to those eternal Laws of Justice by which God governs the world, that the punishment should arise proportionably to the greatness of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies despised: and therefore although the Scripture be very sparing in telling us what the state of those persons shall be in another life who never heard of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; yet for those who do, and despise it, it tells us plainly, that an eternal misery is the just desert of those to whom an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness was offered, and yet neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. And we are the rather told of it, that men may not think it a surprize in the life to come; or that if they had known the danger, they would have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it; and therefore our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who never mentioned punishment but with a design to keep men from it, declares it frequently, that the punishment of those persons and places would be most intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, who have received, but not improved the light of the Gospel: and that it would be more tolerable for the persons who had offer'd violence to Nature, and had Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 23.</note> burning in their hearts by their horrid impurities, than for those who heard the Doctrine, and saw the Miracles of Christ,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62152:98"/>
and were much the worse, rather than any thing the better for it. But lest we should think that all this black scene of misery was only designed for those who were the Actors in that dolefull Tragedy of our Saviours sufferings: we are told by those who were best able to assure us of it, that the same dismal consequences will attend all the affronts of his Doctrine, as if they had been offer'd to his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For it is nothing but the common flattery and self-deceit of humane nature, which makes any imagine, that though they do not now either believe or obey the Gospel; they should have done both, if they had heard our Saviour speak as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man spake, and seen him do what never man did: For the same disposition of minde which makes them now slight that Doctrine <hi>which is delivered to them by them that heard him,</hi> would have made them slight the Person as well as the Doctrine, if they had heard it from himself. And therefore it is but reasonable that the same punishment should belong to both; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since God hath provided so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly for the assurance of our Faith, by the miraculous and <hi>powerfull demonstration of that divine spirit</hi> which did accompany those who were the first publishers of this
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62152:98"/>
Doctrine to the world. And therefore the Author of this Epistle, after he hath in the words of the Text declared, that it is impossible to escape, if we <hi>neglect the great salvation</hi> offered us by the Gospel; in the following words he gives us that account of it, <hi>that at first it began to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him: God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.</hi> So that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gifts of the Holy Ghost, falling upon the Apostles, and the many signs and wonders which were wrought by them, were the great testimony of God to the world, that these were the persons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by himself to declare that Doctrine whereon the eternal salvation of Mankinde did depend. And since we have so lately acknowledg'd the truth of this testimony which God gave to the Apostles, by the solemn celebration of that glorious descent of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> upon them on the day of Pentecost, that which naturally follows from it is, the great care we ought to take lest we be found guilty of <hi>neglecting that great salvation</hi> which is offered to us in that Doctrine which was attested in so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a manner <hi>by God himself;</hi> and that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62152:99"/>
from the consideration of our own dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; <hi>for how shall we escape, if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect so great salvation?</hi> wherein are three things considerable:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The care God hath taken to make us happy, by offering <hi>so great salvation</hi> to us.</item>
                     <item>2. The care we ought to take in order to our own happiness, <hi>not to neglect</hi> the offers which God hath made us.</item>
                     <item>3. The unavoidable punishment which those do incurre who are guilty of this neglect. <hi>How shall we escape?</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I need not tell this Auditory how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible the Negative is, which is expressed by such an interrogation which appeals to the judgement of all who hear it, and so relyes not upon the bare authority of the speaker, but upon the plain evidence of the thing, which others were judges of as well as himself. As though he had said, if you slight and disesteem the Gospel of Christ, upon whatever grounds ye do it, if either through too great an opinion of the wisdom of this world you despise it as vain and useless, if through too mean an opinion of the excellency of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, you reject it either as uncertain in its Theory, or impossible in its practise; or if through too great a love of the pleasures
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62152:99"/>
of sin, or a secure and careless temper of minde, you regard not the doing what Christianity requires to make you happy; think with your selves, what way you can finde to escape the wrath of God; for my part, I know of none; for if God were so severe against the violation of a far mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er institution, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> insomuch <hi>that every contempt and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did receive a just recompence of reward, how shall we escape who neglect so great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi> or as the Apostle elsewhere argues to the same purpose. <hi>He that despised Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>

                     <hi>Law died without mercy, under two or three witnesses, of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> This is a sad subject, but I am afraid too necessary to be spoken to in the Age we live in; wherein men seem to be inappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive of the danger of inwardly despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Religion they profess to own, and the neglecting of that which they hope to be saved by. It is strange that it should be so; but much more strange that men should think to do so, and not be call'd to an account for it. It is not only the gross
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62152:100"/>
and open sinner that desies Heaven, and by his oaths and blasphemies dares God to shew his Power and Justice upon him, but the slye and self-deceiving hypocrite that hates Religion while he thinks he loves it; that in his heart contemns it, but is afraid to know that he does so, that ought to be possess'd with a truer sense of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a greater dread of the issue of the contempt or neglect of it. There is some appearance of ingenuity in an open enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but none so dangerous as that which hides it self under the disguise of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. In our Saviours time there were several sorts of those who shewed their disesteem of him, some that were so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged against him, that they contrive all wayes for his disgrace and punishment, others could hear him with patience, <hi>but the cares of this World, the deceitfulness of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mark 4. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Riches, and the lust of other things choaked and stifled all good apprehensions of him,</hi> that they became weak and ineffectual. And those were guilty <hi>of making light of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-feast</hi> because of other business which they had to minde, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 5. as well as those who offered all the injuries and affronts to his servants that invited them, <hi>v.</hi> 6. And as it was in the dayes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, so it is now; <hi>some were eating and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62152:100"/>
drinking,</hi> minding nothing but the vain and sensual pleasures of the world; <hi>some were buying and selling,</hi> so busie in this world, that they had no leisure to think of being happy in another, some were deriding and blaspheming; but all these too wise, or too vain, or too profane to minde the offers of eternal salvation. I wish we could say it were otherwise now, that a sensual and voluptuous, an easie and a careless life in some, that ambition and the restless pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit after the honour and riches of the world in others, that a profane wit, and a contempt of all that is serious in those that think themselves too great to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, did not enervate the force of Christianity upon their minds, and make them all though upon different grounds agree in the neglect of their own salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But is the case of such men grown so desperate that no remedy can work upon them? hath the love of sin and the world so far intoxicated them, that no reason or consideration whatever can awaken them? have they hardened themselves against all the power of divine Truths with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as strong as death, and as cruel as the grave whither they are going? Will neither the love of happiness, nor the fear of misery, their own interest, and the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62152:101"/>
wisdom of avoiding so great a danger, the dread of the Majesty and Power of God, and the horror of the great day, prevail at least so far on men to consider, whether these things be true or no; and if they be, what unspeakable solly it is to neglect them? And the better to make that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, I shall prove these following things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God by the Gospel hath taken so great care of mens happiness, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a gross neglect can make them miserable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That nothing can be more unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than when God hath taken so much care of it, men should neglect it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is very just for God to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himself against so gross a neglect, by the severe punishments of the life to come.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God by the Gospel hath taken so great care of mens salvation, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a gross neglect can make them miserable. For, whatever the minde of man can imagine necessary in order to its own happiness, in its present fallen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate condition, is abundantly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for by the Gospel of Christ. For, man was so wholly lost as to his own felicity, that among the ruins and decayes of his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62152:101"/>
Nature, he could not pick up so much as the perfect image and Idea of his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; when he reflects upon himself, he finds himself such a confused mass of folly and weakness, that he can never imagine that so noble a design should have its ground-work laid upon so course a Being. And rather than believe the foundation of his happiness to be within himself, there is nothing so vain and trifling without him, but he is ready to fall down before it, and cry out, Here I place my felicity. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he admires the brave shews, and the Pomp and Gallantry of the World, and thinks nothing comparable to a glorious out-side, and a great train of attendants: sometimes he raises himself, and flutters upon the wings of a popular Air, till a cross blast comes and leaves him in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rout: sometimes his eyes are dazzled with the glory of the more refined and solid pieces of that Earth out of which he was framed, and thinks it reasonable, that the softness of flesh and blood, should yield to the impressions of silver and gold; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he even envyes the pleasures of the Brutes, and if it were possible would out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe them in their grossest sensualities: sometimes again he flatters himself, and then adores his own imperfections, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62152:102"/>
thinks his Passions, Honour; and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness, Wit. So far is vain man from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himself happy, that the first step to it, is to make him understand what it is to be so. But supposing that the true image of his happiness should drop down from Heaven; and by the place from whence it fell, should conclude where the thing it self is to be found; yet this were only to make him more miserable, unless he withall knew how to come thither. He is sure not to climb up to it by the tops of the highest mountains, nor to be carried thither upon the wings of a mighty wind, he hath no fiery Chariots at his command to ascend with to the Glories above: but only he <hi>that maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Ministers a flame of fire,</hi> is able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the souls of men from vanishing into the soft air, and to conduct them to the Mansions of eternal Bliss. It is he only that can make them capable of the Joyes of another life, by purging them from the stains and the pollutions of this. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without his grace and favour ever to hope for the happiness of Heaven, must be by fancying a Heaven to be there, where there is no God. So that it is necessary, that the Proposals of this salvation must come from the Author of it, and that with
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62152:102"/>
such arguments as may perswade men of the truth of it, and with such motives as may encourage men to accept of them. Now the Gospel of Christ affords us all these things which are necessary to our happiness, there we have the most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and settled notion and Idea of it, the most large and free offers of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in order to it, the greatest assurance that these things did immediately proceed from God, and the most encouraging mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to accept of these offers in order to that great salvation which is tender'd to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We have the most agreeable and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led notion of true happiness: not such a mean and uncertain thing which lyes at the mercy of the continual vicissitudes and contingencies of this present state, but that which is able to bear up the minde of man against all the troubles of this life, and to carry him to a Region beyond them all, where there is a fulness of joy without an allay of sadness after it, and ever-flowing rivers of pleasures that need no dams to make them rise higher, nor falls to make their motion perceived. Our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour never flatters his followers with the expectation of a felicity in this life; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is the most he hath promised
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62152:103"/>
them, and that they may enjoy, if they follow his directions, let this world be be what it will, and do what it pleases with them. He never tells his Disciples they may have satisfaction here if they lie upon their beds of down with their heads full of tormenting cares, that the pleasure of humane life lies in the gratifications of the senses, and in making what use they can of the world; he never deceives them with the promise of so poor a happiness as that which depends upon health, friends, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, and having our own wills. No, but he tells them of a more noble and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous felicity; that will preserve its own stae and grandeur in spight of the world; a happiness consistent with loss of Estate, loss of Friends, with affronts and injuries, with persecutions, and death it self. For, when our Saviour begins to discourse of happiness, what another kinde of strain doth he speak of it in, than any of those <hi>Philosophers</hi> who have so much obstructed the happiness of mans life by their volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous writings and contentions about it. Here we meet with no <hi>Epicurean</hi> softness, which the sense of true Virtue carried the minds of the more noble Heathens above; no rigid and incredible <hi>Stoical</hi> Paradoxes, that make men only happy by the change of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62152:103"/>
names; no <hi>Aristotelean</hi> supposition of a prosperous life for Vertue to shew its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in; but here the only supposition made, is that which lyes in a mans own breast, <hi>viz.</hi> true goodness, and then let his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be what it will, his happiness is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with it. For those above all other persons whom our Saviour calls Blessed, in the beginning of that excellent Abstract of Christianity, his Sermon on the Mount, are, not the rich and great men of the world, but those who, to the <hi>poverty</hi> of their condition adde that <hi>of their spirits</hi> too, <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 3.</note> by being contented with the state they are in; not those, who are full of mirth and jollity, that laugh away one half of their time, and sleep the rest; but they who are <hi>in a mournfull condition,</hi> either by reason <note place="margin">V. 4.</note> of their own sorrows, or out of compassion to others, or out of a general sense of their own imperfections, or the inconstancy of our present state: Not those, who are ready enough to give, but unable to bear affronts, that think the lives of men a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice small enough for any words of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace which they have given them; but <hi>the meek and patient spirit,</hi> that is neither <note place="margin">V. 5.</note> apt to provoke, nor in a rage and madness when it is; that values the rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity above all the barbarous Punctilio's
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62152:104"/>
of Honour. Not those, who are as impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the pursuit of their designs, and as eager of tasting the fruits of them, as the thirsty Traveller in the sands of <hi>Arabia</hi> is of drinking the waters of a pleasant Spring: but such who make <hi>righteousness</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> their <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> that which <hi>they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">V. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>hunger and thirst after,</hi> and take as much pleasure in as the most voluptuous <hi>Epicure</hi> in his greatest dainties: Not those, whose malice goes beyond their power, and want only enough of that to make the whole World a Slaughter-house, and account racks and torments among the necessary instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of governing the World; but such, who when their enemies are in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <note place="margin">V. 7.</note> will not torment themselves by cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them, but have such a sense of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humanity, as not only to commend pity and good nature to those above them, but to use it to those who are under them. Not those, whose hearts are as full of dissimulation and hypocrisie, as the others hands are of blood and violence, that care not what they are, so they may but seem to be good: but such whose inward inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and <hi>purity of heart,</hi> far exceeds the <note place="margin">V. 8.</note> outward shew and profession of it: who honour Goodness for it self, and not for the Glory which is about the head of it.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62152:104"/>
Not those, who never think the breaches of the world wide enough, till there be a door large enough for their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests to go in at by them; that would rather see the world burning, than one peg be taken out of their Chariot-wheels: but such who would sacrifice themselves, like the brave <hi>Roman,</hi> to fill up the wide <note place="margin">V. 9.</note> gulf which mens contentions have made in the world; and think no Legacy ought to be preserved more inviolable than that of <hi>Peace,</hi> which our Saviour left to his Disciples. Lastly, not those, who will do any thing rather than suffer, or if they <hi>suffer</hi> it shall be for any thing rather than <hi>righteousness,</hi> to uphold a party, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">V. 10, 11, 12.</note> a discontented faction; but such, who never complain of the hardness of their way, as long as they are sure it is that of Righteousness; but if they meet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and persecutions in it, they wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, as the harbingers of their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reward, the expectation of which makes the worst condition not only tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable but easie to them. Thus we see what kinde of happiness it is, which the Gospel promises; not such a one as rises out of the dust, or is tost up and down with the motion of it; but such whose ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-failing fountain is above, and whither
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62152:105"/>
those small rivulets return, which fall down upon Earth to refresh the mindes of men in their passage thither; but while they continue here, as the <hi>Jews</hi> say of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that came out of the <hi>rock,</hi> it follows them while they travel through this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness below. So that the foundation of a Christians happiness is the expectation of a life to come, which expectation ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so firm a bottom, as the assurance which Christ hath given us by his death and sufferings, it hath power and influence sufficient to bear up the mindes of men, against all the vicissitudes of this present state.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have the most large and free of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of divine Goodness in order to it. Were it as easie for Man to govern his own passions, as to know that he ought to do it; were the impressions of Reason and Religion as powerfull with Mankinde as those of Folly and Wickedness are, we should never need complain much of the misery of our present state, or have any cause to fear a worse to come. There would then be no condition here but what might be born with satisfaction to ones own minde; and the life of one day led according to the principles of vertue and goodness, would be preferred before a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62152:105"/>
sinning Immortality. But we have lost the command of our selves, and therefore our passions govern us; and as long as such furies drive us, no wonder if our ease be little. When men began first to leave the uncertain speculations of Nature, and found themselves so out of order, that they thought the great care ought to be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their own actions; how soon did their passions discover themselves about the way to govern them! And they all agreed in this, that there was great need to do it, and that it was impossible to do it without the principles of Vertue; for never was there any Philosopher so bad, <note place="margin">V. Lud. Viv. ad S. Aug. de <hi>Civit. Dei, l. 19. c. 1.</hi>
                     </note> as to think any man could be happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Vertue; even the <hi>Epicureans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves acknowledged it for one of their established Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

(although there never were so many, nor really could be upon his own grounds) yet not one of all these but made it necessary to be vertuous, in order to being happy, and those who did not think vertue to be desired for it self, yet made it a necessary means for the true pleasure and happiness of our lives.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62152:106"/>
But when they were agreed in this, that it was impossible for a vitious man to enjoy any true contentment of minde: they fell into nice and subtle disputes about the names and order of things to be chosen, and so lost the great effect of all their common principles. They pretended great cures for the disorders of mens lives, and excellent remedies against the common distempers of humane nature, but still the disease grew under the remedy, and their applications were too weak to allay the fury of their passions. It was neither the order and good of the Universe, nor the necessity of events, nor the things being out of our power, nor the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of humanity, no nor that comfort of ill natured men, as <hi>Carneades</hi> call'd it, the many companions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ons from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out when a great occasion was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented them. For he who had read all their discourses carefully, and was a great man himself, I mean <hi>Cicero,</hi> upon the death of his beloved daughter, was so far from being comforted by them, that he was fain to write a consolation for himself, in which the greatest cure (it may be) was the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version he found in writing it. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing these things had gone much farther,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62152:106"/>
and that all wise men could have govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their passions as to the troubles of this life (and certainly the truest wisdom lies in that). Yet what had all this been to a preparation for an eternal state, which they knew little of, and minded less? All their discourses about a happy life here, were vain, and contradicted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; when, after all their rants about their <hi>wise man being happy in the bull of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris,</hi> &amp;c. they yet allow'd him to dispatch himself if he saw cause, which a wise man would never do, if he thought himself happy when he did it. So that unless <hi>God</hi> himself had given assurance of a life to come, by the greatest demonstrations of it in the death and resurrection of his Son; all the considerations whatever could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have made mankinde happy. But by the Gospel he hath taken away all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions and doubts concerning another state, and hath declared his own readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be reconciled to us upon our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to pardon what hath been done amiss, and to give that divine assistance whereby our wills may be governed, and our passions subdued, and upon a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of our selves to his wise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and a sincere obedience to his Laws, he hath promised eternal salvation in the life to come.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:62152:107"/>
3. God hath given us the greatest <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance</hi> that these offers came from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; which the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives an account of here, saying, that <hi>this salvation began at first to be spoken by our Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein we have all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which the mindes of reasonable men could desire as to these things: It might be justly expected, that the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of so great news to the World should be no mean and ordinary person; neither was he, for the honour was as great in the person who brought it, as the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was in the thing it self: No less than the Eternal Son of God came down from the Bosom of his Father, to rectifie the mistakes of Mankinde, and not only to shew them the way to be happy, but by the most powerfull arguments to perswade them to be so. Nay, we find all the three persons of the Trinity here engaged in the great work of mans salvation; <hi>it was first spoken by our Lord, God also bearing them witness,</hi> and that <hi>with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> So that not only the first revelation was from God, but the testimony to confirm that it was so, was from him too; there being never so clear
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62152:107"/>
an attestation of any divine truths as was of the Doctrine of the Gospel. From whence it follows, that the foundation whereon our Faith stands, is nothing short of a <hi>divine testimony,</hi> which God gave to the truth of that revelation of his will; so vain are the cavils of those who say, we have nothing but meer <hi>probabilities</hi> for our <hi>Faith,</hi> and do interpret that manner of proof which matters of fact are capable of, in a sense derogatory to the firmness of our Christian Faith. As though we made the Spirit of God a <hi>Paraclete</hi> or <hi>Advocate</hi> in the worst sense, which might as well plead a bad as a good cause. No, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that <hi>God himself did bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to that doctrine <hi>deliver'd by our Lord,</hi> and that in a most signal and effectual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for the conviction of the world, by those demonstrations of a divine power which accompanyed the first Preachers of salvation by the Gospel of Christ. So that here the <hi>Apostle</hi> briefly and clearly resolves our Faith; if you ask, <hi>Why we believe that great salvation which the Gospel offers?</hi> the answer is, <hi>Because it was declared by our Lord,</hi> who neither could nor would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us: If it be asked, <hi>How we know that this was delivered by our Lord?</hi> he answers, because this was the constant Doctrine of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62152:108"/>
all his Disciples, <hi>of those who constantly heard him, and conversed with him.</hi> But if you ask again, <hi>how can we know, that their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was infallible, since they were but men,</hi> he then resolves all into that, <hi>that God bare witness to them by signs and wonders, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> And those persons whom these arguments will not convince, none other will. Who are we, that should not think that sufficient which God himself thought so! who are we, that dare question the certainty of that which hath had the <hi>Broad Seal</hi> of Heaven to attest it! Can any thing make it surer than God himself hath done? and can there be any other way more effectual for that end, than those demonstrations of a divine power and presence which the Apostles were acted by? Those that cavil at this way of proof, would have done so at any other, if God had made choice of it: and those who will cavil at any thing, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to be convinced by nothing; and such are not fit to be discoursed with.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here are the most prevailing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to perswade them to accept of these offers of salvation. There are two passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are the great hinges of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> mens Hopes and Fears, and therefore all Laws have had their sanctions
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62152:108"/>
suitable to these two in Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments: now there was never any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which gave greater encouragement to hope, never any punishment which made fear more reasonable than those are which the Gospel proposes. Will ever that man be good, whom the hopes of Heaven will not make so? or will ever that man leave his sins whom the fears of Hell will not make to do it? What other arguments can we imagine should ever have that power and influence on mankinde, which these may be reasonably supposed to have? Would you have God alter the methods of his Providence, and give his rewards and punishments in this life? but if so, what exercise would there be of the patience, forbearance and goodness of God towards wicked men? must he do it as soon as ever men sin? then he would never try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would repent and grow better? or must he stay till they have come to such a height of sin? then no persons would have cause to fear him, but such who are arrived at that pitch of wickedness: but how then should he punish them? must it be by continuing their lives, and making them miserable? but let them live, and they will sin yet further: must it be by utterly destroying them? that to persons, who
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62152:109"/>
might have time to sin the mean while, (supposing annihilation were all to be fear'd) would never have power enough to deterr men from the height of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness. So that nothing but the misery of a life to come, can be of force enough to make men fear God, and regard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and this is that which the Gospel threatens to those that neglect their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which it sometimes calls <hi>everlasting fire,</hi> sometimes <hi>the Worm that never dies,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 41. Mark 9 44. 1 Thess. 1. 10. 2 Thess. 1. 9.</note> sometimes <hi>the wrath to come,</hi> sometimes <hi>everlasting destruction,</hi> all enough to fill the minds of men with horror at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension; and what then will the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going it doe? Thence our Saviour, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably bids men, <hi>not fear them that can only kill the body, but are not able to kill the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>soul; but rather fear him which is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy both body and soul in hell.</hi> Thus the Gospel suggests the most proper object of fear, to keep men from sin, and as it doth that, so it presents likewise the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable object of hope to encourage men to be good; which is no less than a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness that is easier to hope to enjoy than to comprehend; a happiness infinitely above the most ambitious hopes and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this world; wherein greatness is added to glory, weight to greatness, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62152:109"/>
eternity to them all; therefore call'd <hi>a far</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Wherein the Joyes shall be full and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, the perception clear and undisturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the fruition with continual delight and continual desire. Where there shall be no fears to disquiet, no enemies to allarm, no dangers to conquer; nothing shall then be, but an uninterrupted peace, an unexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Joy, and pleasures for evermore. And what could be ever imagined more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to mindes tired out with the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this world, than such a repose as that is? What more agreeable to the minds and desires of good men, than to be eased of this clog of flesh, and to spend eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the fountain of all goodness, and <hi>the spirits of just men made perfect?</hi> What more ravishing delight to the souls that are purged, and <hi>made glorious by the blood of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 7. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Lamb,</hi> than to be <hi>singing Hallelujahs to him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever?</hi> How poor and low things are those which men hope for in this world, compared with that great salvation, which the Gospel makes to free a tender of? What a mean thing is it to be great in this world, to be honourable and rich, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be made the object of the envy of some, the malice of others, and at last it
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62152:110"/>
may be, an instance of this worlds vanity; and after all this to be for ever miserable? But O the wisdom of a well-chosen hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, that carries a man with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and peace through this life, and at last rewards him with a Crown of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting felicity. Thus we see the Gospel proposes the most excellent means to make men happy, if they be not guilty of a gross neglect of it; and if they be, that is their own act, and they must thank none but themselves if they be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But I pray, what reason can be given, since God is so tender of our happiness, that we should neglect it our selves? which is the next thing to be spoken to. There are three sorts of things we think we have reason to neglect: Such as are too <hi>mean,</hi> and unworthy our care, such as are so <hi>uncertain,</hi> that they will not recompence it, such as our own <hi>Interest</hi> is not at all concerned in; but I hope there are none who have an immortal soul, and the use of their understandings, can ever reckon their salvation under one of these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is it too <hi>mean</hi> an employment for you to minde the matters of your eternal welfare? Is Religion a beggarly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62152:110"/>
thing, that it doth not become the greatness of your mindes to stoop to take any notice of it? Hath God lost his honour so much with you, that his service should be the object of mens scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? But what is it which these brave spirits think a fit employment for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, while they despise God and his Worship? Is it to be curiously dressed, and make a fine shew, to think the time better spent at the Glass than at their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions? These indeed are weighty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and fit in the first place to be minded, if we were made only to be gazed upon. Is it meerly to see Playes, and read Romances, and to be great admirers of that vain and frothy discourse which all persons account wit but those which have it? This is such an end of mans life which no <hi>Philosopher</hi> ever thought of. Or is it to spend time in excesses and debaucheries, and to be slaves to as many lusts as will command them? This were something in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we had any other name given us but that of <hi>Men.</hi> Or lastly, is it to have their minds taken up with the great affairs of the World, to be wise in considering, carefull in managing the publick interest of a Nation? This is an employment, I grant, fit for the greatest mindes, but not

such which need at all to take them off from minding their eternal salvation. For the greatest wisdom is consistent with that, else Religion would be accounted folly, and I take it for granted, that it is never the truely wise man but the pretender that entertains any mean thoughts of Religion. And such a one uses the publick Interest no better than he doth Religion, only for a shew to the world, that he may carry on his own designs the better. And is this really such a valuable thing for a man to be contented to cheat himself of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness, that he may be able to cheat the world, and abuse his trust? I appeal then to the Consciences of all such who have any sense of humanity, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interest of mankinde, setting aside the considerations of a life to come, whether to be just and sober, vertuous and good, be not more suitable to the design of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, than all the vanities and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, all the little arts and designs which men are apt to please themselves with? And if so, shall the eternal happiness which follows upon being good, make it less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable to be so? No surely, but if God had required any thing to make us happy, which had been as contrary to our present Interest as the Precepts of Christianity
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62152:111"/>
are agreeable to it; yet the end would have made the severest commands easie, and those things pleasant which tend to make us happy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Are these things so <hi>uncertain,</hi> that they are not fit for a wise man to be solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about them? <hi>if they will come with a little care,</hi> they will say, <hi>they are desireable, but too much will unfit them for greater busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi> But do men believe these things to be true or not, when they say thus? if they be true, why need they fear their uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty? if they be certain, what pains and care can be too great about them? since a little will never serve to obtain them. Let but the care and diligence be proportionable to the greatness of the end, and the weight of the things, and you never need fear the want of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for all your labour. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you say, <hi>if you were fully convinced of their certainty, you would look more after them.</hi> What hinders you from being so convinced? Is it not a bad disposition of minde which makes you unwilling to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into them? examine things with a minde as free as you would have it, judge seriously according to the reason of things, and you will easily finde the interests of a life to come are far more certain, as well
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62152:112"/>
as more desireable than those of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life. And yet the great uncertainty of all the honours and riches of this world, never hinder the covetous or ambitious person from their great earnestness in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of them. And shall not then all the mighty arguments which God himself hath made use of to confirm to us, the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a life to come, prevail upon us to look more seriously after it? Shall the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible love of the Father, the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable sufferings of the Son of God, and the miraculous descent and powerfull assistance of the Holy Ghost have no more impression on our mindes, than to leave us uncertain of a future state? What mighty doubts and suspicions of God, what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusts of humane Nature, what unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ingratitude, and unaccountable folly lies at the bottom of all this uncertainty? <hi>O fools, and slow of heart to believe,</hi> not only <hi>what the Prophets have spoken, but what our Lord hath declared, God himself hath given testimony to, and the Holy Ghost hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed!</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. But is not your <hi>Interest</hi> concerned in these things? Is it all one to you whether your souls, be immortal or no? whether they live in eternal felicity, or unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able misery? Is it no more to you, than
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62152:112"/>
to know what kind of Bables are in request at the <hi>Indies,</hi> or whether the customs of <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Japan</hi> are the wiser, <hi>i. e.</hi> than the most trifling things, and the remotest from our knowledge. But this is so absurd and unreasonable to suppose, that men should not think themselves concern'd in their own eternal happiness and misery, that I shall not shew so much distrust of their understandings to speak any longer to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But if notwithstanding all these things our neglect still continues, then <hi>there remains nothing but a fearfull looking</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>for of judgement, and the fiery indignation of God.</hi> For there is no possibility of esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping if we continue to neglect so great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. All hopes of escaping are taken away, which are onely in that, which men neglect; and those who neglect their only way to salvation, must needs be miserable. How can that man ever hope to be saved by him whose <hi>blood</hi> he <hi>despises</hi> and <hi>tramples under foot?</hi> What grace and favour can he expect from God, who hath <hi>done despight unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> That hath cast away with reproach and contempt the greatest kindness and offers of Heaven. What can save him that resolves to be damned, and every one does so, who knows
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62152:113"/>
he shall be damned, if he lives in his sins, and yet continues to do so? God himself, in whose only pity our hopes are, hath irreversibly decreed that he will have no pity upon those, who despise his goodness, slight his threatnings, abuse his patience, and sin the more because he offers to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. It is not any delight that God takes in the miseries of his Creatures, which makes him punish them; but shall not God vindicate his own honour against obstinate and impenitent sinners? He declares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that he is far from delighting in their ruine, and that is the reason he hath made such large offers, and used so many means to make them happy; but if men resolve to despise his offers, and slight the means of their salvation, shall not <hi>God</hi> be <hi>just</hi> without being thought to be <hi>cruel?</hi> And we may assure our selves, none shall ever suffer, beyond the just desert of their sins, for <hi>punishment</hi> as the Apostle tells us in the words before the Text, is nothing <hi>but a just recompence of reward.</hi> And if there were such a one proportionable to the <hi>violation of the Law delivered by Angels;</hi> how shall we think <hi>to escape</hi> who <hi>neglect</hi> a more excellent means of happiness, which was delivered <hi>by our Lord himself?</hi> If God did not hate sin, and there were not a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62152:113"/>
punishment belonging to it, why did the Son of God die for the expiation of it? and if his death were the onely means of expiation, how is it possible that those who neglect that, should escape the punishment not only of their other sins, but of that great contempt of the means of our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him? Let us not then think to trifle with <hi>God,</hi> as though it were impossible a Being so mercifull and kind, should ever punish his Creatures with the miseries of another life: For, however we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our selves, <hi>God will not be mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 7, 8.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>I shall only propound some few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, to prevent so great a neglect as that of your salvation is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider, what it is you neglect, the <hi>offer</hi> of Eternal Happiness, the greatest kindness that ever was expressed to the World, the foundation of your present peace, the end of your beings, the stay of your mindes, the great desire of your Souls, the utmost felicity that humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of. Is it nothing to neglect the favour of a Prince, the kindness of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62152:114"/>
Great Men, the offers of a large and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Estate? but these are nothing to the neglect of the favour of God, the love of his Son, and that salvation which he hath purchased for you. Nay, it is not a bare neglect, but it implyes in it a mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt not only of the things offer'd, but of the kindness of him who offers them. If men had any due regard for God or themselves, if they had any esteem for his love, or their own welfare, they would be much more serious in Religion than they are. When I see a person wholly immersed in affairs of the World, or spending his time in luxury and vanity, can I possibly think that man hath any esteem of God or of his own Soul? when I finde one very serious in the pursuit of his Designs in the World, thoughtfull and busie, subtle in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, carefull in managing them; but very formal, remiss and negligent in all affairs of Religion, neither inquisitive about them, nor serious in minding them; what can we otherwise think, but that such a one doth really think the things of the World better worth looking after, than those which concern his eternal salvation. But consider, before it be too late, and repent of so great folly. Value an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62152:114"/>
Soul as you ought to doe, think what Reconciliation with God, and the Pardon of sin is worth, slight not the dear Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase which was bought at no meaner a rate than the Blood of the Son of God, and then you cannot but minde the great salvation which God hath tender'd you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider, on what terms you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, or what the things are for whose sake you are so great enemies to your own salvation. Have you ever found that contentment in sin or the vanities of the World, that for the sake of them, you are willing to be for ever miserable? What will you think of all your debaucheries, and your neglects of God and your selves, when you come to dye? what would you give then (if it were in your power to redeem your lost time) that you had spent your time less to the satisfaction of your sensual desires, and more in seeking to please God? How uncomfortable will the remembrance be of all your excesses, oaths, injustice and profaneness, when death approaches, and judgement follows it? What peace of mind will there then be to those who have served God with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and have endeavoured to <hi>work out
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62152:115"/>
their salvation,</hi> though it hath been <hi>with fear and trembling?</hi> But <hi>what would it</hi> then <hi>profit a man to have gained the whole World, and to lose his own soul?</hi> Nay, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable losers must they then be, that lose their Souls for that which hath no value at all, if compared with the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider, what follows upon this neglect, not only the loss of great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the incurring as great damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it. The Scripture describes the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of the life to come, not meerly by negatives, but by the most sensible and painfull things. If destruction be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that is <hi>everlasting destruction;</hi> if the anguish of the soul, and the pains of the body be so troublesom, what will <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction be both of Body and Soul in Hell?</hi> If a Serpent gnawing in our bowels be a representation of an insupportable misery here, what will that be of <hi>the Worm that never dies?</hi> if a raging and devouring fire; which can last but till it hath consumed a fading substance, be in its appearance so amazing, and in its pain so violent, what then will the enduring be of that wrath of God, which shall burn like fire, and yet be everlasting? Consider then of these things,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62152:115"/>
while God gives you time to consider of them; and think it an inestimable mercy that you have yet time to repent of your sins, to beg mercy at the hands of God, to redeem your time, to depart from iniquity, to be frequent in Prayer, carefull of your Actions, and in all things obedient to the will of God, and so God will pardon your former neglects, and grant you this great salvation.</p>

If it were once to be hoped, that all Mankinde would be wise and sober, that their judgements would be according to the truth of things, and their actions suitable to their judgements; we might then reasonably expect that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be valued so much as true goodness, nothing so much in contempt and disgrace as impiety and profaneness. But if we finde it much otherwise in the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62152:117"/>
Age we live in; we have so much the less cause to wonder at it; because it hath been thus, in those times we might have thought would have been far better than our own. I mean those times and ages, wherein there were not only great things first spoken and delivered to Mankinde, but examples as great as the things themselves; but these did so little prevail on the stupid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull world, that they among whom the <hi>Son of God</hi> did first manifest himself, seem'd only solicitous to make good one Prophesie concerning him, <hi>viz. That he should be despised and rejected of men.</hi> And they who suffer'd their malice to live as long as he did, were not contented to let it dye with him; but their fury increases as the Gospel does: and wherever it had spread it self, they pursue it with all the rude clamors, and violent persecutions which themselves or their factors could raise against it. This we have a large te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of, in those <hi>Jewish</hi> Christians to whom this Epistle was written; who had no sooner embraced the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but they were set upon by a whole army of persecutions. <hi>Heb. 10. 32. But call to remembrance the former dayes, in which after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions.</hi> As though the great
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62152:117"/>
enemy of souls, and therefore of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, had watched the first opportunity to make the strongest impression upon them, while they were yet young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced; and therefore less able to resist so sharp an encounter. He had found how unsuccessfull the offer of the good things of this World had been with their Lord and Master; and therefore was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to try what a severer course would do with all his followers. But the same spirit by which he despised <hi>all the Glories of the World,</hi> which the Tempter would have made him believe he was the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of; enabled them with a mighty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and strange transports of joy, not only to bear their own share of reproaches and afflictions, but a part of theirs who suffer'd with them, <hi>v.</hi> 33, 34. But least through continual duty, occasion'd by the hatred of their persecutors, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their afflictions; their courage should abate, and their spirits saint; the Apostle finds it necessary, not only to put them in mind of their former magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; but to make use of all arguments that might be powerfull with them, to keep up the same vigour and constancy of mind in bearing their sufferings, which they had at first. For he well knew, how
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62152:118"/>
much it would tend to the dishonour of the Gospel, as well as to their own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort; if after such an early proof of a great and undaunted spirit, it should be said of them, as was once of a great <hi>Roman</hi> Captain, <hi>Ultima Primis cedebant;</hi> that they should decline in their reputation as they did in their years; and at last sink under that weight of duty which they had born with so much honour before. Therefore, as a General in the Field, after a sharp and fierce encounter at first, with a mighty resolution by his Souldiers; when he finds by the number and fresh recruits of the enemy, that his smaller forces are like to be born down before them; and through meer weariness of fighting are ready to turn their backs, or yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to the enemies mercy; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures them by the honour they have gain'd, and the courage they had already expressed, by their own interest, and the example of their Leaders, by the hopes of glory, and the fears of punishment, that they would bear the last shock of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies force, and rather be the Trophies of their Courage than of their Triumphs: so does our Apostle, when he finds some among them begin to debate, whether they had best to stand it out or no; he
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62152:118"/>
conjures them, 1. By the remembrance of their own former courage, whereby they did bear as sharp tryals as these could be, with the greatest chearfulness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy; and what could they gain by yielding at last, but great dishonour to themselves, that they had suffer'd so long to no purpose, unless it were to discover their own weakness and inconstancy. 2. By the hopes of a reward which would sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow their faithfulness; <hi>v. 35, 36. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise:</hi> and the <hi>time will not be long</hi> ere ye come to enjoy it, <hi>v.</hi> 37. but <hi>if ye draw back,</hi> you lose all your former labours, for he who alone is able to recompence you, hath said, <hi>that if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him,</hi> v. 38. and then from the example of himself, and all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine followers of Christ, <hi>but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul,</hi> v. 39. But least these examples should not be enough to perswade them; he conjures them by the name of all those who were as eminent for the greatness of their minds as the strength of their Faith; who have
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62152:119"/>
despised the frowns as well as the smiles of the world; and were not discouraged by the severest tryals from placing their confidence in God, and their hopes in a life to come; and all this done <hi>by persons who had not received the Promise:</hi> Heb. 11. 39. and could there be a greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to the clearness of that light we enjoy above them, if we only grew fainter by it? And therefore in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Chapter he encourages them by that army of Martyrs which had gone before them, <hi>by that Cloud of witnesses</hi> which did both direct and refresh them, that they would <hi>lay aside every thing which was apt to oppress or dishearten them, but especially their sinfull fears, which they were so easily betray'd by, and so run with patience the race that was set before them,</hi> v. 1. But, saith he, if none of these will prevail with you, there is an example yet behinde, which ought above all others to heighten your courage, and that is, of the <hi>Captain of your salvation, the author and finisher of your faith,</hi> under whom you serve, and from whom you expect your reward; and as <hi>Caesar</hi> once said to his Souldiers, when he saw them ready to retreat out of the field, <hi>Videte quem, &amp; quo loco Imperatorem deserturi estis,</hi> Remember what kinde of Generall you
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62152:119"/>
forsake, and in what place you leave him: one whom you have vow'd your lives and your service to, one who hath thought nothing too dear, which was to be done for your good, one that will be ready to reward the least service you can do for him, one that is ready to assist you to the utmost in what you undertake, one that hath already undergone far more for your sakes, than ever you can do for his; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Consider him that endured such contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary, and faint in your minds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words we have represented to us, the unparallel'd example of courage and patience under sufferings, in our Lord and Saviour; and the great influence that it ought to have on all those who are call'd by his Name, that they would not disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour so excellent a pattern of enduring sufferings, by weakness or dejection of mind. Christianity is a Religion which above all others does arm men against all the contingencies and miseries of the life of man: yea, it makes them serviceable to the most advantageous purposes that the greatest blessings can be designed for. It raises the minds of men higher than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to consider, the common condition of humane nature, the unavoidableness of such
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62152:120"/>
things which are out of our own power, and the unreasonableness of tormenting our selves about the things which are so, and that most mens conditions in the world as to their contentment, depends more upon their minds, than their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumstances; though these are things very fit for us as men to consider and make use of; yet they do not reach to that height, which the consideration of a life to come, and the tendency of all our sufferings here to the inhancement of our future glory may raise us to. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering not only the weight of the arguments in themselves, but the force they receive from the example of him, <hi>who for the joy that was set before him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Cross, and despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> By which mighty instance we find, that the sufferings of this life are so far from being inconsistent with the joyes of another, that he who is <hi>the Captain of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, was made perfect through sufferings,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note> and therefore none of his followers have cause to be dejected under them. But that we may the better understand the force of this argument, we shall consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What those things were which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>

2. From whom he suffer'd them, <hi>it was the contradiction of sinners against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that Way and manner he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For what ends he did it. And when we have considered these, we shall see the influence this example of Christs suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ought to have upon our constancy and patience: which will be the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full improvement of it to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What those things were</hi> which Christ endured; which are here comprehended under those words, <hi>the contradiction of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> It is agreed by the best Expositors, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> that under this phrase of the contradiction of sinners, the whole history of our Saviours sufferings is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. All the injuries, reproaches, false accusations, all the cruelties, indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and violence, which were offer'd him, from the time of his publick appearance to his expiring upon the Cross, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone by him, by the malice of unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable men, may be call'd <hi>the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of sinners.</hi> For the sense of this word extends as well to actions as words; and the summe of all that which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour suffer'd from them, may be reduced under these heads. 1. The ill entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62152:121"/>
of his Doctrine. 2. The disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Miracles. 3. The violence offer'd to his Person.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ill entertainment of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; which must needs seem very strange to these who do not consider what a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s the clearest reason hath to the minds of such who are governed by inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and prejudice. Though all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies concerning the <hi>Messias</hi> were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in him; though the expectations of the people were great at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the appearance of him that was to redeem his people; though all the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of time, place, and person, did fully agree to what was foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; though his Doctrine were as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Son of God to reveal, as the sons of men to receive; though the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted innocency of his life were so great, as made him weary of his own that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him: yet because he came not with the pomp and splendor which they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they despise his Person, revile his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, persecute his followers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive his ruine. What could have been imagined more probable, than that the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, which had waited long in expectation of the <hi>Messias</hi> coming, should have welcom'd his approach with the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62152:121"/>
greatest joy, and receiv'd the Message he brought with a kindness only short of that which he shewed in coming among them? Was it nothing to be eased of that heavy burden of the Ceremonial Law, which neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear? and that God was willing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the chargeable and troublesome service of the Temple, for the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and spiritual Worship of himself? Was it nothing to have the Promises of a Land which now groaned under the weight of its oppressions, turned into those of an eternal state of bliss and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality? and to change the Lamps of the Temple, for the glorious appearance of the Sun of Righteousness? Was it nothing to have an offer of Peace and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God made them, after they had suffer'd so much under the fury of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure? Was a meer temporal delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by some mighty Conquerour from the subjection they were in to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, so much more valuable a thing, than an eternal redemption from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Hell and the Grave? Are the pomps and vanities of this present life, such great things in Gods account, that it was not possible for his Son to appear without them? Nay, how unsuitable had it been
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62152:122"/>
for one who came to preach humility, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, self-denyall, and contempt of the world, to have made an ostentation of the State and Grandeur of it? So that either he must have changed his Doctrine, or rendred himself lyable to the suspicion of seeking to get this world by the preaching of another. And if his Doctrine had been of another kinde, he might have been esteemed a great person among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but not the Son of God, or the promised <hi>Messias, in whom all Nations of the Earth should be blessed.</hi> Which surely they would never have thought themselves to have been, in one, who must have subdued the neighbour Nations to advance the honour of his own. But since the Son of God thought fit to appear in another manner than they expected him, they thought themselves too great to be saved by so mean a Saviour. If he had made all the Kingdoms of the Earth to have bowed under him, and the Nations about them to have been all tributaries to them; if <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had been made the Seat of an Empire as great as the World it self, they would then have gloried in his Name, and entertained whatever he had said, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or false, with a wonderfull Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. But Truth in an humble dress
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62152:122"/>
meets with few admirers; they could not imagine so much Power and Majesty could ever shroud it self under so plain a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise. Thus Christ <hi>came to his own, and</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The disparagement of his Miracles. Since the bare proposal of his Doctrine, though never so reasonable, could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to believe him to be the Son of God, he offers them a further proof of it by the mighty works which were wrought by him. And though the more ingenuous among them were ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>that no man could do the things which he did, unless God were with him:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 3. 2.</note>

yet they who were resolved to hear and see, and not understand; when they found it not for their credit, to deny matters of fact so universally known and attested, they seek all the means to blast the reputation of them that may be. Sometimes raising popular insinuations against him, that he was a man of no austere life, a friend of Publicans and sinners, one that could choose no other day to do his works on, but that very day wherein God himself did rest from his; and therefore no great regard was to be had to what such a one did. When these arts would not take, but the people found the benefit of his Miracles, in healing the sick, curing the blinde and the lame, feeding the hungry; then they undervalue all these in comparison with the wonders that were wrought by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wilderness. If he would have made the Earth to open her mouth, and swallow up the City and the power of <hi>Rome;</hi> if he would have fed a mighty Army with bread from Heaven, in stead of feeding some few thousands with very small Provisions; if in stead of raising one <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Grave, he would have raised up their <hi>Sampsons,</hi> and their <hi>Davids,</hi> their men of spirit and conduct, whose very presence would have put a new life,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62152:123"/>
into the hearts of the people; if in stead of casting out <hi>Devils,</hi> he would have cast out the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom they hated the worse of the two: if he would have set himself to the cure of a distempered State, instead of healing the maladies of some few inconsiderable persons: if instead of being at the expense of a Miracle to pay tribute, he would have hinder'd them from paying any at all; then a <hi>Second Moses</hi> would have been too mean a title for him, he could have been no less than the promised <hi>Messias,</hi> the <hi>Son of God.</hi> But while he imploy'd his power another way, the demonstration of it made them hate him the more; since they thought with themselves what strange things they would have done with it for the benefit of their Countrey; and therefore express the greatest malice against him, because he would not imploy it as they would have him. From thence, they condemn his Miracles as only some effects of a Magical skill; and say, he dispossessed the lesser <hi>Devils</hi> by the power of him that was the <hi>Prince</hi> among them. So unworthy a requital did they make for all the mighty works which had been done among them; <hi>Which,</hi> as our Saviour saith, <hi>if they had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 21.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But although all this argued a strange spirit of <hi>contradiction</hi> in them to all the designs for their own good; yet the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice from whence that rose, would not stop here; for as they had long contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his ruine, so they watched only an opportunity to effect it. Which his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent presence at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> seemed to put into their hands, but his reputation with the people made them fearfull of embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it. Therefore they imploy their Agents to deal privately with one of his Disciples who might be fittest for their design; and to work upon his covetous humour by the promise of a reward, to bring him to betray his Master with the greatest privacy into their hands. This <hi>Judas</hi> undertakes, knowing the place and season of his Masters retirements, not far from the City, where they might with the greatest secrecy and safety seize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his person. Which contrivance of theirs our Saviour was not at all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of; but prepares himself and his Disciples for this great encounter. He institutes his solemn Supper, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually observed in remembrance of his death and sufferings; after which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62152:124"/>
admirably with his Disciples, to arm them against their future sufferings; and prays that most divine Prayer, S. <hi>John</hi> 17. which he had no sooner finished, but he goes with his Disciples to the usual place of his retirement in a <hi>Garden</hi> at the foot of the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Olives.</hi> And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the blackest Scene of sufferings that ever was acted upon humane Nature. Which was so great, that the Son of God himself expresseth a more than usual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of it; which he discovered by the <hi>Agony</hi> he was in, in which he sweat <hi>drops of blood;</hi> by the earnestness of his <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 44.</note> Prayer, falling upon his knees, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thrice, saying, <hi>O my Father, if it be</hi>

                     <hi>possible, let this Cup pass from me; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Surely, this Cup must needs have a great deal of bitterness in it, which the Son of God was so earnest to be freed from. If there had been nothing in it but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly incident to humane Nature, as to the apprehensions of death or pain, it seems strange, that he who had the greatest innocency, the most perfect charity, the freest resignation of himself, the fullest assurance of the reward to come, should express a greater sense of the horror of his sufferings, than thousands did, who
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62152:125"/>
suffer'd for his sake. But now was <hi>the hour come</hi> wherein the Son of God was to be made a Sacrifice for the sins of Men; wherein he was <hi>to bear our griefs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our sorrows;</hi> when he was <hi>to be wounded</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 53. 4. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities;</hi> now <hi>his soul was exceeding sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull</hi>

                     <hi>even unto death;</hi> for now <hi>the hour of his enemies was come, and the power of</hi>

                     <hi>darkness.</hi> And accordingly they improve it; they come out against him as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, with swords and staves, and having seized his Person, being betray'd into their hands by one of his Disciples, they carry him to the High Priests house, where his professed enemies presently condemn him of Blasphemy, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 66, 67.</note> with this, they express the greatest contempt of him, for they spit in his face, they buffet him, and smite him with the Palms of their hands, they mock him, and bid him prophesie who it was that smote him; so insolent was their malice grown, and so spightfull was their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against him. And so fearfull were they, lest he should escape their hands, that the very next morning early, they send him bound to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, to have the sentence pronounced against him, to whom they accuse him of Sedition
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62152:125"/>
and Treason; but <hi>Pilate</hi> upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him declares, <hi>he found no fault in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>him;</hi> which made them heap more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable calumnies upon him, being resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by what means soever to take away his life. Nay, the price of the blood of the Son of God was fallen so low with them, that they preferred the life of a known seditious person, and a Murtherer before him. And when <hi>Pilate</hi> being unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, asked still, <hi>what evil he had aone?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 23.</note> they continue their importunity without any other answer but <hi>Crucifie him,</hi> and making up what wanted in Justice and Reason in the loudness of their clamors. And at last seeing the fury and madness of the people, with the protestation of his own innocency as to his blood, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers him up to the people; and now he is stripped, and scourged, and mock'd, with <hi>a Crown of Thorns, a Scarlet Robe,</hi> and a <hi>Reed in his hand:</hi> all the indignities they could think of, they put upon him. But though it pleased them, to have him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to all the ignominies imaginable, yet nothing would satisfie them but <hi>his blood;</hi> and therefore he is led forth to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and though so lately scourged and weakened by his sorrows, yet he is made to carry his own Cross (at least through
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62152:126"/>
the City) for no other death could satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, but the most ignominious, and painfull. And when he was brought to the place of Crucifixion, they nail his hands and feet to the Cross, and while he was hanging there, they deride and mock him still, they divide his garments before his face, give him Gall and Vinegar to drink, and the last act of violence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon him, was the piercing of his side, so that out of his <hi>Pericardium</hi> issued <hi>both water and blood.</hi> Thus did the Son of <note place="margin">John 19. 34.</note> God suffer at the hands of unreasonable men; thus was the blood of that immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Lamb spilt by the hands of violence; and he who left the bosom of his Father, to bring us to glory, was here treated as if he had been unworthy to live upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But that which yet heightens these sufferings of Christ, is to consider, <hi>from whom</hi> he suffer'd these things, it was <hi>from sinners;</hi> which is as much as to say, from <hi>men,</hi> if the word were taken in the largest sense of it; for all have sinned; but being taken by us in opposition to other men, so it implyes a greater height of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in these than in other persons. But this is not here to be consider'd absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as denoting what kinde of persons he
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62152:126"/>
suffer'd from, but with a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the nature of their proceedings with him, and the obligations that lay upon them to the contrary. So that the first shews the injustice and unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of them; the second, their great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, considering the kindness and good will which he expressed towards them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Injustice and unreasonableness of their proceedings against him. It is true indeed, (what <hi>Socrates</hi> said to his wife, when she complained that he suffer'd unjustly, <hi>What,</hi> saith he, <hi>and would you have me suffer justly?)</hi> it is much greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the person who does suffer, when he does it unjustly, but it is a far greater reflection on those who were the causes of it. And that our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> did suffer with the greatest injustice from these men, is apparent from the falseness and weakness of all the accusations which were brought against him. To accuse the <hi>Son of God</hi> for Blasphemy, in saying, he was so, is as unjust as to condemn a <hi>King</hi> for treason, because he saith he is a <hi>King:</hi> they ought to have examined the grounds on which he call'd himself so; and if he had not given pregnant evidences of it, than to have passed sentence upon him as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62152:127"/>
and Blasphemer. If the thing were true, that he was what he said, <hi>the Son of God,</hi> what horrible guilt was it in them, to imbrue their hands in his blood? and they found he alwayes attested it, and now was willing to lay down his life to confirm the truth of what he said. This surely ought at least to have made them more inquisitive into what he had affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but they allow him not the liberty of a fair tryall; they hasten and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the sentence, that they might do so the execution. If he were condemned as a false Prophet; (for that seems to be the occasion of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> meeting to do it, to whom the cognisance of that did particularly belong) why do they not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what it was he had foretold, which had not come to pass; or what reason do they give why he had usurped such an Office to himself? If no liberty were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed under pain of death for any to say, that they were sent from God, how was it possible for the <hi>Messias</hi> ever to appear, and not be condemned? for the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him was, that he should be a great person immediately sent from God, for the delivery of his people. And should he be sent from God, and not say that he was so? for how then could men know
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62152:127"/>
that he was? So that their way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with him, discovers it self to be manifestly unjust, and contrary to their own avowed expectations. Neither were they more successefull in the accusation of him before <hi>Pilate;</hi> why did not the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses appear to make good the charge of sedition and treason against him? where were the proofs of any thing tending that way? Nay, that which abundantly testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the innocency of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as to all the matters he was accused of, was that the <hi>Roman Governour,</hi> after a full exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the cause, declares him innocent, and that not only once but several times, and was fully satisfied in the Vindication he made of himself; so that nothing but the fear of what the <hi>Jewes</hi> threatned, <hi>viz.</hi> accusing him to <hi>Caesar</hi> (a thing he had cause enough otherwise to be afraid of) which made him at last yield to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. But there was one circumstance more which did highly discover the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Christ, and the injustice of his sufferings, which was <hi>Judas</hi>'s confession and end; the man who had betray'd his Lord, and had receiv'd the wages of his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but was so unquiet with it, that in the time when his other Disciples durst not own him, he with a great <hi>impetus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62152:128"/>
to them with his Money, throws it among them with that sad farewell to them all, <hi>I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>innocent blood.</hi> What could have been said more for his Vindication at this time than this was, by such a person as <hi>Judas,</hi> one who had known our Saviour long, and had been the fittest instrument, if any guilt could have been fasten'd upon him, to have managed the accusation against him; but the anxiety of his minde was too great for what he had done already, to live to do them any longer service; for either his grief suffocated him, or his guilt made him hang himself; for the words will sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie either. Neither can it be said by any modern <hi>Jews,</hi> that all the testimony we have of these things is from his own Disciples; but that certainly they had some greater matter to accuse him of; which we now have lost. For how is it possible to conceive, that a matter so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant as that was, should be lost by those of their own Nation, who were so highly concerned to vindicate themselves in all places, as soon as the <hi>Gospel</hi> was spread abroad in the World? For the guilt of this blood was every where by the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

2. This <hi>contradiction</hi> of theirs to Christ was an act of high Ingratitude. It was a sharp but very just rebuke which the <hi>Jews</hi> received from <hi>our Saviour,</hi> when they were once ready to stone him; <hi>Many good works have I shewed you from my Father, for which of those works do you stone me?</hi> The <note place="margin">John 10. 32</note> very same might have been applyed to his Judges and accusers, when they were about to crucifie him. For what was his whole Life after he appeared publickly, but a constant design of doing good? His presence had far more vertue for the curing all bodily distempers, than the <hi>Pool</hi> of <hi>Bethesda</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the <hi>Temples</hi> of <hi>AEsculapius</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> What wonders were made of very small things done by other persons, as the cure of a blinde Man by <hi>Vespasian!</hi> when such mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of far more certain and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cures, can hardly keep up the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any thing extraordinary in him. But though his kindness was great to the bodies of men, where they were fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of pity and compassion; yet it was far greater to their souls, that being more agreeable to the design of his coming into the World; for the other tended to raise such an esteem of him as might ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Souls. And to shew, that this was his great business, wherever he comes, he discourses about these things, takes every opportunity that might be improved for that end, refuses no company he might do good upon, and converses not with them with the pride and arrogance of either the <hi>Pharisees</hi> or <hi>Philosophers,</hi> but with the greatest meekness, humility and patience. How admirable are his more solemn dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, especially that upon the Mount, and that wherein he takes leave of his Disciples! How dry and insipid are the most sublime discourses of the <hi>Philosophers</hi> compared with these! how clearly doth he state our Duties, and what mighty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements does he give to practise them! how forcibly does he perswade men to self-denyal and contempt of the world! how excellent and holy are all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts! how serviceable to the best interest of men in this life and that to come! how suitable and desireable to the souls of good men are the rewards he promises! what exact rule of Righteousness hath he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to men, <hi>in doing as they would be done by!</hi> with what vehemency doth he rebuke all hypocrisie and <hi>Pharisaism!</hi> with what tenderness and kindness does he treat those that have any reall inclinations to

true goodness! with what earnestness does he invite, and with what love doth he embrace all repenting sinners! with what care doth he instruct, with what mildness doth he reprove, with what patience doth he bear with his own disciples! Lastly, with what authority did he both speak and live, such as commanded a reverence, where it did not beget a love! And yet after a life thus spent, all the requital he met with, was to be reproached, despised, and at last crucified. O the dreadfull effects of malice and hypocrisie! for these were the two great enemies which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes proclaimed open war with; and these at first contrived, and at last effected his cruel death. What baseness, ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, cruelty, injustice, (and what not?) will those two sins betray men to, when they have once taken possession of the hearts of men! for we can finde nothing else at the bottom of all that wretched conspiracy against our Saviour; but that his doctrine and design was too pure and holy for them; and therefore they study to take him away who was the author of them.</p>

                     <hi>for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow his steps; who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth; who when he was reviled, reviled not again: when he suffered, be threatned not, but committed himself to him that judged righteously.</hi> He uses none of those ranting expressions which none of the patientest persons in the world were accustomed to; of bidding them <hi>laugh in Phalaris his Bull;</hi> and when they were racked with pains, to cry out, <hi>Nil agis do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor:</hi> he tells them not, that it is their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have no sense of torments, and to be jocund and pleasant when their flesh is torn from them, or nailed to a Cross; if this be any kinde of fortitude, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of a <hi>Gladiator</hi> than of a wise man or a Christian. The worst of men either through a natural temper of body, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hardned themselves by custom, have born the greatest torments with the least expression of grief under them.

The malice and rage of his enemies did not at all provoke him; unless it were to pity and pray for them.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62152:133"/>
consider, how much our salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the knowledge of it, and how clear and express the Scripture is in assigning the causes of the sufferings of Christ. Which though as far as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments were concerned in it, we have given an account of already, yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the particular management of this grand affair by the care of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a higher account must be given of it, why so divine and excellent a person should be exposed to all the contempt and reproach imaginable, and after being made a sacrifice to the tongues and rods of the people, than to dye a painfull and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death? So that allowing but that common care of divine Providence, which all sober <hi>Heathens</hi> acknowledged, so transcendent sufferings as these were, of so holy and innocent a person, ought to be accounted for, in a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner; when they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves concerned to vindicate the Justice of Gods Providence in the common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of those who are reputed to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the generality of Mankind. But the reasons assigned in that common case will not hold here, since this was a person immediately sent from God upon a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular message to the World, and therefore
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62152:134"/>
might plead an exemption by vertue of his Ambassage from the common <hi>Arrests</hi> and troubles of humane nature. But it was so far otherwise, as though God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed him on purpose to let us see how much misery humane nature can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. Some think themselves to go as far as their reason will permit them; when they tell us, that he suffer'd all these things <hi>to confirm the truth of what he had said,</hi> and particularly <hi>the Promise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins,</hi> and that <hi>he might be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to others, who should go to Heaven by suffering afterwards,</hi> and that <hi>he might, being touched with the feeling of our infirmities here, have the greater pity upon us now he is in Heaven.</hi> All these I grant to have been true and weighty reasons of the sufferings of Christ, in subordination <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o greater ends, but if there had been nothing beyond all this, I can neither understand why he should suffer so deeply as he did, nor why the Scripture should insist upon a far greater reason more than upon any of these? I grant, the death of Christ did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of his Doctrine, as far as it is unreasonable to believe that any one who knew his Doctrine to be false, would make himself miserable to make others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; but if this had been all intended,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62152:134"/>
why would not an easier and less ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious death have served? since he who would be willing to die to confirm a falshood, would not be thought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a truth by his death, because it was painfull and shamefull. Why, if all his sufferings were designed as a testimony to others, of the truth of what he spake, were the greatest of his sufferings, such as none could know the anguish of them but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, I mean his <hi>Agony</hi> in the Garden, and that which made him cry out upon the Cross, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me?</hi> Why were not his Miracles enough to confirm the truth of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? since the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without his death, by the evidence his Miracles gave that he was sent from God; since the Doctrine of remission of sins had been already deliver'd by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and received by the People of the <hi>Jews;</hi> since those who would not believe for his Miracles sake, neither would they believe though they should have seen him rise from the Grave, and therefore not surely because they saw him put into it. But of all things, the manner of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> sufferings seems least designed to bring the World to the belief of his Doctrine, which was the main obstacle to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment

But if it be alledged further, <hi>that God now entring into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with man for the pardon of sin, the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the blood of Christ was necessary as a federal rite to confirm it.</hi> I answer, if only
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62152:135"/>
as a federal rite, why no cheaper blood would serve to confirm it but that of the Son of God? We never read that any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was confirmed by the death of one of the contracting parties; and we cannot think that God was so prodigal of the blood of his Son, to have it shed only in allusion to some ancient customs. But if there were such a necessity of alluding to them, why might not the blood of any other person have done it? when yet all that custom was no more, but that a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice should be offer'd, and upon the parts of the sacrifice divided, they did solemnly swear and ratifie their Covenant. And if this be yielded them, it then follows from <note place="margin">V. Heins. not. ad Sil. p. 9, 10.</note> this custom, that Christ must be consider'd as a <hi>sacrifice</hi> in his death; and so the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Covenant must be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to that oblation which he made of himself upon the Cross. Besides, how incongruous must this needs be, that the death of Christ the most innocent person in the World, without any respect to the guilt of sin, should suffer so much on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to assure us, that God will pardon those who are guilty of it? May we not much rather infer the contrary, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holiness and justice of Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if he dealt so severely <hi>with the green
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62152:136"/>
tree, how much more will he with the dry?</hi> If one so innocent suffer'd so much, what then may the guilty expect? If a Prince should suffer the best subject he hath, to be severely punished, could ever any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it was with a design to assure them that he would pardon the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious? No; but would it not rather make men afraid of being too innocent, for fear of suffering too much for it? And those who seem very carefull to preserve the honour of Gods Justice, in not punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one for anothers faults, ought likewise to maintain it in the punishing of one who had no fault at all to answer for. And to think to escape this by saying, <hi>that to such a person such things are calamities, but no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,</hi> is to revive the ancient explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Stoicism, which thought to reform the diseases of Mankind by meer change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the names of things, though never so contrary to the common sense of humane nature: which judges of the nature of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments by the evils men undergo, and the ends they are designed for. And by the very same reason that God might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise his dominion on so innocent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as our Saviour was, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to sin <hi>as the moving cause to it,</hi> he might lay eternal torments on a most innocent
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62152:136"/>
Creature (for degrees and continuance do not alter the reason of things) and then escape with the same evasion, that this was no act of injustice in God, because it was a meer exercise of Dominion. And when once a sinner comes to be perswaded by this that God will pardon him, it must be by the hopes that God will shew kindness to the guilty, because he shews so little to the innocent; and if this be agreeable to the Justice and Holiness of Gods nature, it is hard to say what is repugnant to it. If to this it be said, <hi>that Christs consent made it no unjust exercise of dominion in God towards him:</hi> it is easily answer'd, that the same consent will make it less injustice in God to lay the punishment of our sins upon Christ, upon his undertaking to satisfie for us; for then the consent supposes a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cause of punishment; but in this case the consent implyeth none at all. And we are now enquiring into the reasons of such sufferings, and consequently of such a consent; which cannot be imagined but upon very weighty motives, such as might make it just in him to consent, as well as in God to inflict.</p>
                  <p>Neither can it be thought that all the design of the sufferings of Christ, was <hi>to give us an example</hi> and an incouragement
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62152:137"/>
to suffer our selves; though it does so in a very great measure, as appears by the Text it self. For the hopes of an eternal reward for these short and light afflictions, ought to be encouragement enough, to go through the miseries of this life in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a better to come. And the <hi>Cloud of Witnesses,</hi> both under the Law and the Gospel, of those who have suffer'd for righteousness sake, ought to make no one think it strange, if he must endure that, which so many have done before him, and been crowned for it. And lastly, to question whether <hi>Christ could have pity enough upon us in our sufferings,</hi> unless he had suffer'd so deeply himself; will lead men to distrust the pity and compassion of Almighty God, because he was never ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of suffering, as we do. But the <hi>Scripture</hi> is very plain and full (to all those who rack not their minds to pervert it) in assigning a higher reason than all these of the <hi>sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> viz. That <hi>Christ suffered for sins, the just for the unjust;</hi> that <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>his soul was made an offering for sin,</hi> and that <hi>the Lord</hi> therefore as on a sacrifice of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Isa. 53. 10.</note>

Not as though Christ did suffer the very same which we should have suffer'd, for that was eternal death as the consequent of guilt in the person of the Offender, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62152:138"/>
then the discharge must have been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately consequent upon the payment, and no room had been left for the freeness of remission, or for the conditions required on our parts; But that God was pleased to accept of the death of his Son, <hi>as a full, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the sins of the World;</hi> as our Church expresseth it; and in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sufferings of his Son, is pleased to offer pardon of sin upon sincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and eternal life upon a holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his will. Thus much for the things we are to consider concerning <hi>the contradiction of sinners which Christ endured against himself.</hi>

                  <p>Nothing now remains, but the influence that ought to have upon us, lest we be weary and faint in our minds. For which end I shall suggest two things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The vast disproportion between Christs sufferings and ours.</item>
                     <item>2. The great encouragement we have from his sufferings, to bear our own the better.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. The vast Disproportion between Christs sufferings and our own. Our lot is fallen into suffering times; and we are apt enough to complain of it. I will not say it is wholly true of us, what the <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:62152:138"/>
saith generally of the complaints of men, <hi>Non quia dura sed quia molles patimur;</hi> that it is not the hardness of our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons so much as the softness of our spirits which makes us complain of them. For I must needs say, this <hi>City</hi> hath smarted by such a series and succession of judgements which few Cities in the world could pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel in so short a time. The Plague hath emptied its houses, and the fire consumed them; the War exhausted our spirits, and it were well if Peace recovered them. But still these are but the common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of humane nature, things that we ought to make account of in the World; and to grow the better by them. And it were happy for this City; if our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and obedience were but answerable to the mercies we yet enjoy: let us not make our condition worse by our fears; nor our fears greater than they need to be: for no enemy can be so bad as they. Thanks be to God our condition is much better at present than it hath been; let us not make it worse by fearing it may be so. Complaints will never end till the World does; and we may imagine that will not last much longer; when the City thinks it hath trade enough, and the Countrey riches enough. But I will not go about
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62152:139"/>
to perswade you that your condition is better than it is, for I know it is to no purpose to do so; all men will believe as they feel. But suppose our condition were much worse than it is; yet what were all our sufferings compared with those of our Saviour for us? the sins that make us smart, wounded him much deeper; they pierced his side, which only touch our skin; we have no cause to complain of the bitterness of that Cup which he hath drunk off the dreggs of already. We lament over the ruins of a City, and are revived with any hopes of seeing it rise out of the dust; but Christ saw the ruins that sin caused in all mankind, he undertook the repairing them, and putting men into a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than before: And we may easily think what a difficult task he had of it; when he came to restore them who were delighted in their ruins, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too good to be mended. It is the comfort of our miseries, (if they be only in this life) that we know they cannot last long; but that is the great aggravation of our Saviours sufferings, that the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of sinners continues against him still. Witness, the <hi>Atheisme,</hi> I cannot so properly call it, as the <hi>Antichristianism</hi> of this present Age; wherein so many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62152:139"/>
persons act over again the part of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees;</hi> they slight his Doctrine, despise his Person, disparage his Miracles, contemn his Precepts, and undervalue his Sufferings. Men live as if it were in defiance to his holy Laws; as though they feared not what God can do, so much as to need a <hi>Mediator</hi> between him and them. If ever men <hi>tread under foot the Son of God,</hi> it is when they think themselves to be above the need of him; if ever they count <hi>the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant an unholy thing,</hi> it is not only when they do not value it as they ought, but when they exercise their profane wits upon it. <hi>Blessed Saviour!</hi> was it not enough for thee to bear the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinners upon Earth; but thou must still suffer so much at the hands of those whom thou dyedst for, that thou mightest bring them to Heaven? was it not enough for thee to be betrayed on Earth, but thou must be defied in Heaven? Was it not enough for thee to stoop so low for our sakes, but that thou shouldest be trampled on because thou didst it? was the ignominious death upon the Cross too small a thing for thee to suffer in thy Person, unless thy Religion be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and exposed to as much shame
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62152:140"/>
and mockery as thy self was? Unhappy we, that live to hear of such things! but much more unhappy if any of our sins have been the occasion of them: If our unsuitable lives to the Gospel have open'd the mouths of any against so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Religion. If any malice and revenge, any humour and peevishness, any pride or hypocrisie, any sensuality and voluptuousness, any injustice, or too much love of gain, have made others despise that Religion which so many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, and so few practise. If we have been in any measure guilty of this, as we love our Religion, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Saviour, let us endeavour by the holiness and meekness of our spirits, the temperance and justice of our actions, the patience and contentedness of our minds, to recover the honour of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which only can make us happy, and our Posterity after us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What Encouragement we have from the sufferings of Christ, to bear our own the better; because we see by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that God deals no more hardly with us, than he did with his own Son, if he layes heavy things upon us. Why should we think to escape, when his own Son underwent so much? if we meet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62152:140"/>
and ill usage, with hard measure, and a mean condition, with injuries and violence, with mockings and affronts, nay with a shamefull and a painfull death, what cause have we to complain, for did not the Son of God undergo all these things before us? If any of your Habitations have been consumed, that you have been put to your shifts where to lodge your selves, or your Families; consider, that <hi>though the Foxes</hi>

If you are in pain and trouble, think of his Agony and bloody sweat, the nailing of his hands and feet to the Cross, to be a sacrifice for the expiation of your sins. Never think much of undergoing any thing, whereby <hi>you may</hi>

                     <p>ALthough the Letter I receiv'd from your hands contained in it so many mistakes of my meaning and design, that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62152:143"/>
it seemed to be the greatest civility to the Writer of it, to give no answer at all to it; because that could not be done, without the discovery of far more weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in him, than he pretends to finde in my discourse: Yet the weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the matter may require a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account from me, concerning <hi>the true reason of the sufferings of Christ.</hi> Wherein my design was so far <hi>from representing old Errors to the best advantage,</hi> or <hi>to rack my wits to defend them,</hi> as that person seems to suggest; that I aimed at nothing more than to give a true account of what upon a serious enquiry, I judged to be the most natural and genuine meaning of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine contained in the Writings of the New Testament.</p>
                     <p>For finding therein such multitudes of expressions which to an unprejudiced mind attribute all the mighty effects of the Love of God to us, to the obedience and sufferings of Christ. I began to consider what reason there was why the plain and easie sense of those places must be forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and a remote and Metaphorical mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put upon them. Which I thought my self the more obliged to doe, because I could not conceive if it had been the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Scripture, to have delivered
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62152:143"/>
the received Doctrine of the Christian Church, concerning the reason of the sufferings of Christ, that it could have been more clearly and fully expressed than it is already. So that supposing that to have been the true meaning of the several places of Scripture which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for; yet the same arts and subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might have been used to pervert it, which are imploy'd to perswade men that is not the true meaning of them. And what is equally serviceable to truth and falshood, can of it self, have no power on the minds of men to convince them it must be one, and not the other. Nay, if every unusual and improper acception of words in the Scripture, shall be thought sufficient to take away the natural and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine sense, where the matter is capable of it; I know scarce any article of Faith can be long secure; and by these arts men may declare that they believe the Scriptures, and yet believe nothing of the Christian Faith. For if the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, though unusual acception of those expressions <hi>of Christs dying for us,</hi> of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, propitiation, reconciliation by his blood, of his bearing our iniquities,</hi> and <hi>being made sin and a curse for us,</hi> shall be enough to invalidate all the arguments taken from
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:62152:144"/>
them to prove that which the proper sense of them doth imply; why may not the improper use of the terms of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Resurrection, as well take away the natural sense of them in the great Articles of the Creation of the World, and Resurrection after death. For if it be enough to prove that <hi>Christs dying for us,</hi> doth not imply <hi>dying in our stead;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sometimes <hi>dying for others</hi> imports no more than dying for some advantage to come to them; if <hi>redemption</hi> being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times used for <hi>meer deliverance,</hi> shall make our <hi>redemption</hi> by Christ, wholly <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical;</hi> if the terms of <hi>propitiation, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,</hi> &amp;c. shall lose their force because they are sometimes used where all things cannot be supposed parallel with the sense we contend for: why shall I be bound to believe that the World was ever created in a proper sense, since those persons against whom I argue, so earnestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that in those places in which it seems as proper as any, it is to be understood only in a metaphorical. If when <hi>the World and all things are said to be made by Christ,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 3. 10.</note> we are not to understand the production but the reformation of the World and all things in it, although the natural sense of the Words be quite otherwise; what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:62152:144"/>
can make it necessary for me not to understand the Creation of the World in a metaphorical sense, when <hi>Moses</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers to us the history of it? Why may not I understand <hi>in the beginning,</hi> Gen. 1. for the beginning of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, as well as <hi>Socinus</hi> doth <hi>in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> John 1. for the beginning of the Evangelical? and that from the very same argument used by him, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>in the beginning</hi> is to be understood of the main subject concerning which the author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to write, and that I am as sure it was in <hi>Moses</hi> concerning the <hi>Law</hi> given by him, as it was in S. <hi>John,</hi> concerning the <hi>Gospel</hi> deliver'd by <hi>Christ.</hi> Why may not <hi>the Creation of the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> be no more than the erection of the Jewish Polity? since it is acknowledged, that by <hi>New Heavens and new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness,</hi> no more is understood than a new state of things under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel? Why may not the <hi>confused Chaos</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no more than the state of Ignorance and darkness under which the World was before the Law of <hi>Moses?</hi> since it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that it signifies in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment such a state of the World before the Gospel appeared? and consequently, why may not <hi>the light which made the first day</hi>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:62152:145"/>
be the first tendencies to the Doctrine of <hi>Moses,</hi> which being at first divided and scattered, was united afterwards in one great Body of Laws, which was call'd the <hi>Sun,</hi> because it was the great Director of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, and therefore said <hi>to rule the day;</hi> as the less considerable Laws of other Nations are called the <hi>Moon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were to govern those who were yet under the <hi>night</hi> of Ignorance? Why may not the <hi>Firmament being in the midst of the Waters,</hi> imply the erection of the Jewish State in the midst of a great deal of trouble, since it is confessed, that <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are often taken in Scripture in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical sense for troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? and <hi>the Earth appearing out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> be no more but the settlement of that State after its troubles; and particularly with great elegancy after their passage through the Red Sea? And <hi>the production of Herbs and living Creatures,</hi> be the great encrease of the People of all sorts, as well those of a meaner rank (and therefore call'd herbs) as those of a higher, that were to live upon the other, and sometimes trample upon them, and therefore by way of excellency call'd <hi>the living Creatures?</hi> And when these were multiplyed and brought into order, (which being done
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:62152:145"/>
by steps and degrees, is said to be finished in several dayes) then the State and the Church flourished, and enjoy'd a great deal of pleasure, which was the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Man and Woman, and their being placed in Paradise (for <hi>a perfect Man,</hi> notes a high degree of perfection, and <hi>a Woman</hi> is taken for the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Revelations):</hi> But when they followed the Customs of other Nations which were <hi>as a forbidden tree</hi> to them, than they lost all their happiness and pleasure, and were expelled out of their own Countrey, and lived in great slavery and misery, which was the Curse pronounced against them, for violating the rules of Policy established among them. Thus you see how small a measure of wit, by the advantage of those wayes of interpreting Scripture, which the subtilest of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries make use of, will serve to pervert the clearest expressions of Scripture to quite another sense than was ever intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Writer of them. And I assure you, if that rule of interpreting Scripture be once allowed, that where words are ever used in a Metaphorical sense, there can be no necessity of understanding them in a proper; there is scarce any thing which you look on as the most necessary to be believed in Scripture, but it may
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62152:146"/>
be made appear not to be so upon those terms: for by reason of the paucity and therefore the ambiguity of the Original words of the Hebrew language, the strange Idioms of it, the different senses of the same word in several Conjugations, the want of several modes of expression which are used in other Languages, and above all the lofty and Metaphorical way of speaking used in all Eastern Countreys, and the imitation of the Hebrew Idioms in the Greek translation of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Original of the New, you can hardly affix a sense upon any words used therein, but a man who will be at the pains to search all possible significations and uses of those words, will put you hard to it, to make good that which you took to be the proper meaning of them. Wherefore although I will not deny to our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the praise of subtilty and diligence, I cannot give them that, (which is much more praise worthy) <hi>viz.</hi> of discretion and sound judgement. For while they use their utmost industry to search all the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and Metaphorical senses of words, with a design to take off the genuine and proper meaning of them, they do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the ill consequence that may be made of this to the overthrowing those
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:62152:146"/>
things, the belief of which themselves make necessary to salvation. For by this way the whole Gospel may be made an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, and the Resurrection of Christ be thought as metaphorical as the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his Death, and the force of all the Precepts of the Gospel avoided by some unusual signification of the words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are delivered. So that nothing can be more unreasonable than such a method of proceeding, unless it be first sufficiently proved that the matter is not capable of the proper sense, and therefore of necessity the improper only is to be allowed. And this is that which <hi>Socinus</hi> seems after all his pains to pervert the meaning of the places in controversie, to rely on most; viz. <hi>That the Doctrine of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Socin. de Servat. Part 2. Cap. 4</note> 
                        <hi>doth imply an impossibility in the thing it self, and therefore must needs be false; nay,</hi> he saith <hi>the infallibility of the Revealer had not been enough in this Case, supposing that Christ had said it, and risen from the dead, to declare his own Veracity; unless he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it by its proper causes and effects, and so shewed the possibility of the thing it self. And the reason,</hi> he saith, <hi>why they believe their Doctrine true, is not barely because God hath said it, but they believe certainly that God hath said it, because they know it to be true;</hi>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:62152:147"/>
by knowing the contrary Doctrine to be impossible. The controversie then, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaning of the places in dispute is to be resolved from the nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of the matter contained in them: for if <hi>Socinus</hi> his reason were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to his confidence, if the account we give of the sufferings of Christ, were repugnant not only to the Justice, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Grace of God, but to the nature of the thing; if it appear impossible, that mankinde should be redeemed in a proper sense, or that God should be propitiated by the Death of his Son as a Sacrifice for sin; if it enervate all the Precepts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and tends rather to justifie sins than those who do repent of them, I shall then agree, that no industry can be too great in searching Authors, comparing places, examining Versions, to finde out such a sense as may be agreeable to the nature of things, the Attributes of God, and the design of Christian Religion. But if on the contrary, the Scripture doth plainly assert those things from whence our Doctrine follows, and without which no reasonable account can be given either of the expressions used therein, or of the sufferings of Christ; if Christs death did immediately respect God as a sacrifice, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62152:147"/>
were paid as a price for our Redemption; if such a design of his death be so far from being repugnant to the nature of God, that it highly manifests his Wisdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Mercy; if it assert nothing but what is so far from being impossible, that it is very reconcileable to the common principles of Reason, as well as the Free-Grace of God in the pardon of sin; if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truely understood, it is so far from ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating, that it advances highly all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of Christian Religion, then it can be no less than a betraying one of the grand Truths of the Christian Doctrine, not to believe ours to be the true sense of the places in controversie. And this is that which I now take upon me to maintain.</p>

The state of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie in general.</note> will be more necessary, than to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the true <hi>state of the Controversie;</hi> which hath been rendred more obscure by the mistakes of some, who have managed it with greater zeal than judgement; who have asserted more than they needed to have done, and made our Adversaries assert much less than they do: And by this means have shot over their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries heads, and laid their own more open to assaults. It is easie to observe, that most of <hi>Socinus</hi> his Arguments are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62152:148"/>
against an opinion, which few who have considered these things do maintain, and none need to think themselves obliged to do it; which is, That Christ paid a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and rigid satisfaction for the sins of men, considered under the notion of debts, and that he paid the very same, which we ought to have done; which in the sense of the Law, is never call'd Satisfaction, but strict payment. Against this, <hi>Socinus</hi> disputes from the impossibility of Christs paying the very same that we were to have paid; because our penalty was Eternal death, and that as the consequent of inherent guilt, which Christ neither did nor could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. Neither is it enough to say, <hi>That Christ had undergone Eternal death, unless he had been able to free himself from it;</hi> for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of one to pay for another, who could discharge the debt in much less time than the offenders could, was not the same which the Law required. For that takes no notice of any other than the persons who had sinned; and if a <hi>Mediator</hi> could have paid the same, the Original Law must have been disjunctive; <hi>viz.</hi> That either the Offender must suffer, or another for him; but then the Gospel had not been the bringing in of a better <hi>Covenant,</hi> but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the old. But if there be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:62152:148"/>
or dispensation of the first Law, then it necessarily follows, that what Christ paid, was not the very same which the first Law required; for what need of that, when the very same was paid that was in the obligation? But if it be said, <hi>That the Dignity of the person makes up, what wanted in the kind or degree of punishment:</hi> This is a plain confession that it is not the same, but some thing equivalent, which answers the ends of the Sanction, as much as the same would have done, which is the thing we contend for. Besides, if the very same had been paid in the strict sense, there would have followed a deliverance <hi>ipso facto;</hi> for the release immediately follows the payment of the same: and it had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice to have required any thing further, in order to the discharge of the Offender, when strict and full payment had been made of what was in the obligation. But we see that Faith and Repentance, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of those two, are made conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on our parts, in order to the enjoying the benefit of what Christ hath procured: So that the release is not immediate upon the payment, but depends on a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, made in consideration of what Christ hath done and suffered for us. If it be said, <hi>That by Christs payment we become his, and he
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:62152:149"/>
requires these conditions of us;</hi> besides the contrariety of it to the Scriptures, which make the conditions to be required by him to whom the payment was made; we are to consider, that these very persons assert, that Christ paid all for us, and in our name and stead; so that the payment by Christ, was by a substitution in our room; and if he paid the same which the Law required, the benefit must immediately accrue to those in whose name the debt was paid: For what was done in the name of another, is all one to the Creditor, as if it had been done by the Debtor himself. But above all things, it is impossible to reconcile the freeness of remission, with the full payment of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same which was in the obligation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it serve to say, <hi>That though it was not free to Christ, yet it was to us:</hi> For the satisfaction and remission must respect the same person; for Christ did not pay for himself, but for us, neither could the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission be to him: Christ therefore is not considered in his own name, but as acting in our stead; so that what was free to him, must be to us; what was exactly paid by him, it is all one as if it had been done by us, so that it is impossible the same debt should be fully paid and freely forgiven. Much less will it avoid the difficulty in this
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:62152:149"/>
case to say, <hi>That it was a refusable payment;</hi> for it being supposed to be the very same, it was not in justice refusable; and however not in equity, if it answer the intention of the Law, as much as the suffering of the offenders had done; and the more it doth that, the less refusable it is. And although <hi>God himself found out the way,</hi> that doth not make the pardon free, but the designation of the person who was to pay the debt. Thus when our Adversaries dispute against this opinion, no wonder if they do it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully; but this whole opinion is built upon a mistake, that satisfaction must be the payment of the very same; which while they contend for, they give our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries too great an advantage, and make them think they triumph over the Faith of the Church, when they do it onely over the mistake of some particular persons. But the foundation of this mistake, lies in the consideration of punishment, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>debts,</hi> and that satisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be by strict payment in rigor of Law; but how great that mistake is, will appear in the subsequent discourse: but it cannot but be wondred at, that the very same persons who consider sins, as debts which must be strictly satisfied for, do withal contend for the absolute necessity
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:62152:150"/>
of this satisfaction; whereas <hi>Socinus</hi> his Arguments would hold good, <hi>if sins were onely considered as debts, and God as the meer Creditor of punishment, he might as freely part with his own right without satisfaction, as any Creditor may forgive what sum he pleases, to a person indebted to him;</hi> and no reason can be brought to the contrary, from that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sins, why he may not do it. But if they be considered with a respect to Gods Government of the world, and the honour of his Laws, then some further account may be given, why it may not be consistent with that, to pass by the sins of men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out satisfaction made to them.</p>
                     <p>And because the mistake in this matter, hath been the foundation of most of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent <note place="margin">§. 3. Of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of debts and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> mistakes on both sides, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the cause of errours, doth far more to the cure of them, than any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought against them; and withall, the true understanding of the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of satisfaction depends upon it, I shall endeavour to make clear the notion under which our sins are considered; for upon that, depends the nature of the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which is to be made for them. For while our Adversaries suppose, that sins are to be looked on under the notion of debts in this debate, they assert it to be
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:62152:150"/>
wholly free for God to remit them, without any satisfaction. They make the right of punishment meerly to depend on Gods ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Dominion; and that all satisfaction must be considered under the notion of compensation, for the injuries done to him, to whom it is to be made. But if we can clearly shew a considerable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the notion of debts and punishments, if the right of punishment doth not depend upon meer Dominion, and that satisfaction by way of punishment, is not primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for compensation, but for other ends, we shall make not onely the state of the Controversie much clearer, but offer something considerable towards the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. The way I shall take for the proof of the difference between debts and punishments, shall be using the other for the Arguments for it. For besides, that those things are just in matter of debts, which are not so in the case of punishments; as, that it is lawful for a man to forgive all the debts which are owing him by all persons, though they never so contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maciously refuse payment, but our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries will not say so in the case of sins; for although they assert, That the justice of God doth never require punishment in case of Repentance, but
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:62152:151"/>
withall they assert, That <hi>in case of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, it is not onely agreeable, but due to the nature and decrees; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the rectitude and equity of</hi>

                        <hi>God not to give pardon.</hi> But if this be true, then there is an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent difference between the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>debts</hi> and <hi>punishments;</hi> for the Impenitency doth but add to the greatness of the debt: And will they say, it is onely in Gods power to remit small debts, but he must punish the greatest? what becomes then of Gods ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute liberty to part with his own right? will not this shew more of his kindness to pardon the greater, rather than lesser of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders? But if there be something in the nature of the thing, which makes it not onely just, but necessary for impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be punished, as <hi>Crellius</hi> after <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> frequently acknowledges; then it is plain, that sins are not to be considered meerly as debts; for that obstinacy and impenitency is onely punished as a greater degree of sin, and therefore as a greater debt. And withall, those things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the remission of debts, which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just in the matter of punishments; as it is lawful for a Creditor, when two persons
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:62152:151"/>
are considered in equal circumstances, to remit one, and not the other; nay, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the greater debt, without any satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to exact the lesser to the greatest extremity; but it is unjust in matter of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, where the reason and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are the same, for a person who hath committed a crime of very dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, to escape unpunished, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who hath been guilty of far less to be severely executed. Besides these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, I say I shall now prove the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of debts and punishments, from those two things whereby things are best differenced from each other; <hi>viz.</hi> The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reason, and the different End of them.</p>
                     <p>The different Reason of debts and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments: The reason of debts is domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">§. 4. The reason of humane punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the publick interest.</note> and property, and the obligation of of them, depends upon voluntary contracts between parties; but the reason of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is Justice and Government, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon meer contracts, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the person stands in to that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he is accountable for his actions to. For if the obligation to punishment, did depend upon meer contract, than none could justly be punished, but such who have consented to it by an antecedent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract:
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:62152:152"/>
If it be said, <hi>That a contract is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, by their being in society with others;</hi> that is as much as I desire to make the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference appear, for in case of debts, the obligation depends upon the voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the person; but in case of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the very relation to Government, and living under Laws doth imply it. And the right of punishment depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the obligation of Laws, where the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of them holds, without any express contract, or superiority of one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as in the case of violation of the Law of Nations, that gives right to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation to punish the infringers of it. Otherwise Wars could never be lawful between two Nations, and none could be warrantable, but those of a Prince against his rebellious subjects, who have broken the Laws themselves consented expresly to. Besides, in case of debts, every man is bound to pay, whether he be call'd upon or no; but in case of punishments, no man is bound to betray or accuse himself. For the obligation to payment in case of debt, ariseth from the injury sustained by that particular person, if another detains what is his own from him; but the obligation to punishment, arises from the injury the Publick sustains by the impunity of crimes,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:62152:152"/>
of which the Magistrates are to take care; who by the dispensing of punishments, do shew that to be true which <hi>Grotius</hi> asserts, that if there be any Creditor to be assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in punishment, it is the publick good: Which appears by this, that all punishments are proportioned, according to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the offences have upon the publick interest; for the reason of punishment is not because a Law is broken, but because the breach of a Law tends to dissolve the community, by infringing the Authority of the Laws, and the honour of those who are to take care of them. For if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it, the measure of punishments is in a well ordered State, taken from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which crimes have upon the peace and interest of the community. No man questions', but that Malice, Pride and Avarice, are things really as bad as many faults, that are severely punished by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws; but the reason these are not punished is, because they do not so much injury to the publick interest, as Theft and Robbery do. Besides, in those things wherein the Laws of a Nation are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, the utmost rigor is not used in the preventing of crimes, or the execution of them when committed, if such an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may endanger the publick more, than
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:62152:153"/>
the impunity of the offenders may do. And there are some things which are thought fit to be forbidden, where the utmost means are not used to prevent them; as Merchants are forbidden to steal customs, but they are not put under an Oath not to do it. And when penalties have been deserved, the execution of them hath been deferred, till it may be most for the advantage of the publick: as <hi>Joabs</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till <hi>Solomons</hi> Reign, though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it as much in <hi>Davids.</hi> So that the rule commonly talked of, <hi>Fiat justitia &amp; pereat mundus,</hi> is a piece of Pedantry, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than true Wisdom; for whatever pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty inflicted, brings a far greater detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the publick, than the forbearance of it, is no piece of Justice to the State, but the contrary; the greatest Law, being the safety and preservation of the whole body. By which it appears, that in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, the reason of punishment is not, that such an action is done, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the impunity in doing it, may have a bad influence on the publick interest; but in debts, the right of Restitution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the injury received by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person, who looks at no more than the reparation of his loss by it.</p>

We are now to consider, how far these things will hold in Divine Laws, and <note place="margin">§. 5. The right of Divine punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not meer Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. <hi>Crell. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spons. ad Grot. cap. 2 sect. 1. &amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> what the right of punishment doth result from there. For <hi>Crellius,</hi> the subtillest of our Adversaries, knowing how great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence the resolution of this is, in the whole Controversie of Satisfaction, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently contends, <hi>That the right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth result from Gods absolute Dominion, and therefore he is to be considered as the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party, and not as Governor in the right of inflicting punishment;</hi> for which his first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, <hi>That our obedience is due to Gods</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">p. 144.</note> 
                        <hi>Law, on the account of his Dominion; but when that is not performed, the penalty suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in its room, and therefore that doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God on the same account:</hi> His other Arguments are, <hi>from the compensation of injuries due to the offended party, and from Gods anger against sin, in which he is to be considered as the offended party:</hi> These two latter will be answered under the next head; the first I am to examine here. He therefore tells us, that the right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belongs to Gods Dominion, because the reason of his Government of mankind is, because he is the Lord of them. But, for our better understanding this, we are to consider, although the original right of Government doth result from Gods Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:62152:154"/>
for therefore our obedience is due, because of his Soveraignty over us; yet when God takes upon him the notion of a Governor, he enters into a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with his creatures, distinct from the first as meer Lord. For he is equally Lord of all to whom he gives a being, but he doth not require obedience upon equal terms, nor governs them by the same Laws: Dominion is properly shewed in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of power; but when God gives Laws according to which he will reward and punish, he so far restrains the exercise of his Dominion to a subserviency to the ends of Government. If we should suppose, that God governs the world meerly by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, we must take away all rewards and punishments; for then the actions of men, would be the meer effects of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable power, and so not capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and punishments; for there could be neither of these, where mens actions are not capable of the differences of good and evil, and that they cannot be, if they be the acts of Gods Dominion, and not of their own. But if God doth not exercise his full Dominion over rational creatures, it is apparent that he doth govern them under another notion than as meer Lord, and the reason of punishment is not to be
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:62152:154"/>
taken from an absolute right which God doth not make use of, but from the ends and designs of Government, which are his own Honour, the Authority of his Laws, and the good of those whom he doth govern. And <hi>Crellius</hi> is greatly mistaken, when he makes <hi>punishment to succeed in the place of the right of obedience;</hi> for it is onely the desert of punishment, which follows upon the violation of that right; and as we assert, that the right of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is derived from Gods Soveraignty, so we deny not, but the desert of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is from the violation of it; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all we say, that the obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depends upon the Laws, and Gods right to inflict punishment (Laws being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) is immediately from that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he hath over mankinde: For otherwise, if the whole right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did still depend upon Gods Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the first right of Soveraignty, then all sins must have equal punishments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are all equal violations of the fundamental right of obedience; then it were at liberty for God to punish a greater sin, with a less punishment; and a lesser sin, with a greater: And lastly, this would make the punishment of sin, a meer Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thing in God; for there would be no
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:62152:155"/>
reason of punishment, but what depended upon Gods meer will; whereas the reason of punishment in Scripture is drawn from a repugnancy of sin to the divine purity and holyness, and not meerly from Gods power or will to punish; but if that were all the reason of it, there would be no repugnancy in the nature of the thing for the most vitious person to be rewarded, and the most pious to be made everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly miserable. But who ever yet durst say or think so? From whence it appears that the relation between sin and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no result of Gods arbitrary will; but it is founded in the nature of the things, so that as it is just for God to punish offenders, so it would be unjust to punish the most innocent person without any respect to sin. But if the right of punishment depends meerly on Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, I cannot understand why God may not punish when, and whom, and in what manner he pleaseth; without any impeachment of his Justice, and therefore it is to be wonder'd at, that the same persons who assert the right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be meerly in Gods dominion, should yet cry out of the unjustice of one person being punished for anothers faults; for why may not God exercise his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:62152:155"/>
in this case? yes say they, <hi>he may his dominion, but he cannot punish, because pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment supposes guilt, and cannot be just without it;</hi> how far that reaches, will be examined afterwards; at present, we take notice of the contradiction to themselves which our Adversaries are guilty of, that they may serve their own <hi>hypothesis,</hi> for when we dispute with them, against abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute remission without satisfaction, then they contend that the right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a meer act of dominion, and God may part with his right, if he please; but when they dispute with us against the translation of punishment from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then they no longer say that the right of punishment is an act of dominion, but that it is a necessary consequent of inherent guilt, and cannot be removed from one to another. And then they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny that punishment is of the nature of debts; for <hi>one mans money,</hi> they say, <hi>may become anothers, but one mans punishment</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>cannot become anothers:</hi> Thus they give and take, deny and grant, as it serves for their present purposes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>different end of debts and punishments,</hi> make it appear that there is a difference in the nature of them; for the intention of the obligation to payment in case of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:62152:156"/>
debt, is the compensation of the damage which the Creditor sustains; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of punishment, is not bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, but it is designed for greater and further ends. For which we are to consider the different nature of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they are inflicted by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of some injury done to private persons, and as they do respect the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good. I grant, that private persons in case of injuries, seek for compensation of the damage they sustain, and so far they bear the nature of debts; but if we consider them as inflicted by those who have a care of the publick, though they are to see that no private person suffers injury by another, yet the reason of that is not meerly that he might enjoy his own, but because the doing injuries to others tends to the subversion of the ends of Government. Therefore, I can by no means admit that Position of <hi>Crellius, that a Magistrate only punishes as he assumes the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. c. Grot. cap. 2. Sect. 2. p. 147. Sect. 17. p. 162.</note> 
                        <hi>person of the particular men who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived injuries from others;</hi> for he aims at other ends than meerly the compensation of those injured persons. Their great end is according to the old Roman <hi>Formula, nè quid Resp. detrimenti capiat:</hi> the reason of exacting penalties upon private men is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:62152:156"/>
still with a regard to the publick safety. Supposing men in a. state of nature no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is due to the injured person, but restitution of damage, and compensation of the loss that accrues to him by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury sustained; and whatever goes beyond this, is the effect of Government, which constitutes penalties for preservation of the Society which is under Laws. But herein <hi>Crellius</hi> is our adversary, but with no advantage at all to his Cause; for he offers to prove against <hi>Grotius, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is due by an injury beyond bare compensation for what the other is supposed to lose by the right of nature;</hi> for saith he, <hi>in every injury there is not only the reall damage which the person sustains, but there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the person implyed in it, for which as well as the former, he ought to have compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</hi> To which I answer, 1. That this doth not prove what he designs, <hi>viz.</hi> that punishment doth belong to the injured person in a state of Nature, beyond bare restitution, but that it is necessary, that men should not continue in such a state, that so they may be vindicated from that contempt, and others compelled to resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Both which, as they are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are not in the power of the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party as such, but shew that it is very
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62152:157"/>
reasonable there should be Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, that private persons may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in their just rights, and offenders punished for the vindication not only of their honour, but of the Laws too. And Laws being established, the injured person hath right to no more, than the compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of his loss; for that being forced upon the offending party, is a sufficient vindication of his honour. 2. If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of a private person makes a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation necessary, how much more will this hold in a publick Magistrate; whose contempt by disobedience is of far worse consequence than that of a private person. And by this argument <hi>Crellius</hi> overthrows his main <hi>hypothesis,</hi> viz. that God may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don sin without satisfaction; for if it be not only necessary, that the loss be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensated but the dishonour too; then so much greater as the dishonour is; so much higher as the person is; so much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the world as his Laws are; so much more necessary is it that in order to pardon there must be a satisfaction made to him, for the affronts he hath received from men. And if the greatness of the injury be to be measured as <hi>Crellius</hi> asserts, <note place="margin">Crell. c. Grot. cap. 2. p. 174.</note> 
                        <hi>from the worth and value of the thing, from the dignity and honour of the person, from the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62152:157"/>
displicency of the fact to him,</hi> which he makes the measure of punishment; this makes it still far more reasonable, that God should have satisfaction for the sins of men, than that men should have for the injuries done them by one another; especially consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the same Author doth assert afterwards, <hi>that it is sometime repugnant to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sect. 29. <hi>p.</hi> 198.</note> 
                        <hi>justice, for one to part with his own right in case of injuries, and that either from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and circumstances of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or a decree or determination to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi> for the first he instanceth in case of <hi>notorious defamation;</hi> in which he saith, <hi>it is a dishonest and unlawfull thing for a man, not to make use of his own right for his vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi> and for the other, <hi>in case of great obstinacy and malice.</hi> By both which, it is most apparent, that <hi>Crellius</hi> puts a mighty difference between the nature of debts; and punishments, since in all cases he allows it lawfull for a person free, to remit his debts; but in some cases he makes it utterly unlawfull for a person not to make use of his right for punishment. And withall if a private person may not part with his own right in such cases, how unreasonable is it not to assert the same of the great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the world? and that there may be a necessity for him upon supposition of the contempt of himself and his Laws, to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:62152:158"/>

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:62152:158"/>
primary intendment of punishment to be the evil of him that suffers it. Whereas the right of punishment is derived from an injury received, and therefore that which gives that right, is some damage sustained, the reparation of which is the first thing designed by the offended party: Though it take not up the whole nature of punishment. And on this account no man can justly propose any end to himself in anothers evil, but what comes under the notion of restitution. For the evil of another is only intended in punishment as it respects the good of him for whose sake that evil is undergone. When that good may be obtained without anothers evil, the desire of it is unjust and unreasonable: and therefore all that contentment that any one takes in the evil another under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, as it is evil to him, is a thing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to humane nature, and which all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons condemn in others when they allow themselves in it. It will be hard for <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to make any difference between this end of punishment which he assigns, and the greatest cruelty; for what can that be worse than taking delight in making others miserable, and seeing them so when he hath made them. If it be replyed, <hi>that cruelty is without any cause, but here a just
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:62152:159"/>
cause is supposed,</hi> I answer, a just cause is only supposed for the punishment, but there can be no just cause for any to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the miseries of others, and to comfort themselves by inflicting or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them. For the evil of another is never intended, but when it is the only means left for compensation; and he must be guilty of great inhumanity, who desires anothers evil any further than that tends to his own good, <hi>i. e.</hi> the reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the damage sustained; which if it may be had without anothers evil, then that comes not by the right of nature within the reason of punishment; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently where it doth not serve for that end, the comfort that men take in it is no part of justice, but cruelty. For there can be no reason at all assigned for it; for that <hi>lenimentum doloris</hi> which <hi>Crellius</hi> insists on is meerly imaginary, and no other than the Dog hath in gnawing the stone that is thrown at him; and for all that I know, that propension in nature to the retribution of evil for evil any further than it tends to our security, and preservation for the future, is one of the most unreasonable Passions in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.</p>

of Gods glory, in the punishment of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reclaimable sinners. And this we do not deny to be a just punishment, since our Adversaries themselves, as well as we, make it necessary. But we are not so to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the end of Divine punishments doth so respect the community, as though God himself were to be excluded out of it; for we are so to understand it, as made up of God as the Governor, and mankind as the persons governed; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever then tends to the vindication of the rights of Gods Honor and Soveraignty, tends to the good of the whole, because the manifestation of that end is so great an end of the whole.</p>
                     <p>But withall, though we assert in the life to come, the ends of punishment not <note place="margin">§. 12. The ends of Divine punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in this and the future state.</note> to be the reclaiming of sinners, who had never undergone them, unless they had been unreclaimable; yet a vast difference must be made between the ends of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that, and in this present state. For the other is the <hi>Reserve,</hi> when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else will do, and therefore was not primarily intended; but the proper ends of punishment, as a part of Government, are to be taken from the design of them in this life. And here we assert, that Gods end in punishing, is the advancing
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:62152:169"/>
his honor, not by the meer miseries of his creatures, but that men by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his severity against sin, should break off the practice of it, that they may escape the punishments of the furture state. So that the ends of punishment here, are quite of another kinde, from those of another life; for those are inflicted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause persons have been unreclaimable by either the mercies or punishments of this life; but these are intended, that men should so far take notice of this severity of God, as to avoid the sins which will expose them to the wrath to come. And from hence it follows, That whatsoever sufferings, do answer all these ends of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine punishments, and are inflicted on the account of sin, have the proper notion of punishments in them, and God may accept of the undergoing them as a full <hi>satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to his Law, if they be such as tend to break men off from sin, and assert Gods right, and vindicate his honor to the world; which are the ends assigned by <hi>Crellius,</hi> and will be of great consequence to us in the following Discourse.</p>

which, and not on the death of Christ they say our remission depends; but so far as the death of Christ may be an argument to us to believe his Doctrine, and that faith may incline us to obedience, and that obedience being the condition in order to pardon, at so many removes they make the death of Christ to have influence on the remission of our sins.

                        <hi>that God as absolute Lord of all, had a right of absolute dominion upon the life and body of Christ, and therefore might justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him up to death, and give his body to the Crosse; and although Christ by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary force of the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>had a right to escape so painfull and accursed death, yet God by the right of dominion had the power of disposal of him, because he intended to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate his torments with a reward infinitely greater than they were: but because</hi> he saith, <hi>for great ends the consent of Christ was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:62152:173"/>
therefore God did not use his utmost dominion in delivering him up by force as he might have done, but he dealt with him by way of command, and rewards proposed for obedience, and in this sense he did act as a righteous Governour, and indulgent Father, who encouraged his Son to undergoe hard, but great things.</hi> In which we see, that he makes the sufferings of Christ an act of <hi>meer dominion</hi> in God, without any <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent cause</hi> as the <hi>reason</hi> of them; only he qualifies this act of dominion with the proposal of a reward for it.

                        <note place="margin">Crell. c. 1. §. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>not only to give salvation to Mankinde, but to give us a firm hope of it in this present state, now our sins by deserving eternal punishment, do hinder the effect of that decree upon us, and therefore they were an impulsive cause of the death of Christ, by which it was effected, that this decree should obtain notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our sins. But we are not to understand as though this were done by any expiation of the guilt of sin by the death of Christ; but this effect is hindred by three things, by taking away their sins, by assuring men that their former sins, and present infirmities upon their sincere obedience shall not be imputed to them, and that the effect of that decree shall obtain, all which,</hi> saith he, <hi>is effected morte Christi interveniente, the death of Christ interventing, but not as the procuring cause.</hi> So that after all these words he means no more by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our sins <hi>an impulsive cause of the death of Christ,</hi> but that the death of Christ was an argument to confirm to us the truth of his Doctrine, which doctrine of his doth give us assurance of these things: and that our sins when they are said to be <hi>the impulsive cause,</hi> are not to be considered with a respect to <hi>their guilt,</hi> but to that <hi>distrust of God</hi> which our sins do raise in
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62152:174"/>
us; which distrust is in truth according to this sense of <hi>Crellius the impulsive cause,</hi> and not the <hi>sins</hi> which were the cause or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it. For that was it which the doctrine was designed to remove, and our sins only as the causes of that. But if it be said, <hi>that he speaks not only of the distrust, but of the punishment of sin as an impediment which must be removed too, and therefore may be call'd an impulsive cause,</hi> we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the removal of this is not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the death of Christ, but to the leaving of our sins by the belief of his Doctrine; therefore the punishment of our sins cannot unless in a very remote sense be said to be an <hi>impulsive cause</hi> of that, which for all that we can observe by <hi>Crellius,</hi> might as well have been done without it; if any other way could be thought sufficient to confirm his doctrine, and Christ, without dying, might have had power to save all them that obey him. But we understand not an impulsive cause in so remote a sense, as though our sins were a <hi>meer occasion of Christs dying,</hi> because the death of Christ was one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument among many others to believe his Doctrine, the belief of which would make men leave their sins; but we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for a neerer and more proper sense,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:62152:174"/>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> that the death of Christ was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily intended for the <hi>expiation of our sins,</hi> with a respect to <hi>God</hi> and not to us, and therefore our sins as an <hi>impulsive cause</hi> are to be considered as they are so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to God; that it was necessary for the Vindication of Gods Honour, and the deterring the world from sin, that no less a Sacrifice of Attonement should be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than the blood of the Son of God. So that we understand an <hi>impulsive cause</hi> here in the same sense, that the sins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were, under the Law, the cause of the offering up those Sacrifices, which were appointed for the expiation of them. And as in those Sacrifices there were two things to be considered, <hi>viz.</hi> the mactation, and the oblation of them, the former as a <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by a substitution of them in place of the persons who had offended; the latter as the proper Sacrifice of attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although the mactation it self, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered with the design of it, was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificial act too: So we consider the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Christ with a twofold respect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as <hi>to our sins,</hi> as the impulsive cause of them, so they are to be considered as a <hi>punishment,</hi> or as <hi>to God,</hi> with a design to expiate the guilt of them, so they are a <hi>Sacrifice of Attonement.</hi> The first conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:62152:175"/>
is, that we are now upon, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the present debate depends, for if the sufferings of Christ be to be taken under the notion of <hi>punishment,</hi> then our Adversaries grant, that our sins must be an impulsive cause of them in another sense than they understand it. For the clearing of this, I shall prove these two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That no other sense ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of the places of <hi>Scripture</hi> which speak of the sufferings of Christ with a respect to sin, but this.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is not meant that God would punish the Children of the</hi> Israelites, <hi>but that by the occasion of their parents sins, they should undergoe that trouble, in wandering in the Wilderness, and being deprived of the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the promised Land.</hi> But could <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> think that any thing else could have been imagined, (setting aside a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction) a greater instance of Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, than that was to the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> all their circumstances being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered?

                        <hi>rest?</hi> Surely then the debarring them so long of that rest, was an instance of Gods wrath, and so according to his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples must have something of <hi>Vindicta</hi> in it, and therefore be a proper punishment. The truth is, our Adversaries allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in speaking things most repugnant to Humane Nature in this matter of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, that they may justifie their own <hi>hypothesis.</hi> For a whole Nation to be for forty years debarred from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est blessings were ever promised them; and instead of enjoying them, to endure the miseries and hardships of forty years travells in a barren wilderness, must not be thought a punishment, and only because occasioned by their Parents sins. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is inflicted on the account of sin, and with a design to shew Gods severity against it, and thereby to deterr others from the practice of it, hath the proper notion of punishment in it; and all these things did concurr in this instance, besides the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral sense of mankind in the matter of their punishment, which was such, that supposing them preserved in their liberty, could not have been imagined greater.

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:62152:183"/>
are to be understood of the force and efficacy of Christs death to do it, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the effect of it in us; not as though Christ did deliver us from sins by his death, but that he did that by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon which the taking away of sin would follow, or which had a great power for the doing it.</q> So uncertain are our Adversaries, in affixing any sense upon these words, which may attribute any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at all, to the death of Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross. For if they be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of taking away sins, then they are onely to be meant of the power that was in the death of Christ, to perswade men to leave their sins; which we must have a care of understanding so, as to attribute any effect to the death of Christ in order to it; but onely that the death of Christ was an argument for us to believe what he said, and the believing what he said would incline us to obey him, and if we obey him, we shall leave off our sins, whether Christ had dyed or no: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing his miracles had the same effect on us, which those of <hi>Moses</hi> had upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were sufficient to perswade them to believe and obey without his death. But if this be all that was meant by Christs <hi>bearing our sins in his body on the tree;</hi> why
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:62152:183"/>
might not S. <hi>Peter</hi> himself be said to bear them upon his cross too? for his death was an excellent example of patience, and a great argument to perswade men he spake truth, and that doctrine which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was repentance and remission of sins: So that by this sense, there is nothing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar attributed to the <hi>death of Christ.</hi> But taking the other sense for the <hi>taking away the punishment of sins,</hi> we must see how this belongs to the death of Christ: Do they then attribute our delivery from the punishment to sin, to the death of Christ on the <hi>Cross?</hi> yes, just as we may attribute <hi>Caesars</hi> subduing <hi>Rome,</hi> to his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing over <hi>Rubicon,</hi> because he took that in his way to the doing of it: so they make the death of Christ onely as a passage, in order to expiation of sins, by taking away the punishment of them. For that shall not be actually perfected, they say, till his full deliverance of all those that obey him, from hell and the grave, which will not be till his second coming. So that if we onely take <hi>the body</hi> of Christ for his <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming,</hi> and the <hi>cross</hi> of Christ, or the <hi>tree,</hi> for his <hi>Throne of Glory,</hi> then they will acknowledge, that Christ may very well be said, <hi>to take away sins in his own body on the tree:</hi> but if you take it in any sense that
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:62152:184"/>
doth imply any peculiar efficacy to the death of Christ, for all the plainness of S. <hi>Peters</hi> words, they by no means will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of it.</p>

It is granted by our Adversaries, that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> in those words, doth not give the full sense of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> but onely applies that by way of accommodation, to bodily diseases, which was chiefly intended for the sins of men. And in a way of accommodation it is not unusual to strain words beyond their genuine and natural signification, or what was intended primarily by the person who spake them. Would it be reasonable for any to say that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifies <hi>to give,</hi> because that place <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 18. where the word by all is acknowledged to signifie <hi>to receive,</hi> is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>to give, Eph.</hi> 4. 8. so that admitting another sense of the word here, as applied to the cure of bodily diseases, it doth

                        </gap>ense intended by the <hi>Prophet.</hi> 2. The word as used by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> is very capable of the primary and natural sense; for S. <hi>Matthew</hi> retains words of the same signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, with that which we contend for, <gap reason="foreign">

So that all that is implied hereby, is the <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> which our Saviour <hi>took</hi> in the healing of the sick.

Because those by whom they were said <hi>to be chastened,</hi> did not think they did it without any respect to a fault; but they supposed them to be justly punished; and this is that we plead for, that the chastisement considered with a respect to him that inflicts it, doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some fault as the reason of inflicting it. 2. This is far from the present purpose, for the <hi>chastisement</hi> there mentioned is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to death, <hi>as chastened, but not killed;</hi> whereas <hi>Grotius</hi> expresly speaks of such <hi>chastisements as include death,</hi> that these cannot be supposed to be meerly designed for instruction, and therefore must be conceived under the notion of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:62152:188"/>
more remote from the business; for though the Psalmist accounts himself innocent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the great enormities of others; yet he could not account himself so inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent with a respect to God, as not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve chastisement from him.</p>

For the ends of such a punishment assigned by <hi>Crellius</hi> himself, are, <q>That others observing such a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, may abstain from those sins
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:62152:189"/>
which have brought it upon the person who suffers.</q> Now the question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther supposing Christ did suffer on the account of our sins, these sufferings of his may deterr us from the practice of sin or no? And therefore in opposition to <hi>Crellius,</hi> I shall prove these two things: 1. That supposing Christ suffered for our sins, there was a sufficient argument to deterr us from the practice of sin. 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that his sufferings had no respect to our sins, they could not have that force to deterr men from the practice of it: for he after asserts, <hi>That Christs sufferings might be a</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>to us, though they were no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sin.</hi> 1. That the death of Christ considered as a punishment of sin, is a proper <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or hath a great force to deterr men from the practice of sin: and that because the same reason of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is supposed in Christ and in our selves, and because the example is much more considerable, than if we had suffered our selves. 1. The same reason of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is supposed. For why are men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from sin, by seeing others punished; but because they look upon the sin as the reason of the punishment; and therefore where the same reason holds, the same ends may be as properly obtained. If we
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:62152:189"/>
said that Christ suffered death meerly as an innocent person out of Gods dominion over his life; what imaginable force could this have to deterr men from sin, which is asserted to have no relation to it as the cause of it? But when we say, that <hi>God laid our iniquities upon him,</hi> that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not upon his own account but ours, that the sins we commit against God were the cause of all those bitter Agonies which the Son of God underwent, what argument can be more proper to deter men from sin than this is? For hereby they see the great abhorrency of sin which is in God, that he will not pardon the sins of men without a compensation made to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and a demonstration to the world of his hatred of it. Hereby they see what a value God hath for his Laws, which he will not relax as to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of offenders, without so valuable a consideration as the blood of his own Son. Hereby they see, that the punishment of sin is no meer arbitrary thing depending barely upon the will of God; but that there is such a connexion between sin and punishment as to the ends of Government, that unless the Honor and Majesty of God, as to his Laws and Government may be preserved, the violation of his Laws must
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:62152:190"/>
expect <hi>a just recompence of reward.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they see what those are to expect who neglect or despise these sufferings of the Son of God for them; for nothing can then remain, but <hi>a certain fearful looking for of judgement and fiery indignation which shall devour the Adversaries.</hi> So that, here all the weighty arguments concurr which may be most apt to prevail upon men to deterr them from their sins. For <hi>if God did thus by the green tree, what will he do by the dry?</hi> If he who was so innocent in himself, so perfectly holy, suffered so much on the account of our sins; what then may those expect to suffer, who have no innocency at all to plead, and add wilfulness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency to their sins? But if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by <hi>Crellius, that it is otherwise among men:</hi> I answer, that we do not pretend in all things to parallel the sufferings of Christ for us, with any sufferings of men for one another. But yet we add, that even among men the punishments inflicted on those who were themselves innocent as to the cause of them, may be as exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as any other. And the greater appearance of severity there is in them, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er terror they strike into all offenders. As Childrens losing their estates and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, or being banished for their Parents
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:62152:190"/>
treasons in which they had no part them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Which is a proper punishment on them of their Fathers faults, whether they be guilty or no; and if this may be just in men, why not in God? If any say, <hi>that the Parents are only punished in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> he speaks that which is contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the common sense of mankind; for punishment doth suppose sense or feeling of it; and in this case the Parents are said to be punished, who are supposed to be dead and past feeling of it, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who undergo the smart of it must not be said to be punished; though all things are so like it, that no person can imagine himself in that condition, but would think himself punished, and severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too. If it be said, <hi>that these are calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties indeed, but they are no proper punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> it may easily be shewed that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction will not hold here. Because these punishments were within the design of the Law, and were intended for all the ends of punishments, and therefore must have the nature of them. For therefore the Children are involved in the Fathers pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment on purpose to deterr others from the like actions. There are some things indeed that Children may fall into by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of their Fathers guilt, which may
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:62152:191"/>
be only <hi>calamities</hi> to them, because they are necessary consequents in the nature of the thing, and not purposely designed as a punishment to them. Thus, being deprived of the comfort and assistance of their Parents, when the Law hath taken them off by the hand of justice: this was designed by the Law as a punishment to the Parents, and as to the Children it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a necessary consequent of their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For otherwise the Parents would have been punished for the Childrens faults, and not the Children only involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that which unavoidably follows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Parents punishment. So that <hi>Crellius</hi> is very much mistaken either in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case of our Saviours punishment, or in the general reason of exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, as among men. But the case of our Saviour is more exemplary, when we consider the excellency of his person, though appearing in our nature, when no meaner sufferings would satisfie, than of so transcendent a nature as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, though he were the Eternal Son of God, this must make the punishment much more exemplary, than if he were considered only as our Adversaries do, as <hi>a meer man.</hi> So that the dignity of his person under all his sufferings may justly

For upon the same account that the most innocent person suffers most severely from him, for all that we know, the more we strive to be innocent, the more severely we may be dealt with, and let men sin, they can be but dealt severely with, all the difference then is, one shall be call'd <hi>punishments,</hi> and the other <hi>calamities,</hi> but the severity may be the same in both.

of things to men, hath no regard to what men are or do, but acts therein according to his own Dominion, whereby he may dispose of men how or which way he pleases. If a Prince had many of his Subjects in open rebellion against him, and he should at that time make his most obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and beloved Son to be publickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to all manner of indignities, and be dishonoured and put to death by the hands of those rebells; could any one imagine that this was designed as an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary punishment to all rebels, to let them see the danger of rebellion? <hi>No,</hi> but would it not rather make them think him a cruel Prince, one that would punish innocency as much as rebellion; and that it was rather better to stand at defiance, and become desperate, for it was more dangerous to be beloved than hated by him, to be his Son than his declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?

but they suffer only for their own, and what they have deserved themselves.</hi> To which I answer, that the argument is of very good force upon our <hi>hypothesis,</hi> though it would not be upon theirs. For if we suppose him to be <hi>a meer man</hi> that suffer'd, then there could be no argument drawn from his sufferings to ours, but according to the exact proportion of sins and punishments: but supposing that he had a <hi>divine</hi> as well as <hi>humane nature,</hi> there may not be so great a proportion of the sins of the world to the sufferings of Christ, as of the sins of a particular person to his own sufferings; and therefore the argument from one to the other doth still hold. For the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of punishments must be taken with a proportion to the dignity of the person who suffers them. And <hi>Crellius</hi> himself confesseth elsewhere, <hi>that the dignity of the person is to be considered in exemplary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

                        <hi>and that a lesser punishment of one that is very great, may do much more to deterre men from sin, than a greater punishment of one much less.</hi> But he yet further urgeth, <hi>that the severity of God against sinners may be discovered in the sufferings of Christ, because</hi>

                        <hi>Gods hatred against sin is discovered therein.</hi> But if we ask how Gods hatred against sin, is seen in the sufferings of one perfectly

innocent and free from sin, and not rather his hatred of innocency, if no respect to sin were had therein? he answers, <hi>that Gods hatred against sin was manifested, in that he would not spare his only Son to draw men off from sin.</hi> For answer to which, we are to consider the sufferings of Christ as an innocent person, designed as an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary cause to draw men off from sin; and let any one tell me, what hatred of sin can possibly be discover'd, in proposing the sufferings of a most innocent person to them without any consideration of sin as the cause of those sufferings? If it be said, <hi>that the doctrine of Christ was designed to draw men off from sin; and that God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his Son to dye to confirm this doctrine, and thereby shewed his hatred to sin.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 1. This is carrying the dispute off from the present business, for we are not now arguing about the design of Christs doctrine, nor the death of Christ as a means to confirm that, but as a <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, and what power that hath without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our sins as the cause of them, to draw us from sin, by discovering Gods hatred to it. 2. The doctrine of Christ according to their <hi>hypothesis,</hi> discovers much less of Gods hatred to sin than ours doth. For if God may pardon sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

any compensation made to his Laws or Honour, if repentance be in its own nature a sufficient satisfaction for all the sins past of our Lives; if there be no such thing as such a Justice in God which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires punishment of sin committed; if the punishment of sin depend barely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods will; and the most innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may suffer as much from God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to sin as the cause of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the most guilty; let any rational man judge whether this Doctrine disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as much Gods abhorrency of sin, as asserting the necessity of vindicating Gods honour to the World, by the breach of his Laws, if not by the suffering of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themselves, yet of the Son of God as a Sacrifice for the expiation of sin, by undergoing the punishment of our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so as upon consideration of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he is pleased to accept of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and sincere obedience, as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon which he will grant remission of sins, and eternal life. So that if the discovery of Gods hatred to sin be the means to reclaim men from it, we assert upon the former reasons, that much more is done upon our Doctrine concerning the sufferings of Christ, than can be upon theirs.

                        </note> Christs sufferings to be a punishment for sin, are those which assert Christ to be made <hi>sin and a curse for us:</hi> which we now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to make clear, ought to be understood in no other sense; for as <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, <q>As the Jews sometimes use sin, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sin; as appears, besides other places, by <hi>Zach. 14. 19.

                        <note place="margin">Crel. c. 1. §. 60.</note> replies, <q>That as there is no necessity, that by the name of sin, when applied to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, any more should be implied, than
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:62152:195"/>
that those sufferings were occasioned by sin, no more is there when it is applied to the person;</q> nay, much less, for he saith, <q>No more is required to this, but that he should be handled as sinners use to be, and undergo the matter of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any respect to sin, either as the cause or occasion of it.</q> So he saith, <q>The name <hi>Sinner</hi> is used, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 21. and in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the name of sin in the first clause is to be understood, as of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in the latter; and as we are said to be righteousness in him, when God deals with us as with righteous persons, so Christ was said to be sin for us, when he was dealt with as a sinner. And the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for sin under the Law were so call'd, not with a respect to the punishment of sin, but because they were offered upon the account of sin, and were used for taking away the guilt of it; or because men were bound to offer them, so that they sinned if they neglected it. So that all that is meant by <hi>Esaias</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> is, That Christ was made an expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, or that he exposed himself for those afflictions which sinners onely by right undergo.</q> But let <hi>Crellius</hi> or any others of them tell me, if the <hi>Scripture</hi> had intended to express, that the sufferings of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:62152:195"/>
Christ were a punishment of our sins, how was it possible to do it more Emphatically than it is done by these expressions (the custom of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) not onely by saying, that <hi>Christ did bear our sins,</hi> but, <hi>that himself was made sin for us?</hi> those phrases being so commonly used for the punishment of sin. Let them produce any one instance in Scripture, where those expressions are applied to any without the consideration of sin? that place 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 21. is very far from it; for in all probability, the design of <hi>Bathsheba</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Solomon King</hi> was already discovered, which was the reason that <hi>Adonijah</hi> his elder Brother declaring himself <hi>King,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited not him with the rest of the <hi>Kings</hi> sons: All that she had for <hi>Solomons</hi> succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, was a secret promise and oath of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> and therefore she urgeth him now to <hi>declare the succession, v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We shall be handled as offenders, we shall be destroyed:</hi> But surely not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the supposition of a fault, by them which should inflict that punishment upon them: The plain meaning is, they should be accused of Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:62152:196"/>
still with a respect to them, who were the inflicters, a fault or sin is supposed as the reason of their punishment, either of their own or others. But of our Saviour it is not said, <hi>That he should be counted as an offender by the Jews;</hi> for although that doth not take away his innocency, yet it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth an accusation of something, which in it self deserves punishment. But in <hi>Esai.</hi> 53. 10. it is said, <hi>He made his soul sin;</hi> and 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>That God made him sin for us,</hi> which must therefore imply, not being dealt with by men onely as a sinner, but that with a respect to him who inflicted the punishment, there was a consideration of sin as the reason of it. We do not deny but Gods suffering him to be dealt with as a sinner by men, is implied in it, for that was the method of his punishment designed; but we say further, that the reason of that permission in God, doth suppose some antecedent cause of it: For God would never have suffered his onely Son, to be so dealt with by the hands of cruel men, unless he had made himself <hi>an offering for sin;</hi> being willing to undergo those sufferings, that he might be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifice for the sins of the world. And although <hi>Socinus</hi> will not yield, <hi>That by being made sin for us, should be understood <note place="margin">Soc. l. 1. c. 8.</note>
                           <pb n="367" facs="tcp:62152:196"/>
Christs being an Expiatory Sacrifice for sin;</hi> yet <hi>Crellius</hi> is contented <hi>it should be so taken in both places:</hi> Which if he will grant, so as by virtue of that Sacrifice, the guilt of sin is expiated, we shall not contend with him about the reasons, why those Sacrifices were call'd <hi>sins,</hi> although the most proper and genuine must needs be that, which is assigned by the Law, that the sins of the people were supposed to be laid upon them, and therefore they were intended for the expiation of them: But it is very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to say, <hi>That Expiatory Sacrifices were called sins, because it would have been a sin to neglect them:</hi> For on the same account, all the other Sacrifices must have been call'd so too; for it was a sin to neglect any where God required them, and so there had been no difference between Sacrifices for sin and others. To that reason of <hi>Crellius, from our being made righteous, because dealt with as such, to Christs being made sin onely, because dealt with as a sinner,</hi> we need no more than what this parallel will afford us; For as <hi>Crellius</hi> would never say, that any are dealt with as righteous persons, who are not antecedently supposed to be so; so by his own Argument, Christs being dealt with <hi>as a sinner,</hi> must suppose guilt ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to it; and since the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:62152:197"/>
it was not his own, in those words, <hi>Who knew no sin,</hi> it follows that it must be the consideration of ours, which must make him be dealt with as a sinner by him, who made him to be sin for us. But to suppose that Christ should be said to be <hi>made sin,</hi> without any respect <hi>to sin,</hi> is as much as if the <hi>Latins</hi> should call any one <hi>Scelus,</hi> and mean thereby a very honest man; or a <hi>Piaculum,</hi> without any supposition of his own or others guilt. But we are to consider, that the sufferings of Christ, seeming at first so inconsistent with that relation to God as his onely Son, which the Apostles assert concerning him, they were obliged to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his innocency as to men, and yet withal to shew, that with a respect to God, there was sufficient reason for his permission of his undergoing these suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. That <hi>he knew no sin,</hi> was enough to clear his innocency as to men; but then the question will be asked, If he were so innocent, why did God suffer all those things to come upon him? Did not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> plead of old with God, <hi>That he would not slay the righteous with the wicked,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 25.</note> it was repugnant to the righteousness of his nature to do so; <hi>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:62152:197"/>
be as the wicked, that be far from thee; shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</hi> How then comes God to suffer the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect innocency to be dealt with so, as the greatest sins could not have deserved worse from men? Was not his righteousness the same still? And <hi>Abraham</hi> did not think the distinction of <hi>calamities</hi> and <hi>punishments,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to vindicate Gods proceedings, if the righteous should have been dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as the wicked. And if that would hold for such a measure of righteousness as might be supposed in such who were not guilty of the great abominations of those places, that it should be enough, not onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themselves, but the wicked too; how comes it that the most perfect obedience of the Son of God, is not sufficient to excuse him from the greatest sufferings of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors? But if his sufferings had been meerly from men, God been accountable onely for the bare permission; but it is said, that <hi>he fore-ordained and determined these things to be,</hi> that Christ himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that <hi>God had forsaken him;</hi> and here, <hi>that he made him sin for us:</hi> and can we imagine all this to be without any respect to the guilt of sin, as the cause of it? Why should such an expression be used of <hi>being made sin?</hi> might not many others
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:62152:198"/>
have served sufficiently to declare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities and sufferings he underwent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such a phrase as seems to reflect upon Christs innocency? If there had been no more in these expressions than our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries imagine, the Apostles were so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Christs honour, they would have avoided such ill-sounding expressions as these were; and not have affected <hi>Hebraisms,</hi> and uncouth forms of speech, to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of their Religion. But this is all which our Adversaries have to say, where words are used by them out of their proper sense, <hi>that the Prophets and Apostles affected tricks of wit, playing with words, using them sometimes in one sense, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently quite in another.</hi> So <hi>Crellius</hi> saith of Esaiah, <hi>That he affects little elegancies of words and verbal allusions, which makes him use</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crel. c. 1. §. 57.</note> 
                        <hi>words sometimes out of their proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense;</hi> thence he tells us, <hi>The sufferings of Christ are called chastisement, though they have nothing of the nature of chastisements in them:</hi> And from this liberty of interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they make words (without any other reason, than that they serve for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) be taken in several senses in the same verse: For <hi>Socinus</hi> in one verse of <note place="margin">Socin. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat. 1. cap. Joh. v. 10.</note> S. <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel, makes the <hi>World</hi> be taken in three several senses: <hi>He was in the world,</hi>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:62152:198"/>
there it is taken, saith he, for the men of the world in general: <hi>The world was made by him,</hi> there it must be understood onely of the reformation of things by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; and, <hi>the world knew him not,</hi> there it must be taken in neither of the former senses, but for the wicked of the world: What may not one make of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> by such a way of interpreting it? But by this we have the less reason to wonder, that <hi>Socinus</hi> should put such an Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon <hi>Gal. 3. 13. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</hi> In which he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>by the curse,</hi> in the first clause to be meant, <hi>the punishment of sin,</hi> but not in the second: And the reason he gives for it is, <hi>amavit enim Paulus in execrationis verbo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gutus esse.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> affected playing with the <note place="margin">Socin. de Christo servat. l. 2. c. 1.</note> word <hi>curse,</hi> understanding it first in a proper, and then a Metaphorical sense. But it is plain, that the design of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> are very different in these words: <hi>Socinus</hi> thinks he speaks onely Metaphorically, when he saith, that <hi>Christ was made a curse for us; i. e.</hi> by a bare allusion of the name, without a correspondency in the thing it self; and so that the death of Christ might be called a curse, but was not so: but S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="372" facs="tcp:62152:199"/>
speaks of this not by way of extenuation, but to set forth the greatness and weight of the punishment he underwent for us. He therefore tells us, what it was which Christ did redeem us from, <hi>The curse of the Law;</hi> and how he did it, <hi>by being not onely made a curse, but a curse for us; i. e.</hi> not by being hateful to God, or undergoing the very same curse, which we should have done; which are the two things objected by <hi>Crellius</hi> against our sense; but that the death of Christ was to be considered, not as a bare separation of soul and body, but as <hi>properly poenal,</hi> being such a kind of death, which none but <hi>Malefactors</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> were to suffer; by the undergoing of which punishment in our stead, he redeemed us from that <hi>curse</hi> which we were liable to by the violation of the Law of God. And there can be no reason to appropriate this <hi>onely to the Jews,</hi> unless the death of Christ did extend onely to the deliverance of them from the punishment of their sins; or because the curse of the Law did make that death poenal, therefore the intention of the punishment, could reach no further than the Law did; but the Apostle in the very next words speaks of the farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension of <hi>the great blessing promised to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, That it should come upon the Gentiles also;</hi>

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:62152:200"/>
by which these may be avoided any other might; so that it had not been possible for our Doctrine to have been expressed such a manner, but such kind of answers might have been given as our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries now give. If it had been said in the plainest terms, <hi>that Christs death was a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for our sins,</hi> they would as easily have avoided the force of them as they do of these; they would have told us <q>the Apostles delighted in an Antanacla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, and had expressed things different from the natural use of the words by them; and though punishment were sometimes used properly, yet here it must be used only metaphorically because the matter would bear no other sense.</q> And therefore I commend the ingenuity of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> after all the pains he had taken to enervate the force of those places which are brought against his Doctrine; he tells us plainly, <q>That if our Doctrine were not only once, but frequently <note place="margin">Socin. de servat. l. 3. c. 6.</note> mentioned in Scripture; yet he would not therefore believe the thing to be so as we suppose. For, <hi>saith he,</hi> seeing the thing it self cannot be, I take the least inconvenient interpretation of the words; and draw forth such a sense

from them, as is most consistent with it self and the tenour of the Scripture.</q> But for all his talking of the tenour of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> by the same reason he interprets one place upon these terms, he will do many, and so the tenour of the <hi>Scripture</hi> shall be never against him: and by this we find, that the main strength of our Adversaries is not pretended to lye in the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> all the care they have of them is only to reconcile them if possible with their <hi>hypothesis;</hi> for they do not deny but that the natural force of the words doth imply what we contend for; but because they say the Doctrine we assert is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with reason, therefore all their design is to find out any other possible meaning, which they therefore assert to be true, because more agreeable to the common reason of mankind. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is enough for our present purpose, that if it had been the design of Scripture to have expressed our sense, it could not have done it in plainer expressions than it hath done, that no expressions could have been used, but the same arts of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries might have been used to take off their force, which they have used to those we now urge against them, and that setting

in its Members, either in the most, or the most principal, though the fewest:</q> but we are to consider, how far he doth extend this way of punishment of some in others. 1. <hi>At the greatest distance of time, if they have been of the same Nation;</hi> for he extends it to the utmost degree of Gods patience towards a people; <q>For, <hi>saith he,</hi> God doth not presently punish as soon as they have sin'd; but spares for a great while, and forbears, in expectation of their repentance, in the mean while a great many guilty persons dye, and seem <note place="margin">Crell. p. 242.</note> to have escaped punishment. But at last the time of Gods patience being past, he punisheth their Posterity by exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the full punishment of their sins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and by this means punisheth their Ancestors too, and punisheth their sins in their punishment; for, <hi>saith he,</hi> all that people are reckon'd for one man of several Ages, and that punishment which is taken of the last, may be for the sins of the first, for the conjunction and succession of them: of which we have an example, <hi>saith he,</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                        </q> By which we see a very remote conjunction, and a meer si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude in comparing a succession of Ages in a people with those in a man, may
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:62152:205"/>
(when occasion serves) be made use of to justifie Gods punishing one Generation of men for the sins of others that have been long before. 2. <hi>When sins are more secret, or less remarkable, which God might not punish, unless an occasion were given from others sins impelling him to it;</hi> but because God would punish one very near them, he therefore punisheth them, that in their punishment he might punish the other: Or in case sins spread through a Family, or a people, or they are committed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers persons at sundry times, which God doth not severally punish, but sometimes then, when the Head of a People or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily hath done something which remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably deserves punishment, whom he will punish in those he is related to, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generally punisheth the whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or people. 3. <hi>That which may be a meer exercise of dominion as to some, may be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per punishment to others;</hi> as in the case of <hi>Infants,</hi> being taken away for their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> sins; <hi>For God, as to the Children,</hi> he saith, <hi>useth only an act of dominion, but the punishment only redounds to the Parents, who loose them; and though this be done for the very end of punishment,</hi> yet he denyes, <hi>that it hath the nature of Punishment in any but the Parents. 4. That Punishment may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:62152:206"/>
for those who can have no sense at all of it;</hi> as <hi>Crellius</hi> asserts in the case of <note place="margin">Crell. ib. sect. 11. sect. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Sauls sons,</hi> 2 Sam. 21. 8. 14. that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment was mainly intended for <hi>Saul,</hi> who was already dead. From these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of <hi>Crellius</hi> in this case, we may take notice, 1. That a remote conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be sufficient for a translation of penalty, <hi>viz.</hi> from one Generation to another. 2. That sins may be truly said to be punished in others, when the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themselves may escape punishment, thus the sins of Parents in their Children, and Princes in their Subjects. 3. That an act of dominion in some may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as a proper punishment to others. 4. That the nature of punishment is not to be measured by the sense of it. Now upon these concessions, though our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries will not grant, that Christ was properly punished for our sins, yet they cannot deny but that we may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to be <hi>punished</hi> for our sins in <hi>Christ,</hi> and if they will yield us this, the other may be a strife about words. For surely there may be easily imagined as great a conjunction between Christ and us, as between the several Generations of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that last which was punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the destruction of <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:62152:206"/>
though we escape that punishment which Christ did undergo, yet we might have our sins punished in him, as well as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces theirs in their Subjects, when they escape themselves; or rather as Subjects in an innocent Prince, who may suffer for the faults of his people; if it be said, <hi>that these are acts of meer dominion as to such a one,</hi> that nothing hinders but grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, yet our sins may be said to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in him; as well as Parents sins are punished properly in meer acts of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon their Children; if it be said, <hi>that can be no punishment where there is no sense at all of it,</hi> that is fully taken off by <hi>Crellius;</hi> for surely we have as great a sense of the sufferings of Christ, as the first Generation of the <hi>Jews</hi> had of the suffering of the last, before the fatal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the City, or as <hi>Saul</hi> had of the punishment of his Sons after his death. So that from <hi>Crellius</hi> his own concessions, we have proved, that <hi>our sins may very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said to be punished in Christ,</hi> although he will not say, that Christ could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly punished for our sins; nay he and the rest of our Adversaries not only deny it, but earnestly contend, that it is very unjust to suppose it, and repugnant to the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Gods nature to do it.</p>

And so we come to consider the mighty <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>Crellius</hi> his arguments propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> arguments that are insisted on for the proof of this, which may be reduced to these three; <hi>viz. 1. That there can be no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but what is deserved, but no man can deserve that another should be punished. 2. That punishment flows from revenge, but there can be no revenge where there hath been no fault. 3. That the punishment of one, cannot any ways be made the punishment of another; and in case it be supposed possible, then those in whose stead the other is punished, must be actually delivered upon the payment of that debt which was owing to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That one man cannot deserve anothers punishment,</hi> and therefore one cannot be punished for another; for there is no just punishment, but what is deserved. This being the main Argument insisted on by <hi>Crellius,</hi> must be more carefully considered; but before an answer be made to it, it is necessary that a clear account be given in what sense it is he understands it, which will be best done, by laying down his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as to the justice of punishments, in a more distinct method than himself hath done; which are these following: 1. That no person can be justly punished, either for his own or anothers faults, but he that hath deserved to be punished by some sin,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:62152:207"/>
of his own: For he still asserts, <q>That the justice of punishment ariseth from a <note place="margin">Crell. c. 4. s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That personal guilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, supposed one mans sin may be the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive cause</hi> of anothers punishment, but they cannot be the <hi>meritorious.</hi> The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them he thus explains, <q>The cause, is that which makes a thing to be; the impulsive, that which moves one to do a thing, without any consideration of right that one hath to do it: Merit, is that which makes a man worthy of a thing, either good or bad, and so gives a right to it; if it be good, to himself; if bad, to him at whose hands he hath deserved it.</q> Now he tells us, that it is impossible, <q>That one mans sins should make any other deserve punishment, but the person who committed them; but they may impel one to punish another, and that justly, if the person hath otherwise deserved to be punished, unjustly if he hath not.</q> The reason he gives of it is, <q>That the vitiosity of the act, which is the proper cause of punishment, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:62152:208"/>
go beyond the person of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender; and therefore can oblige none to punishment, but him that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the fault. And therefore he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, That no man can be justly punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond the desert of his own sins, but there may sometimes be a double impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive cause of that punishment; <hi>viz.</hi> His own and other mens, whereof one made <note place="margin">Crell. ib. sect. 18.</note> that they might be justly punished, the other that they should be actually: but the latter, <hi>he saith,</hi> always supposeth the former, as the foundation of just punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so that no part of punishment could be executed upon him, wherein his own sins were not supposed as the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause of it.</q> These are his two main principles which we must now throughly examine, the main force of his book lying in them. But if we can prove, that it hath been generally received by the consent of mankind, that a person may be punished beyond the desert of his own actions; if God hath justly punished some for the sins of others, and there be no injustice in one mans suffering by his own consent for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, then these principles of <hi>Crellius</hi> will be found not so firm as he imagines them.</p>

reason and ends of punishment assigned by him, where there is <hi>no desert</hi> at all of it in the person who undergoes it. But then he adds, <hi>that this is an unjust punishment,</hi> to which I reply, That then the reason of punishment assigned by <hi>Crellius</hi> before is insufficient; for if this answers all the ends of punishments assigned by him, and yet be unjust, then it necessarily follows, that those ends of punishment are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the greatest injustice. For he before made punishment to have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral respect to anger, and makes the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary end of punishment to be a satisfaction of the desire of revenge in men, yet now grants, that these may be in an unjust pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Neither can it be said, <hi>that he consider'd punishment only naturally, and not morally;</hi> for he tells us, <hi>that this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of divine punishments,</hi> which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore just, because designed for these ends; but in case there be no supposal of a fault at all, then he denyes that it is a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only an affliction, and an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of dominion. So that according to him, where-ever there is a proper punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it must be just, when-ever God doth punish men: and the only difference between God and man supposable in this case is, that we have assurance God will
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:62152:210"/>
never use his dominion unjustly; but that men do so when they make one to suffer for anothers fault, notwithstanding a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and conjunction between the man that committed the fault, and the person that suffers for him. But this is begging the thing in question, for we are debating, whether it be an unlawfull exercise of power or no? for we have this presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is not unlawfull, because it may answer all the ends of punishments, and what way can we better judge, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>But we are to consider, that we do not <note place="margin">§. 5.

And in this case we assert, since ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Crellius</hi> the natural and proper ends of punishments may be obtained, and the consent of the person takes away the wrong done to him in the matter of his sufferings, so far as he hath power over himself, that such a punishment is not unjust.

let them assign where the injury lyes; it cannot be to the <hi>publick,</hi> if the ends of punishments may be obtained by such a suffering of one for another, by a valid consent of the suffering party; it cannot be to the <hi>person</hi> in <hi>whose room</hi> the other suffers, for what injury is that to escape punishment by anothers suffering; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be to <hi>the suffering person,</hi> supposing that to be true, which the Heathens still sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, <hi>viz.</hi> that every man had a power over his own life.

in the thing, there is a dignity in the person, or he may be said to be <hi>worthy</hi> to undergo it. <hi>But doth not this lay open the greatest innocency to as great a desert of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as the highest guilt?</hi> By no means. For we make a lyableness to punishment, the natural consequent of guilt: and he that hath committed a fault, cannot but <hi>deserve</hi> to be punished, so that no suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others can take away the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral consequence of a bad action, which is a <hi>desert of punishment;</hi> So that as we say, a wicked action cannot but deserve to be punished, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is an agreeableness in reason and nature, that he who hath done ill, should suffer ill; so we say like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there is no necessity in nature and reason, that he that hath thus deserved it, must unavoidably suffer it. And on the other side, we say, <hi>no man by his innocency can deserve to be punished,</hi> i. e. no mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency makes him by vertue of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to punishment; but yet we add, that <hi>notwithstanding his innocency,</hi> the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances may be such that he may be <hi>justly</hi> punished, and in that sense <hi>deservedly.</hi> So that the Question is strangely mistaken, when it is thus put, <hi>Whether an innocent person consider'd as such, may be justly punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> for no one asserts that, or is bound
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:62152:213"/>
to do it; but the true question is, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a person notwithstanding his innocency may not by some act of his own will oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to undergo that punishment which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he did not deserve? which punishment, in that case is just and agreeable to reason:</hi> And this is that which we assert and plead for. So that innocency here is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered any other ways, than whether that alone makes it an unlawfull punishment, which otherwise would be lawfull, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether the Magistrate in such cases, where substitution is admittable by the Laws of Nations (as in the cases we are now upon) be bound to regard any more than that the obligation to punishment now lyes upon the person, who by his own act hath substituted himself in the others room; and if he proceeds upon this, his action is justifyable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reason. If it be said, <hi>that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution is unjust, unless the substituted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath before hand deserved to be punished;</hi> it is easily answered, that this makes not the matter at all clearer; for either the person is punished for the former fault, and then there is no substitution; or if he be punished by way of substitution, then there is no regard at all had to his former fault, and so it is all one as if he were perfectly innocent.</p>

And by this <hi>Crellius</hi> his answer to the instances both in <hi>Scripture</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <note place="margin">§. 6. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Scripture considered.</note> concerning Childrens being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for their Parents faults, will appear to be insufficient, Viz. <q>That God doth never punish them for their Parents faults beyond the desert of their own sins, and therefore no argument can be drawn from thence, that God may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish an innocent person for the sins of others, because he hath punished some for what they were innocent:</q> For the force of the argument doth not lye in the supposition of their innocency, as to the ground of punishment in general, for we do not deny, but that they may deserve to be punished for their own faults: but the argument lyes in this, whether their own guilt were then considered as the reason of punishment, when God did punish them for their fathers faults? And whether they by their own sins did deserve to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished not only with the punishment due to their own miscarriages, but with the punishment due to their fathers too? If not, then some persons are justly punished, who have not deserved that punishment they undergo; if they did deserve it, then one person may deserve to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for anothers sins. If it be said, as it is by <hi>Crellius, That his own sins make him
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:62152:214"/>
capable of punishment, and God by occasion of others sins doth execute that punishment, which he might not have done for his own.</hi> I answer, we are not enquiring into the bare capacity of punishing, but into the reason of it: was the reason of punishment his own or his fathers sins? If his own, then he was punished only for his own sins; if his fathers, then the punishment may be just which is inflicted without considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proper <hi>desert</hi> of it; <hi>for no man</hi> (say they) <hi>can deserve to be punished, but for his own sins.</hi> But it's said, <hi>that the sins of Fathers are only an impulsive cause for God to punish the Children according to the desert of their own sins, which he might otherwise have forborn to punish.</hi> Then, the sins of the Fathers are no <hi>reason</hi> why the Children should be punished; but their own sins are the <hi>reason,</hi> and their Fathers the <hi>bare occasion</hi> of being punished for them. But in <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>reason</hi> of punishment is drawn from the <hi>Fathers sins:</hi> and not from the <hi>Childrens:</hi> For then the words would have run thus, <hi>if the Children sin, and deserve punishment by their own iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then I will take occasion from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sins, to visit their own iniquities upon them:</hi> Whereas the words referre to the <hi>fathers sins</hi> as the reason of the <hi>Childrens</hi> punishment. So in the words of the Law,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:62152:215"/>
wherein the reason of punishment ought to be most expresly assigned, it is not, I will certainly punish the children, if they continue in the Idolatry of their Fathers; but, <hi>I will visit the sins of the Fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>

Did the people in <hi>Josiah's</hi> time, deserve to be punished for the sins of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to <hi>Josiah?</hi> Or was God so highly provoked with those sins, that although he did not punish <hi>Manasseh</hi> himself upon his repentance, yet he would let the world see, how much he abhorred them, by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing those sins upon the people after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; although according to the usual proportion of sins and punishments, the sins of the people in that age did not exceed
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:62152:216"/>
the sins of other ages, as much as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments they suffered, did exceed the punishments of other ages: which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary according to <hi>Crellius</hi> his Doctrine; for if God never punisheth by occasion of their Fathers sins, the children beyond the <hi>desert</hi> of their own <hi>sins;</hi> then it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that where judgements are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably greater, the sins must be so too; the contrary to which is plain in this instance.

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:62152:217"/>
made by the <hi>Jews,</hi> soon after their going into Captivity, which they imputed to Gods severity in punishing them for their Fathers sins. Now the complaint was either true or false; if it were true, then though this was looked upon as great severity in God, yet it was no injustice in him; for though God may act severely, he cannot act unjustly: If it was false, then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer had been an absolute denial of it, as a thing repugnant to the Justice of God. Which we do not find here, but that God saith unto them, <hi>v. 3. Ye shall not have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion any more to use this Proverb in Israel:</hi> if the thing had been plainly unjust, which they complained of, he would have told them, they never had occasion to use it. But we finde the <hi>Prophets</hi> telling them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, that they should suffer for their Fathers sins, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 15. 3, 4. where he threatens them with destruction and banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because of the <hi>sins of Manasseh in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem;</hi> and in the beginning of the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity they complain of this, <hi>Lam. 5. 7. Our Fathers have sinned, and are not, and we have born their iniquities.</hi> And <hi>Jerem. 31. 28. God</hi> saith by the <hi>Prophet, that he had watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over them to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to afflict: but that he would watch over them to build, and to plant,

                        <hi>Hebrew,</hi> than the other Versions do. So that the <hi>Land of Israel</hi> was the occasion of the <hi>Proverb,</hi> by their being banished out of it for their Fathers sins: Now God tells them, they should have no more occasion to use this Proverb concerning the <hi>Land of Israel;</hi> for they, notwithstanding their Fathers sins, should return into their own <hi>Land.</hi> And even during the continuance of their captivity, they should not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go such great severities for the future, but they should find their condition much more tolerable than they imagined; onely, if any were guilty of greater sins than others, they should themselves suffer for their own faults, but he would not punish the whole Nation for them, or their own posterity. This I take to be the genuine meaning of this place; and I the rather embrace it, because I find such insuperable difficulties in other Interpretations that are given of it: For to say as our Adversaries do, <hi>That what God saith, should not be for the future, was repugnant to his nature and justice ever to do,</hi> is to charge God plainly with injustice in what he had done: For the <hi>Prophets</hi> told them they should suffer for the sins of their <hi>Fathers:</hi> Which sufferings were the ground of their complaint now, and the answer here given must relate to
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:62152:218"/>
the occasion of the complaint; for God saith, <hi>They should not have occasion to use that Proverb:</hi> Wherein is implied, they should not have the same reason to complain which they had then. I demand then, Do not these words imply, That God would not do for the future with them, what he had done before? if not, the proper an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer had been a plain denial, and not a promise for the future he would not; if they do, then either <hi>God</hi> properly punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for the sins of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> and then God must be <hi>unjust</hi> in doing so; or it was just with <hi>God</hi> to do it, and so this place instead of overthrowing will prove, that some may be justly punished, beyond the desert of their own sins: or else, <hi>God did onely take occasion by their Fathers sins, to punish them according to the desert of their own iniquities:</hi> But then they had no cause to complain, that they were punished for any more than their own iniquities; and withal, then God doth oblige himself by his promise here, never to punish men for the future <hi>by the occasion of others sins:</hi> which is not onely contrary to their own Doctrine, but to what is plainly seen after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the punishment of the <hi>Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or if they be taken with a respect to the immediate oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of them both, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.—33. They do not relate to this dispute about <hi>Childrens suffering for their Fathers sins;</hi> but to another, which was concerning a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 20.</note> mans sinning and dying in his sins,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:62152:219"/>
and a wicked mans repenting, and living in his righteousness; which were directly contrary to the common opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> to this day, which is, that God will judge men according to the greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their actions good or bad: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Maimonides</hi> and others. Now they thought it a very hard case, for a man who had been righteous the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of his time, if he did at last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit iniquity, that his former righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should signifie nothing, but he must dye in his iniquity. To this therefore God answers, that it was only the inequality of their own ways, which made them think Gods ways in doing so unequal. This then doth not make it unequal, for God either to punish men, upon the occasion, or by the desert of other mens sins, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing such a conjunction between them, as there is in the same body of people, to those who went before them. And <hi>Crellius</hi> himself grants, <q>That <hi>Socinus</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">Crell. c. 4. sect. 15.</note> intended to prove, that one mans suffering for anothers sins was unjust in it self, from this place: no, not though we take it in the strictest sense, for one suffering in the stead of another.</q>

                           <pb n="411" facs="tcp:62152:220"/>
nor he do deny that one man may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for anothers sins; but that which they deny is, that ever the innocent were punished so as the guilty were freed by it, <hi>and so he answers,</hi> in the case of Hostages and Sureties, their punishment did never excuse the offenders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And to this purpose <hi>he saith, Socinus</hi> his argument doth hold good, that though one mans money may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come anothers, yet one mans sufferings cannot become anothers: For, <hi>saith he,</hi> if it could, then it would be all one who suffered, as it is who pays the money due: And then the offender must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently released, as the Debtor is upon payment of the debt.</q> This is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of what is said by him upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. To which I reply; 1. That this gives up the matter in dispute at present between us; for the present question is, Whether it be unjust for any one to suffer beyond the desert of his own actions? <hi>Yes,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, it is, in case he suffers so, as that the guilty be freed by his sufferings.</hi> But we are not enquiring, Whether it be just for another person to be freed for a mans suffering for him? but whether it be just for that man to suffer by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, more than <hi>his own</hi> actions, without
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:62152:221"/>
that consent deserved? The release of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other person by virtue of his sufferings, is a matter of another consideration. Doth the freeing or not freeing of another by suffering, add any thing to the <hi>desert</hi> of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering? He that being wholly innocent, and doth suffer on the account of anothers fault, doth he not suffer as <hi>undeservedly,</hi> though another be not freed, as if he were? As in the case of <hi>Hostages</hi> or Sureties, doth it make them at all the more guilty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the persons they are concerned for, will be punished notwithstanding, if they come under the power of those who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted the punishment upon them, who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for them? Nay, is not their <hi>desert</hi> of punishment so much the less, in as much as the guilty are still bound to answer for their own offences? If we could suppose the guilty to be freed by the others suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it would be by supposing their guilt more fully translated upon those who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and consequently, a greater obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to punishment following that guilt. From whence it follows, that if it be just to punish, when the person is not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from whom the other suffers, it is more just when he is; for the translation of the penalty is much less in the former case, than in the latter; and what is just upon
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:62152:221"/>
less grounds of punishment, must be more just upon greater. I look on this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but as a shift of <hi>Crellius,</hi> hoping thereby to avoid the consent of mankind in one mans suffering for another, without attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the main argument he was upon; <hi>viz.</hi> The justice of one person suffering for another. 2. It is a very unreasonable thing, to make an action unjust for that, which of it self is acknowledged by our <hi>Adversaries</hi> to be very just; <hi>viz.</hi> The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the offenders themselves. If it were just to suffer, if the other were not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and it were just to pardon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the other were punished or no, how comes this suffering to be unjust, meerly by the others being pardoned by it: nay, is it not rather an Argument, that those sufferings are the most just, which do so fully answer all the ends of punishments; that there is then no necessity that the offender should suffer; but that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governor having obtained the ends of Government, by the suffering of one for the rest, declares himself so well pleased with it, that he is willing to pardon the offenders themselves. 3. Many of those persons who have had their sins punished in others, have themselves escaped the punishment due to the desert of their sins.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:62152:222"/>
As is plain in the case of <hi>Ahab,</hi> whose punishment was not so great as his sins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, because the full punishment of them was reserved to his posterity. If it be said, as it is by <hi>Crellius, That</hi> Ahab <hi>was not wholly</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. c. 4. sect. 25. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>freed, his life being taken away, for his own sins:</hi> That gives no sufficient answer; for if some part of the punishment was deferr'd, that part he was delivered from; and the same reason in this case will hold for the whole as the part. As is plain in the case of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and several others, the guilt of whose sins were punished on their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, themselves escaping it. 4. Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries confess, that in some cases it is lawful and just for some to suffer, with a design that others may be freed by their suffering for them. Thus they assert, <hi>That one Christian, not onely may, but ought to lay down his life for another, if there be any danger of his denying the truth, or he judges him far more useful and considerable</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. c. 6. sect. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>than himself: so likewise a son for his Father, one Brother for another, or a Friend, or any, whose life he thinks more useful than his own.</hi> Now I ask, whether a man can be bound to a thing that is <hi>in its own nature unjust?</hi> if not, as it is plain he cannot, then such an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of one man to suffer for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of another cannot be unjust, and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:62152:222"/>
consequently the suffering it self cannot be so. But <hi>Crellius</hi> saith, <hi>The injustice in this case lyes wholly upon the Magistrate who admits it:</hi> but I ask wherefore is it unjust in the Magistrate to admit it? is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the thing is in it self unjust? if so, there can be no obligation to do it; and it would be as great a sin to undergo it, as in the Magistrate to permit it; but if it be just in it self, we have obtained what we contend for; <hi>viz.</hi> that it may be just for a man to suffer beyond <hi>the desert</hi> of his own actions; for he that layes down his life for his Brethren, doth not deserve by his own actions that very punishment which he undergoes. And if the thing be in it self just, how comes it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just in him that permits it? 5. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why among men the offenders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are punished, is because those were not the terms, upon which the persons suffered. For if they had suffer'd upon these terms that the other might be freed, and their suffering was admitted of by the Magistrate on that consideration, then in all reason and justice the offenders ought to be freed on the account of the others suffering for them. But among men the chief reason of the obligation to punishment of one man for another, is not,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:62152:223"/>
that the other might be freed, but that there may be security given to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that the offender shall be punish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> and the reason of the sureties suffering is not to deliver the offender, but to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Law, by declaring that all care is taken that the offender should be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when in case of his escape, the surety suffers for him. But it is quite another thing when the person suffers purposely that others might be freed by his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for then in case the suffering be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the release of the other is not only not unjust, but becomes due to him that suffer'd, on his own terms. Not as though it follow'd <hi>ipso facto</hi> as <hi>Crellius</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, but the manner of release doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the terms which he who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for them, shall make in order to it. For upon this suffering of one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon such terms, the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of the suffering is not the <hi>actual discharge</hi> but the <hi>right</hi> to it which he hath purchased; and which he may dispense upon what terms he shall judge most for his honour. 6. Although one persons sufferings cannot become anothers so as one mans <hi>Money</hi> may; yet one mans suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings may be a sufficient consideration on which a benefit may accrue to another.
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:62152:223"/>
For to that end a donation, or such a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring right from one to another as is in <hi>Money,</hi> is not necessary, but the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it hath from him who hath the power to pardon. If he declare that he is so well pleased with the sufferings of one for another, that in consideration of them, he will pardon those from whom he suffer'd; where lies the impossibility or unreasonableness of the thing? For <hi>Crellius</hi> grants, <hi>that rewards may be given to others than the persons who did the actions</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. ib. s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>in consideration of those actions;</hi> and why may not the sufferings of one for others, being purposely undertaken for this end, be available for the pardon of those whom he suffer'd for? For a man can no more transferre the right of his good actions, than of his sufferings. From all which it follows, that one person may by his own consent, and being admitted thereto by him to whom the right of punishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, suffer justly; though it be beyond the desert of his own actions; and the guilty may be pardoned on the account of his sufferings. Which was the first thing we designed to prove from <hi>Crellius,</hi> in order to the overthrowing his own <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.</hi> For it being confessed by him that such sufferings have all that belongs to the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:62152:224"/>
nature of punishments, and since God hath justly punished some for the sins which they have not committed; since all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have allowed it just for one man by his own consent to suffer for another; since it cannot be unjust for the offender to be released by anothers sufferings, if he were admitted to suffer for that end, it evidently follows, contrary to <hi>Crellius</hi> his main Principle, that <hi>a person may be justly punished beyond the desert of his own actions:</hi> And so that first argument of <hi>Crellius</hi> cannot hold, <hi>that one man cannot by his own consent suffer for another, because no man can deserve anothers punishment, and no punishment is just but what is deserved.</hi> His second argument from the nature of <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> hath been already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in the first Discourse about the nature and ends of punishments, and his third argument, <hi>that one mans punishment cannot become anothers,</hi> immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And so we have finished our first consideration of the <hi>sufferings of Christ</hi> in general, as <hi>a punishment of our sins,</hi> which we have shewed to be agreeable both to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>

                     <p>WE come now to consider the death of Christ, as an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">§. 1. The death of Christ considered as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for sin.</note> 
                        <hi>for the sins of mankinde:</hi> Which is as much denied by our Adversaries, as that it was a punishment for our sins. For though they do not deny, <hi>That Christ as a Priest did offer up a Sacrifice of Expiation for the sins of men;</hi> yet they utterly deny, <hi>That this was performed on earth,</hi> or that <hi>the Expiation of sins did respect God, but onely us;</hi> or, <hi>that the death of Christ, had any proper efficacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the expiation of sin, any further than as it comprehends in it all the consequences of his death,</hi> by a strange <hi>Catechresis.</hi> I shall now therefore prove, that all things which do belong to a proper Expiatory Sacrifice, do agree to the death of Christ. There are three things especially considerable in it: 1. A Substitution in the place of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders. 2. An Oblation of it to God. 3. An Expiation of sin consequent upon it. Now these three, I shall make appear to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree fully to the death of Christ for us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A Substitution in the place of the Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</hi> That we are to prove, was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> and that <hi>Christ</hi> in his death <hi>for us,</hi> was <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted</hi>

in our place. 1. That in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifices under the Law, there was a <hi>Substitution</hi> of them <hi>in the place</hi> of the Offenders. This our Adversaries are not willing to yield us, because of the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency which is so plain in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> between those Sacrifices, and that which was offered up by Christ. We now speak onely of those Sacrifices, which we are sure were appointed of old for the expiation of sin, by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

                        <hi>understood, of what was done under the Law:</hi> They will not be the less serviceable to our purpose; for thereby it will appear, that the means of Expiation lay in the <hi>shedding of blood:</hi> Which shews, that the very <hi>mactation</hi> of the beast to be sacrificed, was designed in order to the expiation of sin. To an inquisitive person, the reason of the slaying such multitudes of beasts in the Sacrifices appointed by God himself among the <hi>Jews,</hi> would have appeared far less evident than now it doth, since the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hath given us so full an account of them. For
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:62152:227"/>
it had been very unreasonable to have thought, that they had been meerly insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted out of compliance with the customs of other Nations, since the whole design of their Religion, was to separate them from them: and on such a supposition the great design of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> signifies very little; which doth far more explain to us the nature and tendency of all the Sacrifices in use among them, that had any respect to the expiation of sins, than all the customs of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or the Commentaries of the latter <hi>Jews.</hi> But I intend not now to discourse at large, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this subject of Sacrifices, either as to the nature and institution of them in general, or with a particular respect to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ, since a learned person of our <hi>Church,</hi> hath already undertaken <hi>Crellius</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Argument, and we hope ere long will oblige the world with the benefit of his pains. I shall therefore onely insist on those things which are necessary for our purpose, in order to the clearing the Substitution of Christ in our stead, for the expiation of our sins by his death; and this we say was represented in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifices, which were instituted among the <hi>Jews.</hi> If we yield <hi>Crellius</hi> what he <note place="margin">Crell. c. 10. sect. 13.</note> after <hi>Socinus</hi> contends for; <hi>viz.

head of a heifer instead of him: In which case, the death of the heifer was to do as much towards the expiating the Land, as the death of the Murtherer if he had been found: And we do not contend, <hi>that this was designed to expiate the Murtherers guilt</hi> (which is the Objection of <hi>Crellius</hi> against <note place="margin">

Which may be enough at present to shew, that a substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was admitted by the Law, of a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice instead of the offender, in order to the expiation of guilt; but whether the offender himself was to be freed by that Sacrifice, depends upon the terms on which
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:62152:233"/>
the sacrifice was offered; for we say still, that so much <hi>guilt</hi> was expiated, as the sacrifice was designed to expiate; if the sacrifice was designed to expiate the guilt of the offender, his sin was expiated by it; if not his, in case no sacrifice was allowed by the Law, as in that of murther, then the guilt which lay upon the Land was expiated, although the offender himself were never discovered.</p>

eternal death for us, or that we were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately freed by his sufferings.

substitution,</hi> because <hi>the death of Christ was a bare condition, and no punishment,</hi> they then express their minds more freely; and if these places be allowed to prove a substitution, I hope the former discourse will prove that it was by way of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neither is it necessary, <hi>that the very same kinde of punishment be undergone in order to surrogation,</hi> but that it be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in order to the accomplishing the end for which it was designed.

If <hi>David</hi> had obtained his wish, that he had dyed himself for his Son <hi>Absolom,</hi> it had not been necessary in order to his Sons escape, that he had <hi>hanged by the hair of his head,</hi> as his Son did; but his death, though in other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, had been sufficient.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The notion of a sacrifice belongs to the death of Christ, because of the Oblation made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to God. <hi>Crellius</hi> his sense of Christs Oblation proposed. Against him it is proved, that the Priestly Office of Christ had a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary respect to God, and not to us. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifices did divert the wrath of God. Christ not a bare Metaphorical High-Priest. <hi>Crellius</hi> destroyes the Priesthood of Christ by confounding it with the exercise of his Regal Power. No proper expiation of sin belongs to Christ in Heaven, if <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his Doctrine be true. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. proves the death of Christ an expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and an Oblation to God. The Phrase of <hi>a sweet-smelling savour,</hi> belongs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifices; <hi>Crellius</hi> his gross no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. His mistakes about the kinds of Sacrifices. Burnt-offerings were expiatory sacrifices both before and under the Law. A new distribution of sacrifices proposed. What influence the mactation of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice had on Expiation. The High-Priest only to slay the Sin-offering on the day of Atonement; from whence it is proved, that
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:62152:241"/>
Christs Priesthood did not begin from his entrance into Heaven. The mactation in expiatory sacrifices no bare preparation to a sacrifice, proved by the Jewish Laws, and the customs of other Nations. Whether Christs Oblation of himself once to God, were in Heaven, or on Earth? Of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of Oblations under the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law. Several things observed from thence to our purpose. All things necessary to a legal Oblation, concurre in the death of Christ. His entrance into Heaven hath no correspondency with it; if the blood of Christ were no sacrifice for sin. In Sin-offerings for the People, the whole was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed; no eating of the sacrifices allowed the Priests, but in those for private Persons. Christs exercise of Power in Heaven, in no sense an Oblation to God. <hi>Crellius,</hi> his sense repugnant to the circumstances of the places in dispute. Objections answered.</p>

of Representation; whereof the first was done in the Temple, the second in the Holy of Holies; so the first of Christ was on Earth, the second in Heaven; the first is not a bare preparation to a Sacrifice, but a Sacrifice: the latter not so much a Sacrifice, as the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of one already past. Wherefore, since appearing and interceding are not properly sacerdotal acts, any further than they depend on the efficacy of a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice already offer'd, he that takes away that Sacrifice, doth not leave to Christ any proper Priesthood, against the plain authority of the Scripture, which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to Christ the office of a Priest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from that of a Prophet and a King.</q> To which <hi>Crellius</hi> replyes: <hi>That the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

For his Priestly Office,</hi> he saith, <hi>is never in Scripture mention'd as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from his Kingly, but is comprehended under it; and the great difference between them is, that one is of a larger extension than the other is, the Kingly Office extending to punishing, and the Priestly only to expiation.</hi> This is the substance of what <hi>Crellius</hi> more at large discourseth upon this subject. Wherein he asserts these things. 1. That the Priestly Office of Christ doth not in reference to the expiation of sins respect <hi>God</hi> but us; his Intercession and Oblation wherein he makes the sacerdotal function of Christ to consist, being the exercise of his power for the good of his People. 2. That Christ did offer up no Sacrifice of expiation to God upon Earth, because the <hi>mactation</hi> had no reference to expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any other than as a preparation for it; and Christ not yet being constituted a <hi>High-Priest</hi> till after his Resurrection from the dead. Against these two asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I shall direct my following discourse,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:62152:243"/>
by proving; 1. That the Priestly Office of Christ had a primary respect to God, and not to us, 2. That Christ did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this Priestly Office in the Oblation of himself to God upon the Cross.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Priestly Office of Christ had <note place="margin">§. 2. That the Priestly Office of Christ had a primary respect to God, and not us. <hi>Crell. in Heb.</hi> 5. 1.</note> a primary respect <hi>to God, and not to us;</hi> which appears from the first Institution of a <hi>High-Priest,</hi> mentioned by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Hebr. 5. 1. <hi>For every High-Priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: Id est,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>ut procuret &amp; peragat ea quae ad co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendum ac propitiandum numen pertinent;</hi> i. e. That he may perform the things which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the <hi>worshipping</hi> and <hi>propitiating God:</hi> We desire no more, but that <hi>the propitiating God,</hi> may as immediately be said to respect him, as the <hi>worshipping</hi> of <hi>God</hi> doth; or let <hi>Crellius</hi> tell us, what sense <hi>the propitiating God</hi> will bear; if all that the <hi>High-Priest</hi> had to do, did immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the people: nay, he saith not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <q>That it was the chief Office of a High-Priest, to plead the cause of sinners with God, and to take care, that they may find him kind and propitious, and not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry or displeased.</q> In what sense <hi>God</hi> was said to be <hi>moved</hi> by the Expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:62152:243"/>
is not here our business to discuss; it is sufficient for our purpose, that they were instituted with a respect to <hi>God,</hi> so as to procure his favour, and divert his wrath. In which sense, the Priest is so often in the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> said, by the offering up of Sacrifices, to expiate the sins of the people. But <hi>Crellius</hi> saith, <q>This ought not <note place="margin">Crell. c. 10. sect. 3.</note> so to be understood, as though God by Expiatory Sacrifices, were diverted from his anger, and inclined to pardon;</q> which is a plain contradiction, not onely to the words of the Law, but to the instances that are recorded therein; as when <hi>Aaron</hi> was bid in the time of the <hi>Plague, to make an</hi>

                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>was intreated for the Land, and the plague was stayed from Israel:</hi> By which nothing can be more plain, than that the primary intention of such Sacrifices, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the Office of the <hi>Priest</hi> who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them, did immediately respect the <hi>Atoning God:</hi> But yet <hi>Crellius</hi> urgeth, <q>This cannot be said of all, or of the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

Doth Christ in Heaven declare the pardon of sin any other way than it was declared by him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth?

And yet nothing can be more remote from the notion of Christs <hi>Priesthood,</hi> than that is; so that expiation of sins according to them can have no respect at all to the Oblation of Christ in Heaven, or (which is all one in their sense) his continuance in Heaven to his second coming. <hi>Yes,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, his continuance there, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>

<pb n="466" facs="tcp:62152:249"/>
thing, which hath no influence at all upon it, should be looked on as a condition in order to it. From whence it appears, that while our Adversaries do make the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of <hi>Christs Priesthood</hi> to respect <hi>us</hi> and not <hi>God,</hi> they destroy the very nature of it, and leave Christ only an empty name without any thing answering to it: But if Christ be truly a <hi>High-Priest,</hi> as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> asserts that he is, from thence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that he must have a respect to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>offering up gifts and sacrifices for sin:</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>

                        <note place="margin">§. 6. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. proves the death of Christ an Expiatory Sacrifice and an oblation to God.</note> in the Oblation of himself <hi>to God</hi> upon the Cross.

Because Christ is said to offer up himself antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to his entrance into Heaven. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the death of Christ is said <hi>to be an offering, and a sacrifice to God,</hi> which is plain <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 2.</note> from the words of S. <hi>Paul, as Christ also hath loved us, and given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a sweet-smelling savour.</hi> Our Adversaries do not deny that the death of Christ is here call'd an <hi>Oblation,</hi> but they deny, <q>That it is <note place="margin">Crell. c. 10. sect. 47.</note> meant of an Expiatory Sacrifice, but of
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:62152:249"/>
a free-will offering; <hi>and the reason</hi> Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius <hi>gives is,</hi> because that phrase of a sweet-smelling savour is generally and almost alwayes used of sacrifices which are not expiatory; but if ever they be used of an Expiatory Sacrifice, they are not applyed to that which was properly expiatory in it, <hi>viz.</hi> the offering up of the blood, for no smell, <hi>saith he,</hi> went up from thence, but to the burning of the fat, and the kidneys, which although required to perfect the expiation, yet not being done till the High-Priest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned out of the Holy of Holies, hath nothing correspondent to the expiatory Sacrifice of Christ, where all things are perfected before Christ the High-Priest goes forth of his Sanctuary.</q> How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent these last words are with what they assert concerning the <hi>expiation</hi> of sin by actual deliverance at the great day, the former discourse hath already disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. For what can be more absurd, than to say, <hi>that all things which pertain to the expiation of sin are perfected before Christ goes forth from his Sanctuary,</hi> and yet to make the most proper <hi>expiation</hi> of sin to lye in that act of Christ which is consequent to his going forth of the <hi>Sanctuary, viz.</hi> when he proceeds to judge the quick and the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:62152:250"/>
dead. But of that already. We now come to a punctual and direct answer, as to which two things must be enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. 1. What the importance of the phrase of a <hi>sweet-smelling savour</hi> is? 2. What the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are to which that phrase is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. 1.

Sacrifices, (which he will not say, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ was represented by) the <hi>Levites</hi> might kill the beasts for sacrifice; for it appears, that in those sacrifices, wherein themselves contend that Christs was represented, the office of the <hi>High-Priest</hi> did not begin with entring into the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> but with the <hi>mactation</hi> of that Sacrifice whose blood was to be carried in thither. Therefore if we speak of the bare instruments of <hi>mactation</hi> in the death of Christ, those were the <hi>Jews,</hi> and we make not them <hi>Priests</hi> in it, for they aimed at no more than taking away his life (as the <hi>Popae</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and those whose bare office it was to kill the beasts for Sacrifice among the <hi>Jews</hi> did:) but if we consider it with a respect to him that offer'd up his life to God, then we say, that Christ was the <hi>High-Priest</hi> in doing it; it being designed for the expiation of sin; and by vertue of this <hi>blood-shed</hi> for that end, he enters into Heaven as the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> there <hi>ever living to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us.</hi> But the vertue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent acts, depends upon the efficacy of the <hi>blood</hi> shed for expiation; otherwise the <hi>High-Priest</hi> might have enter'd with the same effect into the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> with any other blood besides that which was
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:62152:256"/>
shed on purpose as a <hi>sin-offering,</hi> for expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sins of the people; which it was unlawfull for him to doe. And from hence it is, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> insists so much on the comparison between the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>legal sacrifices,</hi> and the efficacy of the one <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 13, 14. 10. 4, 10.</note> far above the other, in its power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation; which he needed not to have done, if the shedding of his blood, had been only a preparation for his entrance on his <hi>Priesthood</hi> in Heaven. So that the proper notion of a <hi>Sacrifice for sin,</hi> as it notes the giving the life of one for the expiation of the sins of another, doth properly lye in the <hi>mactation,</hi> though other sacrificial acts may be consequent upon it.

the second time without sin unto salvation.</hi> Heb. 10. 10, 11, 12. <hi>By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the Body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every High-Priest, standeth daily ministring and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take away sins: but this man after he had offer'd one sacrifice for sins for ever sate down on the right hand of God.</hi> To these places <hi>Crellius</hi> gives this answer, <q>That the <note place="margin">Crell. c. 10. sect. 54.</note> name of Oblation as applyed to Christ, primarily signifies Christs first entrance into Heaven, and appearance before the face of God there, but consequently the continuance of that appearance; so that when a thing is once actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and presented, it is said to be once offer'd, although being offer'd, it alwayes remains in the same place, and so may be said to be a continual Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this first appearance, <hi>saith he,</hi> hath a peculiar agreement with the legal Oblation; and therefore the name of Oblation doth most properly belong to that, because Christ by this means ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that power on which the perfect remission of our sins depends: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the continuance of that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, seems only consequentially to have the name of Oblation belonging to it, yet
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:62152:258"/>
in its own nature, it hath a nearer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the effect of the Oblation, <hi>viz.</hi> the remission of sins, or deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from punishment, and doth of it self conferre more to it than the other doth. And therefore in regard of that, Christ is said most perfectly to exercise his Priesthood, and to offer and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for us, from the time he is said to sit down at the right hand of God.</q> Against this answer, I shall prove these two things, 1. That it is incoherent, and repugnant to it self. 2. That it by no means agrees to the places before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. 1. That it is incoherent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to it self in two things. 1. In making that to be the proper <hi>Oblation</hi> in correspondency to the Oblations of the Law, which hath no immediate respect to the expiation of sins. 2. In making that to have the most immediate respect to the expiation of sins, which can in no tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sense be call'd an <hi>Oblation.</hi> For the first, since <hi>Crellius</hi> saith, that the proper notion of <hi>Oblation</hi> is to be taken from the <hi>Oblations</hi> in the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> we must consider what it was there, and whether <hi>Christs</hi> first entrance into Heaven can have any correspondency with it. An <hi>Oblation</hi> under the <hi>Law</hi> was in generall, any thing
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:62152:258"/>
which was <hi>immediately dedicated to God,</hi> but in a more limited sense it was proper to what was dedicated to him by way of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> according to the appointments of the <hi>Levitical Law.</hi> We are not now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what was properly call'd an <hi>Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in other Sacrifices, but in those which then were for expiation of sin; And in the Oblation was, first of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for whom the Sacrifice was offer'd. So in the <hi>Burnt-offering,</hi> the person who brought it, <hi>was to offer it at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation:</hi> i. e. as the <note place="margin">Lev. 1. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Jewes</hi> expound it at the entrance of the Court of the <hi>Priests,</hi> and there he was <hi>to lay his hands upon the head of it, and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">V. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>him.</hi> This Offering was made before the Beast was slain; after the killing the beast, then <hi>the Priests were to make an Offering of the blood, by sprinkling it round about the Altar of Burnt-offerings,</hi> the rest of the <hi>blood,</hi> say the <hi>Jewes,</hi> was poured out by the <hi>Priests,</hi> at the South-side of the <hi>Altar</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation, where the two holes were for the passage into the Channel which convey'd the blood into the valley of <hi>Kidron:</hi> thus the <hi>blood</hi> being offered, the <hi>parts</hi> of the beast, were by the <hi>Priests to be laid upon the Altar, and there they were all to be consumed by fire; and then it was
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:62152:259"/>
call'd an Offering made by fire, of a sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto the Lord.</hi> The same rites were used in the <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> and <hi>Trespass-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> as <hi>to the laying on of hands,</hi> and <hi>the sprinkling the blood,</hi> and <hi>consuming some part by fire:</hi> and in the <hi>sin-offerings,</hi> there was to be the same imposition of hands: but concerning the <hi>sprinkling of the blood,</hi> and the way of consuming the remainders of the Sacrifice, there was this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference; that in the common <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings</hi> for particular persons, <hi>the blood was sprinkled upon the horns of the Altar of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lev. 4. 25. 30.</note>

shed in order to expiation. If we coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For his death had been nothing else, but the offering up himself to God, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the expiation of the sins of the people; and there can be no reason, why the oblation must be of necessity something consequent to his death, since all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to a perfect <hi>oblation</hi> do concur in it. For where there is something solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted to God, and in order to the expiation of sins, and by the hand of a <hi>Priest,</hi> there are all things concurring to a legal oblation; but in this case, all these things do concur, and therefore there can be no imaginable necessity of making the oblation of Christ, onely consequent to his Ascension, since in his death all things concur to a proper oblation. In the Law, we grant that the oblation made by the <hi>Priest,</hi> was consequent to the death of the beast for Sacrifice; but the reason of that

From hence all Expiatory Sacrifices were at first whole Burnt-offerings, as appears by the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal Sacrifices, and the customs of other <note place="margin">Xenoph. Cyropaed. l. 7, 8. Strab. l. 4. Plutarch. Symp. l. 6. probl. 8.</note> Nations, and among the Jews themselves, as we have already proved in all solemn offerings for the people. And although in the sacrifices of private persons, some parts were allowed to be eaten by the Priests; yet those which were designed for expiation were consumed. So that the greater the offering was to God, the more it implied the <hi>Consumption</hi> of the thing which was so offered: How strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable then is it, That the Oblation
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:62152:263"/>
of Christ should not (as under the Law) have respect to his death and sufferings; but to his <hi>entrance into Heaven,</hi> wherein nothing is supposed to be consumed, but all things given him with far greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as our Adversaries suppose, than ever he had before. But we see the <hi>Apostle</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels Christs <hi>suffering</hi> with the <hi>burning of the sacrifices,</hi> and his <hi>blood</hi> with the <hi>blood</hi> of them, and consequently his offering up himself, must relate not to <hi>his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven,</hi> but to that <hi>act</hi> of his where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he suffer'd for sins, and offer'd up <hi>his blood</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the sins of the world.</p>
                     <p>From all which it appears; how far <note place="margin">§. 11.

<pb n="496" facs="tcp:62152:264"/>
what more propriety there is in making this presenting of Christ in Heaven to have a correspondency with the legal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, than the offering up himself upon the Cross. For 1. on the very same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that his entrance into Heaven is made an <hi>Oblation,</hi> his death is so too; viz. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was the way whereby he obtained the power of expiation;</hi> and far more properly so than the other, since they make Christs entrance and power the reward of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but they never make his sitting at the right hand of God, the reward of his <hi>entrance into Heaven.</hi> 2. His offering up himself to God upon the Cross, was his own act, but his entrance into Heaven was <hi>Gods,</hi> as themselves acknowledge, and therefore could not in any propriety of speech be call'd <hi>Christs offering up himself.</hi> 3. If it were his own act, it could not have that respect to the <hi>expiation</hi> of sins, which his death had; for our Adversaries say, <hi>that his death was by reason of our sins,</hi> and that he suffer'd to purge us from sin; but his <hi>entrance into Heaven</hi> was upon his own account, to enjoy that power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which he was to have at the right hand of God. 4.

                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 7, 9.</note> which is repeated afterwards; but will they say, that this <hi>World</hi> was not the place into which Christ came to obey the <hi>Will</hi> of his Father? and how could it he so properly said of the future World, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will;</hi> when they make the design of his ascension to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the reward of his doing and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of God upon Earth?</p>

<pb n="504" facs="tcp:62152:268"/>
to be a heavenly High-Priest, and if he, had been on earth, he could not have been a Priest:</hi> The meaning of which is only this, that if Christs Office had ended in what he did on earth, he would not have had such an excellency as he was speaking of; for then he had ceased to be at all such a <hi>High-Priest,</hi> having no <hi>Holy of holies</hi> to go into, which should as much transcend the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sanctuary, as his Sacrifice did the <hi>blood of Bulls and Goats:</hi> Therefore in correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to that <hi>Priesthood,</hi> which he did so far excell in all the parts of it, he was not to end his <hi>Priesthood</hi> meerly with <hi>the blood</hi> which was shed for a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but he was to carry it into Heaven, and present it before God, and to be a perpetual Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor in the behalf of his people: And so was in regard of the perpetuity of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>a Priest after the Law of an endless life:</hi> But lest the people should imagine, that so great and excellent a <hi>High-Priest,</hi> being so far exalted above them, should have no sense or compassion upon the infirmities of his people, therefore to encourage them to adhere to him, he tells them, <hi>That he was made like to his Brethren;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they need not doubt, but by the sense which he had of the infirmities of humane nature, he will have <hi>pity</hi> on the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:62152:268"/>
of his people; which is all the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> means by those expressions. So that none of these places do destroy the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Christ on earth,</hi> but only assert the <hi>excellency,</hi> and the <hi>continuance</hi> of it <hi>in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> Which latter, we are as far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, as our Adversaries are from grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former.

What imaginable necessity was there, that Christ must shed his <hi>blood</hi> in order to the <hi>expiation</hi> of our sins, if all that <hi>blood</hi> of the Legal Sacrifices did signifie no more than a bare condition of pardon, though a slight part of obedience in it self? Why must Christ lay down his life in correspondency to
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:62152:276"/>
these <hi>Levitical Sacrifices?</hi> for that was surely no <hi>slight part</hi> of his obedience. Why might not this condition have been dispensed with in him, since our <hi>Adversaries</hi> say, that in it self it hath no proper efficacy on the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin? And doth not this speak the greatest repugnancy to the kindness and <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that he would not dispense with the ignominious death of his Son, although he knew it could have no influence of it self on the expiation of the sins of the world? But upon this supposition, that the <hi>blood</hi> of Sacrifices under the <hi>Law</hi> had no proper influence upon Expiation, the <hi>Apostles</hi> discourse proceeds upon weak and insufficient grounds. For what necessity in the thing was there, because the blood of the Sacrifices was made a condition of pardon under the <hi>Law,</hi> therefore the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> must be so now; although in it self it hath no proper efficacy for that end? But the <hi>Apostles</hi> words and way of Argumentation doth imply, that there was a peculiar ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy both in the one and the other, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Expiation; although a far greater in the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ, than could be in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as the thing typified, ought to exceed that which was the representation of it. From hence we see, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes

what Expiation there was under the Law, not immediately to God, as belonging properly to him, but <hi>to the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an heifer, sprinkling the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</hi> Which he had very great reason to do, since <hi>God</hi> expresly saith to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the blood was given them <gap reason="foreign">

But from this we may easily understand, in what sense <hi>God</hi> is said to <hi>expiate</hi> sins, where it hath respect to a Sacrifice (which is that we are now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of, and not in any larger or more improper use of the word) for since <hi>God</hi> himself hath declared, that the <hi>blood</hi> was given for Expiation, the Expiation which belongs to <hi>God,</hi> must imply his acceptance of it for that end, for which it was offered. For the execution or discharge of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment belonging to him, he may be said in that sense to expiate, because it is only in his power to discharge the sinner from
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:62152:277"/>
that obligation to punishment he lies under by his sins. And we do not say, that where expiating is attributed <hi>to him that accepts the Atonement,</hi> that it doth imply his undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any punishment which is impossible to suppose; but that where it is attributed to a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as the means of <hi>Atonement,</hi> there we say it doth not imply a bare condition, but such a Substitution of one in the place of another, that on the account of that, the fault of the offender himself is expiated thereby.</p>

expiated, but this,</hi> he saith, <hi>doth not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly relate to Christ as a Sacrifice, but as a Priest.</hi> But never a one of these senses comes near to that which <hi>Crellius</hi> grants to be the proper importance of <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, as applyed to a Sacrifice, viz. <hi>the purging away guilt, and the aversion of the wrath of God, and punishment,</hi> not any way, but by the means of the Sacrifice offer'd. For in the <hi>Legal Sacrifices</hi> nothing can be more plain than that the expiation was to be by the Sacrifice offer'd for <hi>Atonement:</hi> supposing then that in some other way (which could be by no means proper to those Sacrifices) Christ may be said to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate sins, what doth this prove that there was an expiation belonging to his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice agreeable to the Sacrifices of old? But as I urged before in the case of <hi>Christs</hi> being <hi>High-Priest,</hi> that by their assertions the <hi>Jews</hi> might utterly deny the force of any argument used by the <hi>author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to prove it: so I say as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation by Christs Sacrifice, that it hath no analogy or correspondency at all with any Sacrifice that was ever offer'd for the expiation of sins. For by that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways understood something which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately offer'd to <hi>God</hi> for that end, upon which they obtained remission of sins; but
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:62152:281"/>
here is nothing answerable to it in their sense of Christs Sacrifice; for here is no Oblation at all made <hi>unto God</hi> for this end; all the efficacy of the Sacrifice of Christ, in order to expiation doth wholly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately respect us; so that if it be a proper Sacrifice to any, it must be a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to us, and not to God: for a Sacrifice is always said to be made to him whom it doth immediately respect; but Christ in the planting Faith, in actual deliverance, in declaring to us this deliverance, doth wholly respect us, and therefore his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice must be made to men, and not to God. Which is in it self a gross absurdity, and repugnant to the nature and design of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices from the first institution of them; which were always esteemed such immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate parts of divine Worship, that they ought to respect none else but God, as the object to which they were directed, though for the benefit and advantage of Mankinde. As well then might Christ be said <hi>to pray for us,</hi> and by that no more be meant but that <hi>he doth teach us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand our duty;</hi> as be made an expiatory Sacrifice for us, and all the effect of it only respect us and not God. And this is so far <hi>from adding to the perfection of Christs Sacrifice above the Legal</hi> (which is the thing

                        <note place="margin">Crell. c. 10. sect. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>properly signifie the thing it self, may very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be taken only for the declaration of it, when the performance of the thing doth follow by virtue of that declaration: which then happens, when the declaration is made of the thing decreed by another, and that in the name and by the command of him who did decree it. And in this sense, Christ by his blood may be said to deliver us from the punishment of our sins, by declaring or testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us the will and decree of God for that purpose.</hi> But this answer is by no means sufficient, upon these considerations; 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth not reach the proper and natural sense of the words, as <hi>Crellius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesseth; and yet he assigns no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at all, why we ought to depart from it, unless the bare possibility of another meaning be sufficient. But how had it been possible for the efficacy of the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ for <hi>purging away the guilt of our sins,</hi> to have been expressed in clearer and plainer terms than these, which are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:62152:284"/>
of themselves to signifie as much as we assert? If the most proper expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for this purpose, are not of force enough to perswade our Adversaries, none else could ever do it; so that it had been impossible for our Doctrine to have been delivered in such terms, but they would have found out ways to evade the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. It seems very strange, that so great an efficacy should not only once or twice, but so frequently be attributed to the blood of Christ for expiation of sin, if nothing else were meant by it, but that Christ by his death did only declare that God was willing to pardon sin? If there were danger in understanding the words in their proper sense, why are they so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently used to this purpose? why are there no other places of Scripture that might help to undeceive us, and tell us plainly, that Christ dyed only to declare his Fathers will? but what ever other words might signifie, this was the only true meaning of them. But what miserable shifts are these, when men are forced to put off such Texts which are confessed to express our Doctrine, only by saying that they may be otherwise understood? which destroys all kind of certainty in words; which by reason of the various use of them,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:62152:284"/>
may be interpreted to so many several senses, that if this liberty be allowed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other pretence, but that <hi>another meaning is possible,</hi> men will never agree about the intention of any person in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For upon the same reason, if it had been said, <hi>That Christ declared by his death Gods readiness to pardon,</hi> it might have been interpreted, <hi>That the blood of Christ was therefore the declaration of Gods readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to pardon, because it was the consideration upon which God would do it:</hi> So that if the words had been as express for them, as they are now against them, according to their way of answering places, they would have been reconcileable to our opinion. 2. The Scripture in these expressions, doth attribute something <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>blood of Christ;</hi> but if all that were meant by it were no more, than the <hi>declaring Gods</hi> will to pardon, this could in no sense be said to be peculiar to it. For this was the design of the Doctrine of Christ, and all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were wrought to confirm the truth of that part of his Doctrine, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned remission of sins as well as any other: but how absurd would it have been to say, that the <hi>miracles</hi> of Christ <hi>purge us from all sin,</hi> that through <hi>Christ healing the sick, raising the dead, &amp;c.</hi> we have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:62152:285"/>
even the forgiveness of sins,</hi> which are attributed to the <hi>blood of Christ?</hi> but if in no other respect, than as a testimony to the truth of the Doctrine of Remission of sins, they were equally applicable to one as to the other. Besides, if this had been all intended in these expressions, they were the most incongruously applied to the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ; nothing seeming more repugnant to the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, which was declared by it, than that very thing by which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, if no more were intended by it: For how unsuitable a way was it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the pardon of the guilty persons, by such severities used towards the most Innocent! Who could believe, that God should declare his willingness to pardon others, by the death of his own Son; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less that death of his be considered as the <hi>Meritorious cause</hi> for procuring it? And in that sense we acknowledge, That the death of Christ was a <hi>declaration</hi> of Gods will and decree to pardon, but not meerly as it gave <hi>testimony</hi> to the truth of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (for in that sense the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> might be said <hi>to purge us from sin,</hi> as well as the <hi>blood of Christ)</hi> but because it was the <hi>consideration</hi> upon which God had decreed to pardon. And
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:62152:285"/>
so as the acceptance of the condition required, or the price paid, may be said to declare or manifest, the intention of a person to release or deliver a Captive: So Gods acceptance of what Christ did suffer for our sakes, may be said to <hi>declare</hi> his readiness to pardon us upon his account. But then this <hi>declaration</hi> doth not belong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to the act of Christ in suffering; but to the act of God in accepting: and it can be no other ways known, than <hi>Gods</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance is known; which was not by the <hi>Sufferings,</hi> but by the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And therefore the declaring Gods will and decree to pardon, doth properly belong to that: and if that had been all which the <hi>Scripture</hi> had meant, by <hi>purging of sin by the blood of Christ,</hi> it had been very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruously applied to that, but most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> But these phrases being never attributed to that which most properly might be said <hi>to declare</hi> the will of God; and being peculiarly attributed to the <hi>death</hi> of Christ, which cannot be said properly to do it; nothing can be more plain, than that these expressions ought to be taken in that which is confessed to be their proper sense; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi> of sin, which doth belong to the death of Christ, as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the sins of the world.</p>

But where is it
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:62152:287"/>
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the death of Christ had no other influence on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of our sins, but as a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition intervening in order to that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority whereby he should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate sins? what makes him attribute so much to the death of Christ, if all the benefits we enjoy depend upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of it; and no otherwise upon that, than meerly as a preparation for it? what peculiar <hi>emphasis</hi> were there in Christs <hi>dying for sinners, and for the ungodly;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less his death had a particular relation to the expiation of their sins? Why are men said <hi>to be justified by his blood,</hi> and not much rather by his <hi>glorious resurrection,</hi> if the blood of Christ be only considered as an antecedent to the other? And that would have been the great demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the love of God which had the most immediate influence upon our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: which could not have been the death in this sense, but the life and glory of Christ. But nothing can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd than what <hi>Crellius</hi> would have to be the meaning of this place, viz. <hi>that the Apostle doth not speak of the proper force of the death of Christ distinct from his life; but that two things are opposed to each other for the effecting of one of which the death of
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:62152:287"/>
Christ did intervene, but it should not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene for the other;</hi> viz. <hi>it did intervene for our reconciliation, but it should not for our life.</hi> For did not the death of Christ equally intervene for our <hi>life</hi> as for our <hi>reconciliation?</hi> was not our eternal deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance the great thing designed by Christ, and our reconciliation in order to that end? what opposition then can be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it should be necessary for the death of Christ to intervene in order to the one than in order to the other? But he means, <hi>that the death of Christ should not intervene any more;</hi> what need that, when it is acknowledged by themselves, that Christ dyed only for this end before, that he might have power to bestow eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life on them that obey him? But the main force of the Apostles argument lyes in the comparison between <hi>the death of Christ</hi> having respect to us <hi>as enemies</hi> in order to <hi>reconciliation,</hi> and the <hi>life of Christ</hi> to us considered as <hi>reconciled;</hi> so that if he had so much kindness for enemies, to dye for their reconciliation, we may much more presume that he now living in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will accomplish the end of that recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, in the eternal salvation of them that obey him. By which it is apparent
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:62152:288"/>
that he speaks of the death of Christ in a notion proper to it self, having influence upon our reconciliation; and doth not consider it <hi>metonymically</hi> as comprehending in it, the consequents of it.</p>

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:62152:290"/>
his <hi>entrance</hi> into it as the means of it; but our Saviour before that tells us <hi>that all power and authority was committed to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>him;</hi> and his very entrance into Heaven was a part of his glory; and given him in consideration of his sufferings; as the <hi>Apostle</hi> plainly asserts; <hi>and he became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to death, even the death of the Cross,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>wherefore God hath highly exalted him,</hi> &amp;c. There can be then no imaginable reason to make the entrance of Christ into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and presenting himself to God there, a condition or means of obtaining that power and authority which is implyed in his <hi>sitting at the right hand of God.</hi> 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, we should look on these as distinct, there is as little reason to attribute the expiation of sin to his <hi>entrance,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as distinct from the other: For the expiation of sins in Heaven being by <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> himself confessed to be by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Christs power, and this being only the means to that power, how could Christ expiate sins by that power which he had not? But of this I have spoken before, and shewed that in no sense allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themselves the expiation of sins can be attributed to the entrance of Christ into Heaven as distinct from his sitting at
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:62152:291"/>
the right hand of God. Thus much may suffice to prove, that those effects of an Expiatory Sacrifice, which do respect the sins committed, do properly agree to the death of Christ.</p>
                     <p>I now come to that which respects the person, considered as obnoxious to the <note place="margin">§. 11.

And that the death of Christ was such a means of <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for us, I shall prove by those places of Scripture which speak of it.

                        </gap>, for Christ is here considered as interposing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, as <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Priests</hi> under the Law did between God and the people, in order to the averting his wrath from them.

That none of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do assert any reconciliation with God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to our conversion, and so that the Reconciliation mention'd implies only the laying aside our enmity to God by our sins.</hi> I begin with the first of these, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we are to consider not barely the phrases used in Scripture, but what the nature of the thing implyes; as to which a difference being supposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man on the account of
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:62152:295"/>
sin, no reconciliation can be imagined but what is mutual. For did man only fall out with God, and had not God just reason to be displeased with men for their Apostasie from him? If not, what made him so severely punish the first sin that ever was committed by man? what made him punish the old World for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties by a deluge? what made him leave such Monuments of his anger against the sins of the World in succeeding Ages? what made him adde such severe sanctions to the Laws he made to the people of the <hi>Jews?</hi> what made the most upright among them so vehemently to deprecate his wrath and displeasure upon the sense <note place="margin">Psal. 6. 1. 38. 1. Psal. 5. 5. 7. 11. 11. 5. Lev. 26. 30.</note> of their sins? what makes him declare not only his hatred of the sins of men, but of the persons of those who commit them; so far as to express the greatest abhorrency of them? Nay, what makes our Adversaries themselves to say, <hi>that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. de Deo &amp; Attrib. l. 1. c. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>impiety is in its own nature hatefull to God, and stirrs him up to anger against all who commit it?</hi> what means, I say, all this, if God be not angry with men on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of sin? Well then; supposing God to be averse from men by reason of their sins, shall this displeasure alwayes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:62152:296"/>
or not; if it alwayes continues, men must certainly suffer the desert of their sins; if it doth not alwayes continue, then God may be said to be <hi>reconciled</hi> in the same sense that an offended party is capable of being reconciled to him who hath provoked him. Now there are two wayes whereby a party justly offended may be said to be <hi>reconciled</hi> to him that hath offended him. First, when he is not only willing to admit of terms of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but doth declare his acceptance of the mediation of a third person, and that he is so well satisfied with what he hath done in order to it, that he appoints this to be published to the World to assure the offender, that if the breach continues, the fault wholly lyes upon himself. The second is, when the offender doth accept of the terms of agreement offer'd, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himself to him whom he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, and is upon that received into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And these two we assert must necessarily be distinguished in the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation between God and us. For upon the death and sufferings of Christ, God declares to the World he is so well satisfied with what Christ hath done and suffer'd in order to the reconciliation between
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:62152:296"/>
himself and us, that he now publishes remission of sins to the World upon those terms which the Mediator hath declared by his own doctrine, and the <hi>Apostles</hi> he sent to preach it: But because remission of sins doth not immediately follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of Christ, without suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of any act on our part, therefore the state of favour doth commence from the performance of the conditions which are required from us. So that upon the death of Christ <hi>God</hi> declaring his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Christs mediation, and that the obstacle did not lye upon his part; therefore those Messengers who were sent abroad into the world to perswade men to accept of these terms of agreement, do insist most upon that which was the remaining obstacle, <hi>viz.</hi> the sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that men by laying aside them, would be now reconciled to God, since there was nothing to hinder this recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, their obstinacy in sin excepted. Which may be a very reasonable account why we read more frequently in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> of mens duty in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled to God; the other being supposed by them as the foundation of their preaching to the world, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:62152:297"/>
on by them upon that account, as is clear in that place to the <hi>Corinthians, That God was in Christ reconciling the World to himself, not imputing unto men</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19, 20.</note> 
                        <hi>their trespasses, and hath committed to us the Word of Reconciliation;</hi> and therefore addes, <hi>Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, me pray you in Christs stead be ye reconciled to God:</hi> And least these words should seem dubious, he declares that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation in Christ was distinct from that reconciliation he perswades them to' for the reconciliation in Christ he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth past. <hi>v. 18.

to his Apostles.</hi> But if such shifts as these will serve to baffle mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, both <hi>they</hi> were <hi>made,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were <hi>written</hi> to very little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for if this had been all the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> had meant, that Christ preached the same Doctrine of Reconciliation before them, what mighty matter had this been to have solemnly told the World, that <hi>Christs Apostles</hi> preached no other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but what their <hi>Master</hi> had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before? especially if no more were meant by it, but that men should leave their sins, and be reconciled to God. But besides, why is <hi>the Ministery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> then attributed only to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and not to <hi>Christ,</hi> which ought in the first place have been given to him, since the <hi>Apostles</hi> did only receive it from him? Why is that <hi>Ministery of Reconciliation</hi> said to be, viz. <hi>that God was in Christ reconciling the World to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</hi> was this all the subject of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> preaching, to tell the World, that Christ perswaded men to leave off their sins? how comes God to reconcile the World to himself by the preaching of <hi>Christ,</hi> since <hi>Christ</hi> himself saith, he was not sent to preach to the world, but <hi>to the lost
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:62152:298"/>
sheep of the house of Israel?</hi> Was the World reconciled to God by the preaching of Christ before they had ever heard of him? Why is God said not to <hi>impute to men their trespasses</hi> by the preaching of Christ, rather than his <hi>Apostles;</hi> if the not imputing were no more than decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Gods readiness to pardon; which was equally done by the <hi>Apostles</hi> as by <hi>Christ</hi> himself? Lastly, what force or dependance is there in the last words, <hi>For he made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin,</hi> &amp;c. if all he had been speaking of before had only related to Christs preaching? How was he <hi>made sin</hi> more than the <hi>Apostles,</hi> if he were only <hi>treated as a sinner</hi> upon the account of the same Doctrine which they preached equally with him? and might not men be said to be made <hi>the righteousness of God in the Apostles,</hi> as well as <hi>in Christ,</hi> if no more be meant, but being perswaded to be <hi>righteous,</hi> by the Doctrine delivered to them?</p>
                     <p>In the two latter places, <hi>Eph. 2. 16. Coloss. 1. 20. &amp;c.</hi> it is plain, that <hi>a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reconciliation</hi> is likewise mention'd, the one of the <hi>Jews and Gentiles</hi> to one another, the other of both of them <hi>to

Having thus far proved, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of an Expiatory Sacrifice do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <note place="margin">§. 12. Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> to the death of Christ, nothing now remains but an answer to be made to two Objections, which are commonly insisted on by our Adversaries. The first is, <hi>That God was reconciled before he sent his Son, and therefore Christ could not dye to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God to us.</hi> The second is, <hi>That the Doctrine of Satisfaction asserted by us, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the freeness of Gods grace in the remission of sins:</hi> Both which will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of an easie Solution upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the foregoing discourse. To the first I answer, That we assert nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with that love of God, which was discovered in sending his Son into the world; we do not say, That God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mankind so much on the account of sin, that it was impossible he should ever admit of any terms of Reconciliation with them, which is the only thing inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the greatness of Gods love, in sending Christ into the world; but we adore and magnifie the infiniteness and unexpressible, greatness of his love, that notwithstanding all the contempt of the former kindness and mercies of Heaven,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:62152:299"/>
he should be pleased to send his own Son to dye for sinners, that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him. And herein was the great love of God manifested, that <hi>while we were enemies and sinners, Christ dyed for us,</hi> and that for this end, that we might be reconciled to God by his death. And therefore surely, not in the state of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or Reconciliation with God then. But it were worth the while, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what it is our Adversaries mean, when they say, <hi>God was reconciled when he sent his son, and therefore he could not dye to reconcile God to us.</hi> Either they mean, that God had decreed to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled upon the sending his son, or that he was actually reconciled when he sent him: if he only decreed to be reconciled, that was not at all inconsistent with Christs dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reconcile God and us in pursuance of that decree: if they mean, he was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reconciled, then there was no need for Christ to dye to reconcile God and us; but withal, actual Reconciliation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies pardon of sin; and if sin were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pardoned before Christ came, there could be no need of his coming at all, and sins would have been pardon'd before committed; if they were not pardoned,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:62152:300"/>
notwithstanding that love of God, then it can imply no more, but that God was willing to be reconciled. If therefore the not-remission of sins were consistent with that love of God, by which he sent Christ into the world, then notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was yet capable of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by his death. So that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries are bound to reconcile that love of God, with not presently pardoning the sins of the world, as we are to reconcile it with the ends of the death of Christ, which are asserted by us.</p>
                     <p>To the other Objection, <hi>Concerning the inconsistency of the Freeness of Gods Grace,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">§. 13. The free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Grace as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in Scripture, destroys not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</note> 
                        <hi>with the Doctrine of Satisfaction.</hi> I answer, Either Gods Grace is so free as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all conditions, or not: If it be so free, as to exclude all conditions, than the highest <hi>Antinomianism</hi> is the truest Doctrine; for that is the highest degree of the Freeness of Grace, which admits of no conditions at all.

of Gods governing the world, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of his hatred against sin, and the vindication of the honour of his Laws by the Sufferings of the Son of God in our stead, as an Expiatory Sacrifice for our sins. There are two things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in sin, the dishonor done to God, by the breach of his Laws, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury men do to themselves by it; now remission of sins, that respects the injury which men bring upon themselves by it; and that is <hi>Free,</hi> when the penalty is wholly forgiven, as we assert it is by the Gospell to all penitent sinners: but shall not God be free to vindicate his own Honor, and <hi>to declare his righteousness to the world,</hi> while he is <hi>the Justifier of them that believe?</hi> Shall men in case of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation, be bound to vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, though they freely forgive the Authors of the slander, by our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries own Doctrine?</hi> and must it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> to admit of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> that the world may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that it is no such easie thing to obtain pardon of sin committed against God; but that as often as they consider the bitter Sufferings of Christ, in order to the obtaining the forgiveness of our

sins, that should be the greatest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to disswade them from the practice of them? But why should it be more inconsistent with the Sacrifice of Christ, for God freely to pardon sin, than it was ever presumed to be in all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of either Jews of Gentiles? who all supposed Sacrifices necessary in order to <hi>Atonement;</hi> and yet thought themselves obliged to the goodness of God in the Remission of their sins? Nay, we find that God himself, in the case of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> appointed <hi>Abraham to pray for</hi>

                        <hi>him,</hi> in order to his pardon; And will any one say, this was a derogation to the grace of God in his pardon? Or to the pardon of <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends, because <hi>Job</hi> was appointed to sacrifice for them? <note place="margin">Job 42. 7.</note> Or to the pardon of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> out of his kindness to them, directed them by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and appointed the means in order to it? But although <hi>God</hi> appointed our <hi>High-Priest</hi> for us, and out of his great love sent him into the world, yet his Sacrifice was not what was <hi>given him,</hi> but what he <hi>freely underwent himself;</hi> he gave us Christ, but <hi>Christ</hi> offered up himself <hi>a full, perfect and sufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Satisfaction for the sins of the world.</hi>
