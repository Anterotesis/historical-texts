         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HAving, by the Good Hand of GOD, contributed so much to the restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace in the dissenting Congregations in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and somewhat to the Union here, a Reason may be expected how I become engaged in the present Debates; with grief of Heart I shall nakedly render it. Soon<note place="margin">The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of my Sermon at <hi>P. H.</hi> above a year since.</note> after the reprinting of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Works, his Errors that lay hid for many Years appeared with open Face: Many pleading, that there are no Humblings or preparatory Works in order to Conversion, Saving Faith is nothing but a Perswasion that our Sins are pardoned; yea, we are justified before we are born; Christ was accounted the very Blasphemer at God's Bar; Sin cannot hurt the Believer; Men have nothing to do in order to Salvation; no assurance by Signs from Sanctification, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Eleven Counties the Flame broke soon into, under the conduct of Mr. <hi>Davies,</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others; the faithful Ministers were deserted as Legalists, Churches divided, and Town and Country filled with Debates and Noise. These Errors and Disorders were imputed to the Body of <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> and Attempts against our Liberty thereupon threatned. Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Son puts out a Book of his own to abett some of his Father's Opinions, and therein <hi>reflects on me by Name, and other Books</hi> to this purpose were set forth; hereupon once, and but once, I deliver'd at <hi>Pinners-Hall</hi> that which is the Appendix to my Book, hoping that a plain state of the Differences might convince some well-meaning People, or at least vindicate us, that we were not <hi>Papists, Arminians, &amp;c.</hi> as these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented us, nor <hi>Antinomians,</hi> as by others we were all accused. In that Sermon I charged no person; yea, to prevent a Iealousie that I might intend Mr. <hi>Cole, &amp;c.</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted this; <hi>It's true, there are some small Differences among the Orthodox, in wording some of these things, but shall we hereby give advantage to such Errors,</hi> &amp;c? A great Clamour is thereupon contrived, and in his next turn, Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> with great severity, exposed us to vulgar notice, affirming many Notions that some worthy Divines were startled at: Some Friends of Mr. <hi>Coles</hi> proposed to me a Meeting with him, in the presence of Dr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> In this Meeting it was agreed, that I should read my Sermon, after which Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> declared he had no Exception, and so we were agreed (which was now the second time.) Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> in his turn at <hi>P. H.</hi> publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared there was no real Difference, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> also did, and I repeated it with great sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, hoping that the Err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>neous would be less confident, when they lost that Cover which they made of his Name. This Calm did not long endure, for Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> (I fear<note place="margin">Why I prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Book, about six months since.</note> by Instigation) revived at <hi>P. H.</hi> the same Reflections, and Dr. <hi>Bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> practically prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>Necessity of Repentance</hi> to the <hi>Forgiveness of Sin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> soon after brake out into the wonted Exclamations, and charged us as Opposers of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in Iustification, &amp;c. and I was accounted by most as the chief Mark level'd at. Friends entreated me to take no notice of these Reflections in my Sermons there; and tho' thus oft provoked, I never expressed any Resentments in any Discourse there since that first: Nevertheless many assured me of the necessity of printing somewhat to clear our selves, and if possible to stem this Tide; Peoples Mouths were filled with the grossest Misrepresentations of our Doctrines; Ministers were accused as Legalists, when they only preached that men had somewhat to do if they would be saved; if a man did but
<pb facs="tcp:43118:2"/>
plead with Sinners from Gospel-Threats, or argue Obedience and Duties, he was no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Preacher: Yea, some arrived to that daringness, as publickly to assert there were but three or four Ministers of Christ in <hi>London;</hi> the Reverend Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> himself escaped not the Title of a Legalist. These things caused in me many sad Thoughts, and at last I was convinced, unless we should prostitute our Ministry, suffer the infecting of our People, which would end in Divisions, (as I found attempted on some of my own) and be all guilty, and branded abroad as Complyers, by our silence; something must be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. I was sensible of the Trouble, Reproach, and Hazards attending it, especially since I was informed that some, out of the Union, were the Spring in this Affair, who having failed in their Unchristian Methods to oppose that Agreement, it seems judged by the Notions of some few (of whom I was ignorant) that either these Opinions must prevail, by our silence, or that the Union would be endangered if we appeared against them. At last I found the effects of Mr. <hi>Davies</hi>'s and others Practises, abroad, and in the City; that the hazard to our Peace would grow, by further delay, especially seeing as yet so very few, if any of the United Brethren, were suspected to abett these Errors, and Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> with all the rest that appeared their Advocates, in City and Country, were not of the Union. Nay, I believed if some others did not act Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> he could not be offended with what I should write, he having at three meetings expressed himself so reconciled to my Principles, and then disowned what I should oppose. The reason why I desired any Testimony to my Book, was because the People do oft value Names more than Arguments, the Opposites (so unscrupulous in their Clamours) might prejudice men against the Truths, as if I was singular. And considering the delay of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Testimony against Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,</hi> this might be some Antidote, till we arrived at more. Yea, I heard also Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> was printing when I was about mine. These are the Considerations which induced me to print my Book at the desire of several Brethren, and I have Peace in this, that it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an absolute Duty.

               <hi>formerly called Congregational, and it looks like forming a Party,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A.</hi> I did ask some of them that I thought would not scruple it, particularly Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> who did object nothing against it, but a prudential Consideration; and the same answer he made to Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> when he first asked him; and before the second Edition came out, I tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him what use his Hand might have been of, he made the like answer, and made then to me no Objection against the Book, but that he wished I had left out that of the third to the <hi>Phil.</hi> All which I mention'd to some, with real respect to him and those Brethren. But since Mr. <hi>C's</hi> Book was published, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> tells me and others, he is not of my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I know not wherein, except in my sence of that Text. Yet there are others that forbare subscribing, who declare no disagreement; and he must quite alter his use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way of Preaching, if he much differ from me. Others ask <hi>why I raked into Dr.</hi> Crisp's <hi>Ashes. A.</hi> It was needful I should instance some Author, for they said nobody affirmed those things I mentioned in my Sermon. I chose Dr. <hi>C.</hi> before another, not from Prejudice, but because he was reprinted with an unhappy Front, his Works seemed the Standard of the propagators of these Errors. This Book was taking with many, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to People by Mr. <hi>Trayl</hi> and others, as I can prove, and he must never be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, if not after his Death; and tho' I treat him with all respect, yet I wonder his Works should be so applauded now, when most of our great Divines opposed them hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Yea, as Mr. <hi>Nesbit</hi> from cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

oft speaks Contradictions, but the most I mention he labours to prove, and his Scheme enforceth it. Obj. <hi>You take Bits of Sentences. A.</hi> I still give one full period, and it's only to avoid swelling my Book that I mention'd no more in other Clauses; yea, in what is material I oft set his words at large, and if it be needful, I shall put him in a fuller light. Many Obj. <hi>My Book was written against Mr.</hi> Cole. <hi>A.</hi> I had no Eye to him at all, except in the Digression about Repentance, which was much the same as I deliver'd at a third meeting to compose the Debate between Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> and him, (tho' since then he broke out against us twice) this I preface in my Book with these words: <hi>Herein I have to do with men of more orthodox Principles than Dr.</hi> Crisp. And Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> must know, these words did refer to him; yea, notwithstanding many strange Passages, I hope he doth not hold most of those Opinions; nor can he agree with Mr. <hi>Chancy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he disagree with what he hath oft said, yea, and printed. Obj. <hi>It's more than hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>I</hi> intend in that Book to reflect on all them called Congregational. A.</hi> I am sure I abhor such an Intention; nay, did not I pitch on Testimonies from among them, to oppose these Errors? I know many of their Ministers, whom I think free from the least disposition towards them; the <hi>New England</hi> Synod effectually oppos'd them;<note place="margin">The History thereof is worth the buying, Mr. <hi>Parkhurst</hi> lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed it.</note> Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> have written well against them; I cite <hi>Bulkley,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owens, &amp;c.</hi> who are fully for the opposite Truths; and tho' I sent Mr. <hi>M.</hi> word, that <hi>in the mind I was in,</hi> I would forbear Testimonies from his Writings, but that I would not bind my self for any time, yet I have since met with great reason to cite him, as one fully for the Truth: Yea, Mr. <hi>N.</hi> (tho' I never requested it) in my House declared, That if Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and three more such had subscribed, he would not have been unwilling to do it; and he desired me to add (<hi>Congregational</hi>) to the Divines in and about this City who forbear to subscribe only from prudential Considerations which I refused. He remembreth the latter part, and owneth it; and he told Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> that if one Passage or two were rectified, he would subscribe my Book. It's true, some clamorous People, that cry up these Opinions, happen to be of that Perswasion, but I hope far the greater part are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter principl'd; and many seem on the wrong side only from Misrepresentations. Obj. <hi>Why do you use the word Rector? A.</hi> It's a proper word, used by Dr. <hi>Owens,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and most. This Book hath met with various entertainment, with many it hath pleas'd God to grant it acceptance, and many Ministers out of the Country offered their Subscriptions; but of the four seeming Answers to it, I'll give these hints. To Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I am obliged, for his Christian usage, and while he allows, that I speak the Language of Time, and of the Dispensation I am under, I will comply with his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, not to enter the Lists, unless I have occasion to prove my Sence of <hi>Phil. 3.</hi> which I find patroniz'd by <hi>Augustin.</hi> Of Mr. <hi>Keach</hi> I would but ask, 1. Doth not he believe that persons are bound to agree to the Covenant of Grace, and thereby engaged to love God, and sincerely obey him; and is not refusing to agree to this Covenant the damning Sin? yea, is not this Refusal the Heart of Unbelief? And that's all I there affirm. 2. Is his Spirit in a right frame, when he shall bring these words in my Catechism, to prove that we are not justified upon believing, till we do Good Works, when in that short Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism there is this; Q. <hi>Is not a Believer pardoned, before he can put forth any other Act of Obedience?</hi> A. <hi>Thô true Faith is a certain Principle of Obedience, yet so soon as we believe, we are pardoned, even before there can be time to put forth any other Acts of Obedience.</hi> Yea, how oft do I say in my Book, that no Act of ours is a <hi>jot</hi> of the Righteousness <hi>for</hi> or <hi>by</hi> which we are justified, but that is Christ's alone; and yet this person fixeth the quite contrary on me, and so batters in the dark, and warneth all from hearing me: The Lord humble and forgive such. The Letter from the City, &amp;c. seems rather to design a Turn, than argue a Truth; for as it weakly saith
<pb facs="tcp:43118:3"/>
some things true; and others erroneous, so throughout he belies their Principles whom he exposeth; if it be wilfully, let his own serious Reviews give him his Character; if igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, why should he intermeddle? There are few Books written that pretend so much, which may be so easily and much exposed. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> is the Author I here deal with: I have long read Books, and from five years old have had no Employment besides my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; yea, before nineteen I was regularly admitted a Preacher, yet I never met with a Tract parallel to his, for abusive Language, violent Rage, and uncharitable Censures. Many great Divines disswade me from a Reply, assuring me it was at best needless<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with their Advice <hi>I</hi> had complied, but that I find the Ignorant believe his Misrepresentation of my Principle: It's amazing what Eye they read with, if they read at all. What's become of Truth or Ingenuity, that Professors dare affix these Doctrines to me, which I a thousand times disown, and never can ascribe any Passages to ground them on, but are still forced to cry, <hi>This is your meaning,</hi> against my plain words and entire Scheme; as thou wilt see in this Reply. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith <hi>I juggle and equivocate;</hi> when I declare I still speak my mind, and must be the most inconsistent Fool, if it were not so. But what should induce me to juggle or equivocate? I value not the Purses of any, and in God's Cause I fear not the Abilities of the whole Party; yea, by more of God's presence I shall be reconciled to their fiery and clamorous Tongues, which is their only formidable strength, tho' the liberty they take doth not evidence a good Cause or a Christian Spirit. They give out, that I oft meet with Noblemen about a great Affair, when I never spake with one of these Noblemen, nor ever was once in any Meeting about that matter. They as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert Mr. <hi>How</hi> said, he had not put his Hand to my Book, but that I assured him Mr. <hi>M.</hi> would do the same; when Mr. <hi>H</hi> affirms he never said any such thing, but that after he had signed, he desired me to ask Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Hand. Others say, that Hands were affixt without their leave, which is too gross to reply to. Nay, they turn the effects of my sinking Distempers to my reproach; the worst I wish them is Forgiveness, and more Charity and Wisdom. <hi>Obj.</hi> They say <hi>some of the first Subscribers did not read the whole Book.</hi> A. The whole substance of the Book is in the Truths and Errors which they did peruse. <hi>Obj.</hi> Do not some of the Subscribers recant? <hi>A.</hi> Tho' they have been abused, yet the only one that to me seem'd willing that his Name had been left out, and that only because of the noise. I offer'd to publish, that <hi>he desir'd it,</hi> but he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born any such desire. Two of these Authors pretend to great Piety in their Party above others, the Lord encrease it in all; but I am perswaded they call many Serious ones of their Party, who live under the power of the contrary Truth, and understand not the Errors of those for whose persons they may have regard. There be a far greater number of humble, meek, heavenly Christians, that abhor these Errors, which they observe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much the Christian Calm and tender Frame of such, that I hope are upright in the Substance. And I heartily desire all of us would lay these Texts to Heart, <hi>1 Cor. 13. Though I have all Faith, and have not Charity, I am nothing.</hi> Iam. 1. 26. <hi>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, but deceiveth his own Heart, that man's Religion is vain.</hi> Iam. 3. 13, to 18. <hi>But the Wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easie to be entreated.</hi> And it's evident, notwithstanding what Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith of Passions, p. 12. that a holy Fear, with a siducial Consent to Christ, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It's true, Assurance should be endeavoured in our <hi>working out our Salvation with trembling and with fear;</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> was a man I'll believe before Mr. <hi>C.</hi> or the <hi>Letter,</hi> and he saith, <hi>In my Conscience this is the general Opinion of ungodly men; they hear Christ died to take away Sin, and to make Peace for Sinners, and therefore they will take no</hi>

S.</hi> of Cov. p. 258.</p>
            <p>I shall represent the true state of the points in debate, that if any men will engage me to Edification, and with Truth, they may be directed. The Controversie with Dr. <hi>C.</hi> my Book doth it so plainly, that I hope all may see it there; but the present Specimen more especially shall refer to Mr. <hi>C.</hi> who differs from many that help the noise, though they will not see it.</p>
            <p>1. It is not whether a certain number of Sinners are of Free Grace elected to Faith<note place="margin">Part of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie between Mr. C. and me stated, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears fully in his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Book.</note> and Iustification, which I affirm but whether the Elect are required by the Gospel to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they may be justified; which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> denies, and I affirm. 2. It is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gospel be such a Law, as that Acts of Obedience to it stand in the place of legal Works. so as that for them we are saved, which I deny, but whether the Gospel doth assure Salvation for Christ's Merits to such as obey it, and threaten an exclusion from this Salvation against all such as disobey it. This Mr. <hi>C.</hi> denies, and I affirm. 3. It is not whether we are justified by our Faith, or any Act of ours, as if they, as Works or Qualifications, were a jot of that Righteousness for which, or by which we are justified; this I deny; but whether God hath fixed this as the Revealed Gospel-Rule, that a man must be a penitent Believer, whom God will justifie for Christ's Righteousness. This Mr. <hi>C.</hi> denies, and I affirm. 4. It is not whether the Faith and Forgiveness of the Elect be the Fruits of Election and Distinguishing Mercy, which I affirm; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath a revealed Rule, by which as Paternal Ruler he gives Pardon and Glory to Believers for Christ's sake, and judicially withholds them from others, whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns not for their being unelected, but for their final Impenitency and Unbelief. This Mr. <hi>C.</hi> denies, and I affirm. To other of his Citations under his Third Principle add this, p. 32. <hi>If you understand Judicial in respect of any Duty, Grace, or Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation found in us, tho' wrought by the Spirit, I abhor it.</hi> 5. It is not whether we are immediately justified upon believing, before any Works, which follow the first Act of Saving Faith; this I affirm; but whether if Faith should be ineffectual to Acts of sincere Holiness, and to prevent Apostacy and utter Ungodliness, would we be subject to Condemnation by the Gospel-Rule. This Mr. <hi>C.</hi> denies, and I affirm. 6. It is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Holiness or Good Works are necessary to Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this they and I affirm, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God doth require them as indispensible means of obtaining the possession of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Christ; and declares, that the total want of them, and much more their Contraries, shall expose to Misery. This Mr. <hi>C.</hi> must deny, and the Necessity they speak of is only a Physical Necessity, not a moral. Note, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Faith doth justifie, which is the Sence of Protestants, when they say we are justified by Faith alone; this I affirm; but whether he that can truly believe to Iustification, must be in part a convinced, humbled, penitent Sinner. This I affirm, and Mr. <hi>C.</hi> denies: yea, he saith, that Pardon is rather the Condition of Faith; nay, Pardon is the Cause of Faith. 10. It is not whether Sanctification taken strictly do follow Iustification; this I affirm; but whether <hi>Effectual Vocation</hi> make a real habitual change in the Soul, and that this Vocation is in order of Nature, before Iustification. This Mr. <hi>C.</hi> and the <hi>Letter, &amp;c.</hi> deny, and I affirm with the Assembly. 11. It is not whether our sincere Faith, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are imperfect, and so can be no meriting Righteousness, which I affirm, but whether they are disobedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> even in Gospel Account, and so incapable of being the Conditions of any of its promised saving Benefits. This Mr. <hi>C.</hi> affirms, and I deny.</p>
            <p>These are some of the Points wherein Mr. <hi>C.</hi> and I differ: I fear I shall find him in all things of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s opinion, as I have assurance he is in his Definition of Faith. May not I now expect, that People that rail at me will impute to me only what I thus plainly state? The Body of well-esteemed Authors are on my side; there's an end to our Ministry if these be not true; most of the practical Books we have, as <hi>Allen,</hi> &amp;c. are all Lyes, and tending to ruine Souls, if Mr. <hi>C.</hi> judge aright. Thou wilt find in this Book Testimonies cogent to my purpose, and if it will serve Mr. <hi>C.</hi> to say I wrest them and men there upon believe him, I cannot help it. Such as I quoted in my first Book' are truly quoted, and serve fully to what I produce them for, but to reconcile all men to themselves is not my Work; and yet I think it no hard matter to evidence, that none of my Authors speak against my Assertions. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith I am against the Articles of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the Assembly; I am sure he'l never prove it, and I profess the contrary, and am certain he is against all Confessions of Faith that we own as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. How far other Ministers are concerned for the Kingdom of Christ, the Safety of Souls, the Rule of Iudgment, the plain Gospel way of Salvation to Sinners, the truth and scope of their Ministry, Time will evidence.</p>
            <p>But in the strength of Christ I'll sustain the utmost Persecution at the Hands of these angry men, and while God enableth me, they shall not overturn the Gospel by their unscriptural Abuse of the blessed Names of the Righteousness of Christ and Free Grace, the Gospel way of the application whereof, and a subservient Ministry, being the whole I contend for. I have oft attempted to adjust these things before I engaged, nay, since the severe Treatment I have met with, I sent to Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> that I would meet him, and shew how much he mistook my Principles; or if he refused a meeting, I would send him an account in Writing, that he might not abuse himself and the World, but he would accept of neither; as if he could not write without the Question were mistated. Yea, at the request of the united Brethren, I agreed to suspend this Book, if he would do so with his, but this he refused. Now, whatever be the Consequences of these Debates, I am innocent, and commit all to God, in whose Cause I, though sickly, weak and unworthy, am engaged. There is a Mystery in it, that the Explication of one Text should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by some for a Reason against my whole Book, and so countenance all Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Errors, which yet they profess to dislike; and the Impartial see I oppose nothing but those Errors. The Doctrine of Imputation being still by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> &amp;c. objected against me, though I have not yet had opportunity to insist thereon, I will state that case, 1. It is not whether Christ was a publick person as a Mediator in his Undertakings, and so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted all for Sinners, that they might be pardoned and saved by his undertaken Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Merits; this I affirm; but whether we were so represented in Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s that we were in Law sence they that undertook to atone and merit. This I deny. 2. Nor
<pb facs="tcp:43118:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whether Christ was a Surety for us in a Bond of his own, to pay our Debt to the full, (and much more) that we might in a due time and way be released; this I affirm; but whether we were joynt-parties in one and the same Bond with him, and so we were actually acquitted when he made Satisfaction, and therefore God could enjoyn no Terms of the application thereof to us for Iustification and Glory, nor suspend the same upon those Terms. This I deny. 3. Nor whether Christ was made under the Law, and that this was one Article of his part in the Covenant of Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> That he should in a way of proper Satisfaction bear the substance of the Penalty of the Law, and yield perfect Obedience to all such of its Precepts, as were competent to his Person, and this to save th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Elect; this I affirm; but whether Christ was joynt-Covenant-Party with all the Elect in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant, so <hi>that they</hi> were legally esteemed to make satisfaction and yield perfect Obedience in his doing thereof. This I deny. 4. Nor whether Christ's Righteousness is imputed to Believers, and so made theirs, <hi>that it</hi> is applyed to them, and pleadable by them, as what was always designed and undertaken for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and is the sole meritorious Cause of their Pardon, Acceptance, and Glory, and this as effectually, as if they themselves had satisfied and merited; and this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is reputed by God as that which now pleads for their Impunity, Acceptance, and Happiness, as Members of Christ: All this I affirm; but whether it be imputed as our formal Righteousness, and so we may truly plead, that we our selves, as Elect, did legally, by Christ as our Proxy, satisfie and merit all, and without the interposal of the Gospel-Rule, we have a legal Title to Glory by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant. This I deny, as what excludes Forgiveness, makes Christ's Sufferings needless, denies any proper Satisfaction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys Christianity. 5. Nor whether we all sinned and died in <hi>Adam,</hi> and in Christ are all made alive; which I affirm, owning Christ's Influence as both real, yea, and publick, as before explained; but whether we were in Christ before Faith, as we were seminally in <hi>Adam</hi> before we were born, which his foederal Headship did suppose. The being thus in Christ before Faith I deny. These express my Thoughts, which I doubt not (by <hi>Christ</hi>'s help) to maintain against all these Opposers, while I expect nothing but a gross exposal of themselves, when their Conceits are forced out of their cloudy Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Reader, I had reason to instance some minute things, though with men of Wisdom and Fairness a Cause dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> He would insinuate that I say, That the preceptive part of the<note place="margin">The Law not abrogated.</note> Law is not a Rule of Manners, nor that the transgression of it makes us guilty, nor that men, whilst they reject the Gospel, are not at all under the Curse of the Law. All which I abhor. And though this Point fell not in my way to handle, yet there wants not Passages to this purpose: <hi>P.</hi> 198. The holiest Action of the holiest Saint needs Forgiveness. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>p.</hi> 225. It's legal Preaching to be always pressing the Duties of the Law of Nature, but neglect preaching Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where I allow it sometimes. Again, in the same Page I condemn saying, That our best Obedience doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Wrath by the Law, as a Rule of Misery and Happiness; or that it doth not need forgiveness. <hi>P.</hi> 125. I affirm the Law to be a Rule of Duty. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. <hi>p.</hi> 107. the Gospel declareth all condemned till they do believe; it declares <hi>they are so,</hi> and denounceth they shall be so, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And again, They that believe, their Condemnation is <hi>reversed:</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 57. Reader, thou mayest read me still affirming the Misery even of the Elect, by the Law, till they are justified by Christ.</p>
               <p>It's true, I do think that 1. The Sentence of the Law cannot hinder the relief of any Soul by Christ, who complieth with the Gospel. 2. Nor that it is possible for any man to be saved by the Law of Innocency. By For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness is our Blessedness, and not by our sinless Obedience: And so far I'll own it, but not in the three former senses.</p>
               <p>III. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> tells me, <hi>p.</hi> 20. That when I said Christ's Sufferings were the Foundation of our Pardon; that our Sins are forgiven for Christ's Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and without them Sin cannot be forgiven. <hi>Your Fundamentally is only a remote Causality,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all that we have of your meaning, is a poor</hi> causa sine qua non. And within a few lines you mean, <hi>By something else besides them, not by the immediate application of them, but mediate and remote,</hi> à causa sine qua non.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43118:6"/>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The plain meaning of what he thus exposeth is, that the Elect were not discharged and actually justified at the time when Christ suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Which is proved <hi>p.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it's strange, that any one that read this or the following Passages, should infer either, 1. That Christ is only a <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> which is no Cause; 2. Or that his Righteousness is not the sole meritorious or material Cause of our Pardon, which in judicial acts are the same; 3. Or that Christ's Sufferings are not immediately applied to our Pardon; 4. Or that Pardon is by any act of ours as a joynt meritorious Cause with Christ; each of which, I hope, the following Passages will clear me in. <hi>P.</hi> 16. I affirm, When we are pardoned, the whole meritorious<note place="margin">Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness the sole meritorious Cause or mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and it is applied to Believers.</note> Cause of Pardon is the Atonement of Christ, and what is required of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is only a meetness to receive the Effects of it. <hi>P.</hi> 39. I affirm, That Justification, and all other Benefits, be the <hi>Fruits</hi> of Christ's Righteousness, as the <hi>only</hi> meritorious Cause of them. <hi>P.</hi> 40. We are, for the sake of Christ's Righteousness delivered from the guilt of Sin, and entituled to Life, and accepted with God against all excluding Bars. <hi>P.</hi> 41. Christ was he by whose Merits he forgives us, but he never was forgiven; we are forgiven, and never had <hi>Merits</hi> of our own to forgive our selves: And it's enough that we were pardoned and adopted for his sake, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served endless Woe, and are never capable of making the least atonement. <hi>P.</hi> 43. Faith owns the <hi>Foundation of our Plea to be in Christ,</hi> from whom are derived to us that Pardon and Right to Life which are the <hi>effects of his Righteousness;</hi> for this we are justified, for that Righteousness which is in Christ we are acquitted and adopted; the <hi>efficient</hi> Merit is in him, the <hi>Effect</hi> of the judicial Absolution <hi>for</hi> that Merit, is in us: The Righteousness <hi>is still in Christ,</hi> for the sake whereof we are absolved or justified: God hath for Christ's sake forgiven us, but not for the <hi>sake</hi> of what is in ourselves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and now being absolved or made righteous in a Law sence, we have as much matter of glorying as absolved acquitted Sinners can have. We are justified by his Righteousness; that is, <hi>for that</hi> we are forgiven, and also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to Life, which we had forfeited our selves, but we are not made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, nor so esteemed; we are not accounted them who made the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we still <hi>take hold of Christ's Righteousness, that by it we may be forgiven;</hi> and this is our Blessedness, and our Gospel-Righteousness, which all such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse who reject Redeeming Love from a Conceit of their own Merits, or refuse the Terms of the Gospel, which by the Promise do make us capable of being justified and saved for the Merits of Christ; yet these still remain <hi>his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> though thus beneficial to us in their <hi>Application,</hi> as the procuring cause of all our Good. <hi>P.</hi> 44. We still need Pardon, and continue justified by the <hi>efficacy</hi> of the Righteousness of another, and must look to Christ as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the only Subject of it all our days. Our justified state is a continuance of the blessed <hi>Effects</hi> of the Righteousness of Christ, from first to last; that Cause is still productive of Supplies, as our Guilt returns, or Necessities and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities renew or grow, but our Redemption is ever in Christ. <hi>P.</hi> 249. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is not the <hi>Effect</hi> of those Graces, but of the Promise in the Virtue of Christ's Blood, or of his Blood <hi>applied</hi> for Forgiveness by the Promise. Reader, if thou regardest Truth, dost not thou find Christ's Sufferings to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43118:7"/>
be a real Cause of Pardon, a sole meritorious or material Cause, all other Causes of that kind excluded, and these Sufferings and Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness immediately applied? See <hi>p.</hi> 247. We are justified only by Christ's Merits, as the sole procuring Cause or Righteousness, for which we are justified.</p>
               <p>V. Mr. <hi>C. p.</hi> 21. <hi>The use of Christ's Sufferings is to compound with God for Sinners, upon the account of the Old Law, and put a Bar upon his Proceedings, according to that, and procure another Law, by the Righteousness whereof we are justified, which Righteousness is our own inherent Righteousness, and not Christs.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 30. <hi>Faith doth not justifie us by applying Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but by its own Vertue, as being a Righteousness it self,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but Christ's Righteousness hath nothing to do here, it's our own Faith and Repentance is the Righteousness, in conformity to the Rule of Promise, and that's Latin for the New Law.</hi> So <hi>p.</hi> 15. <hi>We are not at all entituled to this Blessing by Christ, but by our own Obedience you mean,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I am represented as if I thought, 1. That Christ served only to excuse us from perfect Obedience, but that our Pardon and Glory, given<note place="margin">Gospel-Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not the Righteousness for which we are justified, nor of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as legal Works.</note> by the Promise, were not the immediate Effects of his Merits. 2. That he merited only that we might merit by our Faith. 3. That our Faith and Repentance are the meritorious Cause of our Pardon and Glory by the New Law, and so, that Gospel-Conditions are of the same use to our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as Works were under the Law; that is, to be the Righteousness for which we are justified and saved. All which I disown, and expresly declare, 1. That Christ hath satisfied Justice, and merited Pardon and Glory; these have their Being only on his account, and he hath a Right to give them. 2. When the Sinner partakes of these Mercies, he partakes of them as the fruits of his Death, and for his sake. 3. God in Christ, as our Ruler, hath declared a Way and Order how he will dispense these Benefits to us, and enjoyns our compliance with that Order. If we believe (tho' Faith be his Gift) he will forgive for Christ's sake, otherwise he declares he will not. 4. Gospel-Conditions have no other use to our Interest in these Benefits, than a complyance with this stated Rule of the Distribution of Pardon and Glory, which are merited by Christ, and given only for his sake. This is my plain meaning in all he hath objected against, consult my words in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and what I have repeated in the last Head, and these following in my Book. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 39. I affirm, That Christ by his Righteousness merited for all the Elect, that they should in his time and way be certainly parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of its Saving <hi>Effects,</hi> and did not only purchase a <hi>conditional Grant</hi> of those Effects, <hi>viz.</hi> that Proposition, <hi>He that believeth shall be saved. P.</hi> 1. I affirm, The <hi>whole</hi> meritorious Cause and Price of Justification, Adoption, and Eternal Life were perfect, when Christ finished the Work of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3 <hi>p.</hi> 16. I affirm, That when we are pardoned, the <hi>whole</hi> meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Cause of that Pardon is that atonement, and what is required of Sinners, is only a <hi>Meetness</hi> to receive the <hi>Effects</hi> of it. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 84. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that preparatory Qualifications do merit True Grace; and that Faith or Repentance do merit an Interest in Christ. I say, their whole use de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on <hi>Christ's Ordination. P.</hi> 45. we are <hi>reputed</hi> righteous, for the sake
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43118:7"/>
of what Christ did, and not for the merit of what we have done. <hi>P.</hi> 61. I deny the performance of the Conditions of the Covenant to be a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing Price, or meritorious of the Benefits promised on such Conditions: This I deny, for Christ alone paid the Price, and it's the <hi>Covenant-Promise gives an Interest</hi> in the Benefits, to such as perform the Conditions. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 53, 54. When I had shewn how all Satisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were provided and adjusted in the Covenant of Redemption, I declare, that by the Covenant of Grace I mean the <hi>way</hi> that God hath ordained, to apply to Sinners that Salvation which is prepared by Christ, and which he will enable the Elect to comply with. Same <hi>Pag.</hi> I affirm the Conditions do not merit the Blessings promised. <hi>P.</hi> 55. I affirm, it's from <hi>God's Will in the Promise</hi> that they are made to be Conditions; he connected the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and the Duty; though he chose Conditions that were fit, yet their <hi>fitness</hi> would not have availed to our Interest in the Benefits, unless he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised they should so avail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Covenant, though conditional, is a disposition of Grace: There's Grace in giving Ability to perform the Conditions, as well as in bestowing the Benefits: God's enjoyning one in order to the other, makes not the Benefit to be less of Grace; but it is a Display of God's Wisdom, in conferring the Benefit suitably to the nature and state of Man in this Life, <hi>&amp;c. P.</hi> 45. Our Pardon and Acceptance is firm and lasting, and will no more fail us than the Righteousness of Christ will fail, it being the meritorious Cause and Security thereof, and the Benefits can abate to none, who answers the Gospel-rule of <hi>its Application. P.</hi> 57. These Conditions make us capable of <hi>no</hi> Happiness, but what Christ hath <hi>bought and prepared for us, &amp;c. P.</hi> 58. The Use and Interest of Gospel-Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is not from the conformity of them to the preceptive part of the Law, (though in a degree there be that) but from their conformity, to the Rule of the Grace of the Promise, the promise of Pardon through Christ being to the penitent Believers, and no other. Repentance and Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come necessary and useful Conditions of this Pardon, by the order of God in that gracious Promise; but by the Covenant of Works, the meer Work gave an Interest in the Reward, as it was obedience to the Precept, by a Sanction that had Goodness, but no such Grace in it. See <hi>p.</hi> 61, &amp; 225. I deny that Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in the same place as Works were under the Law, How many more places could I cite? but I shall refer thee to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as to the point of Merit. See <hi>p.</hi> 225, 247.</p>
               <p>VI. Mr. <hi>C. p.</hi> 30, 31. <hi>He looks whether or no we have fully performed the Conditions, and upon finding them, he judicially gives the Promise,</hi> i. e. <hi>in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Reward to the Works performed. Whether they be perfect or imperfect it's no matter; the Reward is of Debt, and not of Grace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And what can this be, but a declared Iudgment, that he is</hi> de congruo, <hi>deserving Pardon, and I think</hi> ex condigno <hi>too, before he is pardoned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The scope of these and the like Passages, is to render me one that thinks that Faith or other Graces did merit the pardon of our Sins; which is contrary to my declared Judgment; as may be seen in what I have above cited, and in these following Passages, <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. <hi>p,</hi> 102, 103.

There is to be considered, what the condition of the person is, whom this Mercy is promised to; he is one that hath this True Grace of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Christ's Righteousness shall not be imputed to this use, unless we believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this Faith being a conformity to the Rule of the Promise, some call it a subordinate Righteousness, not meaning any Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness <hi>for which</hi> a man is forgiven, for it is Christ's Righteousness <hi>alone</hi> for which God justifies us: But it's our answering the Rule by which Christ <hi>applieth his Righteousness</hi> for our remission, and a Right to Life, and his Promise is the ground of our Title. <hi>P.</hi> 104. I deny that Faith or any Grace be <hi>a jot</hi> of the meriting Righteousness for which we are justified. I deny that Faith, or any other Grace add <hi>anything</hi> to the value of Christ's Merits: Yea, I add, That if Christ's Righteousness could be applied for Pardon, to the vilest Sinner, <hi>before he believes,</hi> it would justifie him; but God hath declared, it shall not be applied to Unbelievers. <hi>P.</hi> 120. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Holiness, sincere Obedience, or good Works, are <hi>in the least</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Righteousness whereby Salvation is caused, or for which this, or any Blessing, becomes <hi>due to us, as of Debt, &amp;c.</hi> but He appoints these as the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of a Believer's obtaining Salvation, <hi>&amp;c. P.</hi> 125. I deny that any Holiness, internal or external, any Obedience, work, or Duty, <hi>do at all merit</hi> the Promise, or is the meritorious <hi>Cause or Righteousness for which any</hi> promised Mercy is bestowed: And I own, that <hi>all is of Gift,</hi> tho' given in an order suitable to our condition, as Subjects in a state of Trial. <hi>P.</hi> 137. Nothing of these merit Heaven, but he that merited Heaven, hath peremptorily appointed these to bring us thither. <hi>P.</hi> 155. We ought to <hi>renounce</hi> every Thought of purchasing from God any Benefit for what we do. <hi>P.</hi> 210. We must teach the <hi>best man</hi> to renounce all the Grace he hath, and Good he performs, as if being the <hi>least</hi> atonement for Sin, or <hi>least</hi> purchase of Life, or any <hi>addition</hi> of Merit to a Christ, or sharing in what is peculiar to him. <hi>P.</hi> 225. I condemn it as Legal to preach, that our Faith, Holiness, or Good Works stand <hi>in the same place</hi> now, as perfect Obedience did under the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> to render the Reward to be of Debt, or be the meritorious Righteousness <hi>for</hi> which we are justified. <hi>P.</hi> 244. I do renounce all that Saints have or do, as any atonement for Sin, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing Price of the <hi>least</hi> Benefit, much less Salvation.</p>

               <p>1. There is a specifick difference between Grace and meer moral Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>P.</hi> 224.

               <p>1. I do not oppose the Honour of Christ, though I would keep the Crown upon his Head. See <hi>p.</hi> 55.

I am willing to own any thing that lays Man <hi>low; and exalts Christ,</hi> as the only Atonement, the only Purchaser of all our Blessings, the only Procurer of our Acceptance, the Author and Finisher of all Grace.

               <p>2. I do not oppose the Free Grace of God: See <hi>Cap.</hi> 23. <hi>p.</hi> 240, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have affirmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would admit the <hi>fullest</hi> Expressions to testifie, that in<note place="margin">Free Grace ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, and not oppos'd.</note> these is the Free Grace of God in Truth Of meer Grace he <hi>elected</hi> some certain Sinners to Life, upon no moving <hi>foreseen</hi> Condition, but yet to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it through Sanctification of the Spirit to Obedience, and sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus. Of <hi>meer love</hi> to Sinners no way deserving it, he gave his Son to dye for them, who also undertook to bring all the Elect to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in the way appointed between the Father and him. He without <hi>any</hi> thing in Man to deserve it, gave his Gospel, and thereby offereth in the vertue of his Son's Blood Pardon, and Eternal Life to every one that will repent, and truly believe, and no penitent persevering Believer shall miss of Life by a failure of this Promise. He freely, and of meer Grace, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows</hi> Faith and Repentance; yea, gives his Spirit to create these, and any other good Work in worthless vile Sinners; and though he will not forgive any that finally refuse to believe and repent, nor save any ungodly apostate man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet Pardon and Life are his <hi>Free Gift,</hi> and <hi>no</hi> Grace nor Duty merits them, they being no more than the required <hi>Conditions</hi> or <hi>Means</hi> of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of them, as the Gifts of God through Christ; and so he hereby ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours his own Government, and no way indulgeth the <hi>Boastings</hi> of Men. <hi>P.</hi> 244. This Grace I adore, and own the best to <hi>merit</hi> nothing, to <hi>forfeit</hi> all, yea, to deserve Hell by the Law of Works.

Do I then oppose Christ, or compare any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness with him? I shall add, <hi>Cap.</hi> 19. <hi>p.</hi> 198. I own we should esteem the sincere Holiness of a Believer's Heart and Actions to be <hi>Dung, if compared with Christ,</hi> as meritorious of Justification. And, <hi>p.</hi> 202. Who must not own, that <hi>compared with Christ,</hi> the best thing in us is <hi>vile,</hi> yea, compared with his Righteousness? And <hi>p.</hi> 210. We must teach the <hi>best</hi> man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all the Grace he hath, and Good he doth, as it being the <hi>least</hi> atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Sin, or least purchase of Life, or <hi>any</hi> addition of Merit to Christ, or <hi>sharing</hi> in what is peculiar to him. And <hi>Cap.</hi> 21. <hi>p.</hi> 225. I condemn any that preach, that our best Obedience doth not deserve Wrath by the Law, or that it doth not need Forgiveness, or is <hi>any</hi> Supplement of Christ's Righteousness; yea, or to neglect to call men to <hi>renounce all</hi> in themselves, as any atonement for Sin, or cause of Pardon; and that we must look to Christ as the <hi>only</hi> Propitiation, Purchaser of <hi>all</hi> our Blessings, and Cause of the acceptance of our Persons and Performances.</p>
               <p>Reader, I have given thee a few of those many places. Having finish'd this first point propos'd, I will appeal to thy Conscience, whether I can with any shadow of Justice be charged with those Principles which this Brother fixeth upon me. I hope he did not wilfully expose me in the face of such Evidence. The words in my Preface lead not to the least suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea, are positive to the contrary; and therefore how he saith this is my sence, when I must not only <hi>equivocate,</hi> but grosly contradict my self, and that in places where I state the Question, must encrease the Wonder: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there the least pretence, except that I assert, that though Pardon and Salvation are all Free Gifts, and the Merits of Christ are imputed as the sole meritorious Cause of all, yet God, as our Ruler, hath appointed a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in the Gospel for the dispensing of them, and doth confer them in that Method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ordains a Gospel-Ministry in a consistency therewith, and in a subserviency thereto. This Scheme any man may see in my very Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and morethrough the whole Book. 2. I shall attempt, if possible, to make my sence intelligible to the most vulgar Apprehension, to this end I premise.</p>

If you look at God thus absolutely conferring Benefits, then the way is this: He eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43118:11"/>
elects to Glory a certain number of men, whom he sore saw undone by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall; he appoints his Son to undertake their recovery, as the sole covenanting Party with him, in the Covenant of Redemption he was to satisfie Justice, merit Glory, and make them physically meet for it.</p>
               <p>This is all true, and sometimes prophetically declared thus, and the event as to the Elect is, as certain as if God dealt no otherwise with Man on this side Death. But if this be the whole Method of GOD with Men, as some account it, how much of the Bible is unintelligible and vain, how much is contradicted, and a great part of God's <hi>manifold Wisdom</hi> obscured and denied, which shines forth in his present Paternal Dominion as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer?</p>
               <p>2. God may be considered as a Ruler, Proprietor, and Benefactor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly: We may look at him as communicating his Benefits in a way of Government, and that in many things not exclusive of his absolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.

               <p>It's true, he discovers his absolute Propriety, in not giving the same Means or the same internal Grace to all; which will, no doubt, fully appear to be equal. He doth also discover himself peculiarly beneficent to his Elect, (for whom Christ merited all) and infallibly brings about his purpose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, by making them obedient to the Conditions of whatever sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Benefits his Gospel promiseth upon Conditions: But yet he dispenseth the promised Benefits as a just Rector or Ruler, according to the Offers made to all. Pursuant hereto, our Ministry is appointed to <hi>propose</hi> Blessings to all in the same way, and upon the same Terms, and to assure all, that upon those Terms, and no other, they shall obtain those Benefits for the sake of Christ. Can any think we dare make the same Offers to the Devils, as to every man; or to the Damned, as we can to all men alive? Dare we say to them after Death, <hi>If you will now believe, you shall yet be saved;</hi> turn now, and you shall yet live?</p>
               <p>On the other hand, dare we say to an Elect Unbeliever, if we knew him, Elect, thou shalt be forgiven, though thou dost not believe, thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief is no Bar to thy Salvation, by any Threatning of God declared against thee? Is Sentence past on all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> or on the Elect in Christ's Person, that God deals with neither in a way of Government, as in any state of Trial for Eternity? There's an end of that Preaching which <hi>God</hi> hath fitted and most blessed to the conversion of Souls, if this be true: Mr. <hi>Chancy</hi>'s Father, in <hi>Doct. of Iustific. p.</hi> 117. <hi>Mind you your Duty, God hath ordained the End with the Means; and therefore, though it were revealed to thee from Heaven, that thou shalt certainly be saved; yet I might truly say to thee, except thou believe, and repent, thou shalt perish,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Offer of Christ</hi>

               <p>Having premised these things, I shall familiarly deliver my real Thoughts as to what men ignorantly accuse me of, and pitch upon Forgiveness of Sin,<note place="margin">A plain account of my Iudgment by Questions and Answers.</note> as a word most intelligible to ordinary Readers. <hi>Q.</hi> Who forgiveth Sin? <hi>A.</hi> It's God in Christ forgives Sin. <hi>Q.</hi> What is it for God to forgive our Sins? <hi>A.</hi> To absolve us from obligation to endure those undoing Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, due for the Sins which he forgives. <hi>Q.</hi> For what doth God forgive our Sins? <hi>A.</hi> Only for the Merits and Righteousness of Christ imputed to us. <hi>Q.</hi> Whose Sins doth God forgive?<hi>A.</hi> The Believer's Sins, though he be a Sinner. <hi>Q.</hi> Is our Faith the Righteousness for or by which we are forgiven? <hi>A.</hi> No, this would put up Faith in the room of Christ. <hi>Q.</hi> Doth God accept of Faith, or any imperfect Obedience, instead of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect legal Obedience, as the Righteousness for or by which he counts us worthy of Pardon and Eternal Life, as if He for Christ's sake had abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Law for this end? <hi>A.</hi> No, for this were to exclude Christ's Merits from being the immediate procuring Cause of our Pardon and Eternal Life; which with all Saving Blessings are the Fruits of his Merits and Satisfaction. <hi>Q.</hi> Is not Faith, or any thing in Man, the Cause of Forgiveness? <hi>A.</hi> No, because Forgiveness is a Mercy, which no Grace or Act of ours hath any causal Influence into. <hi>Q.</hi> Is Faith, or any Act of ours, any Price of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness? <hi>A.</hi> No, Forgiveness is a Free Gift, and of Free Grace and Mercy. <hi>Q.</hi> Is Faith, or any Act of ours, a foreseen Motive to encline God to purpose, offer, or give us Forgiveness for it? <hi>A.</hi> No, it's of meer Grace that God resolved, and for Christ's sake actually forgives us when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. <hi>Q.</hi> Will God certainly forgive a Sinner when he believes? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, because he hath promised to do so. <hi>Q.</hi> Will God forgive all the Elect? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, when they do believe. <hi>Q.</hi> Did God decree, and did Christ merit that the Elect might be only capable of being forgiven if they do believe? <hi>A.</hi> No, for God decreed, and Christ merited, that the Elect should certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, and so be infallibly forgiven. <hi>Q.</hi> Will not God forgive the Elect before they do believe? <hi>A.</hi> No, because he hath not promised to forgive any, while they are Unbelievers; yea, He hath declared he will forgive no Unbeliever. <hi>Q.</hi> What is that Faith in Christ which you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to? <hi>A.</hi> Such a Trust in Christ my crucified Saviour, as brings me to receive a whole Christ, in opposition to all Rivals, for Justification, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and Glory; relying on his Merits, Fulness, Power, and Care to perform in his own way, what he hath promised, and I stand in need of. <hi>Q.</hi> Must not we receive Forgiveness before we receive Christ himself? <hi>A.</hi> No, we must receive Christ himself, and with him his Benefits, though I must first believe, that there is Forgiveness in him for me, as well as for other Sinners, if I will accept of him. <hi>Q.</hi> How come we to believe? <hi>A.</hi> By the Work of the Spirit in our effectual Calling. <hi>Q.</hi> Have we not an Interest in Christ, as Members of him, before we do believe? <hi>A.</hi> No, we have no claim to the Priviledges of Christ's Members, until we believe:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43118:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But yet, when the Spirit effectually calls us, Christ thereby takes hold of us, to make us Members, and by Faith we receive him for our Head, and so have the Priviledges and Benefits of his Members, as in Marriage both Parties consent, before the Wife hath claim to the Priviledges of a Wife. <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not Faith entitle us to Forgiveness? <hi>A.</hi> No; yet by Faith I have a certain Interest in Forgiveness. <hi>Q.</hi> What doth entitle us to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness? <hi>A.</hi> The Promises of God entitle us to Forgiveness for Christ's sake, when we do believe. <hi>Q.</hi> Hath God declared any Rule by which he gives Forgiveness to one rather than another? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, his Gospel, wherein he declares, he will forgive them that believe. <hi>Q.</hi> What use is Faith of to Forgiveness? <hi>A.</hi> Not to merit, not to buy, not to cause Forgiveness; but it answers that Gospel-Rule by which God applies Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for our participation of this, as one of the effects of his Death.<hi>Q.</hi> Have we a Right to Forgiveness for Christ's sake upon our believing? <hi>A.</hi> The Promise gives us a Right to Forgiveness by Christ's Merits, when we believe. <hi>Q.</hi> When God forgives us, doth he judge us to be Believers? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, for he hath declared he will forgive none but Believers. <hi>Q.</hi> Will God hereafter more publickly declare us to be Believers? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

A.</hi> So do I say, and add, that the use of any other Gospel-Condition of any other Benefit, is only as that Condition relates to Christ: But how comes Faith related to Christ's Righteousness, but as the Promise declareth, if thou believe thou shalt be forgiven for Christ's Righteousness imputed. <hi>Q.</hi> But are not we justified by Faith? <hi>A.</hi> No otherwise than as God hath declared Christ's Righteousness shall justifie them that believe. <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not Faith take hold of, or look to, approve of, relye on, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Christ and his Righteousness for Pardon? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, and therein is its fitness above any other Grace: But that would not forgive us, if it were not ordained by the Will of God, that they who thus take hold of Christ and his Righteousness, should be justified by the Righteousness of Christ, when they take hold of it. <hi>Q.</hi> But do not you affirm, that Repentance is necessary to our being forgiven? <hi>A.</hi> Yes; not to Pardon in it self, but to our obtaining it; and have proved this <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. but I do not put it in the same place with Faith, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nor as any Righteousness for which God will save me. <hi>Q.</hi> What stress then do you lay? <hi>A.</hi> No more than as they evidence my Faith to be true, execute my first believing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, prevent their Contraries, which the Gospel threatens with Misery, and answer the Rule of any Gospel-promise, that God hath made, and will exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute for Christ's sake, to the upright person. <hi>Q.</hi> Do you think that we are justified by our Good Works at the last day, as if they were the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by which we shall be saved at the last day? <hi>A.</hi> No, I would trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at such a Thought, and declare it's Christ's Righteousness alone, and unmixed, that I hope to be saved for and by. <hi>Q.</hi> What are your Thoughts then as to our inherent Righteousness and Good Works, as they fall under Christ's Judgment at the last day? <hi>A.</hi> My whole Heart is, 1. That if a man truly believe, and dye before he hath opportunity to do more, he shall be sentenc'd <hi>Happy</hi> as a Believer, notwithstanding he was prevented by Death from professing the Truth, and proceeding in Holiness, performing Acts of Worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. God hath declared, that none shall at last be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Christ's Righteousness, that are Infidels, Ungodly, utterly unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or Apostates: And therefore all that God will then save for Christ's Merits, must truly be, and will be declared to be no Infidels, Ungodly, utterly unprofitable, nor total Apostates, but the contrary; and they shall be judged free from the guilt of final Infidelity. 3. The most eminent in Faith, Holiness, Sufferings, and Labours, shall be adjudged to greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Glory, which added degrees will be as truly the effects of Christ's sole Merits, as the lesser degrees.

               <p>Reader, I declare against this Error, and have affirmed, that Faith alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Christ and his Merits. 2.

Which, and many more places, I may contract into this as his</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First Principle.</hi> That the Gospel is in no sence a Law, nor includes in it as<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s first Principle.</note> any part thereof, either any Precept, nor any Promise upon any Condition on our part, nor any Threatning. If thou doubt the word Precept should not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, know, the words above fully assert it. And <hi>p.</hi> 23. he tells us, The Precept of Faith is a Precept of the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>Mr. C. affirms, <hi>p.</hi> 34. <hi>Whatsoever befalls Sinners retaining their sinful state, and rejecting Grace, is from the Law, and not from the Gospel: To talk of a Gospel-Threat is a Cata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>When my Question answer'd by him <hi>p.</hi> 32. was this: Doth <hi>God</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuously dispense these, <hi>viz.</hi> Forgiveness, Adoption, Glory, or any other promised
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43118:14"/>
Benefit given upon God's Terms? (I say) Doth God dispense these, without any regard to our being Believers, or no? Or, whether our Faith be true or no? Mr. <hi>C.</hi> answers, <hi>I would know, whether if God distribute his Free Grace to poor wretched worthless Creatures, according to his Election and distinguishing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, doth he do it blindly because he finds no Reason in them?</hi> Whence I may call this</p>
               <p>His <hi>Third Principle.</hi> That God forgives, adopts, and glorifies Sinners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">Mr. C's 3d Principle.</note> any respect to their being true Believers, or no; and Election and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Mercy be the only Rule by which he forgives, adopts, and glorifies Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as well as gives the First Grace.</p>
               <p>To put the better gloss upon his Principle, he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>Doth God dispense Faith blindly, &amp;c? A.</hi> The Question was not, whether God gave Faith absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but whether he gave Forgiveness and Glory promiscuously. Nay, he knows I oft-times affirm the former. And in <hi>p.</hi> 21. he reviles me for saying, That <hi>there must be a Work of the Spirit for conformity to the Rule of the Promise, in the person to be pardoned.</hi> Yea, this third Principle must follow, and is but the same as That the Gospel is no Law or stated Rule of Forgiveness, Adoption, and Glory. And he affirms, that Faith is a Precept of the Law, and denies that any Precept of the Law is a Rule of Happiness with a Sanction, <hi>p.</hi> 22, 23.</p>

There he might have seen, that I assert, 1. There is a Certainty that the Elect shall obey the Terms of the Gospel, and be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly saved. 2. That it is Christ's Righteousness which is the alone meritorious Cause of a Believer's Justification and Salvation; and that our complyance with the Terms of the Gospel by the Grace of God, is no more than our answering that Rule by which God bestows on us Justification and Salvation, for the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Merits of Christ. He that cannot distinguish between the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for which we are saved, and a complyance with that Rectoral Method, wherein God doth save us for that Righteousness, and the Interest arising from that method complied with, had better sit still, than meddle with these Disputes.</p>
               <p>Reader, tho' I did not once call the Gospel a Law in all my Book, and only said in my Preface, that the Apostle called it a Law of Faith, with respect to what I had discoursed, yet because the whole of Mr. C's Book runs on this, I shall insist most on this Head, 1. by explaining the word <hi>Law;</hi> then 2. in what sence it is not a Law; 3. shew in what sence it is a Law, which I shall prove, &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 4. answer his Objections; 5. produce some Testimonies.</p>
               <p>1. As to the name or word <hi>Law.</hi> It hath pleased God to call the way of his<note place="margin">The word Law of Grace same as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> application of Grace to fallen Sinners, by various names, and by that variety, to help our Apprehensions, which one name would not so well contribute to. It's called a <hi>Law,</hi> a <hi>Covenant,</hi> a <hi>Testament,</hi> a <hi>Promise,</hi> a <hi>Word, &amp;c.</hi> none of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the others, and are easily reduced to each other. A Promise of God, that sets down an Order in conferring Benefits, wherein he enjoins any Duty on Mans part, in that Order, hath the nature of a Law; yea, tho' he engage to enable the Person to do that Duty. We must also consider, that God in some respects varies these Terms from their common use among men, both his Dominion and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43118:14"/>
his Grace abating their rigid Sence. He calls it a Law, but yet his Mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves thereby to confer such Benefits, as brings the Law down to a Promise. He calls it a Promise, but his Dominion renders the Term enjoyned a Duty, and so be raiseth up the Promise to a Law. The word <hi>Covenant</hi> implies the certain performance on his part, in the way he sets down, and our restipulation to that way. In the very word <hi>Testament,</hi> as he notes the ratification of the Covenant by Christ's Death, so it excludes not the appointed Condition of the Legatees, to whom he makes a disposition of the Benefits: So that the Word, the Law of Grace, or the Law of Faith, is no other than the <hi>Covenant of Grace, the Gospel-Promise of Salvation, the Testament of Christ, or the Word of the Gospel, or the Gospel it self.</hi> Whereas Mr. C. exposeth it as a <hi>New Gospel</hi> and <hi>New Law;</hi> it's the first<note place="margin">How for a new Law, and yet no new Gospel.</note> Gospel GOD delivered to Men, for he never promised to give Glory by Christ to any unbelieving impenitent person. A new Law indeed it is, as being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>younger</hi> than the Law of Innocency, which condemns for the least Sin, and gives Life to none but the Perfect; by which Law no man but Christ was ever justified, and by whose answering it for us we shall be justified in a Gospel-way.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4, 6.</note> But yet it is a Law older than <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Abel,</hi> otherwise <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacrifice had been no more acceptable than <hi>Cain</hi>'s, which <hi>by Faith</hi> it was; and which Faith in Christ must have been commanded, as well as the Sacrifice; though the brief account which <hi>Moses</hi> gives, of above two thousand years, doth not express it, nor was it<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7, 11.</note> needful. Yea, God's Words to <hi>Cain</hi> imply it as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> on <hi>Covenant, p.</hi> 43. saith, <hi>These are a Promise of the Covenant, that took place after the Fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>I do not say, the Gospel is a Law in the following sence.</hi> 1. I do not say that the<note place="margin">How the Gospel is not a Law.</note> Gospel includes nothing besides this Law; it gives us an account of the Covenant of Redemption, and the absolute Promises: There be many Prophecies the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of our Blessed Lord, &amp; <hi>c.</hi> Doctrinal Truths, Prophecies, &amp; <hi>c.</hi> yet these may be called Adjuncts. 2. Nor do I judge it a Law in that sence our Divines fix on the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians, viz.</hi> as if Acts of Obedience to this Law are the Righteousness for which we are justified or saved; as Perfect Obedience was under the Law of <hi>Adam.</hi> This I deny, for we have no Righteousness for which we are justified or saved, but Christ's, and the Fruits of that are we blessed with, upon complying with the Gospel. Our Faith or inherent Righteousness, &amp; <hi>c.</hi> are not the paying a Farthing of Debt to the Creditor, but our submitting to that way by which we have Forgiveness of all the Debt, and are Partakers of Glory; both which God had in his Eye, as to be purchased by Christ, before he fixed on this way for our obtaining them. 3. Nor do I take it in the Popish sence, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> espouse, but true <hi>Protestants</hi> oppose, <hi>viz.</hi> as if the moral Law were not perfect in its kind, but that the spiritual extensive sence of the Precepts were new Precepts of our Lord; and that the Old Testament did not include the Gospel-Precepts of Faith in Christ, and Repentance for Pardon, as well as the New, though it did not discover the Objects and Motives, &amp; <hi>c.</hi> so clearly. 4. It is not a Law that supposeth a moral ability in Sinners to perform its Precepts; that was necessary in God's Dealings with Men as his Creatures, just come out of his Hand; but not so, when he deals with Man about his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, when he had virtually sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> forfeited all, yea, had undone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Whatever Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith <hi>p.</hi> 23. I affirm, if the Subject be rational, or have natural Power: If such Ability comes so with this Law, that the Elect are made effectually able, and others are wilfully faulty if they finally rebel, it's enough to justifie the Divine Order. <hi>Will not</hi> and <hi>cannot</hi> are distinct things with Mr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:43118:15"/>
in his Book of <hi>Wilful Impenitency.</hi> Yea, with <hi>D. Owens</hi> on <hi>Ps.</hi> 130. <hi>p.</hi> 248. 5. It is not a Law that extinguisheth the Law of Nature which hath its special Precepts, and which <hi>in genere</hi> upon Gospel Revelation, requires what the Gospel requires, and condemns for Faults against the <hi>special</hi> Precepts of the Gospel, tho' it condemns not so, as to bar the Relief which the Gospel affords, nor promiseth Life upon those Terms, which the Gospel doth. The Gospel in a large sence takes the Law as subservient to its gracious designs; tho' Mr. <hi>C.</hi> weakly infers <hi>p.</hi> 24, 25. that therefore the whole Precept is hereby made the Condition. 6. Neither doth this Law require any thing of us as a Condition of Christ's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the World as a Redeemer, it supposeth that, nor yet any Condition of the first Grace to the Elect. This the Covenant of Redemption secures; and it is assured to the Catholick Church by Promise. 8. Nor is it a Law, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereto renders any promised Blessing a <hi>Debt.</hi> All is <hi>free</hi> tho' <hi>sure:</hi> It's free, as to Man's Procurement or Price, yet it is as sure by Promise, as if it were a Debt; but the Price was Christ's Obedience and Sufferings, and all comes to us of Gift, yet in that way which God appoints to give it.</p>
               <p>2. I mean by the Gospel being a Law, that God in Christ our Redeemer doth<note place="margin">How the Gospel is a Law.</note> by the Gospel expresly <hi>command</hi> Sinners to receive Christ with a true operative Faith, and <hi>promiseth,</hi> that tho' they are condemned by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law, yet upon their so believing, they shall be united to Christ, and justified by his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and that persevering in Faith by sincere Holiness, they shall be saved for his sake. He also <hi>threatens,</hi> that if any shall dye unbelieving, impenitent, ungodly Rejecters of his Grace, they shall be bar'd from these Benefits, and they shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish without relief, and have sorer Punishments, than if these gracious Offers had not been made to them: This is the Law of Faith. I'll add one Caution to this Account, which is too needful. Give me but the Assemblies Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, <hi>Conf. cap.</hi> 14. and I desire to use no word as expressive of the Terms of the Gospel, besides Faith, but men now define Faith by such a small part of it, as requires Caution for the sake of Souls.</p>
               <p>1. Here we have all the Essentials of a Law. God is our <hi>Ruler,</hi> and we his Subjects; <note n="1" place="margin">Iam. 4. 12.</note> his <hi>Will</hi> is revealed in a way of <hi>Government;</hi> here's his <note n="2" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 23</note>

                  <hi>Promise</hi> made to such as do comply; and here's a <hi>Threatning</hi> denounced against such as finally rebel; <hi>Preach the Gospel to every Creature, he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved, he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> 2. Yet this is a <hi>Law of Grace;</hi> it's made by our Redeemer for fallen Man, all the Benefits of it are founded on Christ's Righteousness, as the immediate cause of them: Effectual Ability to perform the Duty, is provided for all the Elect, and declared in the Gospel, and God doth not fix on these terms for any Worth in them, or profit to him. 3. The Gospel is the Instrument or Sign by which this Will of God is expressed: This is not the Language of God in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law; if this were not superadded to that, we had been utterly misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 4. This fixeth that Rule of the Promise which Mr. <hi>C. p.</hi> 33. is at a loss to know. God promiseth he will justifie him that truly believes, and save the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in Heart: Hereby he that in Truth believes, and is upright, answers that Rule which the Unbelievers and Hypocrites do not, and so God doth not hereby promise to save them; yea, he declares they shall not have an Interest in these Mercies, because they continue such, and condemns them as such at last: It's Faith, not Infidelity; it's Faith in <hi>Truth,</hi> not Faith in Perfection, nor Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43118:15"/>I shall offer thee some few Reasons why I say this is some part of the Essence of the Gospel, and that God hath fixed this Rule therein.</p>

                  <hi>R.</hi> 3. Justification is a judicial Act, and therefore it must be by a Law, if we allow God to be a Ruler when He doth it. We dispute this against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who deny it to be a forensick Term. It's true, the Righteousness for which we are justified, is Christ's, which answer'd the Law of Innocency, but the application of it to one man rather than another, and to the same man at one time, and not before, is by the Gospel. It's not the voice of the Law of Works, that the believing Sinner shall be justified for Christ's Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. And I might shew, that in Justification is a Right to Impunity; And can any thing but a Law give this? for Condemnation by Law cannot be reversed without a Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 4. The Gospel gives a Right to its Benefits upon believing, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. to as many as received him, <hi>to them gave he power to become the Sons of God,</hi> even to them that believe in his Name. What did God by his Gospel give to these <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> a Right, a Title to be the Sons of God.

The Gospel-Law is so entirely founded on Christ, and refers to him so fully, that there is no more than an inviolable Connexion between Terms and Benefits; there's no boasting when the Claim is strongest; yea, not boasting, but ascribing all to Christ, is one of the great Terms.</p>

That day supposeth all justified or not by the Gospel, Christ then changeth no mans state; the Godly stand there pardoned and entituled to Life by Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness imputed; the Wicked are there without any Interest in Christ; these wicked ones, if they pretend to sinless Innocency, they are cast upon the least Sin, by the Law of <hi>Adam:</hi> But if they plead God's general Mercy, it will be evident that Mercy adjusted its Rule in the Gospel. If they plead Hopes from Christ as a Redeemer, and the Offers he made, they are convinced by that Book, that Christ saved none but such as repent and believe. If they plead they did believe and profess his Name, Christ will convince them, that his Gospel required a true Faith, operative in sincere and persevering Obedience, the want whereof he will charge upon them; as you see in <hi>Mat. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. &amp; 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so leaves them subject to the Law of <hi>Adam,</hi> without Relief by the Gospel; yea, heightens their Condemnation for disobeying the Gospel: But if they yet plead, But Lord, thou savest some that were Unbelievers as well as we, at least, they were not such

If the Damned or Satan should plead, But they were Sinners, though not unbelieving Hypocrites; the Answer of Christ will be, I have satisfied the Law for them, and so Justice cannot suffer by my washing them in my Blood, nor hinder their being glorious for my sake.</p>

               <p>Reader, it's hard reconciling the account we have of the Day of Judgment, by any thing below what I have delivered, and were not the Gospel to be a Rule of Judgment, I cannot see how that <hi>could be a Iudgment-day,</hi> it must <hi>be</hi> only an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution-day, for by the Law of <hi>Adam</hi> no Believer could be acquitted; that Law must <hi>be</hi> altered <hi>by the Law-giver,</hi> to admit a Satisfaction, and it's by the Gospel only he hath enacted the way how this Satisfaction <hi>shall be</hi> applied. By that first Law these Unbelievers (yea, all men) were condemned virtually in <hi>Adam</hi> when he was judged upon his Fall, and that Sentence seized them as soon as they had a Being, there needed no other. It would help thy Thoughts, if thou wilt acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate some of the Circumstances of the last Judgment to them that shall be alive at that time. I might multiply Arguments to prove the Gospel to be a Law. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever proves the Covenant to be conditional, proves the Gospel to be a Law. Nothing keeps the most sincere Godliness, or Act of a Saint here from <hi>being down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right a Sin,</hi> if the Gospel be no Law, for they are not legally perfect, and so are Sins, I see not how any man can have grounded Hopes of Glory, if the Gospel be no Law; and they that deny it, and say Faith is but a Sign, must set up Works <hi>above</hi> Faith, for they are more evidencing Signs than an internal Act of Faith: Yea, how can Christ be our King, if his Gospel be no Law?

A Law-Sanction doth not exclude the greatest Mercy and Grace, in conferring the Benefit. It's true,<note place="margin">Every San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not Grace.</note> that if the Condition be in it self meritorious, then in that respect the Benefit is of <hi>Debt,</hi> and was made a Condition in the Covenant, because of its condignity, if exactly proportionable, or congruity if less valuable: But God chuseth a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Is it not a gracious Law, though a Law, that <hi>If fallen wretches will duly accept of my Son, they shall have Life by him; and this I command them to do?</hi> 3. His Mistake seems to be in his Notion of <hi>Reward,</hi> and in his <hi>upon</hi> and <hi>not upon</hi> performance of the Condition. Gospel-Benefits are no Reward of Debt, and yet<note place="margin">The Gospel Sanction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> they are given in a way of reward. The Benefits are given not <hi>for</hi> our Faith, yet upon believing; not <hi>upon</hi> it as a <hi>meriting</hi> consideration, yet upon it as that the <hi>presence</hi> whereof is made necessary by the Gospel, this having required Faith, and confined the Benefit to him that believes. If a man says, I'll give you a thousand pounds if you will come to my House and fetch it; is it not a free Gift, though the poor man must come if he will have it? And the Giver is yet bound by his Promise to give it if he come, and not bound to give it if he refuse to come. Do not say receiving Pardon is only <hi>naturally</hi> necessary, and not as a Condition en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, for God might have applied Christ's Merits for Pardon, though the Sinner consented not. A Lunatick may be pardoned by a King; and the Rich man might have sent the thousand pound to the Poor man's House, whether he came for it or no; but Christ resolved to shew his governing Authority in the displays of Grace, and excite to Duty by Motives from Benefits, though the Benefits shall be so given, as that what we do shall be no cause or Merit of them. 4.

Well then, sure though that Action of Receiving doth not justifie me, yet that Action is by God's fixed Law necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my being justified by Christ's Righteousness; not as it is an Action, but as it answers to the Rule of the Promise, whereby God enacts, he will for Christ's sake justifie him that believes. 6.

               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The Argument of these words is, that all the Precepts and Threats in the Gospel are part of the Law of Nature, given to <hi>Adam;</hi> and that Law of <hi>Adam</hi> is the only Law, and therefore Faith in Christ, which Sinners are called to is only the Voice of the Law of Works or Innocency; and the whole Sanction of the Gospel is the Sanction of that Law, and hence the Gospel must be no Law. I might shew what a gross sence he gives of Christ being the end of the Law, and that his words lead us to think, that all Obligation (except from Gratitude) to Obedience, lies on Christ only, and not on the Elect; that the Gospel hath no influence at all upon them that are not actually saved; that the Gospel is only an absolute Promise, or rather a Declaration of Election, to the Elect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing at all from them as a term of any Benefit whatever, and yet they are saved, as Elect by the Law, as immediately entituling them to Life, without the interposal of the Gospel-Sanction; that is, the Gospel doth not only invest them in Pardon, and a Right to Salvation by God's imputing Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to them (when Believers) which was a perfect Obedience of his to the Law, and a full Satisfaction to the Law-giver for them, as their voluntary Surety: Which I hold; but that the Law immediately judgeth them to have obeyed it perfectly, and also to have endured the Penalty in Christ, he being their Proxy and Attorney.</p>
               <p>This is the Method these men espouse, whereby they destroy Christ's Sufferings as a proper Satisfaction, exclude all Forgiveness, as needless: They debase Christ to an Attorney, and exalt the Creatures, as if they stood on the strictest Terms of Merit with God, having legal Innocence of their own, as having obeyed and atoned too: Yea, they had a Grant of all the Saving Effects of Christ's Death, before they fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> who was their Head even when Christ was their Head too, for they were one legal Person wlth Christ alwaies as Elect, and not when they become Believers. And hence the Gospel doth require nothing of any elect persons, to interest them in Christ or his Benefits.</p>
               <p>But I pass by these, and in opposition to the Argument, I shall (in the strength<note place="margin">The Gospel is not the law of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> of Christ) evidence, that the Law of Nature or Works is not a hindrance to the Gospels being a Law, but that the Gospel is another Law, distinct in its Precept and Sanction, and other respects.</p>
               <p>1. The Gospel is distinct in its preceptive part, from the Law of Innocency.<note place="margin">The Gospel differs in its Precepts from <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law.</note> Faith in Christ was never commanded by that Law. To say Faith in God was a Duty, is a vain Objection, for Faith in Christ as a Saviour is specified from its Object, and is distinguished into temporary, historical, saving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Faith that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith <hi>Adam</hi> was wounded in, was meerly a Faith of Assent, which the Devils have, or a natural Trust in God as Creator: But what's that to a receiving of <hi>Christ,</hi> or consent to him as Redeemer, and relyance on him? Of which more by and by.</p>
               <p>Is it not strange that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith, The Law never brings us to God, then Faith doth not, for it's part of the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let's hear what others speak.

For him to have a supernatural Principle of Faith, as we have, was in him superfluous and vain. This he shews, because <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant would not have brought him to Heaven. 3.

And therefore our way of Faith must needs be supernatural, and <hi>altioris ordinis</hi> from his, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he proves 1. in the respect of the Objects revealed to our Faith, which his Mind should never have arrived at: 2. in regard to the Light by which our Minds are acted and elevated: 3. in respect of the way or manner of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Assent raised up thereby.</q>

               <p>I might add the Testimony of one whom Mr. <hi>C.</hi> honoured, who gives this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the present Debate, saying, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>If Consent to the Covenant was a Duty by the Law, then the Law did bind to its own dissolution.</q>  But I suppose this may serve to shew, that Faith in Christ was no Duty by the Law of Nature, and therefore either it is a Command of the Gospel-Law, or it is no Duty at all.

                  <hi>A.</hi> You must consider, 1. the Law of Nature less properly, as the Rule of<note place="margin">The Law as in Innocency not the Gospel-law.</note> Happiness in the Covenant of Innocency; and so it was appropriated to that state, and was a particular Law of Works: If so considered, the several Precepts of it were written on Man's Heart, and God and the Creatures ministred Instruction to the innate Light, which was inherent in our Minds, and that in a <hi>natural way.</hi> Some Ruins of both are still preserved to fallen Man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. 14. In this sence Faith and Repentance could have no place at all in the Law, for it was a Law to govern and save Innocent Man, but not to recover Sinful Man.

If you take the Law of Nature for the remaining Instincts and Notices of it in Man (which ought to be perfect) and assisted and directed by the Works of God, sure the Gospel must <hi>be</hi> another Law, or else Heathens are <hi>able</hi> to find out Christ by the Book of Nature, and engaged to receive him, and rely
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43118:19"/>
on him, though he were never revealed to them. The reason is this; the Law of Nature in this sence binds all the Heathens, and its Precepts are engraven natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally upon their Hearts, and God and his Works consider'd naturally, direct their Minds. 3. The Law of Nature may be considered most generally, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is an Obligation upon Man to believe and obey, whatever God shall any way or time reveal and require, and to suffer for Disobedience what God shall threaten. In this sence indeed the Law commands all Duty in general, but it doth not deny<note place="margin">The general Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>inders not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel to be a Law.</note> the Gospel to be a special Law, for this indeed doth oblige us to obey all God's Laws, when he makes them Laws; but it doth not determine any one Law, nor give a Being to one particular Precept. It's the Foundation of our Obligation, to submit to God's Authority as Creatures, but appoints not wherein we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that subjection. It's the same as an Obligation among men to Allegiance to the supreme Power, which I hope prevents not the Ruler's <hi>Acts</hi> to be Laws. This Law of Nature subjects us to God's Threatnings, which he shall pronounce at any time for Sin, but determineth neither the sort nor degree of the threatned Evils. This Law is common to good Angels, Devils, innocent Man, fallen Man, yea, damned and glorified Man, for they are all engaged as Creatures to obey the Laws of God, when he enacts them, and suffer what he threatens if they obey not. But is the Gospel therefore no Law, or only this Law of Nature? Then Angels, Devils, and the Damned are obliged to believe in Christ for Salvation. Do not say, God doth not require this of them, for they are under this Law of Nature, and so he doth require it of them; or else it is some distinct special Law, whereby he requires it of others, and not of them. By this Notion God never made any Law beside this one Law of Nature; no positive Law, no ceremonial Law, for this Law of Nature did bind Man to observe them when God was pleased to command them; and yet they were special Laws for all that. And why then must the Command of Faith in Christ, and Repentance for Remission, be no Law, when God commands them, because the Law of Nature requires us to obey them when God doth command them? What a Government do these men assign to God, who allow him but one and the same Law to govern the whole Creation by, when their state and circumstances be so different, though all are his <hi>Creatures?</hi> 4. As for such as confound the Law of Nature with the Law to<note place="margin">The Moral Law now the Gospel.</note> 
                  <hi>Israel,</hi> as taken into the Covenant of Grace, I shall not think fit to say more to than this; Though the carnal <hi>Iews</hi> did turn it into a Covenant of Works, as if their imperfect Obedience and chargeable Sacrifices were the very Righteousness for which they were justified, and so neglected Repentance and Faith in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Forgiveness for the sake of Christ, who was typified in their Sacrifices; nevertheless it was a Law of Faith and Repentance, as <hi>Wittichius</hi> calls it, <hi>p.</hi> 106.<note place="margin">

Indeed it's true, the matter of the Ten Commandments were much of the matter of the Law of Innocency, but God did not deliver it to his Church as a Law to innocent Man, but to fallen Man, for his direction and recovery. Therefore when any Authors take the Law as given on <hi>Sinai,</hi> to be the Covenant of Grace, they deny Faith to be commanded <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, though they grant it requir'd in the Law at <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Sanction of the Gospel is not the same with the Law of Innocency; <note place="margin">The sanction of the Gospel differs from <hi>Adams</hi> law.</note> which I shall evidence in the promissory and minatory parts. I'll begin with the promissory part.</p>
               <p>I. The promissory part of the Gospel differs from that of the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. 1. There are many things promised in the Gospel, which that Law never<note place="margin">The Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses differ.</note> promised. Did that Law ever promise <hi>Union with Christ, or the indwelling Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or Forgiveness of Sin, or Perseverance?</hi> Surely no: But the Gospel doth all this. Nay, Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> urgeth many Arguments to prove, that the Reward of<note place="margin">D. <hi>Goodw.</hi> vol. 2. lib. 2. p. 46, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was to be only a continuance in the same Life he had in Paradise, and not a translation to Heaven. 2. The Rewards of the Law of Works were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised on the same account, as the Benefits promised by the Law of Grace be; those were on the account of Works as a <hi>meriting</hi> Righteousness, ours are by <hi>Free Grace,</hi> on the account of <hi>Christ</hi>'s sole meriting Righteousness. Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> saith,<note place="margin">D. <hi>Goodw.</hi> p. 45. ubi supra.</note> 
                  <q>The Reward of the Law was in a just sence due (of Debt) unto the Creature, and that from God: Not that God can owe any thing to his Creature, or be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for any thing to him, but because in a way of natural Justice, or rather Comeliness and Dueness, such as is by the Law of Creation to be between a just Creator and a holy Creature; there is an approbation <hi>due</hi> to him from God, whilst that Creature obeys him, and that as a Debt of Nature.</q> But I say, all the claim we have, is for Christ, and <hi>ex pacto,</hi> as the Free Promise assureth us. 3. The Benefits are promised on different <hi>terms.</hi> By the Law all was for perfect <hi>Sinless</hi> Obedience, but the Gospel promiseth Pardon upon our true repenting and believing; and we forfeit not our Interest in its Blessings, if our <hi>Faith</hi> be effectual and persevering in sincere Holiness and Obedience. 4. The Law of <hi>Adam</hi> did not justifie till the <hi>whole time</hi> of the trial of Obedience was finished. It's true, it did continue the Blessings he had, while he sinned not, but it did not fix his state of Happiness till his trial was over; but the Gospel puts us in a justified state upon our first believing.</p>
               <p>II. The threatning part of the Gospel differs from that in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law. 1. The<note place="margin">The Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings differ.</note> 
                  <hi>Evils threatned</hi> are not wholly the same: Here's not only Death, but that in sorer degrees, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. &amp; 12. 25. God's Wrath will be more poured out, and Conscience will find matter of sorer Reflections. Here's a <hi>privation</hi> of Christ, and his Spirit and Pardon: We are not only without them, but we are barr'd from them, because of our wicked refusal, when they were sincerely offer'd us after our Apostacy. If the Gospel were no Law, we could not be obliged to <hi>more</hi> Misery than <hi>Adam</hi> brought us under; yea, and <hi>Adam</hi> could not be our <hi>full</hi> Representative in his Covenant, if we are capable of encreasing our Misery by <hi>that</hi> Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disobedience to a new one. 2. The Gospel doth not denounce Death for the <hi>same Sins,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law did; that Law threatned Death for the least Sin, yea, for <hi>one</hi> Sin, but the Gospel threatens Death not for <hi>every</hi> Sin; it doth not bar
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43118:20"/>
every Sinner from actual Relief, but the impenitent, unbelieving, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Hypocrite. 3. The Gospel binds not Damnation on us, unless we are finally impenitent Unbelievers. If at any time of life we truly repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we shall find Mercy, but <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law denounced him miserable on his <hi>first</hi> Sin.</p>
               <p>III. There be a great many other Differences, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law God acted<note place="margin">Other Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</note> as meer <hi>Creator,</hi> in the Law of Grace he acts as <hi>Redeemer</hi> as well as <hi>Creator;</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law Men were considered as <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>sinless,</hi> in the Gospel we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as <hi>Sinners;</hi> by that Law God governed us as happy, in order to a fixing us in our happy estate, in the Gospel he deals with us in order to our <hi>recovery</hi> from a lost estate; in that there was <hi>no Mediator,</hi> in this there <hi>is a Mediator,</hi> who also is our King-Redeemer. Many more might be added.</p>
               <p>Reader, weigh all these things, and if the Gospel must be a special Law, so that it be not the Law of Innocency, what can be more plain, than that it is not the same with the Law of Innocency or Nature either. I could farther demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that the very <hi>appropriation</hi> of Faith (tho' it were a legal Precept) to be the grand Condition of Salvation, doth argue the Gospels being a distinct Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for otherwise any Duty would be of equal use: But because Mr. <hi>C.</hi> charges me as a <hi>New Gospeller,</hi> I'll give thee a few of the hundreds that oppose his three former Errors, and consent to my Paradoxes as orthodox.</p>

It is not, nor ever was, a Duty encumbent on them to repent, nor is it so unto the Damned in Hell; God requires it not of them, nor is it their Duty, there being no Forgiveness for them. What should move them to repent? Why should it be their Duty so to do? Assignation then of Repentance is a revelation of Forgiveness: God would not call upon a sinful Creature to humble it self, and bewail its Sin, if there were no way of recovery or relief.

               <p>The excellent Mr. <hi>Clerkson</hi> will help thee to resolve some seeming difference thou findest among Authors, who in one place seem to deny the Covenant to be conditional, and in other places affirm it. See <hi>p.</hi> 132, 133, 134. After he had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted the first Grace to be absolute, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Effectual Calling,</hi> &amp;c. he adds, The <hi>subsequent</hi> Blessings of the Covenant, those that follow the first, are in some sence <hi>conditional,</hi> and so offer'd and promised in a conditional form, and yet are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless gracious. There are Terms and Conditions, taking the word <hi>Conditions</hi> in a Latitude, as comprizing <hi>Qualifications,</hi> Adjuncts, and <hi>necessary Antecedents,</hi> which do no way derogate from Grace, neither detract from its freeness, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, but rather illustrate it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. upon such <hi>Terms</hi> are <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Adoption, and Salvation</hi> offered, and not offered but upon Terms, and yet most freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and graciously, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not only Faith, but <hi>holiness</hi> of Heart and Life, and perseverance therein, are the <hi>Terms</hi> upon which Salvation is promised, <hi>&amp;c.

So that here is an antecedence of some <hi>Duty,</hi> and that necessary by divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and <hi>Command,</hi> and this tending to <hi>obtain</hi> the Favour freely offer'd. And by this we may understand what a Condition is, in a sence very innocent, and no way injurious to Grace: It is an Antecedent <hi>necessarily required,</hi> as the way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or arrive at what is promised. And in this sence it must not be denied there are <hi>Conditions</hi> in the Gospel, and its Promises, unless we will deny that there are Duties necessary to Salvation, and made necessary by <hi>Divine Command,</hi> for such a Condition is nothing but something of a Command joyned with a Promise in a conditional form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He commands all to <hi>Repent,</hi> and He promiseth Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; put this Promise and that Command together, and it becomes a <hi>conditional Promise, If you repent you shall have Pardon,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. But <hi>p.</hi> 137, 138, 140. he justly excludes meritorious, natural, and legal Conditions. By which <hi>Legal</hi> he means not whatever is commanded with an annexed Promise, for that were to contradict all here cited; but such Conditions as do entitle us to the Benefit, as the very Righteousness for which we merit or obtain them; which I have oft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Gospel-Conditions to be.

And what can he mean by <hi>things distinct from the Promise?</hi> If that Faith and Repentance are promised, I had oft affirmed it: If that as Acts in Man they are not distinct from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, it's unfit to reflect on: If that they may not be Terms of Pardon conjoyned therewith, in one promissory Series, it's against the scope of the Bible; and sure, if that hinder not Pardon to be the cause of them, it will not exclude them to be Terms of Pardon. 5.

One Reason at least should have been offered for these contradictions; I suppose all that would be offered is, that Christ cannot work Faith in us till we are pardoned, which the whole Scripture is against, and God hath provided for it, by Divine ordination, in that Christ's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are admitted effectual to the working and and accepting of this Grace, before these Merits are applied for Forgiveness; which is fully expressed in his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Method, whereby he commands and works Faith in order to Forgiveness: Yea, he will not, I hope, deny (lest he spoil his Argument <hi>p.</hi> 28.) that Union with Christ is before Pardon in order of Nature; And is not that an Effect of Christ's Merits?

No Law of God with a Sanction admits of the least Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the said Obedience.</hi> Then if the Gospel, as including <hi>Adam</hi>'s Precepts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Perfection, it cannot forgive any Imperfection; if it do not abate the Rule<note place="margin">Every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Duty is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Condition of Benefits.</note> of Duty, it cannot confer any degree of its promised Mercy.

Doth he indeed think that whereever God enjoyns Duties, he denounceth his Threatning to all degrees of neglect of what he makes a Duty; or that it ceaseth to be a Duty at all, if the Sanction reach not every degree of omission? <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved.</hi> Is not it a Duty here to be baptized?

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Not to expose the Passages before this, as if because the Gospel in a <hi>large</hi> sence includes all the moral Precepts, therefore taken in a strict sence, it makes all those Precepts and perfect Obedience to them the Condition of its <hi>peculiar</hi> Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; and as if Christ's Law did not <hi>bind</hi> a person morally impotent; and that Men must be first pardoned before they are obliged to submit to Christ; and that<note place="margin">Christ is King, and his Laws bind under a Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanction.</note> there is no difference between such a <hi>tast</hi> of Pardoning Mercy, as assures us we shall have Pardon on Gospel-Terms, and our actually having that Pardon before those Terms be yielded to. At this rate he reasons throughout his Book, but I mind greater things than the discovery of his Weakness; therefore to his Principle I answer: He gives Christ, as Redeemer, a poor Kingdom; it's a Kingly Power, but it's of a low sort. 1. Its <hi>extent</hi> is small, it's bounded within his Church; it seems then he hath no Authority over them that are without, no, not to command them to be Church-Members. I thought, tho' he be acknowledged King by his Church, yet his Laws bind much farther. I am sure he damns others for disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. But, 2. by these words He is not such a King as can make Laws in his<note place="margin">Luke 19. 14, 27.</note> very Church; He exerts a Kingly Power in governing of his Church: This is distinguished by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> from <hi>giving Commands.</hi> The sound of this Passage is, He gives Commands as an Officer acting not in a proper Legislation. 3. Allow what he prescribes to be His Laws in any sence, yet there's no Salvation depends upon obeying them: Nothing He requires, yea, by his Revealed Gospel, are any Conditions of Life. He came to purchase Salvation, but he hath no Authority to enjoyn the Terms of it. Whereas I read, <note n="1" place="margin">Rom. 14. 9.</note> that <hi>for this end he died, that he might be Lord of the dead, and of the living:</hi> 
                  <note n="2" place="margin">Heb. 5. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>He is the Author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him:</hi> 
                  <note n="3" place="margin">Joh. 8. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>If a man keep my Sayings, he shall never see death:</hi> 
                  <note n="4" place="margin">Joh. 14. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>He that doth my Commandments, and keepeth them, he loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father:</hi> 
                  <note n="5" place="margin">Joh. 5. 24, 25, 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given the Son to have life in himself, and hath given him Authority to execute Iudgment also, because he is the Son of Man. He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, and shall not come into condemnation.</hi> It seems too that Church-Censures bind nothing of eternal danger, even when rightly administred. Dr. <hi>Owens,</hi> in his Treatise of the Sabbath, says near these words, That <hi>our worshipping Christ in his Ordinances on Earth, is the Condition of our being with him in Heaven.</hi> 4. The Reason for all this is strange, <hi>such Obedience is part of the Life promised;</hi> then he rendred the Elect Libertines, when he made such Promises: He promised to make the Elect obedient, therefore he cannot command them to be so. Pursuant to his Promise, he'll make them obedient, therefore the Terms to be obeyed are no foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conditions of other Blessings promised on those Terms; because he'l see they shall believe, therefore he must not thus enact, <hi>Believe, and thou shalt be saved.</hi> 5. But is there no distinction admittable in the word <hi>Life?</hi> It's sometimes put for Grace in us, sometimes for Glory consummated, sometimes it's put strictly for the saving priviledge part of the Covenant, as consequent to the Terms of it, and <hi>that believing ye might have Life.</hi> In this sence he saw I took it: And doth God in<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 31.</note> every Promise of Life in this sence, promise Obedience to the Terms of it? 6. A few lines after these he determines, the Judgment committed to Christ; It's not Legislation at all, nay, <hi>all of it is not Gospel-Iudgment</hi> (he might have said <hi>none</hi>

to any, that are not saved; for if there be no foederal Sanction in the Gospel, there can be no <hi>conditional Offer</hi> to any that are not saved, nay, to none that are saved. Now Reader, see how Christ as Redeemer is honoured by Mr. C. He shall be of use to excuse us from loyal subjection, while himself is dethroned, as to the recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way of the application of his Merits. This very point of Christ's regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as Redeemer, hath been defended by our<note n="*" place="margin">Icanes <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; vide Charnock, <hi>vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 687. 2.

               <p>I might instance others of his Principles, which I suppose agree with Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> as in his Description of <hi>Faith,</hi> which he hints <hi>p.</hi> 36. and I have heard him more fully define it, by assurance of our Pardon: In that place he makes Faith of no use, but to <hi>claim Possession,</hi> to which it seems we had as full a <hi>Title</hi> before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. And <hi>p.</hi> 17. Mr. <hi>C. After the manner of imputation,</hi> in foro justitiae, <hi>our Sins shall never be laid on us, (viz.</hi> the Elect, <hi>qua</hi>-Elect.) <hi>Which I will prove against you when you will. Rep.</hi> Let's understand the Question, for it is too confused: What is this <hi>After the manner of imputation</hi> in foro, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Do you mean, the Elect shall<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s Challenge accepted.</note> never come to God's Bar of Judgment before they believe, and are forgiven? If so I grant it: But if you mean, that the past Sentence of God binds not the Sins of the Elect upon them, while they are Unbelievers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that this Act of his, by his Word, is not an Imputation <hi>in foro divinae justitiae.</hi> I freely accept your Challenge, so that you will engage to avoid unruly Passions. And it's well if <hi>those Effects of Electing Love, which</hi> Paul <hi>had applied to him in the Womb, are not</hi> semen quoddam electio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, which <hi>Calvin</hi> so condemns.<note place="margin">Calv. <hi>Inst. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. <hi>sect.</hi> 10, 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Of the same sort is what Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith <hi>p.</hi> 34. of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Rep.</hi> 1, God is so reconciled, that no want of atonement shall prevent Peace. 2. That upon this atonement God offers Peace on the lowest Terms. 3. That the Elect shall in time be enabled to obey those Terms, and be actually reconciled. 4. But the whole <hi>Canon</hi> of the Word, and unopposed in this place, assures me, that the Elect are in a state of Wrath till they believe; yea, were God actually reconciled to them, he could not suffer them to remain Enemies in their Minds by wicked Works, and a total absence of his Spirit. But I have not room for these and the like.</p>
               <p>Mr. C. <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>After a certain zealous</hi> Neonomian <hi>had taken his Leave of us:</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 22. <hi>you play the Iugler more; He saith</hi> Quoniam &amp; Christus Mediator, <hi>&amp;c. being that both Christ the Mediator, and Faith in Christ, are only means of the restauration of Man to God, by Holiness and Love. Therefore it must doubtlesly be said, that from</hi> the nature of the thing <hi>Faith, Holiness, and the Love of God, are more necessary to Salvation than either Faith in Christ, or the Sacrifice of Christ himself.

If any man had asked Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Is Holiness as meritorious of Salvation as Christ's Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is? he would have answered, No; for Christ's Satisfaction is the sole meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cause of Salvation, and Holiness is none at all. If you had ask'd Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Is Faith-Love to God of that use, to receive Christ for our Justification, as Faith in Christ is? he would have answer'd, No; Faith in Christ is in it self most ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> and by the Lord appointed to this use to receive Christ. Both these he of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> affirms. 2. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here speaks only of the comparative necessity of these to Salvation, with respect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the <hi>nature of the thing it self;</hi> that is, as he explains himself, it cannot
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43118:29"/>
be <hi>a Salvation</hi> without Holiness at least habitual; it's a Contradiction, as it would be to say <hi>Salvation without Salvation:</hi> It is not whether is more necessary now to my obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation; as if I should ask, whether is more necessary to the Essence of Man, his Humanity, or Christ's Satisfaction? you would say, from the nature of the thing, a man's Humanity is. 3. Nay, had Mr. <hi>B.</hi> spoken of the essential necessity of these to the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Salvation, yet Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath made him speak very orthodoxly; for <hi>p.</hi> 22. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith, <hi>When once a Transgressor is sentenced by the Law, he falls into the hands of Prerogative, and the Prince may do with him what he pleaseth. God also might have put Repentance into the Conditions of the Law of Works at first, and said, if thou dost not eat, or repent of thy eating, thou shalt have thy Reward.</hi> Now if, as he saith, Prerogative could save fallen Man, if God pleased, and what way He pleased; nay, that it was not inconsistent with Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to have made Repentance a Condition of Reward to sinning Man, in the first Law, without the interposal of Christ's Satisfaction, then Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s words are plain; so that we can prove, that it is inconsistent with God's Perfections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to save a man that finally hates him, and is utterly void of all Holiness. And sure if, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith, Christ's Satisfaction was not absolutely necessary to Salvation, Faith in Christ would have been less necessary.</p>
               <p>I am in Duty bound to resent that treatment the memory of this great Blessing of the Nation meets with: What could be more slightly mention'd of any Fellow, than <hi>he took his leave of us?</hi> or more falsly than <hi>he was a Iugler;</hi> tho' <hi>I</hi> more so? Were his Enemies as free from crafty Tricks, Falshood, and Selfishness as he was, a publick Good would be more intended, and the power of Religion receive a greater Testimony. There be of them that say publickly Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is in <hi>Hell:</hi> I confess, I am not in all things of the same Judgment with this great Divine, nevertheless I must say, no man I ever knew expressed so much of God's Image, as consisting in Light, Holiness, and Love: many Thousands bless God for his Labours, which are so adapted to promote Christ indeed, and not an <hi>empty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Name</hi> of him; and I fear not to declare my assurance that his Name will flourish when the <hi>Antinomian</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I answer, It's true, Sin <hi>naturally</hi> is a root bringing all manner of evil Fruit, but yet I say, whatever Sin in its own nature' brings forth, yet the Sins of Gods People they that have God for their own God, (which with him the vilest, if Elect, have) <hi>their</hi> Sins can do them no hurt at all, and in that regard there is no cause of fear from any of their Sins that ever they have committed.
