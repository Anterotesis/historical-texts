         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>4. The attributes of God are either affirmative, or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
they expresse the perfection of God, as farre as we can

nearer to our apprehensions: as when an eye, an hand, anger,

            <p>3. Concerning Gods essentiall properties, we must know,
that there are not in God many, or divers properties, because
he is one of a most simple, pure and indivisible essence; but
in respect of our understanding there are many: Concerning
which we must hold, First, That the essentiall properties of
God are all really the one essence of God: for<note n="i" place="margin">Deus est idem quod sua essentia v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> there is
nothing in God which is not God: there is no accident in
him: a man hath wisedome, power, justice, but not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
not ever; not infinitely neither, as his essence; for the
wisedome, power, justice, &amp;c. of a man, are not man: but
whatever is in God, is of God, and his eternall essence, of
himselfe subsisting independently, inseparably: neither are
they after his essence, but coeternall, and coessentiall, though
they have not alwaies beene declared to the creatures: so his
<note n="k" place="margin">Prov. 8. 22.</note> wisedome and omnipotency was from all eternity, though
they were not manifested till that time he had appointed for
the creation of the world, wherein he made men and <hi>Angels</hi>
witnesses thereof: the same is to be understood of his other
properties, mercy, justice, patience, &amp;c. Secondly, That
these properties are not parts of Gods essence: for that which
is infinite hath no parts, and that which hath parts cannot be
infinite: but every essentiall property is the being of God,
who is indivisible, and truly one. Thirdly, The essentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the deity are inseparable and incommunicable; so
that no creature can become a deity, or have such an essence,
as is infinite, omnipotent, omnipresent, &amp;c. Fourthly, Some
things absolutely spoken of God are in the <hi>abstract,</hi> to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
his selfe-being; as when we say he is life, wisedome,
goodnesse, &amp;c. Some things in the <hi>concrete,</hi> to import to us
the reallity of his existence: as when we say he is good, just,
holy, &amp;c. in both we understand, that whatsoever is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Sunne only we must take heed, that we fix not on any finite
thing further then it may serve to bring home to our finite
understanding, some notions of infinites: this mystery is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and above all comparison: as he is God, he is of himselfe,
neither begotten, nor proceeding: for as the essence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

they are not divers Godheads, or beings, but one and the same:
but as he is the Sonne, he is of the Father; as light of light, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>2 The Sonne is of the same substance with the Father, and

conception, to be by the power of Gods spirit so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,
and therefore so framing <hi>Christ</hi> of a sanctified masse,
as that the deity, and humanity of <hi>Christ,</hi> became one person;
Neither may we think that the father, and the eternall word
and sonne of God, were here excluded, because the action is
attributed to the <hi>holy Ghost;</hi> but this is said, to intimate, that
this was so by the free gift and grace of God (for 'tis said the
power of the most high shall overshadow thee, <hi>Luk: 1. 35.)</hi>
that the manhood of <hi>Christ</hi> being but a creature, should be so
annointed with the oyle of gladnesse above his fellowes, that
it should become a part of the sonne of God, not by confusion
of natures, but union of the Godhead and manhood of <hi>Christ</hi>
into one person; and because the father and the son wrought
this by the holy Ghost, proceeding of them both, the whole
sense is, as if it were said, the spirit of God caused him thus to
be conceived, after an extraordinary manner.</p>
            <p>2. Three things are here consiberable.</p>
            <p>1 That the body of <hi>Christ</hi> was of the body of the Virgin,
that he might be, according to Gods promise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the seed of
<hi>Abraham:</hi> his humane soule was infused by a power of God
into the sacred body prepared for it: both of them from the
moment of their being, having their subsistence in the person
of the son of God, <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:96658:22"/>
2. It was sanctifyed and made<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 1. 35.</note> most holy: such it became
him to be, who redeemed and saved us, free from all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and sinne: for he was to cleanse the first <hi>Adams</hi> sinne de
rived to his posterity, and to overcome sinne in our flesh, by
taking on him our flesh without sinne: that he might by his
suffering, satisfie Gods justice in the same nature which had
offended, and fulfill the whole Law of God to which we were
bound under paine of damnation, and that he might be able to
mediateto God for us, which none but the perfectly holy
could doe.</p>
            <p>3 The two natures, the Godhead and the manhood of
<hi>Christ,</hi> were so united in his conceptions, as that they make
but one person, very God and very man: there is an union in
nature, as the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost are one God:
and an union in person; as when two things in nature differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are so united as that they make but one person: so the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and reasonable soule make the person of a man: so the
Deity and humanity of <hi>Christ,</hi> (one being a spirituall, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
incomprehensible being, the other a bodily finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
are indivisibly united into one sacred person <hi>Christ Jesus:</hi>
so that his humanity is a nature, but not a person, but in the
deity, which uniteth it selfe most immediately to the soule,
and by it to the body of <hi>Christ:</hi> now (as hath beene said)

the carnall wisdome of worldly men, esteeming none

3. Thus would he be borne poore, to make us rich, to expresse
his love to us. 4. Thus he would teach us humility: how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
is the pride of sinfull man, repining at some wants,
when the sonne of God was thus humbled for our sins? 5. He
would have this difference betweene his first and second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:

noise; he came not then to make any externall politicall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Having considered these things we must learne.</p>
            <p>1 To subject our reason to the word of God in assurance
that all things are possible to him which he will, and certainly
true which he speaketh. Thou wilt say, but how shall I doe
that I may be assured thereof? I conceive these rules very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
here in. 1. That thou understand, this word is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by any light but by the same spirit which indited it.
Therefore said our Saviour when the spirit of truth is come,
<hi>He will lead you into all truth.</hi> These things seeme foolish and

which are not otherwise then spiritually discerned. 2. If thou

heart; resolved in this one principle at least; Gods word is

it is but lost labour for him to take the holy word of
life into his hand, who is resolved to beleeve no more, then
that which he can bring within the reach and dimension of
his own carnall reason, which erreth grosly in many things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to common sense. 3. In this, as many other matters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be beleeved, the onely way being to apprehend by
faith, doe thou not attempt the examination of all by reason,
but rather renounce it as unable to measure these things, as
thou art to take up the vast ball of earth into thy hand, or
measure the orbs of heaven by the span: the rather in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

both of body and soule, <hi>quae à peccato sunt, non quae ad peccatum:</hi>
all the effects of sinne without sinne; as in his birth, circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
subjection to men, temptations, blasphemous<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 12. 3.</note> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictons,
and contumelies; desertions of friends, and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
malice of enimies: apprehension of his fathers wrath
against sinne, the paines of death and torments of hell, all that
which is incident and due to sinfull man, (sin onely excepted)
<hi>whereby he became the</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Isay 53. 3.</note> 
               <hi>man of sorrowes.</hi> 2. In particular
that which he suffered under <hi>Pontius Pilat,</hi> the then <hi>Roman</hi>
deputie for that Province.</p>
            <p>2 Concerning the generall, we must observe.</p>
            <p>1. That the divine nature (though personally united to the
humane) suffered not, but only the humane: yet the suffering
is attributed to the person: and sometimes to the deity, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the communication of proprieties,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> and union of the
two natures in one person, so God is said to have purchased
the Church <hi>with his own blood:</hi> because his blood who is truely
God and man, was shed for the redemption of his Church. As
the <hi>Athenian Codrus</hi> disrobing himselfe,<note place="margin">Plutar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and falling into the
enemies quarters in the habit of a poore man with a burthen
on his back, that he might steale a death, to make his people
conquerers, according to the <hi>Oracle,</hi> which said, that people
should overcome, whose king should be slaine in the battle. So
<hi>Christ</hi> assumed the forme of a servant, and became of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
so bare he the Crosse, that his own knew him not, but
slew the Lord of life, that in his death, who so loved us, wee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96658:25"/>
might be more then Conquerers. He was impatible in his deity,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 37.</note>
therefore he assumed an humanity which could suffer that he
might become a ransome and sacrifice for our sinnes; that the
dignitie and merit of his passion might be vallewed according
to the dignitie of the person suffering: now because the worth
of his passion was to be estimated from the united deity: there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
his temporall and short suffering, was of infinite merit, to
redeeme and free us from that which we should else have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to eternitie.</p>
            <p>2 That the suffering of <hi>Christ</hi> was neither accidentall or
casuall, nor soly in the power of man: for though there were
many actors in his sufferings, <hi>Herod, Pilat, Jewes, Gentiles, Judas</hi>
and the devill,<note place="margin">Act. 2 23.</note> yet all these did only that,<note place="margin">Act. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>which the hand and
counsaile of God determined before to be done;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> who would never
suffer evill to be done, but that his infinite wisedome can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and his goodnesse overcome evill, that he can draw good
out of it.</p>
            <p>3 This suffering of <hi>Christ</hi> for us, was fully and soly satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
to the justice of God for all our sinnes: here in his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
differed from all others: they may truly say as that happy
Convert on the crosse,<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 41.</note> 
               <hi>we are indeed righteously here:</hi> but there
was no sinne in him. No passion of man ever hath beene, or
ever can be meritorious, and propitiatory, or satisfactory for
his own sinnes, much lesse for any others: but <hi>Christs</hi> passion
was,<note place="margin">1 Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. 2.</note> and is satisfactory, and propitiatory for the sinnes of all
the elect: if all men should have suffered the torments of Hell,
for the redemption of one soule, they could never have satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gods justice for that one: but <hi>Christs</hi> once suffering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fully satisfied for all, because, it was of infinite valew and
merit.</p>
            <p>4 The end of <hi>Christs</hi> suffering was our redemption of body
and soule: for so much he redeemed as he assumed to redeeme:<note place="margin">Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 3. 16.</note>
in the creation he shewed his wisedome power, &amp; providence:
but here his justice, in that he spared not his owne sonne stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the place of our surety, and his mercy in that he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us; which is a singular comfort, when wee consider that
hee dyed not in vaine.</p>
            <p>5 The limits of <hi>Christs</hi> passion reached from his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96658:25"/>
to his resurrection: the more evident beginnings whereof
were in his life, and the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sweat water and blood: neither is it to be wondred at why
<hi>Christ</hi> was so sorrowfull herein, whereas some of his <hi>Martyrs</hi>
have rejoyced in their sufferings; for these were assured of
their sinnes remission, by the sufferings of their surety <hi>Christ;</hi>
but he felt at once the weight of all the sinnes of the elect: he
was for a time left to the extreamest sense of his fathers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the intensest torments of hell: but they in the midst
of their sufferings, had a comfortable sense of Gods gracious
presence, assuring them of their reconciliation with God, and
remission of their sinnes by <hi>Christ:</hi> now whereas we read
that he freely laid downe his life for his, and none could else

but he was therefore exempt because he had no sinne: and
againe, that he did in the bitternesse of his passion deprecate,

neither are called the holy spirit, which is a peculiar name to
the third person of the blessed <hi>Trinity.</hi>

street, his blood shall be upon his head:</hi> and in the <hi>Paschall lambe</hi>

the Church to any aliant: <hi>The Lord added to the Church dayly
such as should be saved, Act.</hi> 2. 42.</p>
            <p>7. A particular Church of any one denomination, may faile
in some points of doctrine and manners, and yet continue a
living member of the true Church if it faile not in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
and things simply necessary to salvation: for the light of
truth hath its degrees with men, and so hath saving grace its
intentions and remissions. The <hi>Moone</hi> in the waine is the same
which we sometimes see in the full. The <hi>Church of Ephesus,</hi>
lost her first love, <hi>Rev:</hi> 2. 4. The Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by false Apostles into some dangerous opinions, <hi>Gal:</hi> 1.
&amp;c. The Church of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Eliahs</hi> time had in a great part
forsaken the very covenants of God, 1. <hi>King:</hi> 19. 14. yet were
there some names left, 7000. knees which had not bent to <hi>Baal.</hi>
Now though no particular Church is exempt from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Catholike, yet a Church is not presently to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken,
by particular members thereof for some fowl blemishes,
nor many wicked men therein, though wee must knowe, that
God sometimes for such things <hi>removeth the candlesticke</hi> from
certaine places, as from those seven famous Churches of <hi>Asia.</hi>
'Tis not the place, but the Saints which make the Church.</p>
            <p>8. Faith, Hope, and Charity,<note place="margin">Cypr. l. 1. ep. 6.</note> the Gospell truly preached, &amp;
the Sacraments rightly administred, are the best markes of a
true Church.</p>

cause thee to speake ill of those who are in authority, and at

these are the common breaths which blow the chaffe out of

            <p>This communion of the Saints with the <hi>Father,</hi> is in that,

2. by <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>assumption</hi> of our persons, in a mysticall union
with him, answering to God for us, and so making us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the divine nature. 2. <hi>Pet:</hi> 1. 4. 3. The perfection hereof

glory of God, Rom:</hi> 15. 7. The first of these states relateth to the
second, and the second to the last: as nature is subordinate to
grace, and grace to glory: the first union causeth the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
we cannot have communion with him in his future glory
if we have not in his present grace; nor could wee ever have
beene united to him by grace, had not he first united himselfe
to our nature, whereby he fulfilled the law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> satisfied God's ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
for us, and so the divine <hi>unction</hi> sloweth from the head to
all the body. The <hi>holy Ghost</hi> worketh this union, by giving us
faith and sanctification. This union is the most <hi>arct,</hi> and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible:
he tooke on him our nature, into an hypostaticall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the deity: he joyneth us to his mysticall body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96658:35"/>
               <hi>Lord,</hi> is one spirit with him, 1. <hi>Cor: 6. 17. 1. Cor: 12. 13. 1. Joh:</hi> 3,
24. 1. <hi>Joh: 4. 13. Rom: 8. 11. Ephes:</hi> 4. 4. Hereby wee are really san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
in that measure which he appointeth every man to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
whereby he changeth our vile body, that it may be like
unto his own glorious body, <hi>Phil:</hi> 3. 21. and even now<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 8. 17. 18.</note> suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <hi>He</hi> becommeth wisedome, righteousnesse, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and redemption unto us. He freeth us<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
<note n="l" place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 6.</note> purgeth us from all sinne: maketh us walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his good spirit mortifying the works of the flesh.</p>
            <p>The <hi>communion</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> is a participation of his
grace, by which he<note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 8. 9. 1 Cor. 6. 11. 19.</note> uniteth us to him, regenerateth, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
teacheth,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 16.</note> leadeth, comforteth us, witnesseth with our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

for us <hi>with unutterable groanes,</hi> sealeth us up to the
day of redemption, and uniteth us one with another.</p>
            <p>3. Our <hi>communion one with another</hi> importeth. 1. an <hi>externall</hi>
communion and society of the Saints called and united in the
body of the visible Church, by the ministry of the word and
use of the Sacraments. 2. an <hi>internall</hi> conjunction, in which
those whom God hath united in an externall communion, are
also by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> united unto God, and one to another.
By which they have mutually, and joyntly. 1. The same right
to adoption and sonship in God. 2. The same interest in Christ
and all his merits. 3. The same faith and grace of justification.
4. The same right to salvation, life, and eternall glory. This
communion is either of the living with the living, or of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with the deceased Saints, present, or that which shall be in
the life to come in the <hi>Church triumphant,</hi> which shall be the
most compleat and excellent part thereof. This is the first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
which the God of unity bestoweth on his Church,
that her true members hold an happy unity in <hi>Christ,</hi> and a
sweet and comfortable fellowship one with another: for wee
being many,<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 17. 1 Cor. 12. 11, 12, &amp;c.</note>

            <argument>
               <p>Concerning Remission of Sinnes. §. 1. Of the necessitie hereof, to whom it belongeth, it is the
summe of the Gospell.
§. 2. Rules hereto appertaining.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE second benefit which God bestoweth on his <hi>Church</hi>
is <hi>remission of sinnes:</hi> which is a free pardon of all their
transgressions,<note place="margin">Sect. I.</note> so that God will never impute them, remember,
or charge them upon any of those who are justified by faith in
<hi>Christ.</hi> This is an <hi>article</hi> of great necessity, to be beleeved, for
what could communion availe us, if a free remission of our
sinnes did not acquit us of a due condemnation? Without this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96658:37"/>
what could we be but a wretched condemned society? What
ever we else beleeve concerning <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Saviour,</hi> without
this wee were no better then excluded <hi>Virgins</hi> with oyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
lamps, then <hi>Judas</hi> amongst the <hi>Apostles,</hi> sonnes of
perdition.</p>
            <p>This remission is when God forgiveth faults and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
neither imputing the one, nor executing the other: not
onely some sinnes, but all; as 'tis written,<note n="a" place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Thou wilt cast all
their sinnes into the depth of the sea.</hi> and <hi>Psal. 103. 3. Who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth
all thy iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases.</hi> 'Tis true
that sometimes the chastisement lasteth longer then the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the fault: so when the Prophet had said to <hi>David</hi>
repenting<note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord hath put away thy sinne:</hi> yet hee could
not prevaile for the life of his child, neither did the sword de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from his house:<note place="margin">v. 10.</note> but this was a fatherly correction, an
healing, not a punishment, and <hi>David</hi> confessed as much,
<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note> 
               <hi>'tis good for mee that I have beene in trouble:</hi> and it standeth
good by reason, that God remitteth all sinnes if any: for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he that breaketh any one commandement, is<note n="d" place="margin">Jam. 2. 10.</note> guilty of
all, if God retained any one sinne unremitted, the whole debt
must be charged upon the sinner. This was that which <hi>Christ</hi>
declared to <hi>Simon</hi> in the parable of the two<note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 7. 41.</note> debters, one
owed 50. the other 500. pence, and when neither had to pay
the creditor equally forgave both.</p>
            <p>2. This benefit is peculiar to the elect, the <hi>Church:</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Isai. 33. 24.</note> 
               <hi>the
people that dwell therein, shall have their iniquities forgiven:</hi> they
onely are<note n="g" place="margin">Isay 62. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the redeemed of the Lord:</hi> all others out of <hi>Christ</hi>
are in the gall of bitternesse, having no part nor fellowship
herein:<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 4. 12.</note> there is no other name under heavenby which we
can be saved:<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> he was delivered for our offences:<note n="k" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 18.</note> by
his blood we are redeemed, the <hi>Paschall lambe</hi> belongeth
onely to this house: herein however the grace of God is
given in diverse measures, remission of sinnes is<note n="l" place="margin">

bestowed on all the Saints.</p>
            <p>3. This great benefit is the summe of the Gospell,<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 1. 77.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed

               <note n="n" place="margin">Luk. 24 47. Act. 13. 38.</note> given in charge to be preached to

            </p>
            <p>To this point appertaine these <hi>rules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That we despaire not in respect of the greatnesse of our
sinnes: how great soever it be, it is farre lesse then the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
merit of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">1. Joh. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>whose blood
cleanseth us from
all sinnes:</hi> though your sinnes be as scarlet (twice dyed in
originall and actuall transgression,)<note n="q" place="margin">Esay 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>they shall be white
as snow:</hi> there were many who went out of <hi>Christs</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
very happy, some restored to sight, some to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
some to health, some dispossessed of uncleane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
some restored to life: 'twas true of him what was
said of <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Neminem tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem dimisit.</note> hee sent <hi>none away sad</hi> (the yong<note n="s" place="margin">Math. 19. 22.</note> rich

then her that heard,<note n="t" place="margin">Luk. 7. 48. 50.</note> 
               <hi>goe in peace thy sinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given

            </p>
            <p>2. Confesse and repent thee of all thy sinnes, that is, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
them and thou shalt find mercy: if thou<note n="x" place="margin">Prov. 28. 13. 1. Joh. 1. 8, 9. Jer. 2. 35.</note> hidest them
under any pretence of merit, or pleading not guilty, thou

that <hi>Peter</hi> after his fall repented:<note n="z" place="margin">Lego quod slevit, non lego quod satisfecit.</note> wee read hee wept,
wee read not that hee satisfied: repentance is no cause,
<note n="a" place="margin">Act 3. 19. Mark. 1. 15.</note> but a condition of our pardon,<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 24. 47. Luk. 13. 3. 5.</note> without which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

if God should forgive before we repent, it were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the fact rather then mercy, nor could it stand with
his justice. This repentance is 1. in<note n="e" place="margin">Lam. 3. 40.</note> knowledge of our

            </p>
            <p>3. Apply the word of God home to thy conscience that
thou maist understand thy sinne and misery comming on thee,
and be toucht at heart, as <hi>Peters</hi> hearers were, <hi>Act:</hi> 2. 37.</p>
            <p>4. Pray earnestly to God to take away the stony heart,<note n="l" place="margin">Lam. 3. 40.</note>

            <p>6. Be sure thou forgive: 'tis the<note n="o" place="margin">Math. 6. 14. 15.</note> condition of remission
of thy sinne, which Christ annexeth to thy petition for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse

our sinnes which we have at any time committed, in thought, word,

it was shewed in the Prophets vision, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 47. 2. 3. &amp;c. the dry
bones lay scattered up and downe the fields, when the power
of the <hi>Almighty</hi> breathed on them, the sinewes and flesh came

be in the resurrection of the dead. The power of God who
made us all of dust, and infused a living soule into every one

6. From the common course of <hi>nature,</hi> which is God's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
power: the seed is sowed, lyeth long under winter
clouds, except it corrupt it remaineth alone, but by a kind of
yearly death and resurrection, every seed bringing forth its
owne body; that, which without such changes, could have
lasted but few yeares, continueth to the use of man, since the
creation unto this present.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Lastly,</hi> from the consciences of the most obstinate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,
tell mee, <hi>Atheist,</hi> if there be nothing after death,
why art thou so afraid to die?</p>
            <p>Of these things we are to make these uses.</p>
            <p>1. It must teach us to be afraid to sinne,<note place="margin">Sect. III.</note> death cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
thee, thou must rise againe: <hi>Cain, Judas, Dives</hi> would
think themselves happy, if with a thousand thousand deaths,
they could but once die to live no more: it is a great part of
the reprobates torment, that he cannot die, but must be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to an eternall torment of body and soule.</p>
            <p>2 To be comforted against all pressures and calamities of
this life, persecutions, imprisonments, sicknesse, sorrow,
contempt, death: it shall not be long (be an impious, and
ingratefull world nover so malicious) before a joyfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
shall assert, and acquit thee from all these grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</p>
            <p>3. To use the deceased Saints bodies with humane and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reverence; not to handle them despicably, whom God will
once glorifie.</p>
            <p>4. To make death familiar to us by frequent meditation on
our resurrection from the dead: feare not death, seeing thou
shalt certainly rise againe: there shall be incorruption, glory,
and immortality. See <hi>Psal. 16. 9, 10. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p>5. Not<note n="z" place="margin">1. Thes. 4. 13.</note> to sorrow as men without hope for them that

was the very argument wherewith <hi>Christ</hi> (who shewed his
sympathy at <hi>Lazarus</hi> grave, weeping with the living, if not
for the dead) allayed the sorrow of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> and
comforted them in their teares—<hi>I am the resurrection, and the
life: he that believeth in mee, if he were dead, shall live</hi>—</p>

               <hi>let

Priests using those very words (as we now may) did pray effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually

holy writ; for what? Except to teach us imitation? Above all is
that sacred form, which <hi>Christ</hi> (intreated to teach his disciples
to pray) taught them and us: we have no Scripture obliging us
to conceaved prayers intimating them only to be spirituall; or
prohibiting set formes, as not spirituall: we have expresse Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
for set formes. The most spirituall prayer is that which
is so indited, and by the Spirit helping our infirmities, so utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that therein our hearts and mindes be attentive to God's
holy presence, and that which we pray, this may bee in the
heart without words uttering it, or in words conceived, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and red: for the spirit of God as well worketh in writing
as speaking: as appeareth in his dictating the Scriptures: nor
is the writing of prayer to be read, any more a restraining the

Therefore brought hee up them the King of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi>
who slew their yong men with the sword, &amp;c. See <hi>Jer. 19. 15.

deafe eare: this is an affliction, that a sinne: this a bodily infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
that a spirituall and fearefull curse: there may bee true
comfort in this, there can be none in that: The deafe man is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from the dangerous voices of railers and slatterers: and
though he be deafe to man, may listen and freely speake to

were they indeed assured that the contempt thereof refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 5.</note> our faith might not stand in the wisedome of men, but in
the power of God.</p>
            <p>5. Hearing diligently: for what knowest thou when
God will call thee effectually, comfort, and confirme thee?
<note n="h" place="margin">Joh. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Thomas</hi> was but once away from the company of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi>
and in that one neglect, he once lost, (and for ought he
knew, might finally) the oportunity of seeing <hi>Christ</hi> risen
from the dead: and therefore, till <hi>Christ</hi> in mercy came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

of it.</p>
            <p>6. Hearing with an heart desirous rather of things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable

some treacherous eares to Church, as<note n="n" place="margin">Jer. 20. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Jeremies</hi> enemies did,

then a wise hearer, a censurer then a scholler: one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to Church to teach, not to heare: nothing but curiosities
please them: but the truely thirsty are not so solicitous to
drinke in gold or <hi>Corinthian</hi> vessels, as to quench their thirst
with that which is wholsome: there are some <hi>Philoxene's,</hi> so
full of censorious acrimonie, that they had rather be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
twice to the <hi>mines,</hi> then once to forbeare their rigid cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
a prudent hearer will be advantaged both by that which
is delivered with much politure and elegancy, and that which
is roughly: even the speakers errours shall adde to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
the ancient <hi>Heathens</hi> woont to place the <hi>Graces</hi> by the
statue of <hi>Mercury,</hi> to signify with what candor, auditors ought
to passe by some slips of speakers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rules of practice</hi> are either 1. <hi>before. 2. in.</hi> 3. or <hi>after</hi>
hearing the word.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Before</hi> thou commest into the house of God.</p>
            <p>1.<note n="o" place="margin">Eccles. 5.</note> Looke to thy foot, whether thou stand right
before God by a<note n="p" place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> through examination of thy state, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou art in the faith: repent thee of all thy sins,<note n="q" place="margin">Jer. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>breake
up your fallow ground and sow not among thornes:</hi> without
this what hope can we receive of any fruit? One maine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why we doe often heare, and so litle profit, is the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of this duty; how can wee hope that Gods word will
doe us good, when we continue in impenitency and resolution
to sinne.</p>
            <p>2. Pray God for a blessing, that he would assist the
speaker with an enlarged heart, faithfull memory, a doore of
utterance, and that evidence of his spirit, which may make his
ministry powerfull to convert and comfort.<note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 11.</note> If <hi>Paul</hi> had

            <p>3. This Sacrament is called the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> because<note n="c" place="margin">Math 26. 26. 1 Cor. 11. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Christ</hi>

from insidells, and a parting token and pledge of his love assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the faithfull of his continuall love toward them.</p>
            <p>4. The visible signes herein, are<note n="h" place="margin">Math 26. 26. 1 Cor 11. 24, 25.</note>

            <p>1.<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 28.</note> Examine thy self before thou presume to come, whether
thou do understand the institution, meaning and end of this
Sacrament, and if not, learne of them that are able to instruct
thee herein.</p>
            <p>2. Examine whether thou hast true faith assuring thee, that
<hi>Christ dyed for thee;</hi> and with his eye of mercy and omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in his passion, as well looked on thee as those believers,
who stood by his crosse: then, though thy faith be weake, if
thou hunger and thirst for righteousnesse, come to this table
that thou maist be strengthened: The woman was cured,
who said in her heart<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 9. 21.</note> 
               <hi>If I may but touch the hem of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
if thou beleeve, in touching and tasting these signes and
seales which he hath appointed to derive vertue to thy soule,
thou shalt be healed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:96658:62"/>
3. Examine whether<note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Christ</hi> dwell in thee by his holy
spirit, daily mortifying thy corrupt affections, and quickning
thee to the life of grace, which will shew it selfe in sanctified
desires, thoughts, words and actions: at lest in sincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the heart, and some ability to keep Gods holy lawes
without any the least purpose to yeeld indulgence to the
breach of any of them. The soule cannot be in the body but it
shall be discovered by some acts of life and motion: the being
of the<note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 11.</note>

how much more shall the presence of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Examine whether thou do heartily repent thee of every
sinne which thou hast committed: if so then though remorse
of conscience create thee feares and doubtings; come to the
Lords table who<note n="e" place="margin">Math. 11. 28.</note> inviteth the heavy laden, to comfort
them:<note n="f" place="margin">Joh. 3.</note> the brazen serpent was a type of <hi>Christ,</hi> that had
the forme of a serpent without venome, and <hi>Christ</hi> the
<note n="g" place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note> forme and nature of man,<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 4. 15. 1 Pet. 2. 22.</note> without sinne: he that
was stung with fiery serpents,<note n="i" place="margin">Num. 21. 9.</note> by looking up to the brazen
serpent, was presently cured: and he that is bitten with hels
fiery serpents (all other wayes uncurable) by looking upon
<hi>Christ</hi> with the eye of faith, shall be saved: therefore in case
thou find any stupid impenitencie in thy stony heart, be thou
the more attentive in hearing the word, and more serious in
applying it to thy conscience, more fervent in prayer, and
more frequent in receiving this holy Sacrament, thou shalt at
last find an happy effect hereof.</p>
            <p>5. Examine whether thou be in charity with all men: as he
that presumed to offer with any other fire then that which
came from heaven, was cut off from <hi>Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

those who offer this spirituall sacrifice in malice: if hee that
touched the <hi>Arke</hi> with unconsecrated hands, was smitten dead,
what shall become of them who dare come to the <hi>Lords</hi> table
with bloody hands, and malicious hearts? if thou be not in
charity,<note n="k" place="margin">Math. 5. 24<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <hi>leave thy gift before the altar go first and be recen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</hi>
neither maist thou thinke thy selfe excused from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
by thy malice: God biddeth thee be reconciled
and then come and offer: neither maist thou thinke to lay
downe thy malice (as they speake of the serpent, while she
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96658:63"/>
drinketh) for a time only, to resume it againe: in a wilfull
abstinence, there is a contempt of the Sacrament which shall
condemne a man: and in comming to <hi>Christ</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 12. 19. 1 Cor. 5. 7. 8.</note> our <hi>Passeover</hi>
with the <hi>leven of maliciousnesse,</hi> is the same danger: there is
no safe way, but in reconciliation, that thou maist receive
worthily.</p>
            <p>2. The second point is, how we must receive? we must do
it with hearts lifted up to God in holy meditations of <hi>Christ's</hi>
passion, frequent ejaculations imploring Gods gracious assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
obsignation and sealing up of our salvation, with hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
thoughts, minds sequestred from all worldly things,
and the most attentive and holy reverence of soule and body:
for so ought wee to appeare before God in his worship <hi>Psal.

<hi>Christ</hi> are here offered and held out to us, by the hand and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance

5. God appointed the observation of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reasons.</p>
            <p>1. That it might be a day for Gods publike service, as
it was and is observed, that men might come together to heare
the Law, pray, receave the holy Sacraments, &amp;c. <hi>Luk: 4. 16.
Act: 20. 7. 1. Cor:</hi> 16. 2.</p>
            <p>2. To keepe in memory the work of creation. <hi>Exod:
20. 10,</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>3. In the giving of the law was added that which
concerned <hi>Israels</hi> deliverance from their <hi>Egyptian</hi> servitude
(a type of our freedome from the bondage of sinne and Satan)
<hi>remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt—therefore
the Lord thy God commanded thee to keepe this Sabbath day.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 14, 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>4. That it might be a signe betweene God and his
people, that they might knowe that he is the <hi>Lord</hi> that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
them; and a signe of the eternall rest in the life to come,<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 13.</note>
as it is said,<note place="margin">Hebr. 4. 9.</note> 
               <hi>there remaineth therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Sabbath keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>
to the people of God.</p>
            <p>5. To move masters to be just and equall to their
servants and beasts in remembrance of their owne condition:
on the seventh day thou shalt rest, <hi>that thy Ox and thy Asse
may rest, and the sonne of thy hand-maid, and the stranger may bee
refreshed, Exod: 23. 12. that thy man-servant and thy maid-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
may rest as well as thou,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>and remember that thou wast a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
in the land of Egypt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. That God and his lawes may be remembered, that
in case, any forgetfulnesse of him should fall on man (most apt
to <hi>forget God)</hi> the very solemnity of the day might remember
him.</p>
            <p>6. Sanctification of the Sabbath, on Gods part, was his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
to keepe it holy; on mans, the setting it apart from
common use and ordinary workes, to spend it in holy exercises
according to God's commandement: profanation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
was, and is, by doing those workes which God prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be done on that day, as servile workes, or on any day, as
sinne, or any thing hindering his workship on that day to bee
performed, as humane, servile, or ordinary workes of ourcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings:
all workes are not prohibited on the Sabbath, the <hi>Preists</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:96658:67"/>
by the law did sacrifice thereon; this as other like were divine,
or such as appertained to the sanctification of the Sabbath; so
are <hi>meditation</hi> on Gods workes, wisedome, power, benificence,
providence, &amp;c. <hi>hearing, reading, preaching, praying, administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and receaving the sacraments, workes of mercy and necessity, &amp;c</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. This Sabbath so farre as it was <hi>ceremoniall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. II.</note> was changed
for the full and true morall part thereof to bee performed on
the <hi>Lords</hi> day, which is a <hi>Christians sabbath,</hi> or holy rest, for &amp;
to the publike service of God, still religiously to be kept; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
1. It is the <hi>Key of religion</hi> and that which being duely
observed enableth us to the performance of all the rest; for
therein we are to learne our duty to God and man.</p>
            <p>2. This law God twice wrote with his owne hand in
tables of stone, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>itate the perpetuity thereof, as farre as it
is morall.</p>
            <p>3. If there were no fixed time for the publike service
of God; how should men agree to meet therein? One would
have a farme, another Oxen, or some other secular businesse to
distract them one from another. Moreover if there were no
fixed day, 'tis much to bee feared, the men of this world, for
their present emoluments, would often adjourne Gods service,
as <hi>Felix</hi> did <hi>Pauls</hi> discourse of righteous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esse, temperance and
future judgement, with a, <hi>goe thy way for this time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 24. 25.</note> 
               <hi>and when I
have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The same reasons for the keeping holy a Sabbath,
remaine to <hi>Christians,</hi> which for substance, God gave for the
performance thereof before the Gospell; we, and our servants
have need of rest, need to remember God, to learne his will, to
pray and joyne in his publike worship.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Christ</hi> came not to repeale or dissolve the morall
law in any one <hi>jot</hi> or title,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> nor indeed is it changeable or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable,
nor may any part of Gods worship therein comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
be taken away, though we are not now to keep so rigid a
rest as was ceremoniall to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 35. 3.</note> to remember them of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
peculiar to them in their minority and subjection to
those ceremonies which were their schoolemaster to <hi>Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>6. The <hi>Church of Christ</hi> hath constantly,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 6.</note> since the
<hi>Apostles</hi> time kept this day which we now celebrate as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Galat. 3. 24.</note>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:96658:68"/>
rest: to conclude, it is the worlds birth day, wherein it first
saw light; the <hi>Queene</hi> of daies: the <hi>praeludium</hi> of the Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
<hi>Math:</hi>

of God, <hi>Heb:</hi> 4. 9.</p>
            <p>2. For the better understanding of these things, wee must
first consider,<note place="margin">Justyn. Martyr. Apol. 2.</note> that though we read no particular precept for
the transposition of the Sabbath from the seventh to that
which we now celebrate (which is the first of the weeke,<note place="margin">Orig. hom. 7. Sup. Exod. 1. Aug. epist. 86. 118, 119. c. 13. &amp; de temp. ser. 251. &amp; ib. 154.</note> 
               <hi>Mat:
28. 1. Mark; 16. 1. 2. 6. Luk: 24. 1. 3. Joh: 20. 1. 1 Cor: 16. 2. Rev: 1.
10.)</hi> yet is it most likely, that <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Lord of the Sabbath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ignat. ad Mag. vocat—<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c.</note>
prescribed the change, and that, as hee was with <hi>Moses</hi> forty
daies in the mount, to teach him the law and government of
the Church under the same, (not leaving his people to any, the
least point of will-worship and voluntary religion, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in his strict limiting them to the patterne shewed <hi>Moses</hi>
to the very <hi>snu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ers, ashpans, basons, and pinnes</hi> of the sanctuary)
so also when he was before his ascension forty daies with his
disciples, teaching them what to preach, and how to governe
the <hi>Church,</hi> though hee would not againe relade and burden
them with antiquated <hi>ceremonies,</hi> as <hi>touch not, tast not, handle
not,</hi> yet neither would he leave them to any will-worship, but
prescribe them what they should doe concerning so maine a
point as the <hi>transposition</hi> and change of the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> neither
needed he otherwise to confirme a law naturall and morall,
then by shewing himselfe <hi>Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> by taking that
away from it which was ceremoniall, and transporting it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
day: so that as from <hi>Christs</hi> own appointment of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
it was called the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> so also from his owne
appointment, this which we now keepe <hi>Sabbath,</hi> was called the
<hi>Lords day.</hi> For who may presume to appoint such a thing but
the <hi>Lord of the Sabbath?</hi> Or who may call any thing the <hi>Lords;</hi>
or ordaine any thing in his holy worship, which his selfe hath
not appointed? And it is worthy our noting, that <hi>Paul</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
collections for the poore on that day, 1. <hi>Cor: 16. 1, 2. saith
also, 1 Cor: 11. 23. 1 Cor:</hi> 15. 3. that he delivered them that only,
which he had received of the Lord: and that there speaking of
that day, he spake as of a thing then in use and custome (for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96658:68"/>
holy conventions, preaching, praying, receaving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
among <hi>Christians.</hi> See <hi>Act:</hi> 20. 7.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23. 34. et 14. 36. 37 Tit. 1. 5.</note> so that <hi>Christ</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and instructed them, and they only ordered the <hi>Churches</hi>
accordingly:<note place="margin">Act. 15. 6. 24.</note> without all dispute, it is sufficient for us to bee
followers of the <hi>Apostles</hi> as they were of <hi>Christ,</hi> considering
that they were assisted by an infallibility of spirit in these
things.</p>
            <p>Secondly we must consider why Christ changed it, which
was because</p>
            <p>1. The ceremoniall part thereof was changable by
the <hi>Lord of the Sabbath;</hi> he tooke it not away because the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
is indispensable and unchangable, as having it's ground in
the law of <hi>nature,</hi> not withstanding that which some obiect to
the contrary,<note place="margin">Genes. 2. 2.</note> that there is no principle thereof leading a meere
naturall man to the observation of a <hi>seventh day sabbath</hi> for</p>
            <p>1. In the very creation God sanctified the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and
hallawed it by his owne rest thereon,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> as afterward by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steining
to give them <hi>Manna</hi> on that day:<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> and before <hi>Moses</hi>
received the law on <hi>Sina</hi> written on tables of stone,<note place="margin">Exod. 31.</note> he said
unto the people,<note place="margin">Deut. 9. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>Exod:</hi> 16. 29.—The Lord hath given you the
Sabbath.</p>
            <p>2. The naturall mans principles before the fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
after the fall in the state of corruption, differ in many things
and degrees, as light and darknesse. The naturall man in this
<hi>existence</hi> neither <hi>doth receive,</hi> nor <hi>can knowe</hi> the things of Gods
spirit: so that he wanteth illumination, and consequently the
use of diverse principles necessary to lead and guide him in
the way of sanctity,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> which in his pure <hi>essence</hi> and state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
he had as a compleate and perfect law of <hi>nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The darknesse of minde which fell on man by sin,
was so generall that it left him only some such obscure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of a <hi>Deity</hi> to be worshipped, and a conscience which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
rather to check their failings therein, then to enforme
them: as that it left them without all excuse: thus they that
had not the written law,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14.</note> were a law to themselves: the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
among them acknowledging that there was no nation so
immane, and barbarous, but it beleeved there was a <hi>God,</hi> yet
condemning their own ignorance, as much in the manner of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96658:69"/>
his worship, as their apprehension of him: knowing like blinde
men out of the way,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 37.</note> that they erred, <hi>they groaped after him,</hi> but
could not finde the way to him, nor understand how they
ought to serve him: which when they attempted by idol-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and the vaine forgeries of mans inventions, they knewe it
was but the foolish and frivolous dreames of selfe-beguil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng
authors, and the blind assent of a seduced multitude (the great
and tyrannicall <hi>mistresse of errous)</hi> which swaied them.</p>
            <p>4. That remainder of the law of <hi>natures</hi> light after
mans fall was such, as rather, or more immediatly concerned
the preservation of the naturall man in this present life, then
for the compleat instruction of the spirituall, for eternall life;
and so to be reckoned among those common gifts of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
equally on elect and reprobates: of this kinde was the
admirable prudence, temperance, equity, constancy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idelity
of some meere heathens: wherein the conscience had these
principles that intemperance, injury, murder, theft, perjury, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
stealing, rapine, adultery, false testimony, &amp;c. were odious
crimes: for all these and the like were<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> immediatly serving to
the preservation of humane society, which the God of order,
and omnipotent parent of this universe will conserve unto the
end of time: therefore causeth he his sunne to shine and his
raine to fall indifferently on the just and unjust: and therefore
these principles of the <hi>Law of nature</hi> were left more undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
cleere,<note place="margin">Matt. 5.</note> and lesse obscured and obliterated, on the tables of
mans heart in his fall, then those which more immediatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the worship of God in the first table of the morall law,
and the spirituall mans relation thereto: God constantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
in his unsearchable wisdome and justice, to preserve
the life of nature respectively to all men, for the appointed

precept thereof, then that the light of the eye is not naturall
to a man accidentally blinde, and so having no sight to direct
him in the way he should walke in: Man had in his state of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
a sufficient knowledge of the whole law of God, and
therefore as that principle which led him to the true worship
of one onely God; so also to the keeping of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which
is a part thereof; because all the morall law and every precept
thereof, hath its ground in the law of nature uncorrupted,
cleerly appearing, though in the corrupt state, it be obscure, &amp;
in some branches thereof more, in some lesse obliterated; and
the written morall law is indeed no more then a repetition &amp;
second writing,<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 1.</note> or supply thereof, figured in God's <hi>duplicate</hi> &amp;
writing againe the same lawes on the second tables,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 19.</note> after the

            <p>5. The fourth commandement in the morality (that
is sanctification of a seventh day <hi>Sabbath)</hi> is a law of nature as
having its ground therein, and therefore bindeth all men, of all
times and ages; and conditions, to the end of time, as well as
those lawes which say, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother, thou
shalt not kill, commit adultery, or steale:</hi> but that which was cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
therein, (as the observation of a seventh from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation)
was positive, and therefore alterable: it being the nature
of a positive law, to binde either certaine persons only (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
and <hi>Eve</hi> by the precept of not eating the forbidden fruit)
or to a certaine time, as the <hi>ceremoniall</hi> law bound <hi>Israel</hi> untill
the fulfilling of all by <hi>Christ;</hi> and as all before, and under the
law, were bound to observe the seventh day <hi>Sabbath</hi> from the
<hi>creation,</hi> untill it should be changed for the <hi>Lords day,</hi> in whose
power the alteration thereof was, as he was the <hi>creator, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and <hi>sanctifier</hi> of the first <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and was, and is the <hi>Lord</hi>
of the same now changed for that which wee celebrate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his resurrection.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Christ</hi> changed the day to remember us of his resting
from all the workes of his humiliation in his resurrection, the
creation of a new spirituall world,<note place="margin">Isay 65. 17.</note> as it were new heavens and

            </p>
            <p>Concerning the first, these rules are necessary</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 1. Doe not overtoile, travell, or overwatch thy selfe or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,

or praying.</p>
            <p>2. So consider it before it come, that thou maist be sure to
set apart all businesses and distractions which might hinder the
performance of thy duty.</p>
            <p>3. Rise up so early that thou want no convenience to fit
thy selfe for Gods publike and private worship, which when
men do not, they come both unprepared to Church, &amp; neglect
their private duty for preparation, which often rendreth the
publike unfruitfull: this discovereth an admirable hypocrisie in
men, who will to rise that they may have time, to wash &amp; dresse

            <p>4. Renew thy repentance before thou come to heare the
law of Go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lest thou appeare there like the ghest without the

lest the seed of Gods word fall unprofitably among thornes,

               </gap>avour of death unto thee.</p>
            <p>5. Consider the sanctity of God, into whose presence thou
art entring, as <hi>Moses</hi> into the clowd to heare his voice wherein
are the issues of life and death, remember that the time is holy
by Gods owne institution: that the place is consecrated and
set apart for Gods publike worship, and let that come into thy
minde which God said unto <hi>Moses</hi> approaching towards him,
<hi>loose thy shooes from thy feet: for the place thou standest on is holy
ground:</hi> to thy selfe thus appliable, <hi>put off all thy carnall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
resigne thy selfe body &amp; soule, unto the guidance of Gods

            <p>6. Pray privatly, that God would forgive thee thy sinnes,
give thee such a measure of his spirit to enable thee to serve
him, as may make thee therein acceptable to him, blesse his
owne ordinance unto thee, sanctify thee body and soule to his
service, that thou maist sanctify his <hi>Sabbath,</hi> with that <hi>zeale,
care,</hi> and <hi>fervency of spirit,</hi> which may please him: that hee
would assist the <hi>Ministers</hi> of his word, and thy selfe, and the
whole congregation, so that the word may profit you, to the
amendment of life, and building you up to the assurance of
salvation in <hi>Christ.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>In the Sabbath</hi> if thou wilt performe thy duty well, thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
must</p>
            <p>1. Begin with delight in it and all the service of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to be performed: this was God's condition of prospering
<hi>Israel</hi> that they should call the <hi>Sabbath a delight:</hi> the carnall
man for feare of humane law or censure, resteth from his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
workes, goeth to Church, joyneth with the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the time long, because he delighteth not in the <hi>Lord</hi> and his
<hi>Sabbath:</hi> but he that through delight therein, keepeth it not as
in help to sanctification; keepeth it no better then a beast.</p>
            <p>2. Glorifie God therein: In hearing, praying, receiving the
holy Sacrament, singing praises, &amp;c. thou shalt honour him, <hi>not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96658:71"/>
doing thine owne waies</hi> (any servile worke.) Those things may
be done which are subordinate to the sanctification of a <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi>
as the <hi>Priests</hi> laboured in sacrificing,<note place="margin">Isay 58. 13.</note> the <hi>Ministers</hi> now
doe in preaching and officiating, without breach of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
Workes of necessitie or mercy, to man or beast are to
be done: the <hi>Ox</hi> fallen into a pit must be releived: <hi>the Physitian,</hi>
Apothecary, Chirurgion, or others in case of necessitie, may
and must respectively helpe, though it be the ordinary worke
of their calling, because it is a worke of mercy: so to doe is to
honour God: as on the contrary it were to his dishonour, as
if his law bound any man from doing all the good hee can, or
shewing mercy to the distressed; whereas indeed he is a God
of mercy, &amp; loveth the same in all those who beare his image:
but thou must not for gaine doe that which might equally be
omitted; as bargaining, bearing burdens, or other servile worke,
or labour of thy calling, or travelling, except in case of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or subordination to a <hi>Sabbath</hi> dayes workes: it is certainly
an ingratefull sacriledge to rob God of his owne daies service,
appointed for no necessitie of his, but only for our own good
and salvation, and to entrench on that which he hath reserved
to himselfe, whereas he hath allowed men six daies to doe their
workes, and take their lawfull delights therein: Therefore hee
saith, as we must not on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> doe our own waies, so
must not we finde <hi>our owne pleasures, nor speake our owne words:</hi>
it is an hatefull robbery of God to use pastimes on that day,
though lawfull on others: much worse those which are never
lawfull, whereby the Devill is more served on that day, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other. The many fearefull judgements of God on offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
herein (and that which usually befalleth them, in that
God seldome prospereth the most probable industries of such)
is enough to deter all considering men from profanation of
the <hi>Lords day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Doe what good thou canst; to thy selfe in that
which concerneth thy soule or thy body, health and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in case of necessitie; or to others in the like; at conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times, when the publike or private worship of God require
not thy attendance: walke in the fields, or gardens, that thou
maist contemplate on Gods creatures, and his benificence,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96658:71"/>
power, providence and wisedome therein: visit the sick and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned,
if thou have ability and convenience of releiving or
comforting them.</p>
            <p>4. Absteine from immoderate drinking, feeding, slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and whatsoever else may render thee lesse apt for the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
of this day.</p>
            <p>5. As all thy life thou must rest from sinne, so speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
on this day, wherein the very sanctity of the time violated
doubleth the offences committed there, when God specially
requireth the sanctimony, and endeavours to learne his will;
and doe not thinke it enough to rest from labour; as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
not in an inactive contemplation, and as the glorified
Saints in the life to come in their rest aud refreshing, shall yet
continually sing their <hi>Halleluiahs,</hi> and doe those things which
shall be to the eternall glory of God in them, so doe thou now
compose thy selfe to have thy present conversation in heaven,
and to begin thy rest and <hi>Sabbath</hi> here, which shall never end.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is ended; if thou canst, write down some
principall heads for directions or of comforts heard that day,
and by often perusing them, commit all to memory. However
repeat to thy selfe, if single; or with thy family, the summes of
that thou hast heard: praise God for the same; sing Psalmes:
meditate of the eternall rest, whereof this is a type: frame thy
whole life for the attaining thereto: beg pardon of God for
thy severall failings and defects: and pray for the assistance of
his good spirit, and that his ordinance may be powerfull in
thee and thine, to life eternall.</p>

               </note> Love is a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
affection and desire to enjoy that which is good: it is <hi>a
dilection,</hi> because we doe in a free choice discerne what to
love. loves limits are ample, when it hath a fiinite object;
when 'tis towards God, it hath no bounds, save only in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which can but finitely love an infinite, though with all the
soule, and all the might. Love is subjectively in some desire,
objectively in some good (or that which seemeth such) so that
their varieties, cause as many varieties of love: love of God the
supreame good, is incomparably the best: love of that which
God loveth is next, and next that which beareth his image: so
love we our selves, and men and Angells, we love men, either as
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96658:74"/>
we receive good from them, or doe good to them: the first our
language calleth <hi>Love,</hi> the second <hi>Charity:</hi> that hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
amiable and desirable for it object, this something mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and to be pittied or releived.</p>
            <p>2. Love to God, is a vertue wherein the reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
adhereth and is united to, delighteth and resteth in God
as his cheife good: And it is considerable. 1. As <hi>naturall;</hi> such
as was in <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, for without it, he could not
have had Gods image on him.
2. As <hi>infused</hi> in our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is a repaire of Gods image, decayed in us by sinne:

can any man wisely and truely love himselfe any otherwise
then for God's sake: not <hi>wisely;</hi> for 'twere folly for a man to
set his affections at any lower levell then true happinesse,
which can never be in any thing humane or temporall; but it
is to be found and attained onely in God, and our union with
him: to love our selves for beauty, strength, honour, riches, ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
or present life, is to beguile our soules with vaine dreams:
happinesse can be in nothing which can change for worse, or
must unavoidably end: nor can we <hi>truely</hi> love our selves for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

taken: the sinner hateth and destroyeth his own soule,<note n="r" place="margin">See Isay. 3. 9.</note> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe more harme therein, then the devill and all the
powers of hell could otherwaies doe him: for as they cannot
make him sinne against his will, so neither can they make him
truely unhappy without his consent to sinne. Neither is it tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to love our selves, to prouide momentany pleasures, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiling
shewes of happinesse with the losse of the eternall and
true: the gaine of a world cannot compensate the losse of a
soule: nor doth he truly love himselfe who betrayeth himselfe
herein, loving short and evill pleasures, more then the chiefe
good, eternall happinesse, and salvation of his own soule.</p>

so is our love to God.</p>
            <p>6. Love of God shall remaine, and be perfect in the life to
come: when riches, honours, pleasures, deare friends; nay whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
those excellent gifts of learning and prophesie shall leave us,
when faith shall end in enjoying, this one treasure shall be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
and encrease to eternity.</p>
            <p>7. As he that hateth God, is herein more excusable then all
other sinners, because hate of God is more apparently impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
then failing in attaining it, or falling from it by infirmity
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96658:75"/>
(for here may be a will to doe good, but there cannot) so also
herein, that having but one extreame to fall into, the malitious
will fall there: all other sinnes may be in excesse, and in defect;
because every other vertue, this <hi>love</hi> excepted, hath two ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
sisters: as <hi>valour</hi> hath in excesse, <hi>temerity,</hi> and in defect
<hi>timidity; justice</hi> hath on the right hand, too much <hi>severity,</hi> on
the left, too much <hi>mildnesse</hi> and <hi>indulgence</hi> to sinne: so is it in
the rest: only this most amiable vertue hath nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to oppose it: no creature can love God too much, because
none can love him enough, or infinitely. This also aggravateth
the sinne, that there can be no cause in God of any hatred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, because the only chiefe and true good cannot bee
the proper object of hatred: nor could the most wicked hate
him, but that they have sins which his justice must punish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is good; and they have set up their impious desires &amp;
lusts, after pleasures and reveuge in his place; and therefore
hate all that oppose them: so is the<note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> 
               <hi>wisdome of the flesh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

servile feare of God's presence, fleeing from him (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
would have done) audacious liberty of sinning &amp;c, yet are
there degrees herein: the formall hypocrite doth not profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly,
and out of destinate malice, hate God, nor truely love
him: he professeth love, but preferreth the world before God:

            <p>The common <hi>obstructions</hi> and <hi>lets</hi> to the love of God are.</p>

revealing thy selfe, and the inestimable riches of thy mercy to mee,
made me knowe what I had to love in thee: neither didst thou finde
in me any thing worthy of thee, but the effects of thine owne love,
which in my election before I was, determined to make me an object
of thy mercy; therefore thou who art <hi>Love,</hi> didst set thine own image
on me: thou best knowest, that I am of my selfe but worthlesse dust
and earth, and by my sinnes a masse of corruption, such as onely can
displease thee, and deserve thine anger; but <hi>O Lord</hi> God of mercy,
who foundest me a child of wrath, and madest me a sonne; an enemy,
and reconciledst me by the death of thy holy sonne <hi>Jesus,</hi> accomplish
the worke of thine owne mercy in me, and love me still, give mee an
heart to love thee so, above all, with all my soule, minde, and might:
love that which thou hast wrought in my heart, cherish thine owne
graces in me: though my love be full of imperfections, yet thy worke
is perfect: in thee is no shadow of change, Lord for thine owne loves
sake, now make me such as thou maist love me to eternitie through
the merits of thy sonne <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> my <hi>Lord</hi> and blessed <hi>Saviour.</hi>

who count that friendship which denieth nothing; and that he
is no true freind who will not (like <hi>Achates,</hi> or <hi>Theseus</hi> in the

true friend who in selfe-love holds a secret distance, and hath
his reservations against this law of friendship; as, not onely in
case of this worlds goods (which if we communicate not with
them that want,<note n="m" place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 17.</note> we love not God, and therefore can be no
true friends to men) but even in life it selfe, which we must, if
need be, lay downe for the brethren; this is to be understood
where it is justly desired in either: that is, where thou maist
part with life or goods for a greater good, such as is the glory
of God, or the salvation of soules: there are sundry cases,
wherein neither of these are justly desired or granted: a friend
requireth thee to venture thy life in a duell, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of that which he falsely calleth his honour; that is not
better then thy life, therefore not justly required. An acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
desireth thee to engage thy selfe and thy liberty, for his:
(except some other circumstance conclude it) the law of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
bindeth thee not, where thou canst not more advantage
thy friend, then hurt thy selfe. Againe it may be thou art not

            <p>3. Lastly, that we may make a right use of enemies (which
is to better our selves by their exercising our patience, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to God) we must observe these rules following.</p>
            <p>1. If thou love thy selfe entertaine no malice in thy
heart under any pretence: a loathsome <hi>toad-cage,</hi> is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
better then a malitious heart; where likely not <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi>
seven devills but whole <hi>legions</hi> quarter: the most ougly
<hi>serpents,</hi> whom all hate and wish destroyed, are, in their kinde,
good, and so, better then a malitious hater of his own flesh.</p>
            <p>2. Love thine enemies nature, and person whose
faults thou must hate: our anger and censure must go between
these: so <hi>David</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Psal. 139. 21.</note> hated the haters of God; 'tis the precept;
<note n="z" place="margin">Amos 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>hate the evill,</hi> and <hi>love the good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Be just toward thine enemie: charge no more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him then that of which he is truely and certainly guilty:
and be thou modest not saying the worst; least thy censure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lect
upon thy selfe, who art guilty of many sinnes, if not the
same thou blamest in another: consider whether that which
were but just for thine enemy to heare, will become thee to
speake: and<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> beware, least for thy uncharitable and rigid

certainly knowne to thee; is a breach of the same law which
saith, <hi>there shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not beare false witnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Looke equally on thine enemies vertues as on his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96658:92"/>
vices: be not like the troublesome flies which are commonly
setling on the soares, passing over the sound parts, malice hath
false eyes ever lessening other mens merits, and multiplying
their faults, which is the reason why the malitious ever judge
them evill whom they hate; as impious <hi>Ahab</hi> confessed in

            <p>5. Let not thy heart rejoyce in thyne enemies evill:
it is but a vaine pretence to charity, if thou canst bee glad for
any evill befalling thine enemie: 'tis certaine thou canst not
be hid from God.</p>
            <p>6. Be thou neither foolish nor ignoble in thy desire
of revenge; as they are who hurt themselves, rather then spare
their enemie; as indeed all doe, who affect revenge (hereby
taking their cause out of Gods hand) who would justly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
it for them: so doe they who disclose secrets entrusted to
them with in the verge of former freindship; and they who
by any other base office serve their own malice.</p>
            <p>7. Make no man thine enemie whom thou canst

            <p>8. Strive to overcome thine enemie with goodnesse:

               <hi>Alexander</hi> to king

to emulate the vertues of a noble enemy: and nobly to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the charges of the base: which may best be done by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the whole contention on this issue, who shall be more
holy and vertuous? It is the most divine victory to overcome
malice with love and mercy: The beast may overcome with
strength the serpent with subtiltie, the devill with revenge and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96658:93"/>
malice; but vertue is the Saints victory: malice is the mother
of witchcrafts, and nurse of male<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ices; but clemency and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is the shame and confusion of an ignoble enemie; the envy
or emulation of the truly noble, more foiling him then policy
or violence could doe: the holy may be over-matcht, and dy.
Yet are they not properly overcome, who by dying become
more honourable and happy, then those by whom they suffer.
He that is excelled in vertue (as was noted of some of <hi>Caesars</hi>
enemies) must yeeld, faist thou, he is wicked, hath offended me,
I shall not only invite new injuries by bearing the old, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in my reputation, as if I durst not revenge when I might?
Yet first consider thy selfe in how many things, and how often
hast thou offended God: what doth <hi>Christ</hi> daily forgive thee,
or thou must perish: not to say how vaine and worthlesse that
reputation is which is built upon the opinion of the unwise &amp;
wicked, doe but consider that wise men looke most to the end
that they have rightly proposed to themselves, which if they
attaine, their worke is done; whether by force or counsell they
passe not; they looke to the end through just meanes. Suppose
thine end is to overcome thine enemie: if thou mightest make
free choice of the meanes; tell me, wouldst thou overcome
him by good, or evill, by vertue, or violence, by excelling him
in goodnesse, or equalling him in evill? 'Tis an <hi>epidemick</hi> mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to thinke there is no victory but in violence, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
evill with evill, becomming as damnable as their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>9. Lastly, resolve that every injurie shall better thee,
doth thine enemie hurt thee? Let it occasion thee to pray for
him; aud to enter into a serious examination of thine owne
heart, whether thou hast not injured him, or some other, upon
discovery of injury done by thee, repent, and give <hi>satisfaction,</hi>
that God may give thee thy <hi>quietus est;</hi> so will hee in his good

we humbly pray thee to pardon us, for <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> his sake: give
us hearts to repent before the consummation of thy feirce wrath, &amp;
the day of thine anger come upon us; to agree with our adversary
quickly, while we are yet in the way: to seeke righteousnesse, that
we may be hid in the day of thine anger: Lord our hope is in thee,
make us not a reproach to them that hate us; withold not thy tender
mercy from us, let thy loving kindnesse and thy truth preserve us:
Thou who art the God of love and unity, set thine own image again
upon us: and as thou hast loved &amp; redeemed us, in the son of thy love
<hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> so give us hearts to love one another, that thereby all
men may knowe that we are his Disciples. <hi>Lord</hi> deliver us not to

wherein we have any waies injured or justly offended our brethren:

saved. Prevent and divert their malice, that it may not proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the heart is smitten with some aufull feare of God; and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

of <hi>Satan</hi> is to suggest selfe-delusions, as he doth temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to sinne, whereby his baits may be swallowed: his policy

that which is incomparably better then all the world; and of
thy minde, which (if well composed) admirably maketh good,

known causes, and occasions only: so is it not unadvised.
Thirdly, it goeth (like that <hi>burning lamp</hi> between the pieces

how much lesse will the all-seeing God permit the envious

reason thou shouldst pity him, because his sinne makes him

how evill must thou be, who caunt envy the happinesse of any

hurtfull onely to the envious, as I have noted.</p>
            <p>For Antidotes against this venome:</p>
            <p>1. Put on <hi>Christ,</hi> and be sure thou shalt put off envy: it

               <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 13. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Let us walke honestly as in the day—not in

not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof:</hi> put on <hi>Christ</hi>

by an holy imitation of him: hee<note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> was meek and lowly
in heart, and therefore envied no man; (the meek<note n="n" place="margin">Num. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
was so free from ambition and pride, that hee reproved
those that envied for his sake, and wisht that all God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
could prophesie, and that the Lord would <hi>put his Spirit
upon them) Christ</hi> loved all respectively: love<note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 4.</note> envieth not.
If we love for God's sake, we shall never be grieved for any
blessings, which he bestoweth, but wish them greater; we
shall neither undervalue others, nor over-rate our selves, as
the envious doe.</p>
            <p>2. Learne in God's schoole; there's the best cure of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy:
it was a thing which troubled <hi>David</hi> to understand it,
<note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 73. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Vntill</hi> (saith he) <hi>I went into the Sanctuary of God.</hi> Here thou
art taught not to value secular things too much; to consider
his hand which setteth up and pulleth downe; to referre all
thy desires to the advance of his glory: to acknowledge the
favours which he hath conferred on thee by <hi>Christ,</hi> better
then a thousand worlds; which thoughts can leave no place
for envy.</p>
            <p>3. Consider the end of those thou enviest: <hi>David</hi> found
in the Sanctuary that his enemies were not to be envied:
<hi>Surely</hi> (said he)<note n="q" place="margin">Psal 73. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
them down into destruction</hi>—remember how God mixeth bitter
and sweet to all men in this life: this man hath great riches?
but neither childe to enjoy it, nor heart to use it; this man
is healthy in body, with a sick soule: this man thrives, and
layeth up wealth, but with such a conscience, as that the
poorest saint is incomparably more happy: another man
riseth in honours? it may be only to greaten his fall: another
is many waies prosperous to the world-ward? but as the
moon is then most darke toward heaven, when shee is most
light toward the earth, and contrariwise, so is it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
with men: the more gloriously they shine to us, the
more despicable they are to God, who layeth up such terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgements for them, that<note n="r" place="margin">Luke 16. 15</note> a soule in hell is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
an object of envy, as these glittering epuloe's who are
hasting thither.</p>
            <p>4. Ever remember that wee are brethren: members of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96658:109"/>
one body whereof <hi>Christ</hi> is the head: therefore wee must
withall meeknesse<note n="s" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 2, 3</note> support one another through love,
and mutually rejoice at each others good, and so cast away
the works of darknesse, strife, and envy.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Impatience,</hi> is a sicknesse of the mind proceeding from
severall causes, indignation, anger, envy, (so <hi>Caine</hi> to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>

            <p>Impatience is a perturbation of the mind, a selfe-fretting,
tormenting bitternesse of the Soule, proceeding of impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or levity of minde: a secret contest with and repining at
the providence of God. the shame of Rich men and vexation
of the poore: the Mother of despaire, sad fury, and <hi>Asmodeus</hi>
of the inward house; every roome and recesse whereof, it
disturbeth with hideous cries, like<note n="e" place="margin">Isai. 13. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Ziim</hi> and <hi>Ohim,</hi> dolefull
beasts, in the desolations of <hi>Babylon:</hi> it is a folly and sober
madnesse, wherein the sick minde rejecteth all remedy, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
at the Physitian, recrudeth, and teareth open it own
wounds; an heart-eating canker, the inward mans wolfe
which devoureth that which feedeth it, the worme which
biteth the Soule, which <hi>Prometheus</hi>-like, feeds the vulture
which afflicteth it, delighted in that which grieves it: nor is

he could no otherwise feel the torments of Hell (due to us)

lost in that agony a present sense, not an indeficient interest:
for even then he called God his God; which sheweth a vast
distance between the impatience, of desperate unrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sinners, and the estate of the soule-sick holy men, who
(though like the <hi>Israëlites</hi> marching with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> into
the same waters) have there a way opened to their promised
rest, where the enemy is drowned. Concerning this evill,
we must know it groweth on by degrees, first in unadvised
anger mixt with sorrow (which are the seeds of impatience)
next to a dislike of every accident and estate, then to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
murmuring: so like a Gangren it invadeth the Souls
vitalls, hope, content, and cheerefull dependance on Gods
providence, creeping on to violent despare: so that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
a man highly, to prevent this evill by staying its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings;
learning to make a prudent use of every affliction,
and to expell all those discomposed thoughts which any
way feed it; to practice in the whole course of life, that
Saint like patience and moderation, which becometh those,
who depend on the providence of God: which that thou
maist doe, consider these like motives to Patience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentednesse.</p>

righteousnesse, my atonement with thee, and such peace of conscience,
as the world can neither give nor take from mee, that I may love thee
above all, and be truely thankeful to thee for all thy mercies temporal

will not suffer mee to faile in any trial: Lord sanctifie mee by his good
Spirit, and all my afflictions to mee by him: cast out of my soule all those
sinnes and corruptions for which thou fillest me with bitterness: let the
summe and height of all my ambition be, only to be thine: give mee a
prudent and contented heart in every estate and condition, a faithful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance

not, neither deceiveth trust.</p>
            <p>5. Take heed of vaine hopes, specially those which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
right reason (lest thou tempt God) they deceive men:
such is their trust who contemne the ordinary means in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of miracles: and they who doe things against the
expresse word of God, in vaine hope of pardon.</p>
            <p>6. Propose not too great things to thy selfe: we are often
the evident authors of our own sorrowes; when we promise
peace, health, and prosperity to our selves: this high-flying
ambition sometimes looseth it feathers, and we fall into
bitterness, when we come short of that which we vainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
our selves. 'Twere better never climb, then rise to fall.</p>
            <p>7. Pray to the God of hope and consolation, to infuse a
sure hope and confidence into thy soule.</p>

concerning the avoidance of sorrow in apprehension

1. Make not anothers sinne thine, by a foolish and

that which shall make him mourn in his end. Beyond all
this, in case of impenitency, (which the wilfull presumer
may justly suspect) it is that whereby hee barreth himselfe

in the adulteresse crime; hereby robbing her husband
of his prosperity, obtruding a base and adulterous issue, and
so stealing away his estate and inheritance, by giving it to a
stranger; setting on an indelible character of dishonor and
bastardy upon her childe, who but for her impotent and
ungoverned lust, might have been noble; an injury which
she can never expiate, nor impaire to the innocuous sonne,
with rivers of tears, and streams of her infected blood: this
multiplied sinne is sometimes concealed from men, but never
from an all-seeing God, who is a severe revenger of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.
Other sinnes are grievous, yet neither lying, stealing,
idolatry, murder, nor witch-craft, can of it selfe dissolve

dwell plentifully there, and the holy spirit have his temple

               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:96658:135"/>To those who are exercised under the <hi>strife of tongues,</hi> I offer
these rules:</p>
            <p>1. It is a principal artifice of <hi>Satan</hi> to scandal the saints,
that hee may thereby discourage others from imitation of
their holinesse: specially those that bear the <hi>ark of the covenant,</hi>
the ministers of <hi>Christ,</hi> that thereby he may, through their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
wound their doctrine: but be not discouraged; this is

               </note> honor and conformity to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> whom
the wicked persecuted.</p>
            <p>2. Look not only on second causes, but consider God's
justice: it may be he bad <hi>Shimei</hi> curse: hast thou not injured
others, in unjust suspicions or censures? hast thou been tender
of other reputations? if not, know by suffering the evil thou
didst, that thou maist repent, and repaire the injured what
possibly thou canst.</p>
            <p>3. Make a good use of the railers tongue: live more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
and avoid all just occasions of suspicion: the best <hi>antidote</hi>
against <hi>Scorpions</hi> is made of <hi>Scorpions:</hi> the best defence against
railing tongues, is for feare of them to keepe innocency, and
live uprightly,<note n="c" place="margin">Vivendum rectè, tum propter pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, tum his praecipuè cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, ut linguas mancipiorum contemnas, <hi>Juv.</hi>
               </note> that thou maist contemne base tongues.</p>
            <p>4. In every calumny have<note n="d" place="margin">Ad cor semper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum: ut nullius nos ibi lingua implicet, ubi conscientia non accusat: quem enim conscientia defendit, &amp; inter accusationem liber est, <hi>Greg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> l. 6. ep. 14. &amp; l. 8. ep</hi> 95. &amp; <hi>l. 9 ep.</hi> 39.</note> recourse to thine own heart:
let that be thy sanctuary: in spight of the devils malice, and
all the impious tongues which his spirit moveth; he is a free
and happy man whose conscience accuseth him not: God
will once cleer thine innocency: mean time fear not unjust
calumnies: the railer is hated of all men, and at last his
tongue becometh no slander.</p>
            <p>Fourthly let thy speech savour of <hi>meeknesse and humility:</hi>
these are safe vertues and symptoms of wisedom: the proud
insolent boaster is ever odious to prudent hearers; if not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous:
but meeknesse gaineth upon the affections, and so
findeth rest to our souls. <hi>In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride,
but the lips of the wise shall preserve them,</hi> Prov. 14. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:96658:136"/>Fiftly, let thy speech be <hi>religious</hi> and not profane: so
shall thy tongue glorifie its creator, and render him the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of so excellent a gift bestowed on thee. I say not that
thou shouldest alwaies speake of religion: there is an holy
and religious negotiating, and acting the things of this
world: there is a religious rejoycing and mirth: the holy
Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles, did not alwaies speak of
God and religion; they had businesse also with men, and
must necessarily speake thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they did so speake of
those things, as in the presence of God; and so their lives
were as a continuall preaching; according to that pattern
of <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>sanctity</hi> which we read in their words and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
actions: so frame thy life, and words, that they may
be harmlesse, simple, and holy; <hi>habitually,</hi> not affected, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
saint-like, not dissembled: Bew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re of profane disputes,
vaine questions, and dangerous paradoxes (which any waies
endanger the foundation of religion) abuse of God's sacred
Word to jestings, and taking his name in vaine; remember
him who saith, he will not hold such guiltlesse. The habit
of profane swearing (to many unhappy tongues) is like a
<hi>diabeticall</hi> passion, wherein oathes fall from them while they
think not on the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>: Cursing is the language of reprobates,
the bitterness of a malevolent heart overflowing the tongue:
these vices as they are fearful sins, so dangerous symptoms
of an impious soule: loathsome habits, such as could not
become an heathen <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> why any <hi>Christian</hi> should
think them gratefull, I could never understand.</p>
            <p>8. Let thy study be in Gods word, acquaint thee with
his oracles, and make their language familiar to thee; so
shalt thou finde an holy savor in them beyond all excellency
of the tongues of men: and if thou give thine heart sincerely
to obey them, the holy Ghost will derive thence a sweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
into thy tongue; and so season thy heart, that all the
tempters suggestions shall be bitter to thee.</p>

               <p>Of external actions in general. §. 1. Whence good Actions are: How requisite: How regulated?
§. 2. Rules concerning them.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. THe <hi>Actions</hi> of men are the proceed and fruit of their
thoughts:<note place="margin">§. I.</note> as we owe sanctimony to God, and our
consciences within, so doe wee good example to
our neighbour in things external: as <hi>Christ</hi> saith,<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Let your
light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorifie
your father which is in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Good actions proceed from sound faith, without
which they cannot be good, nor pleasing to God: for
<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> whatsoever is not of faith, is sinne: faith apprehending
<hi>Christ</hi> to the justification of our person, maketh our workes
acceptable to him, so farre as they are fruits of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and uniting us to <hi>Christ</hi> giveth us a capacity of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
sanctifying, and enabling us in some measure to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
sinne, and doe that which is holy in his sight: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Scripture saith,<note n="c" place="margin">Iam. 2.</note> Shew mee thy faith by thy works;
which yet saith also, a man is<note n="d" place="margin">Rom 3. 28. Gal. 3. 9, 11.</note> justified by <hi>faith only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the workes of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Though the best of our works cannot justifie us before
God, (because they are imperfect) yet are they never severed
from true faith: and they are the<note n="e" place="margin">Via regninon causa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnandi, <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </note> way to Gods kingdom,
though they cannot be the cause of our arrival there: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the yong mans quaere who would be justified by
workes, <hi>Christ</hi> answereth,<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 19 16.</note> 
               <hi>Keep the Commandements.</hi> (thus
hee convinced him who had not yet learned the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of faith, which saith, Beleeve, and thou shalt be saved)
Thereby shewing, that yet he wanted something, who excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
many men in most things, and therefore must seek sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96658:137"/>
in something else; that is, by faith: as also that the
way to heaven is onely by sanctity: this is a condition, not
the cause of our salvation: wee can never be saved for it,
(because our best is imperfect) nor without it; because wee
owe our best endeavours to Gods honor.</p>
            <p>4. It is not enough to intend, or speak good: <hi>Satan</hi> is
contented either that men should draw neer unto God with
their lips, if their hearts he farre off; or that they speake
well, if they will doe evill. Words at best are but feminine

example of others, prescription, universality of consent,
nor commands of men, may carry us against the expresse
word of God: these have place onely in those things which
Gods law alloweth, commandeth, or leaveth arbitrary.</p>
            <p>Concerning thy actions in generall, these

and the wormes destroy thee. What are pleasures? in their

            <p>2. Make God's Law thy counsellers in all things:
weigh all thy purposes hereby, before thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their owne inventions, in will-worship, and voluntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
wherein all, even the most zealous and painful acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

rejected, with a<note n="m" place="margin">Isai. 1.</note>

thou make all things according to the pattern shewed thee in
the mount. Also when God's word is our rule, wee will
neither lay snares upon our own consciences, placing reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in those things which God hath left indifferent, (as they

               <hi>The end of those things is
death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. In all thy actions set thy selfe ever in the presence
of God: so did <hi>David</hi> professe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 8. ever remember
that thou art in his sight, and that nothing thou doest or
thinkest can be hid from him: neither solitude nor darknesse
can vaile thee, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 11, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5. In all that thou doest, be sure to hold the rule of
charity: for that<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 13. 10</note> is the fulfilling of the Law: this is

there can be nothing acceptable to God which doth
not hold this.</p>
            <p>6. In all religious well designed acts, be what thou
seemest: the <hi>hypocrite</hi> doth but personate, act and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit

never can beguile his owne conscience: be thou therefore
just and sincere in thy deportment before God and man.</p>
            <p>7. Do nothing to others, which thou wouldst not

               <p>MOst merciful Father, who hast promised that if the wicked turne

thy judgments to give us over to our own unhappy waies, who have so long
refused to be guided by thy holy word, and our owne helplesse impotency to
stay our selves, turn unto thee, or set our selves in any good way to serve
and please thee; wee pray thee for <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> sake to pardon all our
misdeeds, and to vouchsafe to lead us in thy pathes, and the way thou
wouldst have us to walke in: we have long gone astray, like lost sheep;
and thou best knowest, O our God, how dangerous <hi>Satan</hi>'s snares are to
us, how many the distractions of a beguiling world? how fraile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme

Lord, thy wisedom cannot erre; therefore renouncing our own guidance,
wee render our selves into thy gracious hands, humbly beseeching thee,
who freely givest wisedom to all that aske, and upbraidest no man; hold
thou up our goings in thy pathes, that we faile not, direct all our waies
that we neither decline to the right hand nor to the lest to offend thee:
Give us the shield of our salvation, and let thy right hand uphold us:
O thou that hearest the prayers of them that call upon thee, heare us,
for our soules waite on thee: direct and guide us, keepe us and counsell
us in all our actions, that we may neither do nor designe any thing, but
that which is pleasing to thee, and which thou wilt blesse unto us: that
we may walk unblamably and prudently toward all men, and holily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee: that in all our actions wee may glorifie thee: that wee may
adorne the Gospel of <hi>Christ</hi> by our holy conversations, give good example
to our neighbours, and stop the mouthes of all malicious adversaries; so
that when these daies of sin are ended, we shall rest from our labors, we

Parents</hi> and <hi>Children:</hi> Duties of Publick Persons are without

with his poverty, and herein his policy was lame.</p>
            <p>3. Some have distributed the family into three parts: the
first commandeth as Master: the second commandeth, but
not in chiefe; as the good vine, not on the top, but sides of
the house: the third are auxiliar; onely obeying, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

            <p>4. Now though this be the order, and order so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that without it no society of man can subsist; yet
must it be with that sanctity and equity, that the God of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:96658:140"/>
may be known to govern, though man administer; and
with that lenity, and candor of command, and willing reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in obeying, that all may seem managed with love, not
feare; familiarity rather then rigid and imperious severity;
for which I suppose the ancient <hi>Latines</hi> comprised all three
orders under the name of <hi>Familiares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. God in his abundant mercy, as hee hath not been
sparing to reveale his will for our salvation; so neither in
any thing which concerneth our present comfort and well
being: his word is a full store-house of spirituall consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and directions of the outward man;<note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.</note> able to make him wise to salvation. There is no condition of man, no
state of life, which hath not directions here layed downe:
from the King to the poore Master of the cottage, from
imperial Potentates, to poore Vassals; here are precepts
and counsels, which being religiously observed, will make
a man happy in any estate.</p>
            <p>The duety of a <hi>Master</hi> of a Family is reducible
to these heads:</p>
            <p>1. That hee care and provide for his family:<note place="margin">§. II.</note> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>hee denieth the faith, and is</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>worse then an infidel.</hi> Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse
and sloth are the mother and nurse of misery and
confusion. See <hi>Pro. 20. 4. Pro 2. 24, 27. Pro 18. 9. Pro 21. 25.
Eccles 10. 18. Pro. 24. 30, 31,</hi> 34. Destruction of many noble
families hath been through prodigality, vaine profusion in

            <p>2. That hee instruct his family in the fear God, and
exercises of true religion; as<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 18. 19</note> 
               <hi>Abraham</hi> did: as those who call them together to prayer, reading and hearing some

himselfe which of his courtiers were God's servants, and

               </gap>ie in an house, bringing God's anger and many plagues
upon it. Now whereas example is indeed the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Rhetorick, the onely way to teach, is to doe that which
thou wouldst have another learne; be sure that thou who
art a master of a family, give no ill example in thy house:
if thy servants see the impious, profane, profuse, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
or lazy, they will imitate thee: as thou servest God,
so will they thee. If thy servant knoweth any evil of thee,
hee can keep thee in awe, and so thy worst enemies may be
they of thine own house, therefore the wise man saith,<note n="k" place="margin">Eccl. 32. 22</note> 
               <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of thine owne children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That<note n="l" place="margin">Ephes. 6. 9.</note> hee do unto his servants that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual;
considering the impartiality of God's judgement, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
commanding; not over-burdening them with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
remembring that they are men, not beasts, (to whom
men ought to be merciful, as their fellow creatures) not
threatning or afflicting them with cruelty, beating, maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or wounding. God cautioned that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> servant
<note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 21.
2, 26, 27.</note> should after six yeeres service be manumissed and set free:
and so in case of maiming. It is folly to create contempt
by too much familiarity: and it is impiety to contemn him
that is <hi>Christ</hi>'s free-man, bought with the sameprice, and heire
of the same kingdom of heaven with thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what knowest
thou but that God hath appointed thy servant to save thy
life (as<note n="n" place="margin">2 King. 5.</note> a captive maid did for <hi>Naaman)</hi> or thy soule?
When <hi>Antigonus</hi> saw his sonne cruelly entreating a servant,
hee said, knowest not thou, O Sonne, that our kingdome
is but a glorious servitude? And <hi>Demonax</hi> in like case said,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96658:141"/>
Leave beating him, lest thou become like thy servant: such
are humane conditions: slaves have become masters, and
great Lords servants; (but to serve passion, is the worst sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very)
hereof <hi>Croesus, Darius, Sampson, Adonibezek, Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
and many others have been examples. Be thou not

some failings, who each day begge Gods pardon for ours,
<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 6. 12.</note> with condition of forgiving others: be not fond to keep

<hi>Manes,</hi> 'Twere a shame (said he) that <hi>Manes</hi> should be able
to live without <hi>Diogenes,</hi> and that <hi>Diogenes</hi> should not be able

               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:96658:142"/>
The Motives hereto are:</p>
            <p>1. God's expresse command,<note place="margin">§. IV.</note> 
               <hi>Colos. 3. 22. Ephes. 6. 5, &amp;c.</hi>
where that moveth not, I know not what can. Obedience
to thy Master is shewing thy selfe a servant of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>doing
the will of God,</hi> Eph. 6. 6.</p>
            <p>2. This adorneth the doctrine of God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore the grace of God hath appeared to all
men, bond and free, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>4. If servants be faithful they shall receive the reward of
the Lord, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
            <p>5. Hee that doth wrong to his Master, shall receive the
like, God will revenge it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 25.</p>
            <p>6. A false and trecherous servant is odious to God and
man, commonly branded with an indelible note of infamy,
as an unthankfull deceiver of trust.</p>
            <p>7. The name of God and his doctrine are blasphemed
by that servant, who, professing to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> is false,
injurious, or unprofitable to his Master; because that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
profession is not to him a spurre to duety, but a cloak of
hypocrisie.</p>

clean: cleanse us from all our iniquities, that we may put away the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
of our doings from before thine eies, that we may indeed cease to
do evil, and learn to do well, that thou mayest make our scarlet sins (twice
died, in original and actual guilt) white as snow in <hi>Salmon;</hi> that we
may consent and obey, and so enjoy the good things of this land, and not be
devoured by the sword, as we are this day for our transgressions. Though
we deserve that the fire of thine anger should consume us as the stubble,
that our root should be as rottennesse, and that our blossom, when we hope,
should go up as the dust, until our cities become desolate, and our houses
without a man, because we have cast away the law of the Lord of hostes:
yet, O Lord, unto thee belongeth mercy, and the issues from death, though
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96658:146"/>
thou hast been terrible in thy workes, layed afflictions upon our loines,
and broken our land, yet heale the breaches thereof: though thou hast
caused us to drinke of the wine of astonishment in thy sore displeasure,
and made us examples of thy just judgments, yet turn again unto us, and
make us instances of thy mercy, that sinners may in our story read that
which may make them afraid to sin, and confident of thy mercy, in their
unfeigned repentance: remember thy mercy which hath been ever of
old: before all times thou electedst us; at the begining of time thou
createdst us to thine owne holy image: in the fulnesse of time, thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
thy holy sonne <hi>Jesus</hi> to death for our redemption: Lord cast not
that away, which thou hast purchased at so deare a rate: we know thy
mercy faileth not, thou art ever the same, not like man, that thou shouldst
repent thee, as mistaken in thy choice, or defeated in thy counsels: O
Lord our God, accomplish thine owne election in us: thou hast given us
thy son Iesus, how shouldst thou not also with him, give us al things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for us? thou hast for his sake acquitted us from eternal condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
how shouldst thou not also spare us and deliver us in the temporal?
'Tis little, O bountiful God, which we beg at thy merciful hands for our
present releife, to that which thou freely gavest us, before wee could aske:
nor is it because wee have none to stand up in the gap for us, that thy
wrath is not yet appeased, seeing thy <hi>Christ,</hi> our faithful high Priest,
sitteth at thy right hand, making intercession for us: O Lord, for his
sake be reconciled to us, deny not our requests, heare and helpe us: esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
thy free covenant and mercy with us: strengthen, O God, that
which thou hast wrought for us, and our fathers, when thou deliveredst
us from the powers of darkness, and taking us to be thy people, didst trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
us into the kingdome of thy deare son: establish the trueth, sincerity
of religion, unity of hearts, and abundance of peace, which thou then gavest
us: forgive the sins of thy people, turn our hearts unto thee, from the first
unto the last, give us unfeigned repentance, and humiliation under thy
mighty hand, that thou maist spare us; and grace to forsake all our evill
waies, that thine anger may cease from us: give us patience to bear thy
fatherly corrections, who hast with so much patience born with our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Bless thy <hi>Church</hi> universal with trueth and unity, shew thy mercy
on her distressed: thou hast hid thy face from us and consumed us, because
of our jniquities; but, Lord, remember them not for ever: appoint now

               <p>Of Marriage; and the dueties thereof. §. 1. Of Marriage; the institution, end and fruits thereof.

            </argument>
            <p>1. <hi>MArriage</hi> is the conjunction of one man with one
woman, according to the lawes of God and
man, in the holy indissoluble band of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
whereby they become one flesh: I say <hi>of one man with
one woman:</hi> for so God made them at first, and so appointed
from the begining. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 4, &amp;c. so that plurality of
wives or husbands at once, is adultery; though when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party dyeth, the surviver<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 7. 2, 3.</note> is free to marry, in the
Lord; <hi>according to the lawes of God,</hi> who saith,<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 7 2.</note> 
               <hi>Let every
man have his owne wife, and every woman her own husband</hi>—and the
<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 7. 2.</note> wife is bound by the law to her husband, <hi>so long as hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 13 4.</note> Marriage is honorable in all, and the <hi>bed undefiled:</hi>
forbidding to marry is the <hi>doctrine of devils,</hi> who labour to
pervert the order and institution of God, to corrupt and
dishonor the fountain of humane propagation, with impure
and wandring lusts. And also <hi>according to the lawes of man;</hi>
which being grounded on God's law, necessarily binde all
men thereto subject, as cautioning against emergent incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
with relation to times, places, and persons; as
where they binde to publish the <hi>sponsals</hi> or contracts, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

where they limit to certain houres in the face of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
&amp;c. to avoid <hi>clandestine</hi> marriages, or incontinent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
under pretence of marriage: next I say, <hi>it is an holy

of the persons capacity and fitnesse, the end and use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

and mother, and remaine with his wife: which is not simply,
but comparatively to be understood; as if hee said, Thou

and mother, then thy wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e: and the word of <hi>Christ</hi> is cleere,
<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 19. 6, 9</note> what God hath joined together, <hi>let no man put asunder:</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication,
and shall marry another, committeth adultery—now in case
of adultery<note n="h" place="margin">Non enim homo separat, quos poena damnat.</note> man separateth not, but a just punishment (as
death) dischargeth the party innocent: he is cruelly impious
who putteth away a chaste wife, and hee impiously foolish
who keepeth an adulterous or dead one by him. Neither
may wee conceive that God joineth all them together, that
are married before men: there is a just age fit to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
required; freedom in consent, and where these are not,
it is no lawful marriage. If there be deceit, as where the man
is an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> where there is fraud or errour, as where a <hi>Leah</hi>
is substituted for a <hi>Rachel;</hi> where there is a lawful pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before married to some other living person, where degrees of
consanguinity or affinity hinder; where there is no consent
of parents, where there is no compulsion, by violence, fear, or
importune commands of superiors; in fine, where the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is not lawful, God joined not, and therefore it is no sin
for man justly to separate, where man unjustly joined.</p>
            <p>2. Marriage was ordained by God in <hi>Paradise,</hi> in the state
of mans innocency: wherein hee (who best knew his owne

               <hi>lust

            </p>
            <p>6. Take heed of matching into an infamous fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
it is true, God can call, and so doth,<note n="h" place="margin">Luke 7.</note> some infamous
sinners home to wash the feet of <hi>Christ</hi> with teares of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:

to make them instances of his mercy: but commonly
<hi>partus ventrem sequitur:</hi> an adulterous <hi>Herodias</hi> hath a dancing
daughter, easily infected with her mothers sicknesse: it is a
desperate adventure to choose there.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>mutual Dueties</hi> of the married
these duties are observable:</p>
            <p>1. That they serve God together with one heart and
consent:<note place="margin">§. III.</note> so <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca, Zacharie</hi> and
<hi>Elisabeth;</hi> so all the children of God in that state do.</p>
            <p>2. That both hold the bond of conjugal love, entire,
pure, and unpolluted: while <hi>Solomon</hi> chargeth the man—
<note n="i" place="margin">Prov. 5. 18, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>rejoice with the wife of thy youth—let her breasts satisfie thee at all
times</hi>—he enjoineth the woman the same duety: let both ever
remember the covenant they have made before God, and
that dreadful word, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9, 10. Be not deceived, neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators,
nor idolaters, nor adulterers—shall inherit the kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That they live together in love, peace, and amity:
that they give not scandal to others, nor create mutual bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
to themselves: Mutual love is gods blessing on thy
family, a <hi>praeludium</hi> of heaven, in thy house, a comfortable
pattern to thy children: like the sun-beams on thy possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:96658:151"/>
as the dew of heaven on thy fields, which maketh all
look cheerfully, and be fruitful: a state that cometh neerest
up to that blessed <hi>Paradise-oeconomy of Adam</hi> innocent: a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
which maketh every estate such; without which no
store is blessed.<note n="k" place="margin">Pro. 15. 17</note> 
               <hi>Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, then a
stalled oxe and hatred therewith.</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Pro. 17. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Better is a dry morsel, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
therewith, then an housefull of sacrifices with strife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That they do cheerfully and willingly communicate
in all that which God hath given them; in prosperity advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
in adversity comforting each other with such sympathy
in joy and sorrow, as is in them who are truely one flesh.</p>
            <p>5. That they bear each others infirmities, never taking
things spoken or done in the worst sense; nor making every
trivial matter an occasion of quarrel, or alienation of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but passing by them so, as that they may seem rather
covered in love, then excused in judgement, or approved in
stupidity: in which practice <hi>Satan</hi> may be beaten with his
own weapon; while that every occasion (which hee admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
in hope to former discord) being prudently used to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the invincible love of the party suffering, and
willing rather to put up injury, then to admit the least
breach of amity by retaliation, more endeareth them to each
other.</p>
            <p>6. That they join hands and hearts, to assist each other
in the way to heaven; See 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 16. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
            <p>7. That they mutually defend each other: so <hi>Michol</hi> preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> sought his life: so prudent <hi>Abigail</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured

               </gap>ederate against the lives or estates of their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</p>
            <p>8. That they neither unjustly take, nor justly give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of jealousie, which ever embittereth, the (otherwaies)
most happy families. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s rule is here to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to women:<note n="m" place="margin">Etsi nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata non fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, tamen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme putes testimonium si rogeris, Hier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ep. 2l 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The <hi>Duties proper</hi> to the <hi>Husband</hi> may appeare
in these following Rules:</p>
            <p>1. Let the<note n="n" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7.</note> husband dwell with his wife according to
knowledge, giving honor to her as the weaker vessel, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
co-heires of the grace of life, that their prayers be not
hindred: where there needeth reproof, let it neither be
rough, odious, injurious, publick, clamorous, nor
disgracefull; but allayed with such wisedome, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
perswasions, as may not only reform but endeare: in
the most happy wedlock there may be some matter of just
dislike, and therefore due cause of reproof: it much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
thee to know thy wives faults, but not to hate her
for them: let the rule be either, beare thy wives faults (if
tolerable) with patience, or amend them with direction, if
they are intolerable, in this thou makest her better, in that,
thy selfe.</p>
            <p>2. Let a man love<note n="o" place="margin">Eph. 5. 33.</note> his wife as himselfe; esteeming
nothing too good or dear for her good: as <hi>Christ</hi> loved his
Church; which concludeth nothing for them who impiously
and cruelly afflict their wives with stripes, or otherwise: for
God saith,<note n="p" place="margin">Col 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.</note> 
               <hi>Husbands love your wives, and be not bitter against
them:</hi> it is uncertaine whether they have evil wives, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that they deserve such, who can no otherwise governe
then by blowes. Neither doth this binde any man to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
(much lesse an impious and dangerous) indulgence
to his wife; wherein she desireth that which needs must, or
probably may hurt her self, her husband or family: it is love
and wisedome to deny her that.</p>
            <p>3. Let a man maintain his wife in cloaths and necessaries
according to his estate, so as shee may live cheerfully with
him, not as servant, but as a partner in his estate.</p>
            <p>4. Let the husband use all comity, holy, gratious, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and peaceable language, as a pattern to all his family,
so specially as a pledge of love to his wife: neither like rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Nabal,</hi> nor fond and vaine, which commonly changeth
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:96658:152"/>
into fits of extream bitternesse; for who can like such ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
levity?</p>
            <p>5. Let the man heare the wife's advice, but never be
transported beyond better reason, nor carried thereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the holy will of God; as <hi>Adam,</hi> whose dreadfull sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

good, endeavouring to content, please, and comfort him.
See <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. 11. contrary to which is the imperious command
of the domineering wife, unreverend speech or action, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of her charge, through pride, sloth, or riotous wasting

necessary for parents concerning the same:</p>
            <p>1. Study thy family, that thou maist not be a stranger
at home: first, it is necessary for thee to proportion the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
thereof, and the breeding of thy children according
to thy estate, lest thou build higher then thy foundation
will beare: it hath been the evident ruine of many families,
that parents have bred their children in so great an heigth, as
that the meanes they were able to leave them, could not
maintain them. It is not a little wisedom to live within thy
fortunes, and to use thy children to a condition rather much
too low, then the least little above thy estate: the minde
will easily greaten, and rise with the fortunes, but very
hardly lessen or descend: it is an evident danger to beare a
saile too great for the bottome; farre more safe is it, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
a concealed estate, then to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tent, and exceed a broken
one. Secondly, it is necessary to know the qualities of thy
family:<note n="h" place="margin">Solemus mala domus nostrae s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> we are many times the last that heare of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances
of our houses: the neighbours whisper, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
sing our reproaches in the streets, before we so much as
suspect them: something there is in affection, which eft soon
blindeth the wise, with too secure opinion of their childrens
good nature and discretion to deport themselves: so <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus
Caesar</hi> was deceived in his <hi>Julia</hi> (whom he beleeved chast,
though he was not ignorant of that dangerous symptom of
immodesty, her over-daring audacity) until in her incurable
infamy, he knew, that pleasures, liberty, luxury, and vaine
compture were precipices to whoredome: something also
there is in parents giving their children too much power to
follow their own <hi>Genius,</hi> led away with the fancy of that
blinde-mans parents, <hi>Joh. 9. 21. hee is of age—hee shall speak for
himselfe;</hi> as if in their wilfull neglect of duety, they should
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:96658:155"/>
not be responsible to God for their children.<note n="i" place="margin">1 Sam 2 23, 31, 32.</note> 
               <hi>Elie</hi>'s<note n="k" place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 13, 14.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expiable
sinne, in too milde a reproofe of his debauched
sonnes, is a sad document to all carelesse and indulgent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
If thou do not thy uttermost endeavour, to stay thy
children from sin, if they perish, God will require their blood
at thy hands; if thou do (though without successe) thou hast
delivered thy soul from that guilt.</p>
            <p>2. Another duety of parents is to do a constant and holy
endeavour to provide, and lay up for their children: idleness,
carelessnesse, luxury, and vain expences of parents, impiously
betray their children, and expose them to the mercy of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilesse
world, to beggery and misery. It is pity that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
among many good lawes, wanteth the <hi>censorian</hi> law
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to punish negligent and unthrifty men; and
to sequester so much of their estates as might secure the wife
and children from want. The <hi>Apostle</hi> marketh the idle with

whereas a little which the righteous hath, is better then great
riches of the ungodly. It was <hi>David</hi>'s experience:<note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 37, 25.</note>

such was poore <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard to <hi>Ahab,</hi> that little spot car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away a kingdom from his posterity: a wise man will not
put up one ill-gotten penny into his treasure: he must needs
bring a curse upon his children, who will make them rich by
sinne. Experience hath often preached this to us, in the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ruine of great families, which, like<note n="t" place="margin">lonah 4. 7.</note> the Prophets

Sinne ever carrieth a curse with it, except in case of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which in this case cannot be without disgorging and
restitution of all that which wrong or fraud had swallowed

matching them well is a principal: wee reade of it in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>

finde a good match, thou hast gained a sonne or daughter, if
otherwise, thou hast lost a childe.</p>

it may (according to thy promise, who canst not deceive) go well with me
and my children after mee. Thou who art the God of my fathers, and
hast preserved me from my mothers womb, who hast blessings in store, for
all that fear thee, for their generations who depend on thee: plant thy
fear in every one of their hearts, and sanctifie them bodies and soules,
whom thou hast given mee; so that in whatsoever state and condition
thy providence shall set them, it may be my comfort and assurance, that
they are thy faithful and elect servants, that thou maist be pleased to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

thy fatherly providence hath assigned them. Lord season their tender
years with grace and trueth: help them and blesse them with blessings of
heaven above, and the earth beneath: and let my blessings prevail above
the blessings of my fathers: give them assurance of their adoption in
<hi>Christ Jesus:</hi> keep them and order their steps, in the way which thou
wouldst have them walke in: let thy faithfulnesse and mercy be with
them, all the daies of their lives: be thou a father and rock of salvation
unto them: keep them by thy sanctifying spirit, holy and sincere before
thee: uphold them that their foot-steps slip not: be thou the guide of their

youth; keep their tender years from sinne and shame: take not thy mercy
and thy trueth from them: preserve them from the houre of tentation, in
life and death, from the power of sin, the snares of Satan, the world, and
the flesh: heare the voice of their praiers when they cry unto thee: helpe
them against all their enemies: blesse their substance, and accept the
worke of their hands: be thou ever their refuge, and save them: Thou
who dividest the earth among the sonnes of men; whose providence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth
unto the feeding and preserving the poorest of thy creatures; feed
them with bread of their stature: thou who encreasedst the oile and the

which thou shalt be pleased to give them) let thy blessing be with it; that
in every estate they may faithfully depend on thy gracious providence,
which never faileth them that trust in thee; and finde such a sufficiency
therein, that they may live cheerfully and contentedly, that they may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
want that which thou knowest necessary and comfortable for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

and the righteousnesse thereof, that all these things may be administred

who hast planted thine owne image of love and compassion in the
hearts of parents towards their children; heare the praiers of a poore
father for his children, and deny not the requests of my lips, when thou
shalt be pleased to take me from them; leave them not destitute, shew thy

from thy commandements: as thou hast shewed me mercy and compassion
all my daies, so holy father let not thy mercy depart from them, but keep
them in thy faith, fear, and love; that as thy providence hath brought us
together in this family, so when this mortal life shall be ended, we may

impiety and disobedience, according to his justice, because
hee is true in both: all sinnes have their severe punishments
following them; and when God's justice is most slow, it is
most sure: but there are some sins which are more destructive
to humane society, which God, the preserver thereof, usually
punisheth in this life, that hee may deterre men from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them: so it is observable, that cruelty, oppression,
and murder, seldome goe unpunished here, but most closely
acted, sometimes they are discovered by extraordinary
meanes: and disobedience to parents, may hence appeare
odious to God and man, that it is commonly punished by
the like deportments of their children: an example thereof
is commonly found in every family of the disobedient. <hi>O

               </hi> or found me. Other sorrowes may be eased,
by giving the afflicted something equivalent to that whose

found: or by some compensation and repair; as <hi>Job</hi> had a

the broken bones, by putting on some purple or rich robes:

               <hi>Give strong

by whose stripes wee are healed.</p>
            <p>1. There are some things principally wounding and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
the conscience,<note place="margin">§. II.</note> coming up like those<note n="e" place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Philistim</hi> spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,

                  </gap>ain,</hi> having murdered his brother, cryed, My
sinne or punishment is greater then I can beare: <hi>Judas,</hi> having
betrayed <hi>Christ,</hi> durst not come to him to beg mercy, because
he apprehended an implacable anger in <hi>Christ:</hi> it is true, that
the<note n="g" place="margin">Eph 5. 6.</note> wrath of God cometh on<note n="h" place="margin">Col. 3. 6.</note> the children of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
for their sinnes: that his<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> wrath is revealed from
heaven against all ungodlinesse and unrighteousnesse of
men: that the impenitent by their hardnesse of heart, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
up to themselves wrath against the day of wrath: that
there<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 2. 5. 8, 9.</note> shall be indignation and wrath to them that obey
not the trueth: but when thou who art of a wounded spirit,
and broken heart, hast well considered; it may be thou shalt
finde that these things concerne thee not, but those who live
in sin, and so would do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:96658:164"/>2. The second thing wounding the conscience, is sense
of spiritual wants, as of hope, faith, assurance of salvation,
the spirit of sanctification, praier, &amp;c. which being Gods
grace and the presence of his holy Spirit in the regenerate,
may yet, for the time, be an hidden treasure, an immortall
seed under the frozen clods, without any appearance of life:
and the saints may weep and complain like<note n="l" place="margin">Joh. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Magdalen</hi> in
the garden, of the losse of <hi>Christ</hi> when he is with them, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to them, and they know him not.</p>
            <p>3. The third is fear of some strong tentations and trials,
in which the afflicted and affrighted conscience startleth (as
the <hi>Disciples</hi> when<note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 8. 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>Jesus</hi> slept in the storm, their ship filled

               <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 14. 30.</note> on the water, when he saw the rough billows coming) and
cryeth out, <hi>Save Master, we perish;</hi> when 'tis sure enough, they
cannot perish who are with <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning him that will receive any solid comfort
in any of these cases,<note place="margin">§. III.</note> it is very necessary that he, 1. Well
consider that state in which he seemeth to be. 2. Examine
his conscience throughly. 3. Practice some rules proper

wee are, or can be to entreat it; for aske it wee never

            <p>2.<note n="r" place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> God delighteth not in the death of sinners, but

The danger is when the minde can be quiet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled

            <p>To this a serious examination is requisite;<note place="margin">§. IV.</note> wherein

God hath not so often commanded it in vain. <hi>Lam. 3. 40.
Psal. 4. 4. 1 Cor. 11. 28. 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
            <p>2. Without this, wee cannot know our sinnes, and so

are extream apt to mistake our selves: which if wee doe, wee
can have no sound comfort in the testimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,

            <p>3. Without this, we cannot possibly know which way
we are going, the<note n="y" place="margin">Mat 7.</note> broad way to destruction, or the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to salvation; which were very necessary to comfort us,
if wee go right, or to recall and rectifie us, if wrong.</p>
            <p>4. Without this, wee can never make a right use of
God's corrections, nor finde any comfortable way out of
them: neither can wee understand his works of mercy in us,
when he humbleth us to raise us more.</p>

of Gods word into the secret and dark recesses of thy heart:
<note n="a" place="margin">Luke 15.</note> the woman first ligted, then swept the room.</p>
            <p>3. Judge thy selfe as impartially as thou wouldst doe
an enemy: limmers use to set their work at some distance
from them, that they may be able to judge, and amend their
errours. Place thy actions upon the person of some other

wittingly and willingly? and whether it can be quiet in any
known and unrepented sin? if it be unquiet, feare not; this
very unrest of conscience, which so much affrighteth thee, is
a principal mark of a good conscience: it is true (as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

            <p>8. Hath not thy conscience at some times, in some
good measure been comforted by a sweet assurance of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest

eclipsed to our sense, and the stupid, or afflicted conscience
feeleth no present comfort of Gods spirit, which yet in due

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The conclusions necessary to be considered hereto, are</p>
            <p>1. God's judgements are ever just, I, when flesh and
blood, say with<note n="z" place="margin">Ioh. 3 9.</note> 
               <hi>Nicodemus, How can these things be?</hi> when

<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 9. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?</hi> and so
also his mercies are as the unsounded déepes, beyond all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of carnal reason; often curing, by wounding
and afllicting the guilty conscience; comforting, by terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
bringing to glory and immortality through corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
killing sinne in the flesh by death, the fruit of sinne, and
bringing to heaven (as I may say) by the gates of hell, and
feare of damnation.</p>
            <p>2. The most grievous sinnes committed in ignorance
and unbeliefe, after repentance, are no arguments to despair:
<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor 6. 9, 10, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Neither fornicators, idolaters—theeves, covetous, drunkards, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of heaven; and such
were some of you: but yee are washed, but yee are sanctified, but yee are
justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God:
Paul</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> was a blasphemer, persecuter, and injurious man, but
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:96658:169"/>
obtained mercy; for as much as he did it ignorantly, and in
unbeleefe, in his conversion these sinnes were taken off, as
his<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 28. 3, 5, 6.</note>

            </p>
            <p>3. Great and grievous sins of the regenerate, through
violent perturbations of minde, or tentations overtaking
them, are not to be reckoned among symptomes of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

denied <hi>Christ</hi> through sudden apprehension of fear:

yet every such failing concludeth not against repentance and

            <p>The rules of practice hereto belonging, are<note place="margin">§. V.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Do thy utmost endeavour to keep the testimony of a
good conscience, which thou canst by no means doe, but by
watching over thy soul, and with unyeelding constancy resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
temptations: every sin, the least, woundeth the soule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh:
be not secure of little sinnes, let a good conscience be
most precious unto thee: part not from it for any pleasures,
honours, or riches of this world; rather part from thy life:
have a tender conscience: a<note n="r" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 3. Tit. 1. 15.</note> seared one, like <hi>callous flesh,</hi> is
hardly sensible of that which toucheth it: to this,<note n="s" place="margin">Consuetudo peceandi, toslit sensam pecc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</note> custome
bringeth a man, taking away the sense of sin.</p>
            <p>2. Approve thy selfe in every action<note n="t" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15. 10.</note> to God, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thy selfe ever in his presence, who seest all thou doest o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
thinkest; and care not who ever else blame thee when
hee approveth thee:<note n="u" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> walke not according to the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the flesh, but by God's grace which shall at last be
thy rejoicing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:96658:170"/>
3. Be sure sin reign not in thee; which cannot be, except
thou sell thy self thereto, by consenting to thine own capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
as the<note n="w" place="margin">Ex. 21, 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note> eare-bored servants, who professed love to
their masters; and so would not be manu-missed and freed
from them: hate sin, and none shall hurt thee: no sin is so
pernicious, as that which pleaseth most; specially take heed
of presumptuous sins, that they get not dominion over thee.
<hi>Psalm. 19. 13. Numb.</hi> 15. ver. 30, 31. <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 17.
vers. 12.</p>
            <p>4. Looke on Gods justice and mercy together, part them
not in thy thoughts: if thou look on his justice onely, thou
must needs despair in the sight of thy sins: if thou look on his
mercy onely, thou wilt easily presume, when thou shalt see
the admirable immensity thereof, so ready to pardon sinnes:
the old sea-men noted the <hi>ignis lambens</hi> sitting sometimes on
the yards of their ships, for a good, or a mischievous presage:
if they saw but one flame, they called it an unlucky <hi>Helena:</hi>
if two, they tooke it for <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> good
abodements of faire and prosperous weather: it is
much like here: to consider either mercy, to presumption;
or justice, to despair; is destructive: it is happy to finde them
thus together, that thou neither in thy security presume to
sinne, nor despair for the greatnesse of any sinne in thy
repentance.</p>
            <p>5. Labour for true faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> who is the

us from all:<note n="z" place="margin">1 Tim 1. 19.</note> holding faith and a good conscience,
that wee may<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 9.</note> not be wrackt. There was no cure
for a wounded <hi>Israelite,</hi> against the venome of fiery
serpents, but to looke up to the brazen<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> Serpent,
which prefigured <hi>Christ</hi> apprehensible by faith; the only
cure of sinne-wounded consciences.</p>
            <p>6. Let but this very sense and apprehension of
God's wrath which now terrifieth thee, cause thee the
more heartily to loath all sinne; and thou shalt
thereby be assured, that God hath wounded thee, only
to heale the.</p>

7. Remember that<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 3. 19.</note> what the law saith, it saith it
only to them who are under the law, not under grace: they
are under the law who plead not guilty, and stand upon their
justification by works of the law: wee are under grace, who
seeing our sinne and misery by the law; flee wholly to him
for mercy, who<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 3. 24.</note> freely justifieth the sinner: the curses
and threatnings of the law are not to breake the<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in, and presuming to sin.</p>

               <hi>David</hi>'s confession: no

               <hi>Esau</hi>

<hi>hee sought it carefully with teares.</hi> If the <hi>grando</hi> fiered, be suddenly
cast back againe, it proves only the assailants harme or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her:
such shall <hi>Satan</hi>'s fire-works prove, if thou presently cast
out his tentations, and heartily repent thee where any of his
darts touch thee.</p>
            <p>9. Give not thy selfe over to pensive dedolency, worldly
sorrow, and fruitlesse solitarinesse: that will but feed the
bitternesse of spirit: think not too much of thy afflictions,
but sweeten them with the frequent remembrance of God's
mercy toward thee: take heed of<note n="k" place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10.</note> worldly sorrow, that
is unto death: cheer up thy selfe in God, as <hi>David</hi> did,<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 43.</note>

            </p>
            <p>10. Hearken diligently to the word of God: hee is the
God of all consolation, and the word is<note n="o" place="margin">Scripturae sacrae oracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, Deimens est, <hi>Salvian de Gub. Dei. l.</hi> 3.</note> his minde and

is no affliction incident to man, which may not there finde a
proper cure: here thou shalt finde rules to guide thee, and
keep thee from sinne: here thou shalt finde the sweet mercy
of God in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> to wash away the guilt of all thy trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions:
but be thou not only a hearer, but a constant doer
of the word, and lay the gracious promises up in thine heart;
so shalt thou in due season feele the work of God's spirit

leprosie of my sinnes stop mine own mouth: my heart answereth, that
I am unworthy that ever thou shouldst encline thy gracious eare unto so
wretched a sinner. These terrors of conscience wherewith thou hast now
afflicted my soule, are thy just judgments: the fears of hell and eternal
condemnation, wherewith thou hast wounded mee, are incomparably lesse
then my sinnes: but Lord remember them not, who canst not forget the
sufferings of thy holy sonne <hi>Jesus</hi> for them all. I am not able to answer
thee one of a thousand, nor can thy justice require that of mee, for which
my Saviour and redeemer hath satisfied: therefore I renounce my selfe,
that I may be found in thy <hi>Christ,</hi> not having on our owne righteousness,
according to the condemning letter of the law, but that I may be clothed in
his righteousnesse, who hath long since cancelled the hand-writing of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
that were against me, and payed the debt for me: Lord, for his
sake, I humbly entreat thee to turne this judgement under which I now
labour, into mercy: let it beget in my soule a true loathing of all sinne,
a stedfast purpose to forsake all my evil waies; a comfortable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of thy mercy pronouncing pardon to my afflicted conscience, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
evidence of thy holy spirit, and assurance of peace with thee: make
mee to hear of joy and gladnesse, that the bones which thou hast broken
may rejoice in thee: cast me not away from thy presence, take not the holy
Spirit the comforter from mee: but restore mee to the joy of thy salvation,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:96658:172"/>
and uphold mee with thy free spirit, despise not a broken and contrite
heart, but heale my wounded spirit: then will I teach transgressors thy
way, that they may fear thee (who art so terrible in thy justice) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

               <p>§. 1. Sense of spiritual wants afflicteth, but not so much endangereth
the soule. §. 2. What we are herein to consider. §. 3. How
we must examine the conscience. §. 4. Rules of practice hereto

            </argument>
            <p>THe second thing wounding and afflicting the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">§. I.</note>
is sense of defects, and spiritual wants: as, want
of faith, hope, assurance of salvation: want of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
purity of heart, the spirit of praier, and hearing,
want of ability rightly to performe other holy dueties. In
these the spirit is stupified and fearfully darkned in the saint
for a time: a man sometimes feeleth dulnesse to, and want of
fervency in praier, and want of comfortable assurance that
God heareth or regardeth it, because hee doth not presently
answer, or not at all grant that which wee aske: sometimes
hee feeleth a deviation of his minde, and discomposure of
thoughts, in attention, and unbeleef in hearing the word, or
reading the same: sometimes want of patience, want of love
to God, and charity to men; in fine, such a general debility,
or distemper of the inward man,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18, 19. 24.</note> that hee readily concludeth
with <hi>Paul, I know that in me</hi> (that is in my flesh) <hi>dwelleth no good
thing: for to will is present with mee: but how to perform that which is
good, I finde not: for the good that I would, I do not: but the evil which
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:96658:173"/>
I would not, that I do—O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?</hi> These are great maladies of the
soule, and wounds of the spirit: but the sense hereof (as I
sayed) is a good sign of a bad cause: where these are, and the
sinner is not sensible thereof, they are desperate <hi>Symptoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For comfort herein,<note place="margin">§. II.</note> let us (as was proposed in case of
the precedent distresse) consider</p>
            <p>1. That the very same measure of grace, which to the
present sense of a regenerate man, seemeth incompetent, may
yet be a sufficient measure to save him: and he is then strong
(by the power of <hi>Christ</hi> resting upon him, and shewing it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in mans weaknesse) when crying out for God's assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
he is most weak in his own sense:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12, 8, &amp;c.</note> so in <hi>Paul</hi>'s distresse,
the Lord thus answered his petitions, <hi>My grace is sufficient for
thee:</hi> hee saith not, it shall be, (as relating to a greater sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply)
but it <hi>is sufficient,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> as speaking of the present measure of
grace, which then hee had, when hee seemed to himselfe,
weakest.</p>
            <p>2. That the saints present measure of assurance is
such, as that they must not only give diligence to make their
calling and election sure,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10, 18.</note> that so an entrance may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
to them abundantly, into the everlasting kingdom of
<hi>Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> but (though it be God which worketh in them both to
will and to do) they must also <hi>work out their own salvation</hi> with
fear and trembling.</p>
            <p>3. All unbeleefe concludeth not a reprobate sense:
there is an unbeleefe in the elect before, and a perplexing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
thereof, after their calling; yea in their best estate
here:<note place="margin">Luke 17. 5. Mark 16. 14.</note> why else did the <hi>Apostles</hi> pray, <hi>Encrease</hi> our <hi>faith,</hi> and
why did our Saviour upbraid them with unbeleefe?</p>
            <p>4. That saving faith differeth in degrees: so that there
is a stronger and a weaker faith, yet both true, and justifying:
so do all other graces: one hath a greater and more excellent
measure of the spirit of prayer then another: one hath a
more discerning and attentive spirit of hearing then another,
and yet in either instance, the least may be true, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:96658:173"/>
for <hi>to every man is given according to the measure of Christ:</hi>
one hath ten talents,<note place="margin">Eph. 4 7.</note> another but two: yea in one and the
same mans faith, there is sometimes a greater, sometimes a
lesser measure of confidence and assurance: and so wee must
judge of other gifts: sometimes there is more fervency in
praier, sometimes lesse: the sun-beams fall not on us at all
times alike, neither doth the light of grace.</p>
            <p>5. That a true saving faith may be very weak, and the
beleever may have very little sense thereof for the time, and
yet the gates of hell shall never prevaile against it, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in <hi>Peter</hi>'s example.</p>
            <p>6. That there are doubtings and failings in the best
on earth:<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> because wee are here but partly spirit:<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> wee are
not yet come to perfection:<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> faith here must receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tintuall
encreases, and be subject to tryals:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 6.</note> so must all
other graces.</p>
            <p>7. That true faith can never, never shall finally
fall away, or utterly faile, though it be subject to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension</hi>
and <hi>remission:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 22. 31.</note> because <hi>Christ</hi> intercedeth for us,
as hee said to <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 29.</note> Behold, <hi>Satan</hi> hath desired <hi>that hee
may sift you as wheat:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13. 48.</note> 
               <hi>but I have prayed for thee, that thy
faith faile not:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Remitti po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, non amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti: secundum gradum, non secundum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum.</note> because his grace by which wee are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and stand, is immutable, in the counsell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God: and because hereto wee are scaled up by the
holy spirit of promise: and the like wee are to judge
of all the fruits of sanctification,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 21, 22.</note> which being the gifts
and graces of God, are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, such as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth
not of, neither finally with-draweth.</p>
            <p>Wee must here againe examine the conscience: I have
spoken something concerning the examination of faith
in the 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> but intend here onely those things
which concerne this present Argument of comforting
the afflicted soule: aske thy conscience therefore,
whether</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:96658:174"/>
1. Thou hast indeed a true sense of thy spirituall
wants, and grievest at thy corruptions of heart, which on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
occasion breake out into acts of sin against God; is this a
grievous burden unto thee? be comforted, thy sin is out of it
proper place, a stranger unto thee: for nothing in it owne
place is heavy. The danger is want of sense, and taking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in unrighteousnesse: if a man feele not when hee is
wounded, hee is either dead, or in some dangerous <hi>ectasie.</hi>
No part hath sense but the living: though it were for the
present more comfortable to be whole, yet sense of smart in
thy wounds,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> concludeth life, and indeed, in God's cures
(who maketh all things work for the best to them that love
him) a better state (in respect of the quiet fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
accrewing to them that are thereby exercised, and
the ulcerous corruptions of our souls, often necessitating our
wounding that we may be healed) then the secure prosperity
of sinners:<note place="margin">Psal 119.</note> it is good at the last for the saint that he hath been
troubled. When thou hearest or readest the Scriptures, doest
thou feele the want of saith, assurance, sanctification, the
spirit and fervency of praier? be comforted: as the sunnes
eclipse, and failing of light towards us, can be discerned by
no light but it own; so neither can the want of grace be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
discerned by any thing but grace.</p>
            <p>2. Hast thou an hearty desire to have these wants of
grace supplied? feare not, that very desire of grace is grace;
without which thou couldst not desire it.<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Blessed are they who
doe hunger and thirst after righteousnesse: for they shall be filled.</hi> God
will never famish that soul which desireth him and his saving
health: none can hunger but the living; none hunger for
grace, but hee that liveth thereby: but thy desire of grace
must be hearty, not languid: such as cannot rest unsatisfied
with any thing else in the world: there may be a feeble or

but hee more loved the wages of unrighteousnesse: the
most happy thirst for the waters of life is that which afflicteth
the soule, till it be obtained; which can never rest or joy in
any thing without it: so that indeed this very condition
which so much afflicteth and affrighteth thee, is the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:96658:174"/>
and happy; and thou shalt once know, that which hee

            </p>
            <p>3. In sense of spiritual wants, aske thy soule whether
ever thou hadst that whereof thou now feelest the want? if
thou hadst, be assured it shall revive againe, and finally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
as it is written,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Whosoever is born of God overcometh the
world:</hi> and this is the victory that overcometh—<hi>our faith.</hi>
And this sense and sorrow is a certain token of thy recovery
and soules health, as that seven times neesing of the <hi>Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>
sonne, before hee opened his death-closed eies, was, of
his lifes returning. If thou never yet hadst the grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
thou now beginnest to feele the want, it appeareth by this
sense, that now thou shalt have it: and this trouble of thy
soule,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> is but as the moving of <hi>Bethesda</hi> waters, a certain signe
of an healing power descended thereinto.</p>
            <p>4. Aske thy conscience,<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 17.</note> as the Prophet saith, <hi>Hast thou
not procured this unto thy selfe?</hi> this of which thou complainest
of? hast thou not neglected the appointed meanes? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
want of faith perplexe thee; hast thou not carelesly
heard the Gospel? hast thou layed it up in a carefull heart?
hast thou valued it, and begged it fervently and frequently
of God, above all things in the world? Thou complainest
of want of the spirit of praier; hast thou not neglected this
duety in times past? doest thou duely prepare thyself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
doest thou use that vigilancy which <hi>Christ</hi> enjoined,
<hi>Watch and pray;</hi> by re-calling thy profane and wandring
thoughts from their extravagancies, and in all attention of
spirit fixing them on <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> thou feelest the want of
sanctification in thy heart, tongue, and actions? Ask thy
conscience, if thou hast not heretofore buried the checks
thereof, for some vaine pleasure or profit's sake? If thou
wouldst have the effect cease, remove the cause. God will
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:96658:175"/>
have his ordinances duely observed, wherein they shall never
want their promised effect.</p>
            <p>5. Ask thy conscience whether thou doest not live in
some grievous sinne? It is but folly to cry out of the heat
and still cast oil on the fire: if it be an <hi>Achan</hi>'s wedge hidden,
search for the cursed thing,<note place="margin">1 King. 8. 38.</note> and the plague in thine own heart,
in the cure whereof thou shalt be comforted; if it be a
sleeping <hi>Jonah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 22. 23.</note> cast him over-board: as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> said, <hi>If thou
return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up: thou shalt put iniquity
farre from thy tabernacles—the Almighty shall be thy defence—then
shalt thou have delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto
God: thou shalt make thy praier unto him, and he shall hear thee</hi>—The
rules of practice are,<note place="margin">§. IV.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Heare God's word preparedly, that is, (as hath
been said) renew thy repentance, and pray for a blessing
thereon: heare it reverendly, and attentively: faith is by
hearing; so is sanctification, Gods spirit working upon his
own ordinance to make it active thereto. The very cause
why so many hear, so often, and so few, so seldome practice,
and receive true comfort thereby, is because they prepare
not, but are like men that sow among thorns.</p>
            <p>2. Let faith (and all other graces) be precious to
thee, for his sake whom it apprehendeth: God will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
his inestimable gifts on men who sleight and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
them: how few set a right estimate on precious faith, the
spirit of praier, or memory of good things, till it be too late?
things of this world are rated high enough: but where is the
man that riseth early, late takes rest, eats the bread of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
ventureth sea and land, to get faith and sanctity?

condition with others: thou art possibly not heard in thy
prayers? not to say, Doest thou aske according to his will?
I say, mark Gods work, which is to save thee and make thee
eternally blessed: if he do that by a means which he knoweth

this means more confirm it? Is not every temptation as the
shaking of the trees, which loosning the ground maketh them

his oracles: thus hee exerciseth thee to humility, without

this, and live) is so farre from helping or releeving mee, that now, by
reason of my infirmity, it becometh to mee a killing letter; at best but
like the Prophets staff sent before by the ministery of the servant, not able
to give life, only shewing mee my sinnes, and rendring me guilty, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Lord let the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> the Prophet himselfe, <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> my

that hee is my <hi>Jesus</hi> and Saviour: that according to thine owne

gracious promise in him, I may live with thee. Blessed Saviour, who
sentest the holy Ghost the comforter of all thine elect, to thy afflicted Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
to strengthen them, send him to my more feeble and wretched soul:
it is neither of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of thine
own goodnesse, shewing mercy: thou workest both the will and the deed
of thy good pleasure: be graciously pleased to sanctify my corrupted will
and affections: as thou hast given me a will, and an hearts desire to
serve and please thee, that I might be saved, so perfect thine owne worke
in mee, establish that thing which thou hast begunne: will thou, that I
will not in vaine: thou hast nothing the lesse by communicating thy
goodnesse to others, Lord give me true holinesse, repaire thine own image
in mee, that thou maist own mee for thine: manifest thine own worke
in mee, unto mee. Let not the good spirit which dwelleth in mee, be
any longer hidden from mee: Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> manifest thy selfe unto my

that I may no more doubt of thy mercies: give mee an evident victory
over sinne and despaire, by the manifest presence of the comforter; Lord
my afflicted soule knoweth no sanctuary but thy mercy: unto thee it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speth,

which may refresh my wearied spirit, and fill mee with the fruits of
righteousnesse, which may appeare in my life and conversation, to
thy glory, and the assurance of my election, calling, sanctification, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,

cometh to full maturity: 1. Suggestion. 2. Delight
therein. 3. Consent to. 4. Acting the same; as <hi>James

sinne when it is finished, bringeth sorth death:</hi> the first of these
(a bare suggestion) is not our sinne, if there be no delight

speaketh a mans will such: declining from good, and encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>5. Tentation of tryal to the saint, is but as fire to gold;
it purifieth and maketh more precious in Gods esteem: as 'tis

death of his saints; and<note n="o" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 7.</note>

               <hi>When he hath tryed mee, I shall come forth as gold:</hi> tentation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

thy selfe, Can the refiner of gold so provide, that he will
not loose it in the fornace? can the husband-man so use the
winde, that hee will not loose the corne, but thereby
cleanse it from the chasse? and canst thou think that God
will loose thee, by permitting thee to temptations? Assure
thy selfe hee cannot erre: hee measureth all, is faithfull,
and<note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> will not suffer thee to be tryed above that thou art
able. Hee knoweth<note n="r" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 9.</note>

<hi>Christ</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> in whom was no sin, was tempted: that thou art
tempted, is no argument of despair: I know not how, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth are here so mixed together, wee being<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> partly
spirit, and partly flesh, that wee cannot be as wee would:
wee finde an irksom law in our selves, against our selves:
our repaire is something, and supernatural, but so short of
that which shall be, that our selves (like the<note n="d" place="margin">Ezra 3. 13</note> 
               <hi>Israëlites</hi> in

be free, then our being so.</p>
            <p>9. Lastly consider that Gods grace (who at his pleasure
<note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 20. 1, 2, 3.</note> chaineth up the tempter) is<note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9</note> sufficient for thee. Hee
restraineth him so much, that hee cannot be a lying spirit in
the mouths of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets, untill hee have leave (to
tempt him out to his destruction) from him who justly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
to strong delusions, that they should perish in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
lies, who receive not the love of the trueth, that
they might be saved: God knoweth best how farre hee will
suffer thee to be tempted, and accordingly measureth out
the sufficiency of grace to all the regenerate. Why hee suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<hi>David</hi> so dangerously to fall, why <hi>Peter,</hi> why <hi>Paul,</hi> I
know not, except to humble them, and leave us motives to
repentance: I am sure his judgements are ever just.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. II.</note> wee are againe (for comfort in
this case) to examine</p>
            <p>1. Whether art thou delighted in the temptation, or
no? if thou neither delight in, nor consent to it, but rather
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:96658:179"/>
startlest at it, as a thing which thy soul loaths and abhorrs,
it shall not hurt thee.</p>
            <p>2. Whether the temptation which commonly afflicteth
thee, be such as probably ariseth from the corruption of
thine owne heart, which is usually inferred by the thoughts
discourse from one thing to another, by direct or naturall
<hi>mediums:</hi> but if it be a temptation of <hi>Satan</hi>'s, cast into thy
soule, it is commonly abrupt, and such as thou didst not
think of, incongruous, sudden, unnatural sometimes, and
such as thou tremblest at, as blasphemous, bloody, or
desperate: though in some temptations hee maketh use of
that wee see or heare, joining himselfe with our natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to sinne: so are those<note n="h" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. Gal, 5. 20.</note> 
               <hi>stimuli carnis,</hi> his messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
like traytors corrupted by some foraigne State, against
their native soile: if a temptation arise of corrupted nature,
the cure must be by beating down carnal reason and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of flesh: if of <hi>Satan,</hi> the very discovery is enough to
make thee hate it, and that to overcome it; seeing if wee
yeeld not he is overcome.</p>
            <p>3. When thou art moved to any thing, whether within
thee, as by suggestion, or without thee, as by perswasions
of men<note n="i" place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 1.</note> examine the spirits, whether they are of God, or
no: thou maist not beleeve all: because many false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are gone out into the world; and God hereby<note n="k" place="margin">Deut. 13. 3.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
you, to know whether you love the Lord your God
with all your heart: and the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith,<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19</note> 
               <hi>there must be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies</hi>
(or sects) <hi>among you:</hi> examine therefore whether they
bring any propositions against faith, (the substance of the
Gospel) sanctimony commanded in Gods law, peace, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
charity, and unity: to the end that if we finde any thing
in mens perswasions, or any inward suggestions, contrary
hereto, wee may conclude them carnal, earthly, sensual,
and devillish, and so take course to resist them; which may
be by the practice of these following rules.</p>
            <p>1. Every day dedicate thy first and thy last waking
thoughts to God in earnest and hearty praier,<note place="margin">§. III.</note> to preserve thee
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:96658:179"/>
from temptations, and to guide all thy thoughts, words,
and actions, so that waking thou maist walke sincerely in
his presence, and sleeping rest confidently in his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

like an holy prophet, with lying visions, to bewitch the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

destroy the cockatrice egges, least breaking out into a fiery

               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Lord God of mercy, encline my heart unto thy testimonies, and
not unto covetousnesse: the vigilant tempter hath his snares in
every estate, in poverty, worldly sorrow, and affectation of unjust sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies:
in riches, pride, luxury, love of the world, distracting cares, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of thy holy ordinance, and forgetfulnesse of thee: but, O Lord, make
good thine own gifts to mee: give me such an heart to use the blessings,
which thou hast bestowed upon me, that it may be eternally good for my
soul, that I had them for this time. It is not, O Lord, for man to adde
any thing to his estate; thy hand maketh rich, thou raisest the poor out
of the dust, and settest him with the Princes of the people: riches come
of thee; not from the West or East: my condition in my birth was no
better then the poorest mans: naked cam I into this world: I was cast
upon thee from the womb: and what am I, O Lord, that thou hast given
mee this abundance? All that is in heaven and earth is thine: both
riches and honour come of thee: and in thine hand it is, to make rich and
great: I am but a stranger before thee, as all my fathers were. All this
store wherewith thou hast blessed mee and mine, is of thine hand, and
thine own: that thou hast put this abundance into mine hand, it is to
try me hereby: now therefore prepare my heart nnto thee: give me true
thankefulnesse, and those riches which shall never be taken away: keepe
my heart that I may never forget thee in the abundance which by thy

proportionably faithful in managing this estate; that I may soberly and

               <hi>shall
take nothing of his labour, which hee shall carry away in his hand:</hi>
there is no man liveth so poore as hee was born: be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with thy something, though it be not so much.</p>
            <p>3. Consider Gods promises: hee hath said, hee will not
faile thee nor forsake thee: the whole world hath no such
assurance of constant supplies. If all the Kings of the earth
should enter into league and binde themselves by oath, and
under their broad seales, never to forsake thee, but to supply
thee with all necessaries, yet they might faile: all power
and will of the creatures is subject to obstructions and lets:
but God can neither be untrue, nor defeated in his counsels:
though heaven and earth passe away, his word shall not fail.
The poor mans security that he shall never want that which
is best for him, is in Gods hands, and hee hath Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
for it: now let him that is impatient of poverty, but
seriously consider, first whether, if he had riches in his own
keeping (as rich men have) had he better security by his own
keeping them, then in Gods promise to supply and keep
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:96658:190"/>
him and them? But some may say, I desire that God would
keep them in my possession. What can thy possession adde
to thy security of having and enjoying them, where God
keepeth them? What can finites adde to infinites? I but
(saist thou) if I had an estate in mine own possession, I could
live more confidently, and comfortably: the reason of that
is, not a greater certainty in thy estate (for that is surest in
Gods hands) but a lesse faith in thee, then becometh those
who have the infallible trueth of God for their assurance:
and because thou repliest more on thy senses, then on God's
Oracles; and the creatures, then the Creator himself. Thou
saist, But yet for all the promises, my want is a great bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
to my soule: yet if God seeth it good to cure that
sick minde with bitter pills (such as poverty is confessed) and
so to save thee; which wouldst thou chuse (if God should
referre it to thee) that which thou thinkest best for thee, or
that which God knoweth to be so; to perish with riches, or
to be saved by poverty? Unhappy sure were wee, and must
often perish, if God would not in mercy deny us our choice,
and chuse for us.</p>
            <p>4. Consider how Gods deerest children have wanted,
and so do still. See <hi>Job 30. 3, 9. Hebr. 11. 37, 38. 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 11.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27. Art thou better then those of whom the world

            <p>6. Consider how God hath<note n="z" place="margin">1 King, 17, 16.</note> supplied the wants of his:

remember that hee saith<note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 10 3.</note> hee will not famish the soule of

            </p>
            <p>7. Consider that God hath not spared his own holy son

thee the lives of thy fellow creatures, (good for meat) to

            <p>6. If thou make a good use of thy imprisonment, thou
maist finde many considerable advantages therein: it will
teach thee, which are thy fast friends: it enlargeth a well
resolved minde: it bringeth to minde the errour and abuse
of former liberty, that thou maist thereby be disposed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for the same: it acquainteth thee with exercises of
patience: fixeth in thee holy resolutions: guards the eare
from many turbulent clamours which torment the more free
eare: it restraineth the roving eies from seeing that vanity of
the world, which made <hi>Democritus</hi> laugh, and <hi>Heraclite</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
weep: it restraineth many from destructive liberty:
it is a riged and unpleasing, but profitable school of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and patience. It is the glasse that more truely sheweth
a man himselfe, then liberty ever can; not to deject the
minde to despair and worldly sorrow, but to raise it to a due
consideration of the causes of Gods judgments, which being
ever just, must bring a good man to the deep consideration of
the end of his suffering, and prove an happy <hi>stimulus</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

as<note n="k" place="margin">2 Chron 33. 13.</note> it did to <hi>Manasses,</hi> who found his best li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

               </gap>ines of death in health, and so
must teach a wise man to prepare there, before the evil daies,
and restlesse paines (death's importunate harbingers) come
and leave no roome for good counsel and resolution. Here
thou maist finde some liberty to serve God, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
did; to pray and sing Psalmes at least: and who can say,
that God did not therefore confine thee, seeing thee too at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
to the world, and carelesse of holy duties, that the
prison might teach thee devotion, which thy liberty could
not? There are many things which may befall thee for thy

and adversity—<note n="q" place="margin">Eccl 4. 14.</note> 
               <hi>out of the prison hee cometh to reigne,</hi>
whereas also hee that is borne in his kingdome, becometh

best for thee; it may be, there is but one doore into the
prison, there are many out: either mercy, or violence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
reward, favor of men, or the <hi>Angel</hi> of God; either
man, or death, (which hath a key to open every doore)
shall set thee free; if nothing else enlarge thee, that will not
faile thee at the appointed houre: and variable are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:96658:196"/>
to which the prison rendreth men; as <hi>I. Caesar</hi> to an

death. I need not these who read of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s servants,
<hi>James, Peter, Joseph, John Baptist:</hi> the prison sendeth some
to heaven, some to destruction: sooner, or later; one way
or other it rendreth all. I only note that the most infamous
temporal end it rendreth men unto, can be no obstruction
and hindrance to their eternal happinesse in <hi>Christ,</hi> who
therefore submitted himselfe to the then most infamous
death, that hee might<note n="r" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13. Deut. 21. 23.</note> take away the curse of the law,
which saith, <hi>cursed is every one which hangeth on a tree.</hi> The
main skill therefore is, and the only certain comfort against
imprisonment or death, to gain assurance that thou ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in
<hi>Christ,</hi> in every place and condition doing those things
which may further thy certainty thereof: to which observe
such like rules:</p>
            <p>1. Keepe innocency,<note place="margin">§. III.</note> that if thou suffer, it may be
wrongfully:<note n="s" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 19, 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> for this is <hi>thanke worthy, if a man for conscience
toward God, endureth griefe, suffering wrongfully—if when yee doe
well, and suffer for it, yee take it patiently, this is acceptable to
God.</hi> And if thou hast lost the first parts of innocency, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire
not, but lay hold on the second table of repentance:
the penitent theefe on the crosse, who confessed hee justly
suffered, yet heard of <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Luke 23. 41 43.</note> 
               <hi>this day thou shalt be with mee
in Paradise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Search thy heart diligently, least some secret sin
causeth this affliction, in case it appear not that thou justly
sufferest of men. See <hi>Isai.</hi> 42. 22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>3. Think how long these imperious masters can hold
thee there, and feare not them who only can imprison and
destroy the body, but fear and trust in him, who can cast
body and soule into hell, and save thee from thy oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors:
prepare thee to entertain death cheerfully: hee shall
once come like the<note n="u" place="margin">Act 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> and take thee out in
spight of the most rigid keepers:<note n="w" place="margin">Iob 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>there the prisoners rest toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
that shall free thy body from a loathed prison, and thy
soul from an afflicted body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:96658:197"/>
4. Improve thy time to some good: some birds sing
sweetest in the cage: that excellent <hi>monument</hi> which beareth
the title of <hi>the first part of the worlds general history</hi> is an example
hereof.</p>
            <p>5. Keep thy minde free from all reigning sin, and in
spight of all geives and fetters, and the bespattering of
black and unhallowed mouths, thou shalt have a more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
freedom in prison, then thy persecuters have in their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
besides that their accompt with the eternal justice of
God, is to come and yet not closed: nothing but sinnes
can miserably enthral: wee may well say to them, as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
to the men of <hi>Judah,</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Iudg. 15 12</note> 
               <hi>Swear to mee that you will not fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mee:</hi> I fear none other bonds: hee is a free-man whose
conscience accuseth him not: God's service in every state is
the best freedom.</p>
            <p>6. Subject thy minde to inevitable necessity, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
bearing; the way to make bonds more heavy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
is vainly to struggle with them: if thy minde
were to stay within, thy confinement were no prison: it were
a punishment to command thee out: if thy minde be relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant,
thou straitnest thy selfe, a <hi>nè exeat regnum</hi> may make
some man think <hi>England</hi> a prison: the old man who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gone out of the city gates, receiving, a warrant from the
<hi>Prince,</hi> prohibiting his going out, could not rest till he had
stollen out: it was his city before, but the restraint made it
a prison to an impatient minde: if thy minde having a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
compliance, thy prison becometh no prison to thee:
an impatient wearisome minde, maketh a kingdome no
more.</p>
            <p>7. Be thou meek in affliction, and thou shalt be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate

not willingly, nor grievest the children of men to crush under

Lord our redeemer hear them in an acceptable time, and help them in the
day of salvation: preserve the oppressed and despised of men: say unto
the prisoners, Goe forth, and to them that are in darknesse, Shew
your selves; binde up the broken hearted, proclaime liberty to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives,
and opening the prison to them that are shut up: comfort them that
mourne, let their deep sighing come before thee: according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

lift thou up my head: enlarge my feet, bring me out of bondage, that I
may live to serve and praise thee in the assemblies of thy servants: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

Lord, thy mercy is not changed, thine arme shortened, nor thine eare

of our unhallowed thoughts, corrupt words, and sinful actions, as
that if there were neither in earth or heaven, among men, or Angels,

wills, rectifie our sinful affections, and subject them all to thine owne
holy will and pleasure: frame every faculty of our soules and bodies to a

Lord gather dayly to her such as thou hast elected to salvation: enlighten
those who have not yet known thy name: take off the <hi>vaile</hi> from the

confirmation of us, whom thou hast called, until our fulness be come in.
Discover and confound the man of sinne, daily abolishing the <hi>mystery
of iniquity,</hi> by the brightnesse of thy coming, the sword of the spirit
and evident preaching the Gospel to all nations; until thou shalt at thy
second coming manifest thy selfe our Saviour and Redeemer, and wipe
all teares from our eies: even so come Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> And now, O Lord,
who lookest with a tender eie upon the pressures of thy servants, let the
sighing of the Prisoners come before thee, and according to the greatnesse
of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die: be merciful to
us here present before thee: we have indeed at thy hands (against whom
wee have sinned) deserved this rod: but, O our God, correct us in
mercy, not in thine anger; for what are wee in thy hands, and who can
stand before thee, when thou art angry? Wee have not rendred unto
thee according to thy goodnesse: wee have surfeited on the sweet blessings
of peace, and abused our liberties, not valuing the benefit thereof, but
vainly reckoning it among our hereditary possessions, as if it might never
be taken from us, when we had freedom to goe into the assemblies of thy
children, the places where thine honour dwelleth, to hear thy word and
present our supplications unto thee; Lord how often have vain pleasures
or worldly profits detained us? or coming before thee? how seldom have
wee returned with any fruits of amendment? therefore doest thou now
teach us by wanting these comforts, their estimate, which wee would not
know, while wee enjoyed them. But, O good God, seeing thy fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
are not to destroy, but to amend us, give us now good understanding
by these chastisements: give us discerning spirits, that through these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
we may look up to the hand that smiteth us, and by our corrections
gain a true loathing and detestation of all the sins for which thou art dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with us: Lord, if it may stand with thine honor; enlarge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us in mercy, restore every man to his own family, to the mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of us and ours, that with them we may praise thy holy name, and better
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:96658:201"/>
serve thee then ever wee have done: if otherwise, Lord proportion our
patience to our tryals: forsake us not in our sad distresses: be thou ever
present with us, that we may rest assured of thy mercies: give us peace
of conscience, and a blessed freedom from the bondage of sin, that wee
may therein know, that neither stone walls, nor armed guards can shut
thy holy spirit the comforter from us, nor bar our praiers from ascending
up to thee. Lord, as our tryals encrease, encrease our comforts in thee;
so that as the more it rained, the more the <hi>arke</hi> was listed up, in which
thou hadst enclosed those whom thou didst thereby save in a perishing
world, so the more our afflictions are showred down upon us, the more
let our soules be lifted up unto thee, and to those things which
are above with thee, that we being weaned from the vain love of this
world, may have our conversation in heaven, and be willing to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that we may live with our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> eternally. And now being
by thy appointment to take our bodily rest, wee pray thee to assure us of
our peace with thee, through the merits of thy holy son <hi>Jesus:</hi> let our
beds put us in remembrance of our graves to which wee are descending,
that wee may keep a faithful watch to the coming of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> for
our deliverance out of these earthly tabernacles: let thy providence keep
us and all ours from the powers of darknesse, and all dangers of body and

also the consolation thereof among the fruits of Sanctity.</p>
            <p>2. There are three kindes of Banishment to which the

some one foreigne place. 2. Inderdiction of the native
soile onely. 3. Limitation of mens approaches to some

lawes of that Republick, whereof wee are a part) we
have a civil right to some of them: now though depriving
hereof by God, is ever just (because no man liveth, and
sinneth not; and thereby often forfeiteth life, liberty, and
all to his justice) yet this punishment inflicted by men, against
a divine and civil right, may make the Judges extreamly
guilty, though it can never make the proscribed Saint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy:

and therefore are not banished, because they live willingly
there? how few live where they were borne? how many

               </gap>nce, I say onely, that in
thy exile, others doe that for thee by violence, which thou
shouldst have done for thy selfe in discretion, that is, they
withdraw thee from the injurious and wicked: thou wouldst
not count it any loss to thee to be taken away from serpents,
or to be drawne out of a perishing <hi>Sodom,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> was: why
shouldst thou think it any losse to be taken away from men
worse then serpents, (they are good in their kinde) men that
have the <hi>poison of aspes</hi> under their <hi>lips?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thou maist say, the grief is, to leave my goods, lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
dear friends, wife and children: Truely this is the
affliction of the parted, and the curse of the parters: the
pleasant possessions made <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife look back; but yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
1. That hee that kept thee at home, can provide
for thee abroad, and if thou trust in him, will: hee can
restore thee to those dear jewels hee gave thee: however thy
praiers for them, are as neere heaven in exile, as at home:
count them not lost, no not dying: they but goe before
thee: wherein if thou canst satisfie thy afflicted minde; what
other great emolument canst thou loose by changing place?
If thou have the same judgement, dexterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fortitude, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
justice, health, strength, means to get necessaries, all
which may there be found, where thou thinkest thy selfe
lost: hereto adde, that God by this means taketh men away
from destruction, rather then their country, as he did <hi>Lot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Consider whether all those things, whose losse thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentest,
be truely goods: perhaps they hurt thee, or are not
thine: it is certain thou couldst be but a tenant at will: they
only are thy goods which cannot be taken from thee in life
or death: reckon like a wise man, and in the testimony of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:96658:204"/>
a good conscience, thou maist also say, all that is mine, I
carry with mee, and so not have a dangerous eie backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
3. Consider well the difference between acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and friends: how many friends thou hast left, may best
appear in thy tryals? how many of these shadowes follow
thee now thou art clouded? doe they not feare thy mine?
doth not that set a strange distance between you? are these
thy friends, or such acquaintance as thou maist every where
finde? Againe; how many malicious enemies hast thou left
behinde, who have often so embittered thy soule, that
thou hast cryed out, <hi>Wo is mee that I sojourne in Meshech, that I
dwell in the tents of Kedar: my soul hath long dwelt with him that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
peace?</hi> so that upon a just account, thou art not so much
banished thy country, as taken from impious enemies.
4. Lastly, be confident that what ever is good, wee shall
meet withal again in the immutable happinesse of heaven:
what ever cannot come thither, is not worth our lamenting

have an end: so that they cannot last long: it is of excellent

use to patience or moderation, to consider well in all temporall
interest, how long we can suffer or enjoy. 12. Sicknesse is the
soules physick: nothing will amend him whom sicknesse cannot
we endure hard things patiently for the cure of the body: and
what is the health thereof without the soules health? Of what
certainty or continuance is it at our best strength? Are the
flowers or bubles more fraile? If we are wise we will not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell

13. Hereby we learne what we owed to God for health,
and in recovery, what use to make thereof, which is, that wee be
truely thankfull; that we more holily employ the same, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that God restored us not to sin: that we accompt it lent us
for a time, to prove us: ever remembring that wee must againe
be sick and dye: that wee betray not the good health (which

to death, and selfe-destruction, by surfetting, drinking, glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

               <p>And now, O gracious Father, though wee are most unworthy to
speake unto thee for our selves; yet seeing thou hast commanded us to
call upon thee one for another, with promise that the prayers for the
righteous shall be available if they be fervent; so that they shall
save the sick; that thou wilt raise them up, and if they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

our sick brother, Lord assure him of his sinnes remission by the merits
of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> give him that peace of conscience and inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

him. There is nothing impossible to thee which thou wilt doe, heare
therefore and have mercy on him: only speake the word and blesse the
meanes, that he may be healed: if otherwise thou hast determined,
thy holy will be done: Lord who canst make all things happy to thy

given thyne angells charge over him, to pitch their tents about him;
so be pleased in this time of tryall to open to him the eie of faith,
whereby he may cleerely perceive that they are more and stronger
with him, then can be against him. send the holy spirit, the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

gracious promises which thou hast made thine elect. <hi>Blessed Jesus,</hi>

have experience of our miseries, who best knowest what it is to dy,
having in thyne own death and bitterest passion overcome death

and him that had the power thereof, to deliver us from sinne, and
destruction the bitter fruite and effect therof: now appeare his
comforter, assuring him of his interest in thy sufferings: give him
such a sense of thy mercy, that the gates of hell may never prevaile
against it: such experience of the life of thy spirit, and power by
which thou didst rise againe from the dead, that hee may certainely
know that his Redeemer liveth, and shall at last shew the same power
in his resurrection, in which he shall, with the rest of thine elect, at
the voyce of the last trumpet, be raised from the dust of the earth,
to meet thee in the clouds of heaven, to see thee with those now lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
eyes, which must at and to the appointed time, be cloased
to sleep in thee, that hee may rest from his labours. And now O Lord
who hast hid from us the houre of our dissolution, that we might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

with thee into thy kingdom, where all sorrow shall cease in the fulnes

and corruption in a never ending life of glory and immortality.

might judge and condemne my selfe for them, thereby to prevent thy
severe judgement, shall yet by no meanes escape thy strict examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

therefore on his bleeding wounds who did not in vaine dye for me: let
thy justice be satisfied in his obedience and suffering for all my sins.

the time of my departure hence draweth high. I humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

this fraile condition to be the due wages of sinne which brought
mortality into the world, but thou who didst put thine owne image on
me hast not made me for so short a life only, as thou givest unto the
beasts which perish: thou hast no need of my miserie, nor advantage
in my destruction, nor could so inestimable a price of my redemption,
as the blood of thy holy sonne <hi>Jesus,</hi> be given for that which thou
wouldst have perish eternally. He must surely live for whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection

that it may be like his own glorious body; let me hence forth live his
life, no more mine own, assured thereby of the repaire of mine inward
man to a joyfull resurrection and life of glory: that he may be to me
in life and death advantage: that in full confidence of my union
with, and interest in him, I may be willing to bee dissolved that I
may be with him. O holy <hi>Saviour,</hi> who hast through death abolished
death and him that had the power thereof, take from me all carnall
feare by bringing life and immortality to light unto my conscience:
thou that hast in thy hands the keyes of death and hell, restraine the
tempters malice and mischievous charges of my sinne-wounded soule:
make me faithfull unto the death and assure mee of the crowne of
righteousnesse laid up for all that love thy appearing. Raise me now
to the life of grace, that the second death may not touch mee. And
though thou bring this fraile flesh to the dust of the earth; yet let not
death have dominion over me. Though it must (to the appointed
time) separate my soule from this decaying tabernacle of clay; let nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life nor death, things present nor future, seperate my soule from
thee and thy <hi>Christ.</hi> I acknowledge thy mercy who justly mightest
have taken me away in my sins, by some sodaine and untimely death;
or set me (who am by sinne a sonne of death) in the condition of those
who in horrour of a restlesse conscience and bitternesse of spirit, seeke
death and cannot finde it: but O good God, whose eye is upon them that
feare thee to deliver their soules from death, in whose hands are the
issues thereof; seeing thou hast thus long spared me, now accomplish
thy mercy in me: be thou my God for ever, and my guide unto my

out thy soule to death for me, receive my wearied spirit to eternall
life: let not this fearefull passage be too bitter to mee: bee thou ever
present with me in all my sufferings: <hi>O holy Ghost</hi> the comforter
of all the elect, leave me not comfortlesse; let me be gathered to my
fathers in peace: bring me to that life wherein thou hast promised to
wipe away all teares from our eyes. where shall bee no more death,
sorrow, paine, nor any bitter effects of sinne: Lord heare me: Lord who
despisest not a broken and contrite heart have mercy upon me: Lord
