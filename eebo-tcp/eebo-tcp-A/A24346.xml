            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT Of a Late, Horrid and Bloody MASSACRE in IRELAND, Of ſeveral thouſands of Proteſtants; procur'd and carry'd on by the L. <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and his Adherents.</head>
            <head type="sub">Which Occaſioned the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under the Conduct of the Lords <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Mountjoy,</hi> &amp;c. To ſeize and ſecure the ſaid <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in order to be ſent for <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FRom the death of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the the Second, of bleſſed Memory, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> date their Happineſs; and from the firſt Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>Talbot,</hi> to the Earldom of <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel,</hi> they conclude on the continuance of it: the crafty Prieſts to raiſe the Natives Zeal to the Cauſe, having Inſinuated, by way of Prophecy, into their Minds, <hi>That one of that Title ſhould free them from the Slavery of their Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and render that Kingdom free and in</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47839:2"/>
               <hi>dependent of all other Nations:</hi> And that as I have been credibly inform'd, made the now Governour Sue to the King for that particular Title, by which he did not only ſatisfie his own Ambition, but rais'd his Reputation ſo among the Iriſh, as they look'd upon him now no otherwiſe than their Guardian Angel and Deliverer. And now being Commiſſioned by the King, first to be Check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Master General to the Army, and preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lord Deputy, and General Governour (though directly contrary to an Act of Parliament, which admits of no <hi>Iriſhman</hi> born to that Office) his firſt buſineſs was to new Model the Army, which in one Years time he did ſo effectually, that of ſeven or eight thouſand, there was hardly one Hundred Officers and Soldiers of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> left; the Name of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> being a Crime too great to be ſuff red in any Military or Civil Imployment, he having the whole diſpoſal of all the firſt, and most of the other. Having now ſecured, and rendered himſelf Formidable to the

               <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> his next care was to ruine the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Estates of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> throughout the Kingdom; which he struck at by making <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> Judges, in the Courts of Judicature, by diſſolving the Charters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by packing of furies, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning Witneſſes, diſcountenancing the <hi>Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Councils,</hi> &amp;c. So that in moſt Cauſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the court of Exchequer; not the Right, but the Religion of the Defendant was chiefly conſidered: By this time Matters grew to ſuch a Head, that His Lordſhip thought it neceſſary to diſarm the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but this Reſolve not proving very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, he pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ceeded to weaken the <hi>Engliſh</hi> firſt, and afterwards to provoke them by publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and reproaches, branding all proteſtants promiſcuouſly, with the title of whiggs and rebels; the commonalty threatning daily what they would do if the <hi>King</hi> ſhould Die, proteſting with bitter execrations, that they would never part with the ſword now they bad it, and daily marking out to

themſelves ſuch and ſuch proportions of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Eſtates: All this notwithſtanding, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh patiently bore, making no other return than by applying themſelves to ſome of the Engliſh Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who repreſented their Caſe to the King, though without Redreſs: But now the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> Coming to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being made known, <hi>Tryconnel</hi> preſently takes the Alarm, and reſolving on all the Injuries done to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> made no doubt of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to revenge; therefore no ſooner the News of the <hi>Dutch</hi> landing arriv'd, but he ſends his Emiſſary's to exaſperate the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> by telling them that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bad ſent for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to cut off the King, and destroy the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks throughout the three Kingdoms; ſo that in ſeveral places the <hi>Iriſh</hi> roſe and deſtroyed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Families; the Deputy Iſſuing out at the ſame time, an Order to diſarm all the Proteſtants; reſolving that if matters miſcaried bere in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to cut them all off, and ſet up fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

aecording to the Sham-prophecy aforementioned. But the Earl of <hi>Grenard,</hi> a very Noble and Worthy Proteſtant, and one exceeding powerful in the North, where the chief of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtrength lies; hearing of this Order, went boldly to the Deputy, deſiring to know if he had Order from the King to diſarm the Proteſtants, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſee it, was refus'd: whereupon he told his Lordſhip plainly, it ſhould not be executed, if he could hinder it; and communicating preſently the Deſign, to the reſt of the Proteſtant Nobility and Gentry; then forthwith ſent Intelligence to all parts, with Advice to stand in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the utmoſt: which we hope, with ſome ſpeedy Aſſiſtance from <hi>England,</hi> will preſerve that Intereſt in the Kingdom, which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants with their Blood, have dearly bought.</p>
            <p>For this ſeaſonable Intelligence, being well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, by the Nobility and Gentry of the Engliſh Intereſt; they preſently importune the Earl of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiqueen,</hi> to make an early proviſion againſt the

pretence of Authority by which they might then ſeem juſtly to act, we have weakned the hopes and expectations of thoſe who repoſed on <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> as an Inſallible power. So that with thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are ſaid to be raiſing in the North, by the Intereſt of the Lords <hi>Grenard, Mazarine, Mountjoy,</hi> and others; by the Lord <hi>Inchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and the Proteſtants in and about <hi>Dublin;</hi> It is not doubted, but by the help of God, that Kingdom may happily be relieved in a very ſhort time, with as little loſs of Blood, or otherwiſe, as <hi>England;</hi> which we hope and heartily pray for, &amp;c.</p>
