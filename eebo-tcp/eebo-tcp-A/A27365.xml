            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The want of a due Provision for Education and Relief

            <head>TO THE
Lords and Commons
IN
Parliament Assembled.</head>
            <p>IT was lamentable and frightful to behold the Tumult of
Weavers, that in a late Sessions, attended your Doors, and
when the Scarcity of Corn hath pinched the Poor, how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
have they appeared (to plunder against all Law) in many
Parts of this Kingdom? Now if the Needy of but one Trade of a
City, shall, through Penury, dare to brave You, that are as
the Vitals to move, and Heads to govern the Nation, and
that have the Strength of it to support you: How much more
dismal would it be to have a poor starved Croud attack single
Gentlemen at their own Home, and what Avantage may
restless Spirits take to disturb the publick Peace with such Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities?</p>
            <p>Forreign Wars wastes our Treasure, but Tumults at home are
a Convulsion upon our Nerves: And though Fines will Awe
Men of Estates, and Corporal Pains Men in Health: But (if
Provision should fail) what can awe the Misery of Starving, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to their increasing Immoralities, which will increase their
Insolence?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61246:3"/>
To collect the Laws about the Poor, into one Act, will make
them much the better understood, and it would be of
great Service, if all our Laws, upon each Subject they Treat of,
were so collected.</p>
            <p>And to Incorporate Counties, Citys, and Towns, to erect Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
and Work-houses, for imploying the able, and providing for
the impotent Poor, will be a good Addition to the present Laws
already made, if they will undertake it.</p>
            <p>But considering that the late regulating of our Coin, increased
the Difficulties of doing it, and that a suitable Provision for our
Poor will not be of less Consequence to the Nation; and that
many of the publick Hospitals hitherto raised, have more
regarded the well Governing, and providing for a few Impotent,
than the profitable imploying of the able Poor.</p>
            <p>Therefore, with Submission, I humbly pray, that you will
please, by Bill or Clause, in some Bill, to incorporate any Persons
(as well as Cities and Parishes) that will raise a Stock for the
imploying of poor People; if it invite no Vndertakers, the Act
can do no Hurt, and if it succeed, it may produce (by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or some other <hi>Expedient)</hi> useful Experiments that more
publick Corporations may learn by, at others Costs.</p>

            <head>To the Intelligent and Thinking Reader.</head>
            <p>WItty Men, who think but once upon a Subject, are able
to make a Jest upon it; but Wise Men think twice, that
will give a right Judgment upon things: And these last are the
<hi>Readers</hi> I address my self unto, who have Temper to receive a
good Proposition, and Sense to disprove a bad or weak one,
by Proposing a better: For that Physician that can advise nothing
in a desparate Disease (as the Condition of many of the Poor are
now to <hi>England)</hi> but contradict others, will have no great Cure
to boast of.</p>
            <p>What I have said of <hi>Trade,</hi> is rather to Anatomize, and look
into the Nature of it, than to find out the most Profitables,
whilst I think Land is the Foundation, and regular Labour is
the great Raiser of Riches to a Nation, and that Trade is the
distributer of it, when it is raised: I would also persuade to
Mercy and Vertue, as what Crowns the Industry of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>There are some too apt to reproach Vertue with ill Names,
and under that disguise, represent the most Industrious as the
more dangerous; tho' Immorallity in the Professors of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
makes them the greatest Enemies and Ruin of that Religion
which they profess: Whilst the Industry of the Subject, as it
makes their Riches the greater Support, so is it the best Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the Government (tho' they are divided into many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Opinions of Religion) it being the Proud and Needy
that are the most restless, and the Idle that are most at leisure
to be Mutinous.</p>
            <p>Some may think me too short in Expression, I desire such, if
they are at leisure, to read this Tract twice, and it will be then
more intelligible unto them, and if they have not time for that,
I conceive they would not have read a larger Comment half
through. And though short Sentences are most liable to be
mistaken, yet they are best to be remembred: And if I can
strike them Sparks, from whence others may set up bigger Lights,
for the good of Mankind, I shall not think my time Ill bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
My brevity may make me seem too positive, with some,
but I doing of it to prevent being tedious, and desiring no more
Credit than as I demonstrate what I writ, I hope my <hi>Reader</hi> (for
my good Intention) will excuse me in that seeming fault.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61246:4"/>
I will not answer for the exactness of my Computations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there is six, seven or eight Millions of People (several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Political Arithmeticians differing in that point) or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we spend 50 or 70 Millions a Year; a Million or two break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no square in my Propositions, they being more to shew the
greatness of the Loss, by our neglect of the Poor, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Profit they are able to raise, rather than the exactness
of either; which, I think, my Reasons in them Computations
fully proves.</p>

            <head>ESSAYS
About the
POOR, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is affecting to consider that the Bodies of many poor, which
might and should be Temples for the Holy Ghost to dwell in,
are the Receptacles so much of Vice and Vermine.</p>
            <p>To love God with all our Strength, and our Neighbour as
our selves, is the Substance and Perfection of the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
But as he that neglects Virtue, loves not God; so he that,
when Power and Opportunity is put into his Hands, will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to relieve his fellow Creatures from their present Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
will want a great Article in his Pasport, to recommend him
to future Happiness.</p>
            <p>That the Poor want to be better managed than they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is
plain, to every one that hath Sence or Charity, whilst their Way
of living is not much less Loss to the Nation, than our Wars,
one being perpetual, and the other but accidental; also the ill
Morals and Miseries of the Poor, are scandalous to our Religion
to the last Degree, Charity and Virtue being the greatest Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Excellencies of Christianity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61246:5"/>
Now, in Order to cure these great Maladies, I propose three Things
to be considered.</p>
            <p>First, Whether the Poor will be best employed by a publick
Stock, or by particular Undertakers, with their own Stocks?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether imploying them upon one Sort of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
or all Sorts, with the Addition of Husbandry, is best?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whether the Poor will be best managed in Societies,
or scattered each at their own Homes?</p>
            <p>To which offer the following Observations.</p>
            <p>To the first, That publick Stocks have generally been eat up,
and will be so, and the Poor are worse imployed by them, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath hitherto shewed us, and that therefore private
Stocks are better than publick ones, for imploying the Poor, as
being better husbanded, whilst the Interest of the Undertakers
will oblige them to more Care in managing the Stock, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
the Poor; and besides, constant Overseers will be much
more capable for the Imployment, than Annual ones.</p>
            <p>But Sick, Cripples, and other disabled Poor, as they are fittest
tobe kept at a publick Charge; so consequently under the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Care, which will leave the more Room for publick Charities
to such.</p>
            <p>To the second, The more Variety of Manufactures the Poor
are imploy'd in, the more Conveniencies they will raise for
themselves, and they will the less Clog the Market, than if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in one Manufacture only: But if they are imployed in
Husbandry also, that they may raise themselves Food, they will
then want nothing; for two Men are able to raise Food and
Clothing for four Men's Subsistence: Whereas to increase our
Manufactures, and not our Food, will lessen the Misery of the
present Poor, but by spreading of it among all the People of the
Kingdom: Which is like an unskilful Physician that removes
the Gout from the Foot, only by repelling of it upon the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
which often infects the whole Body.</p>
            <p>It puts more People to Table, it's true, but it puts no more
Food upon it; where they all suffer, as they do at Sea (when
Provision falls short) by setting five Men to four Mens Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>To the third, I say, Societies affords the best Government, and
also most Conveniencies, with less Charge; and the Poor have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61246:5"/>
very ill Qualities, and are as ill Tutors, as well as evil Examples
to their Children, and therefore it's of absolute Necessity their
Children should have better Instructors, and a more industrious
Education than their Parents will give them; the Happiness of
the next Age much depending upon the good Education of the
Children of this.</p>
            <p>And for Infants, sick and superannuated People, if they were
put into Nurseries and Hospitals; the fewer Nurses, Surgeons,
and Physicians will serve them, than if kept any where else, and
they will be cheaper and better provided for, than in little nasty
Hovils at Home, which are too often the Seeds of Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And as Communities and Hospitals, will have most Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
at least Charge, so they will breed up the best Surgeons and
Physicians, where their Experience in one Year, will be more than
in seven Years without it; which, as it will be greatly to the
Comfort of the poor: So of no less Advantage and Comfort to the
Gentry of the Country, who will then know where to have able
Physicians and Surgeons, upon extraordinary Occasions (which
in many Countries, now, is not easie to be found) the lame Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
in <hi>London</hi> being the best Schools for Surgeons in the
Nation.</p>

               <head>How the Poors Wants will be best answered, and the Nations
Strength and Riches increased.</head>
               <p>THE Evils and Wants that attends the poor of <hi>England</hi> are of
four Sorts.</p>
               <p>First, The Parents give their Children an evil Education.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They want constant Imployment for themselves and
their Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61246:6"/>
Thirdly, They want constant Vent for what they do raise or
make.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They want sufficient Food to feed them for their
Labour.</p>
               <p>The Scheme I offer, as Relief for these four great wants, is, by
Colleges of Industry (which I presented the Parliament with two Years
ago) in which are collected all sorts of Tradesmen and Husbandmen (in
a due Proportion to the Occasion there may be for each Trade among them)
upon so much Land, that with their Labour upon it, will raise them
Materials needful for their Subsistence, which I reckon is about three
Acres to a Head: And that this Plaster will fully cure these four Sores,
I demonstrate.</p>
               <p>First, That in such Collections of People, there may be all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
for Instruction and Oversight, both in Virtue and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They cannot there want Work any Time of the Year,
they having all the Conveniencies of Life to raise for themselves
and their Founders.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They cannot there want Vent for what they raise more
than they spend, because the Founders will gladly receive it, it
being all profit to them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And as a proportionable part of them are imployed
upon the Land in Husbandry, they will raise Food sufficient for
the whole Society.</p>
               <p>I do not propose forming all the Mechanicks of <hi>England,</hi> that
live well otherwise, into Colleges, but such poor who are thrown
into Want by an idle Education; or such as being supernumery
in the Trade they were bred in, who are now accounted bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome,
for them to be gathered and formed into little Bodies,
and several Classes of needful Imployments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if going to plant a
new Country, which would be as gaining several new Provinces
to the Kingdom; and then those little Colonies will live as well
as the rest of the Nation doth, without taking the Bread out of
other peoples Mouths, because they raise their own Food, and
other Subsistence.</p>
               <p>Such Colledges and Colonies will be an excellent Expedient to

Interest will incourage the Undertakers to settle People where
Land (which is the Foundation of Living) may be had cheap,

               <p>IT is a certain Demonstration of the Illness of the Method the
People are imploy'd in, if they cannot live by it; nothing
being more plain, than that Men in proper Labour and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

had been extinguished in the first Age of the World; and
it would be impossible now, for any Shop-keeper or Merchant, to
live in the Nation, or Children be bred up, Land improved,
Buildings raised, and Shiping and Trade increased; if some Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks

               <p>By Computation, there is not above two thirds of the People

two thirds which are Labourers, one half of the People or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
Labouring could supply all the Nation.</p>
               <p>Now considering that all the Poor may be Labourers, and as

is before observed, that half of them: are capable of raising Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
for all the rest to live equal to themselves, or as well as

               <p>And with many Commodities the Market is over-stocked,
(and what is the best Dinner worth to a full Stomack?) which
is the great Unhappiness of many of our Mechanicks, that they
make Commodities, when no Body wants them. And then they
pine or starve, whilst they are waiting for a Customer that will
give Bread for their Manufactures (or Money to buy Bread)
whereas the same Labour in Husbandry they used in making
them Manufactures, would have raised much more Food
than the Money they get for their Manufactures will buy
them.</p>

are useful in distributing, it's only the Labour of the Poor that
increaseth the Riches of a Nation, and tho' there cannot be too
many Labourers in a Nation, if their Imployments are in a due
Proportion; Yet there may be too many Traders in a Country for

rather the Nations expence, than the 120 Thousand Pounds the
Traders get, may be supposed to add to the Nations Stock? and
another Question is, what of it is Prudently spent with comfort,
and how much is extravagantly wasted, to the ruin of the Bodies
and Estates of the Spenders?</p>
               <p>If we send 100 Thousand pound of Manufactures to <hi>Holland</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> we have commonly some useful Manufactures for
them; however, if we did imploy our own Idle Poor, upon
them things, it's possible they would be able to raise most of
them Foreign Goods that we want.</p>
               <p>But then our Woolen Manufactures that supply them Countrys,
would complain of such new Manufactures; as some <hi>Lancashire</hi>
Men lately Petitioned the Parliament, that <hi>Flanders Lace</hi> should be
allowed to come into <hi>England,</hi> that thereby they might have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vent for their Cloth in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61246:10"/>
And thus, whilst our Manufactures are disproportion'd to our
Husbandmen, we are, and shall be like Limbs out of Joint, always
complaining, lay us which way you will.</p>
               <p>For which reason several Laws, made for incouraging of
Trade, doth but raise an intestine War among our Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks;
because the advantage of one Trade is often the ruin of
another: Whereas, increase our Husbandmen and Fishermen,
which will lessen our Manufactures, and make Food plenty,
and a quick Market for Goods, and give the greatest Ease to our
Mechanicks Complaints.</p>
               <p>Now, Supposing the 500 Thousand Pounds worth of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
and Provision sent to <hi>Turky, Italy, Spain, France</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
were to have been used by our own People at home, where
we have enough and may have more to vend them, (whilst the
want of them hinders Thousands in <hi>England</hi> from Marrying) And
if these People were imploy'd in a due Proportion to our wants,
in Tilling our Land, Building Houses, Breeding Cattle, catching
Fish, and making of needful Manufactures, which are lasting Riches
that increaseth the Nations Stock, they would add then a half
Million Sterling Yearly to the Value of the Kingdom; whilst (as
in Page. 6.) a Man in a Years time, that spends 10 <hi>l.</hi> is able to
raise what's worth 20 Pound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quere;</hi> Whether we do not Depopulate our Country, by Pineing
many at home for want of them Manufacturers, and especially
Food, which we send abroad, to supply the Pride and Luxury
of others by the returns? Amos 8. <hi>v. 4. Hear this O ye that Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
up the needy: even to make the Poor of the Land to fail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Land and Labour are the Foundation of Riches, and the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Idle hands we have, the faster we increase in value; and
spending less than we raise, is a much greater certainty of
growing Rich, than any computation that can be made from
our Exportation and Importation, whilst 120 Thousand Pound
Imported to be spent at home for 100 Thousand Pound sent out,
leaves the Publick never the Richer at the Years end.</p>

               <p>LAnd, Stock upon it, Buildings, Manufactures, and Mony,
are the Body of our Riches; and of all these, Mony is of
least use, until it's parted with; Land and Live Stock increase by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61246:10"/>
keeping, Buildings and Manufactures are useful whilst kept, but
Mony neither increaseth, nor is useful, but when it's parted
with, and as Mony is unprofitable to a private Person but as he
disposeth of it, for somthing more valuable, so what Mony is more
than of absolute necessity for a home Trade, is dead Stock to
a Kingdom or Nation, and brings no profit to that Country it's
kept in; but as it is Transported in Trade, as well as imported,
for as Mony increaseth in quantity, it decreaseth in Value in a
Country, except the People and Stock increase in proportion
to the Mony.</p>
               <p>Mony hath two Qualities, it is a Pledge for what it is given
for, and it's the Measure and Scales by which we Measure and
Value all other things, it being portable and durable, and yet
it hath altered far more in Value to all things than other things
have among themselves, when there was but the one 20th part
of the Mony in <hi>England,</hi> to what there is now; As good a Sheep
was sold then for one Shilling, as will now cost 20 Shillings;
and when there will be 20 times more Mony in <hi>England</hi> than
there is now, that Sheep which is now worth but one Guinea,
will then be worth 20 Guineas, except the People increase in
Number and Stock; for as we are now about 7 Millions of
People, and 14 Millions of Mony, which is 40 Shillings for each
Head in the Kingdom, so it may be reasonably Reckoned, that
if we increase in Mony, to have 4 Pound a Head; all things
will double in price, and so in proportion; and if we increase
in Mony, to have 8 Pound a Head, things will be 4 times the
Price they are, yet a Sheep; and a Cow, and a Man's days Work,
were always in Value in the same proportion as they are now,
as the same Number of Days work of a Man would pay for a
Sheep or a Cow, 300 Years ago as will now, and the same La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

               <p>THE <hi>English Plantations</hi> being ours, should be us; and the more,

whole Cities and Provinces of Strangers, as best to secure their
Dominion and Peace.</p>
               <p>The English Plantations, greatly add to the English Territories,
and increase her Subjects, and inlarge her Trade, that their Land
adds to our Territories is indisputable, and if we consider that

               <p>It is mournful to think what good Estates, fine Parts, and Time

Incentives to Immoralities in the Nation, where Fraud, Luxury,

be under the fewer Temptations; and if they can be cured, the
Advantage will be unexpressible, the Souls safety being of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

Malignant Invasions, and the Estate whole to many Generations,
and the Credit strong, as being fit for any Trust. Whereas he
that for Pleasure and Intemperance will forfeit his Interest with
God, lies under a suspicion he will betray his Trust with Men for
less, when there is a Market for it: And what Secrets is that
Man's Breast fit for, which Wine or Lude Women have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

There are several sorts of Distractions, which all Men pities,
and takes care of preserving from doing themselves or others
harm; but Pellons are some of the worst sort of mad Men, whom
Charity therefore would oblige us to take some care to prevent
their mischievous way of Living, and deplorable Deaths.</p>
               <p>The Idle and Profane Education of some, and the Necessities
of others, brings Habits almost invincible; for such to conquer
of themselves, without the State, take them into their prudent
management: But to put them into <hi>Bridewell</hi> or <hi>Newgate</hi> for a
Month or two, and then turn them loose at their own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cressions
(who have none) no more reclaims them, than bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Horse well with Provender makes him less able to Travel;
they learn but more Skill in their Trade, under the Tutors they
meet with there.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures saith, <hi>Watch; for the Devil your Adversary goes
about like a roaring Lion, seeking which of you be may devour.</hi> What
Consideration and Compassion then should be had of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking,
unwatchful People, whose Pride, Lust, or Necessities,
with the Devils incitements of them, is their sole Guide?</p>
               <p>If a Man had a Child, or near Relation, that should fall into
a capital Crime, he would use all his interest to preserve his
Life, how much soever he abhor'd his Fact, in hopes he might
live to grow better, especially if he could have such a power
of Confinement upon him, as might prevent his acting such
Enormities for the future.</p>
               <p>And this Child, and near Relation, is every one to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
whilst the cutting off by untimely Death of one able Man,
may be reckoned 200 Pound loss out of the value of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
for besides their Persons, they are commonly prevented of
the Posterity which they might have, (which is loss to all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations)
and if but one in a Succession, they may be valued
at 10 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, which, at 20 Years Purchase, is 200 Hundred

               <p>How sincerely can we say the Lord's Prayer, <hi>Forgive us our
Trespasses, as we forgive them which Trespass against us;</hi> when for
the loss, possible of less than 20 Shillings, we Prosecute a Man to
Death? Would it not be more natural and agreeable with our

And therefore, as we should, by a timely and industrious Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
have the greater care to prevent such Enormities, it
would also very well agree with our State before God, when
any fall into such Crimes compassionately to keep them from
further Mischiefs, and save such to Repentance, rather than to
destroy them by sudden Death.</p>

they live so voluptuous, and without sense of the other World,
because they are so strongly diverted from thinking of it.</p>
               <p>Also the Licencing too many Ale-houses gives Thieves the

               <head>Of Man's Soul.</head>
               <p>THE Soul of Man is the most invisible, spiritual, and intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Part of this Creation.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Soul, beyond all other Creatures, is most
capable of apprehending the invisible and spiritual Manifestations
of God.</p>
               <p>Now as God is infinite and omnipresent, in all Places, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
is within the Bodies of Men, as well as without them.</p>
               <p>And God being the most invisible Light, Spirit, and Life, he
penetrates all Beings and Spirits, more throughly than the visible
Light at Noon-day doth the Air; the Sun-Beams being but a
Shadow to him, that Light discovering Bodies only, but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Light discovers the most hidden Thoughts.</p>
               <p>And as God only (who is Light) can penetrate Men's Souls,
and beholds the most inward Thoughts and Desires thereof, so he
only is able, and doth shew them to Men, whether they are good
or evil: And as Men's Wills and Affections comes to be subdued
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61246:14"/>
to the Will of God, he discovers to the Souls of Men. What is
to be known of him, the pure in Heart only seeing God.</p>
               <p>For tho God is in all Places, and fills all things, yet all Beings
have not the same Degree of Sence of him, because they are not
of the same Capacity of knowing, or not equally prepared to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and see so pure invisible and intellectual a Spirit.</p>
               <p>And it may be said of visible Bodies, as of Darkness it self, that
tho God shines in them, they comprehend or apprehend him not,
for indeed they want all Sence of Apprehension, as the greatest
Light is unknown to the blind, and the greatest Sounds to the
deaf, so also the Souls of Men, which are given up unto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of sensual Objects (until they are born a new) they do want
their Faculties to be sufficiently spiritualized to behold the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Glory of God, tho his Light doth shew them their evil
State, and his Spirit reproves them, they do not see him: That
Degree or Manifestation of Light which only discovers a Man's
unhappy State to him, appears far less glorious (tho' it is divine)
than that which gives Peace, and discovers the Glory of God, as
Man obeys it: Yet all divine Light which appears to Men, flows
from the Father's Glory, through the one Mediator, our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, who is full of Glory in himself, whilst it is
the Stupidity of Men only that makes them unable to see the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acts 17. v.</hi> 23.—I—beheld your Devotions—To the unknown God,
whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</p>
               <p>24. God that made the World—dwelleth not in Temples made with
Hands.</p>
               <p>25. Neither is worshipped with Mens Hands, as tho he needed any
thing, seeing he giveth to all, Life, and Breath, and all things.</p>
               <p>27. That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might <hi>feel</hi> after him,
and <hi>find</hi> him, tho <hi>he</hi> be <hi>not far</hi> from every one of <hi>Us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. For <hi>in</hi> him we <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>move,</hi> and have our <hi>Being,</hi> as certain
also of your <hi>own</hi> Poets have said.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amos. 4. v.</hi> 13. For lo, <hi>he</hi> that formeth the Mountains, and createth
the Wind, and declareth unto Man what is his <hi>Thought</hi>—the Lord,
<hi>the God</hi> of Hosts is his Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. v. 13. But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by
the Light: For whatsoever doth make manifest is Light.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. v. 5. This then is the Message which we have heard of him,
and declare unto you, That <hi>God is Light,</hi> and in him is no Darkness at

Therefore for any to say, that this inward Light is Man's Conscience, is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Divinity, than it would be good Philosophy and Sence for them to say; That
the Light of the Sun is a Man's Eye, when it is the Eye, that is enlightned by it.</p>

               <p>REasons of State, Profit Health, Reputation, or Danger of Punishment was
part of the Motives given by the ancient Philosophers, to perswade Men
from Vice; which, as it is the least, it is the first Step towards Wisdom; Learning
to do well, through Love to Virtue, being a Degree higher, than ceasing to do
evil for fear of Sufferings.</p>
               <p>Now, as none but God sees Mens Thoughts, so if they do resist every Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Evil, when he, through Christ, first discovereth it to them in their Minds
(by his Light) that is to be vertuous for God's Sake, and it is a true Washing the
Inside, and a being truly religious at Heart: By which early Opposition to Evil,
Men will be enabled the more easily to overcome it, because a first Thought or
Representation to a watchful Man, hath not that Power upon his Affections, as it
will have, after it hath been entertained: And such a Watchfulness will the more
effectually prevent evil Actions, for whilst a Man thinks no ill, to be sure he will
do none.</p>
               <p>This is putting on the Armour of Light, and walking in it, and a Warface (tho
not with carnal Weapons) mighty through God, to the pulling down of strong
Holds, casting down <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and every high thing that exalteth it self against

               <p>Good Actions are as the outward Court to a clean Mind, and a vertuous Soul is as
the Temple to the inward Tabernacle, where God is truly adored, in which that
Worship is the more acceptable, which keeps out, not only, evil Thoughts
(which are always to be avoided) but also such Thoughts, which at other times,
may be useful and needful to entertain.</p>
               <p>For this divine Worship is the more Spiritual, as Men's Minds are more seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
and silenced from Creatures and Imaginations (not dull and sleepily, but)
vigorous, and earnestly seeking after, and praying for, a greater Purity of Soul,
and a farther Manifestation of God, through the Inspiration of inward divine

it self being Light uncomprehensible.</p>
