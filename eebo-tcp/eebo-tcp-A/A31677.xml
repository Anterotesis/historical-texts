            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Author</hi>'s great diſtance from the Preſs, and his no leſs Averſeneſs to appear in publick, tho at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Importunity of Friends, have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd the Delay in publiſhing the enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: and yet perhaps it will be thought, that, in regard to his Years, to the Treatiſe it ſelf, and to its ſmall importance to the Publick, he ought rather to apologize for his Forwardneſs now in expoſing it. But however this his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking may be cenſur'd by ſome, on the former Account, as late and unſeaſonable, or by others on the latter, as vain and inconſiderate; he hopes, betwixt them he may find thoſe who will put a more favourable Conſtruction both upon the Diſcourſe it ſelf, and the Inducements to print it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41429:3"/>
As for thoſe who may account him too ſevere in it, if their own Conſciouſneſs make them think ſo, either they are duely ſenſible of their own Guilt and its Demerits, or they are not; if they are, they can't but at the ſame time be alſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that their Crimes have deſerv'd Severity; but if they are not yet ſenſible, they deſerve it for not being ſo: and there is no other way but that left (ſince gentler means toward them have prov'd ineffectual) to convince them. And as for thoſe, who tho they may not find themſelves ſo concern'd in it, yet wiſh the Author had been more ſparing; he hopes, when they conſider the Occaſion, and the Seaſonableneſs, or rather, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuch Diſcourſes thereon, they may in a great meaſure excuſe him; however, that they will forbear to cenſure him for that which he has not us'd toward them.</p>

            <p>DEliverances from Enemies have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been eſteem'd by all ſober and conſidering Men, as the gracious Effects of God's providential Power and Goodneſs; and therefore ſolemn Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings to Almighty God upon ſuch Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have been very ancient and uſual. And tho it may have fall'n out as to ſuch God's Deliverances, as it did in cleanſing the ten <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 18.</note>

Lepers, that ſcarce one of ten can be found where Glory has been return'd to him for them; yet have we this Practice recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us by very many great and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Examples and Preſidents recorded in ſacred and prophane Hiſtories. For, when the Faithful Patriarch, <hi>Abraham,</hi> returned <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 18, 19, 20.</note> from the Conqueſt and Slaughter of the four Kings, and offer'd the Tenths of all to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi> Prieſt of the moſt high God, he was entertain'd and bleſſed by the Prieſt, who bleſſed God too, on his Behalf, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering his Enemies into his Hands.</p>
            <p>The miraculous Paſſage and Eſcape of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the fatal Overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and of all his Hoſt in the Red Sea, were no leſs ſolemnly and joyfully ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and all the People. And <note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> when the Lord had diſcomfited <hi>Jabin</hi> and <hi>Siſera,</hi> with all their Forces, then ſang <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> that memorable <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <note place="margin">Judg. 4.</note> Song of Triumph, recorded in the fifth Chapter of <hi>Judges.</hi> Nor may it ſeem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, <note place="margin">Judg. 5.</note> that in the Book of the Lord's Battels, referr'd to by <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 21. 14. and in the Book of <hi>Jaſhar,</hi> mention'd <hi>Joſ.</hi> 10. 13. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 18. as alſo in thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Books of the Acts of the Kings of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41429:4"/>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> mention'd and referr'd to elſewhere in Scripture, (all which are loſt) very many Paſſages of this Nature were ſet down at large.</p>
            <p>Many, indeed, and great, were the Troubles <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 19.</note> and Dangers of Righteous <hi>David,</hi> but yet the Lord delivered him out of all; and he forgat not to praiſe him for it, as is evident from the ſeveral Pſalms of Praiſe and Thankſgiving compoſed by him on thoſe Occaſions; and tho his wiſe and peaceful Son, and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, had not thoſe Occaſions his Bleſſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had, yet we find him in dedicating the Temple, which was accompliſhed with Prayers, Praiſes, and Sacrifices, and with all Solemnities ſuitable to the Beauty, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, and Uſe of the Building, bleſſing God alſo that had given Reſt unto his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">1 Kings 8. 56.</note> 
               <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when the Inhabitants of <hi>Ammon, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.</note> and <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> came up againſt <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat,</hi> he did not only apply himſelf to God for his Aid and Succour by Prayer and Faſting; but when the Lord had ſo ſignally own'd his Cauſe, and abſolutely gain'd the Victory to himſelf by turning the Enemies Hands againſt one another. He was ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Deliverance, and (aſſembling all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41429:5"/>
the People for the purpoſe) return'd ſuch an unanimous and ſolemn Praiſe, that it gave Name to the Place where it was performed, and it was thenceforth called the <hi>Valley of Bleſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither were the Heathens wanting in conſecrating part of their Spoils, in offering Sacrifices, in ſinging triumphant Hymns, in erecting Altars and Temples to their Gods, for their Victories over, and Deliverances from their Enemies. And when Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had taught to aſcribe to the Lord the Honour due only to his Name, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperours had ſubmitted their Scepters to that of Righteouſneſs, then were they no leſs careful and punctual to appoint and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſet Times of publick Thankſgiving to Almighty God for his Mercies to, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection over them.</p>
            <p>Such great and pious Preſidents has our moſt Gracious Soveraign for bleſſing God in this manner; and indeed, he wants not among his own Royal, Religious, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Anceſtors, for good Examples of ſuch his Piety. And, tho 'tis true their Thankſgivings were for Victories over Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies, and Formidable ones too, which magnify'd God's Deliverances towards
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41429:5"/>
them, and ſignaliz'd thoſe good Occaſions of their Thankfulneſs; yet has not <hi>His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty</hi> leſs Cauſe to bleſs God, who has delivered him from Domeſtick Foes, from the <hi>Strivings of his own People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Text is part of that Pſalm of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, which as the Title thereof ſpeaks, the Royal Prophet ſang in the Day that the Lord delivered him out of the Hand of all his Enemies; and how proper it is on this Occaſion, I ſuppoſe it will not be difficult to diſcern, from the Parallel of <hi>Holy</hi> David<hi>'s and our Gracious Soveraign</hi>'s Troubles and Dangers, and from their reſpective Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances. For, they were both train'd up in the School of Affliction, and ſmarted for ſome time under the like ſevere Diſcipline: after that, they both enjoy'd a Time of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, Peace, and Proſperity; after which again, their Enemies brake forth afreſh, and were much alike, and their Deliverances many and ſignal, and parallel in none more than in this Inſtance in the Text, from the <hi>Strivings of their own People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text affords theſe two Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Of the Nature of the Deliverance, and that is from the <hi>Strivings of the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41429:6"/>
Secondly, Of the Author of it, <hi>Thou</hi> haſt delivered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, To ſet forth the Deliverance, 'twill be neceſſary to ſhew the Nature and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Danger from which it was; and 'tis very fitly here expreſs'd by the <hi>Strivings of the People:</hi> by which Term we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, all the Contention, Oppoſition, and Faction of the People. In <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe it includes all the Inſolences and Violences his People us'd toward him, as the Railing of <hi>Shimei,</hi> the Treachery and officious Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.</note> of <hi>Doeg,</hi> the Sedition of <hi>Sheba,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty <note place="margin">1 Sam. 22. 9. 17. 2 Sam. 20. 1. 2 Sam. 16. &amp; 17.</note> and Defection of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and the Ingratitude and Rebellion of <hi>Abſalom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Strivings of the People, in the Circumſtances of <hi>our David,</hi> we muſt not only underſtand ſome <hi>Riſings, Stirs, Heats,</hi> and <hi>Diſorderly Things,</hi> as ſome would mince the Matter, but therein are imply'd all the Factious Bandyings and tumultuary Buſtles for making Parties in Petitioning, and at Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, all the Heat and Violence, all the Noiſe and Clamour in running down the Friends to the Government, in ſummoning, hurrying up, and reſtraining in an arbitrary and grievous manner their fellow Subjects, in unkind and undutiful Votes toward their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41429:6"/>
Soveraign, and ſome of them of an ill Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and Tendency, as is ſince manifeſtly prov'd by the Event. But further;</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Strivings of the People,</hi> may well be underſtood all the <hi>Riots, Tumults,</hi> and <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roars of the Mobile,</hi> when they are ſet a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Thoſe which <hi>David,</hi> who was not unacquainted with them, moſt fitly joyns with the raging of the Sea, and the noiſe of <note place="margin">Pſa. 65. 7.</note> its Waves; for, a turbulent Rabble being mov'd by the ſtormy Breath of ambitious Politicians, who love to fiſh in troubled Waters, are as giddy and unconſtant, as noiſie and boyſterous, as outragious and unruly as that ungovernable Element.

In fine, the groſs Calumnies, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Menaces, the various and inconſiſtent Clamours, the deſperate Inſolencies of ſuch a furious Crew, may well, ſure, if any thing can, be term'd the <hi>Strivings of the People.</hi> But furthermore:</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41429:7"/>
Under this Notion of the <hi>Strivings</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> may fall all the cunning Managery and politick Preparatives of the People for Mutiny, Sedition and Rebellion by falſe News, ſcandalous Reports, malicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of the Governours and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, rendring the one odious, and making the other ſeem grievous to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; complaining of Perſecution, Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Tyranny, ill Management of Publick Affairs, the Advancement of ill Men, and the like; poſſeſſing the People, that their Religion, their Liberties and Properties, are invaded, and in danger to be loſt; upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Tameneſs, and animating them to <hi>aſſert their Liberties as becomes Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-men.</hi> With theſe Pretences they make the People think they feel what there is only a Poſſibility to fear, and fear what it is next to impoſſible they ſhould ever feel. 'Tis thoſe ſtale Pretences of Popery and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, that are made uſe of as Glaſſes to contract and approximate the moſt wide and remote Fears and Jealouſies, and alſo to enlarge and improve the ſmalleſt Cloud of a Grievance, tho no bigger than that which the Prophet's Servant eſpy'd, <hi>viz.</hi> than a <note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 44. 45.</note> Man's Hand: ſo that as that did, it ſhall

And as the Commonalty of <hi>England</hi> are lately very well deſcrib'd to be a <hi>People that fear every thing they hear, and nothing that they ſee,</hi> ſo que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs, thoſe who are ſo ſolicitous to have them fear every thing, would at laſt bring them to fear nothing; I mean, Thoſe who would render them ſo timorous of ſuffering any thing from the Government, would at laſt bring them not to fear to do any thing againſt it: for 'twas the late <hi>Royal Martyr's Obſervation, that, When the Peoples Eyes are</hi>

               <hi>once blinded with ſuch Miſts of Suſpicions, they are ſoon miſled into the moſt deſperate Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Actions; wherein they do not only not</hi>

               <hi>conſider their Sin and Danger, but glory in their zealous Adventures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe are the <hi>Strivings of ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in the main, whilſt others have their more diſtinct Poſts and Inſtructions to carry on the ſame Deſign: Some are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring toward the Preſs, and have their particular Subjects to treat upon, as origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Liberty and Power from the People, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Power in the Three Eſtates, the King's being <hi>Major Singulis, Minor Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> the Doctrine of Self Preſervation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, of Reſuſtance in Caſe of Religion, or Rights in vaded, juſtified, paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence exploded, Dommion founded in Grace, and the like; while others in a Club or Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-Houſe, and in all publick places, are to argue and maintain theſe ſeveral Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</p>
            <p>And 'tis from this ſtrife and licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Tongue and Pen, as from two plentiful Sources, that moſt of our late <hi>Miſunderſtandings, Oppoſitions,</hi> and <hi>Strivings,</hi> have ſprung and been deriv'd; and it were eaſie to trace them in their ſeveral Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Channels where they have poiſon'd honeſt Principles, embitter'd good Blood, intoxicated weak Heads, and in fine, bred

all ſorts of ill Humours in the leaſt ſenſible parts of the Body Politick. And tho the Fountains or Authors of theſe Miſchiefs, like <hi>Nile,</hi> hid their Heads, yet a viſible Brood, as monſtrous and pernicious as any that out of Slime and Mud were ever bred on that River's Banks, were in like manner produc'd here, by the overflowings of their Gall, and the Riſings of their Spleen.</p>
            <p>And for the ſame purpoſe, no doubt, it was, that the Licenſe of the Pulpit was as much endeavour'd, as thoſe of the Tongue and Preſs were abus'd; that by a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, compendious, and infallible way, Men might be pulpited out of that Senſe, Religion, and Loyalty, which the other had left them. For the Preſs indeed may publiſh and vend Doctrines tending to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or Rebellion, but the Conventicle reveals, teaches, and recommends them to practice: In a Club or Coffee-Houſe treaſonable Maxims and Tenets may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd or whiſper'd, and more may be imply'd by politick Nods, Faces, and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but in a Conventicle they are trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted, alarm'd, proclaim'd: In ſhort, the Coffee-pot may retail a little Stanch, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and apocryphal Sedition, or Rebellion,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41429:9"/>
but the Tub broaches them whole-ſale, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies and renders them Orthodox and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical.</p>
            <p>'Tis there <hi>Meroz</hi> is curs'd, and curs'd bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly too, Whoſoever he be that is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">Judg. 5. 23.</note> to come forth to the <hi>Help of the Lord,</hi> to the <hi>Help of the Lord againſt the Mighty.</hi> 'Tis there the People have been taught to rage furiouſly together, and to imagine vain <note place="margin">Pſ. 2. 1.</note> things, as that the King was juſt ſtanding <note place="margin">

            <q>Tantum Religio potuit ſuadere malorum!</q>
            <p>And thus are they taught by their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal Leaders, that 'tis not only lawful, but expedient, nay, even their Duty, to rebell, and perſuaded that their religious and civil Intereſts do both call upon them to diſcharge it, poſſeſſing them that both are at ſtake, and in the utmoſt danger, even when they are in the greateſt Security, and the making them believe that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41429:10"/>
they are in a deſperate Condition, makes them really deſperate. And then 'tis no wonder if the common People, under ſuch Miſrepreſentations of Things, loſe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to catch at Shadows, part with a preſent, real Happineſs, in purſuit of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive one; and to prevent an imaginary Evil in Futurity, bring a preſent certain Evil upon themſelves, and perhaps entail it on their Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Thus when in the midſt of Safety and Proſperity, as to the Government, they have poſſeſs'd the People that they <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in extream Jeopardy and Miſery, the next thing is to mark out, and brand the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Occaſions of theſe pretended Evils; and thoſe we may be ſure, muſt be all the Friends to the Government, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the chief Miniſters of State, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in Truſt, and the <hi>King</hi> himſelf is brought in with a ſide-Wind, as being a good Man, but led away; and then over againſt theſe, they point out and rank the Leaders and Deliverers of the People, the Defenders of their Religion, the Vindicators of their Rights, the Redreſſors of their Grievances, the Patriots of their Country, the <hi>Moſeſes</hi> and the <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> that muſt lead them

through the Red Sea of Blood, and through a Wilderneſs of their own making, to the Promiſed Land of Eaſe and Plenty.</p>
            <p>Then he that hath no Brains ſhall be ſet up for the Head of the People; thoſe that have no Religion, for the Defenders of the Proteſtant; thoſe that have no Virtue, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially not that of Continence, for the Scourges of the Lewdneſs of the Court, and of the Vices of the Times; thoſe that have no Honeſty, for the Maintainers of Liberty and Property; thoſe that have no Loyalty, for the King's Friends; and thoſe whoſe guilt and dread of Puniſhment make them fly their Country, to be the Patriots of it; and in a Word, one that had no Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but had winded and ſhifted to all the Points of the Compaſs, to be the only, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wiſe, and faithful Subject and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; and the Counſel which he counſelled, as it was ſaid of that of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> was <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 23.</note> eſteemed by them, as if a <hi>Man had enquired at the Oracle of God:</hi> and the Reaſon of all this is obvious, for the Cauſe elects, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and ſanctifies, all it's reſpective Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Strivers in Petitioning, Remonſtrating, Proteſting, Feaſting, and

Aſſociating together; and being too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and deſperate to proceed in the ſlow Methods of Sedition, caball'd, plotted, and conſpir'd againſt <hi>His moſt Sacred Majeſty,</hi> (whom God long preſerve) againſt his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Brother,</hi> againſt the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in <hi>Church and State,</hi> and againſt the <hi>moſt Loyal</hi> and <hi>eminent Subjects in both;</hi> to tear out the very Bowels of their Mother-Country, to turn the Land into an <hi>Acelda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> a Field of Blood, to involve all in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and Confuſion: in ſhort, to act over again the moſt bloody and diſmal Tragedy of a Civil War, which we of this Nation have the moſt reaſon in the World to dread, having ſo long, ſo lately, and ſo ſeverely, ſmarted under that Rod; and therefore one would think ſhould not be very fond, or eaſie to be perſwaded to play the old Game, and to try the fatal Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment over again.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, ſuch as theſe have been the <hi>Strivings</hi> of ſome of <hi>our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> David<hi>'s People;</hi> and how parallel they are to thoſe from which good King <hi>David</hi> was delivered, is very eaſie to make out to any that will remark and apply things.

Nor has there wanted a cunning <hi>Achitophel,</hi> who being turn'd out of the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, degraded from his Offices, and, like <hi>Lucifer,</hi> thrown from the Pinnacle of his Ambition, grew diſcontented, malicious, and revengeful, and employ'd all his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Malice, and Intereſt, fully to do Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the <hi>King</hi> and the Government, and to all thoſe who were under his malevolent Influence; for neither did there want an <hi>Abſalom</hi> to be ſeduc'd, who being inſtructed to act the popular Part, by ſhewing himſelf on all publick Occaſions, and by bowing to the Rabble, was to ſteal away the Hearts of the People; and at laſt conſpir'd againſt a <hi>moſt Gracious and Affectionate Soveraign,</hi> and a moſt tender and indulgent Parent.</p>

Now it having pleas'd Almighty God, of his infinite Goodneſs to our moſt <hi>Gracious Soveraign</hi> and to his Kingdoms, to deliver him from ſuch <hi>Strivings of his People,</hi> and Him and Us from this horrid and helliſh Conſpiracy, concerning which we may ſay what was ſaid of <hi>Abſalom's, the Conſpiracy was ſtrong;</hi> and his Majeſty having thought <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 12.</note> fit to appoint this Day for <hi>Solemn Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> for ſuch his <hi>miraculous and happy Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> of which that we might be the more ſenſible, having alſo publiſh'd his Royal <hi>Declaration</hi> concerning the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to, the Methods and Progreſs of this Treaſonable Conſpiracy, and ordered it to be twice read in our Churches; we ought, as in Duty bound to God, the King, and our Selves, to return our moſt devout and humble Thankfulneſs to the Divine Author of this great Deliverance.

            </p>
            <p>And our <hi>Good King</hi> was ſo ſenſible of the Divine Mercy to him thereon, that, as it came from a very good Hand, in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of much People, with no leſs Piety than Wiſdom he declar'd, <hi>That it was a Bleſſing of God he had no ways merited, but that God knew his Heart, and he believ'd had preſerv'd him for the good Intentions he had always had to his People.</hi>

we ought to pray unto him, that he would unite our Hearts to himſelf, to the King, and to one another, that we may all live in the Unity of the Spirit, and in the Bond of Peace, that his Majeſty's Reign over us may be long <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note> and proſperous, and that under him we may live a godly and quiet Life; for, Obedience to God and the King is the beſt Expedient to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſuch Bleſſings to us; and among the chief of them, the <hi>Bleſſings of a good King,</hi> who, in the utmoſt Extent and height of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, is the Miniſter of God to us for Good.
