            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>upendious authority appeares beyond all the writing of men <hi>Iunius</hi> saith, that he was uever strucken with an apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Diety,</hi> till he read this first Chapter, affirming it to be the first and chiefest cause of his conversion from Atheisme to a sincere imbracing of <hi>Christianity,</hi> you may see it in his life written by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. And in all this Chapter, I finde not a richer and fuller sentence then this which describesto us the <hi>fullnesse</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The parts of it are three.</p>
            <p>First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here is a <hi>Fulnesse</hi> attributed to <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this is not a respective but a <hi>diffusive Fulnesse,</hi> that is, <hi>Fulnesse</hi> not shut up in its owne Bankes, but running over for our benefit and use.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of his Fulnesse we have all received,</hi> that is, all that ever had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Grace took it from this heap, drew it from this fountaine.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, these receits are amplified by the variety of them, <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Grace.</hi> That is, <hi>Christ</hi> hath given to us for all the Graces which he received of his father for us; Graces answerable, as the Seal is said to give to the Waxe print for print, Character for Character, or as a father is said to give to the sonne lymbe for lymbe, member for member, though not of the same bignesse and measure. In the same sense Christ is said to give to us <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Grace.</hi> So that now you see here a full shop, many Buyers or Receivers, choise of wares, or rather to use the Scriptures similitude: A full Table, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Guests, Variety of dishes: <hi>Of his fulnesse we have all received</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The first part.</note> 
               <hi>Grace for Grace.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60192:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 We begin with the first. This <hi>Fulnesse</hi> is attributed to <hi>Christ</hi> in 4. respects. 1. <hi>In regard of his person:</hi> So hee was full. 1. with an <hi>increate Fulnesse:</hi> for as the glory of God filled the <hi>Temple</hi> that <note place="margin">1. In regard of his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>son.</note> 
               <hi>Moses</hi> could not enter in: so the humanity of <hi>Christ</hi> which answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that type, was filled not only with the effects of the Diety as then, but with the Diety it selfe, which is therefore said to dwell in him corporally or essentially. 2. Hee was moreover filled with a <hi>Created Fulnesse,</hi> and so hee was said to be full of all divine good things, which <hi>Iohn</hi> reduces to two heads, <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth. Truth</hi> which comprehendeth all the vertues of understanding; And <hi>Grace</hi> which comprizeth all beauties and perfections of the will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this <hi>Fulnesse</hi> is attributed to Christ in regard of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices 1. as a <hi>Prophet.</hi> He was <hi>full</hi> of all the Treasures of wisedom <note place="margin">2. In regard of his Offices.</note> and knowledge? So that all the <hi>Light</hi> which the <hi>World</hi> ever had came from him as a <hi>Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the <hi>Revelations</hi> which <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> ever had; All the <hi>Visions</hi> which <hi>Esaias, Ieremy,</hi> and the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ever saw; <hi>All the mysteries</hi> which ever were declared to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> came from him, they all received their light from this <hi>Sun,</hi> which from the first morning of time shone to the darke world, without setting more or lesse, though the darkenesse comprehended it not. Secondly, hee was <hi>ful</hi> as a <hi>Priest, full</hi> of fauour with God, whence he hath audience, alwais full of <hi>Compassion</hi> to man, whence he is ready to entertaine any suits or Suitors; <hi>full</hi> of merit, whence sure to prevaile in all his requests and Intercessions 3. He was <hi>full</hi> as a <hi>King, full</hi> of authority, all power was given him, in Heaven &amp; in Earth, full of strength and might to desend his Servants, and to resist his enemies till he hath made them his soot-stoole. Lastly, full of royall <hi>Munificence,</hi> whence ready to supply the wants of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to give them in the end a large recompence of reward.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this <hi>Fulnesse</hi> is attributed unto Christ in regard of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, <note place="margin">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifits, following, |1. That hee who was so <hi>full</hi> himselfe is able to make us <hi>full,</hi> if we want faith or love, or any other grace. |2. By this we know what a Mediator we have to deale withal even with one <hi>full</hi> of love, <hi>full</hi> of patience, <hi>full</hi> of tender compassion which may invite us to come to him. | Lastly, we have this comfort that

though our Righteousnesse be very weake and small, yet in him we are compleate, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this <hi>Fullnes</hi> is attributed to him in regard of his <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4. In regard of his Effect.</note> Scarce was there ever any action that Christ did, but you shall see a <hi>Fulnes</hi> in it. At the first Miracle that ever he wrought, he filled 6 water-pots with wine, afterwards he filled 5 000 guests with 5 loaves and 2 fishes, so that twelve Baskets <hi>full</hi> of broken meates were taken up; So he filled the Netts with fishes till they were ready to breake againe, and which was the best <hi>Fulnes</hi> of all, he filled the Disciples with the holy Ghost in the day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost, and often afterwards, whence they are said to be full of Joy, and the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>If we would know the Reasons; It is partly in regard of Christ <note place="margin">1. Reasons from Christ.</note> himselfe, hee was the Corner Stone, therefore there is reason hee should be the fairest in all the Building. He was the Prince of our Salvation therefore it was meet he should be like <hi>Saul</hi> higher than all the people by head and shoulders, farre exalted above all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers.</p>

From our selves</note> his <hi>Fulnes</hi> hee might replenish our Vacuity, otherwise wee could neither have seen him nor received of him. Not have seene him, for the glorious Beauty of his Godhead was too bright for our eyes to behold. It was therefore reason that it should be put into the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne, or Vaile of <hi>Christs Humanity,</hi> that in that we might behold it. Nor could we have received of it, for the <hi>Diety</hi> is an <hi>Inacces sible Fountaine;</hi> It was reason therefore that <hi>Christs Humanity</hi> should be the Cesterne or Conduit-Head to receive it for our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell and use.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I answer, first they were said to be <hi>full according to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
               <hi>Christ out of measure,</hi> as a little Dish may be said to be full as well as the Ocean. So they were said to be <hi>full,</hi> because filled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the narrownes of their present Capacity. But Christ wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> full according to all d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ensions, length, breadth, and depth of <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in them there was <hi>Plenitudo Vasis;</hi> In Christ, <hi>Plenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60192:5"/>
fontis,</hi> that is, there was in them a derived participated <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> but in Christ there was a <hi>Fulnes</hi> like the <hi>Fulnes</hi> of a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine springing from himself, which is well expressed by the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when they say, that the <hi>Fulnes</hi> of the Saints and of Christ dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as <hi>Ignis</hi> and <hi>Ignita,</hi> the one like Torches kindled, the other like Fire it selfe, for the <hi>Fulnes</hi> of the Ocean is too little to expresse this; For if you take a drop or two from it, it is so much lessened, rather the <hi>fulnes</hi> of the fire, which lights a thousand Torches, yet is not it selfe diminished.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in them there was a Comparative <hi>Fulnes. Steven</hi> was said to bee <hi>Full</hi> in regard of other lesser Saints, But in him there was an absolute <hi>Fulnes</hi> without all limits, without all comparison.</p>
            <p>What shall we now deduce hence for Application to our selves?</p>
            <p>First, that which is also the Scope of the Evangelist in this place; This should <hi>invite us to come to Christ, and to take of this full heape.</hi> This Incentive <hi>Paul</hi> often uses to inflame the desires of the Gentiles to come to Christ, even the Riches of that <hi>fulnes</hi> which is in him, which in the <hi>fulnesse</hi> of time began to be exposed to all Commers, as he saith, hidden before, but now fully revealed; seen before but in Types and Shadowes, now with open face; before preached but to a few, now to every Creature under Heaven; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit was given but by drops, but now <hi>he that hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended on high, and led Captivity Captive,</hi> hath so given gifts to men, that he hath filled all things.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore be exhorted when we heare of such a <hi>fulnesse,</hi> not to take the <hi>Grace of God in vaine,</hi> but labour we to have our part in it, that as those Corinthians, we may be <hi>made rich in Christ filled with all knowledge and every grace.</hi> Content not your selves therefore to know this onely, for that is our common fault to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves with the Notions of such things without practise.</p>
            <p>But go to Christ as Bees to a meadow that is <hi>ful</hi> of slowers, as Merchants to the Indies that have <hi>full</hi> Mines, that you may expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally find your selves returning from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>In other things fullnes invites us much; <hi>Ioseph's full</hi> Barnes in Aegypt drew <hi>Iacob</hi> and his Sons thither: <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Land <hi>Ful</hi>

Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> to come out of the South to his Court. In every thing fulnes doth much allure and affect us. The Covetous man though he spend but little, yet he desires to take it from a full heape, as he saies <hi>De pleno tollere acervo.</hi> How much more then should this fulnes of Christ worke on us, especially since there is in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not onely a repletive but a diffusive fulnes; not onely plenty, but also bounty? But alas, if we looke upon the waies and actions of men, we shall find that men seeke a fullnesse in every thing else, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, a fulnesse in pleasure and delights, a fulnesse in honour and preferments; But this full <hi>Honey Combe</hi> is almost every where despised, but happy hee, the bent of whose heart God hath turned the right way to seeke a fullnes of Faith and Wisedome, and a fullnesse of the Holy Ghost, who cares not though he be empty of any thing else, so hee bee full of these? though a looser in other things, so a Gainer in these. Such a one hath chosen the better part which shall never be taken from him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If there be a Fulnes in Christ, we should answer it with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulnes of affection on our parts, fully beleeve and trust in him, fully love and adore him, fully delight in him, for it is reason the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be answerable to the <hi>Object.</hi> A little excellency desires little love and esteeme; more excellency more love, but wher there is a fulnesse of al excellencies, that we shold procecute with fulnes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll our affections. All the excellency in the Creature in comparison of this, is but as a drop to the Ocean, and a sparke to the whole Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire. Therefore if we propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion our affections to the object, which ought to be the Rule and square of them, we should bestow on the Creature but a drop of love and delight, but the full streame of our affections should be carried to him, in whom is the <hi>fullnesse</hi> of all perfection. It is true indeed, that as men hide treasure from theeves under straw or baser covering, so God hides this ful excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie from the world under a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se outside, that his secret ones only might find it out, and others seeing, might not see, but stumble at it. Thus he hid Christ himselfe under a Carpenters sonne, so hee hides Divine Misteries under the meane Elements of Bread and Wine, so the wisedom of God is hidden under the foolishnesse of preaching: and under Sheep-skins and Goat-skins, as the Apostle speakes, were hidden, and such as the world is not worthy of, yet there is such a <hi>fulnes</hi> of excellency notwithstanding: for if ever wee saw

beauty in Sun, Moone, Stars, men, women, &amp;c. Or if ever we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> found delight in musicke, meates, drinks, friends, &amp;c. All mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> needs be more abundantly in God, who is the Author, Maker, &amp; giver of all these; As <hi>Solomon</hi> reasons; <hi>He that made the eye, shal not he see,</hi> so he that made all these things, shall he not have them eminently in himselfe, for as the worth of many peeces of silver is comprized in one piece of gold, so all the petty excellencies which are scattered abroad in the Creatures, are all united in God, yea the whole volume of perfections, which is spread through heaven and earth, is epitomized in him; Why do we not then with <hi>Paul,</hi> tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the Pompe and Glory of the world, for the excellent knowledg of Christ? Why do we not with <hi>David</hi> turn away our eyes, hearts, and affections from beholding vanity, and pitch them all on him? Why do we not re-collect our selves, and gather up out affections and thoughts, which are scattered and busied about a thousand tristes, and bestow them all on him, in whom is the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of all excellency beauty, and perfection?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if there be a <hi>fulnesse</hi> in Christ, then let us be <hi>content with him,</hi> having our hearts filled and satisfied with him.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>in regard of spiritual things.</hi> Goe we not to the brookes of <hi>Teman,</hi> the broken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Secondly, for Temporal things let us be <hi>content with him alone,</hi> for he is our fullnesse even in them a so for the better conceiving of this we must know that the first <hi>Adam</hi> brought a generall E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hence the hearts of men are not satisfied with the world, but as the Prophet speaks: <hi>They eat and are not filled, they drink
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60192:6"/>
and behold their soule is empty,</hi> because the Creature is now but as the huske without the graine, the shell without the kernell, full of nothing but emptinesse, and being empty in it selfe, cannot give us satisfaction; But Christ the second <hi>Adam</hi> hath filled all things againe, <hi>Epes.</hi> 1. last verse. <hi>He fils all in all things,</hi> that is, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hearts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Hence we may observe, that many finde a want in the midst of plenty, their hearts finde no rest or satisfaction in al they enjoy, but with the holy Regenerate man it is much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, though he have but a little wealth, a little food and rayment, yet there is a secret <hi>fulnesse</hi> put into that little which makes it fit to give him satisfaction, which is the meaning of that of the Psalmist, <hi>Psal. 37, 16. A little thing to the Righteous, is better then great riches to the wicked,</hi> because in that little it being filled with the blessing of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> they finde a <hi>fulnesse,</hi> whereas the wicked finde an emptinesse in the midst of their greatest aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>If there be a <hi>fulnesse</hi> in Christ, then what though there be a <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> 
               <hi>of sin and guilt in us,</hi> yet there is a <hi>fulnes of Grace in him</hi> able to remove it, and take it away.

            <p>Now I beseech you take not this Exhortation in vaine, for there is nothing more effectual to heale a rebellious disposition, to instil saving <hi>Grace,</hi> to cause a sinner to change his course, then to be fully perswaded that he shal be received to mercy, and that his sins shalbe forgiven in Christ: Even as the Theese, while the Hue and Cry is after him, never returnes willingly: Rebels <note place="margin">Simile.</note> and Pyra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I answer: that to wil, is natural, but to wil wel, is supernatural, and must rise from a higher wel-head than nature is. For as an hatchet wil cut when handled but with a common hand, but not make a chaire, or stoole, or any Artificial thing except it have <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluentiam Artificis quatenus Artifex,</hi> the influence of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wel, to doe a supernatural worke in a supernatural and holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it cannot except it have the influence of a supernatural Agent to direct and guide it.</p>
               <p>If a man might accept <hi>Grace</hi> or refuse it, as he would. God were no God, because he might be crossed by his creature, and his own wil should not absolutely beare rule, especially in that great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of beleiving, and not beleeving, and in putting difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man in the matter of Salvation and Damnation: For according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> though God did heartily desire the conversion of such a man, and offered him al the meanes of <hi>Grace</hi> that could be, yet it is stil in the fice choise of his wil to convert, or not to convert; Their onely answer here is, that seeing God hath made a Decree, that man shal be a free Agent, though he doe most earnestly desire the conversion of such and such men, yet because he cannot disa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60192:8"/>
of the Creature to doe contrary to even that himselfe desires. But what is this else but to put God into such streights as <hi>Darius</hi> was in, who would faine have saved <hi>Daniel,</hi> but because of his Decree he could not? And if griefe in Spirits and Angels be but <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>isus voluntatis,</hi> a reluctancy of the wil, as the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, what is this else but to attribute griefe unto God, and so to detract from his Blessednesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if all <hi>Grace</hi> be not received, but a man may accept it or reject it as he will, how can it be solved, but that a man must <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and boast partly in himselfe,</hi> contrary to <hi>Paul's</hi> rule, and not <hi>wholly in the Lord,</hi> for aske the question of all that are saved, what is the reason that you are saved rather then another, their answer must needs be; I out of the liberty of my owne will, did receive and use well the <hi>Grace</hi> offered, when another did not. So that according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> the Saints in heaven are not a jot more beholding to God then the damned in hel, for the offering of <hi>Grace</hi> on Gods part, was a like common to both, only he that is in heaven, may thank his own wil that he chose it, when onother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused it.</p>
               <p>They have nothing here to answer, but onely that the meanes of <hi>Grace</hi> are dispenced by God with some disparity; But what is that when they maintaine such freedome of wil, that he who hath the greatest meanes may reject grace, and he who hath the least, may accept it?</p>
               <p>Other reasons there are, but that I hasten: as that <hi>Grace is not Grace without being received,</hi> no more then a man can be a man without reason, or a gift can be a gift without being given, for no lesse doth it imply contradiction to suppose it to be a <hi>grace,</hi> &amp; yet not to be freely bestowed by God and received by us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, bowing of the will is an effect of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> is an effect of the spirit. Now the spirit breaths, when, where, &amp; in what measure it listeth. Againe, if <hi>grace</hi> should spring out of our soile it should be but a flower of grasse, <hi>for all flesh is grasse,</hi> but the <hi>grace</hi> of the mediator is of a more durable nature, a flower that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For there are certaine accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table times, after which God offers <hi>Grace</hi> no more: happy he that <hi>knowes that day of his visitation,</hi> and as our Saviour speaketh, <hi>the things which belong to his Peace,</hi> in that his day, which <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> did not, which made Christ to weep over it, and which <hi>Saul</hi> did not: and the Jewes in <hi>Ieremiah's</hi> time did not, when God forbad <hi>Ieremy</hi> to pray for them. For as there were certaine times when the Angell moved the waters in the poole of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> and he that then stepped in, was healed; so there are certaine accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble times, wherein God troubles the hearts of men by his spirit. Happy is he who then steps into a good course, that he may be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Salvation. I say there are certaine times, wherein God doth (as it were) thaw and soften the frozen hearts of men. And it is wisedome then with the husband-man to put in the plough, while the ground is soft: for the heart in such a case is like iron in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace easily fashioned, but stay till it be cold, and it will not be wrought upon.

a man may doe out of the strength of naturall wisedome, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for his owne safety, but it is a much different thing, <hi>viz.</hi> putting life into a dead man: <hi>Ephesians</hi> 2. 1. Making a man a new Creature, 2 <hi>Corinthtant</hi> 5. 17. A change of the whole frame of the heart. As if another soule dwelt in the same body, as he saith; <hi>Ego non ego.</hi> In a word, when a man is cleane another man, then he was serving of God out of an inward propensnesse and having the whole bent of his disposition turn'd to delight in the Law of God without these by-respects. And that this may yet be made clearer, and put out of all doubt, I would aske but this question; That repentance which men take up in age, or in times of extreamity, whence proceedeth it, if from selfe love, as it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually doth in such cases, because the soule is then strongly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with an apprehension of death and hell, and another life, then there is no more then nature in it, for the streame riseth not higher then the fountaine. A beast would doe as much, which sinking into danger, would struggle to save it selfe. But if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from love to God, why was it not done sooner, why not in the flowre of our youth, yea when it is done soonest, would we not be heartily sorry that it was not done sooner, if it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of love to him. And if it thus proceed out of an holy love to God, it cannot arise but from his holy spirit: the breathings of which spirit as they are most free, so are they most pretious. Therefore when such a sparke is kindled in our hearts, let us bee carefull to put fuell to it, and not suffer it to goe out againe.</p>
               <p>Al the Creatures in Heaven and Earth cannot helpe us againe to them, yea the best Ordinances are but as pens without inke, or empty Conduit-pipes which give not a drop of true <hi>Grace.</hi> except <hi>Christ</hi> who is the Fountaine please to conveigh it by them.

This is the very Life of Religion, and in this we must be very frequent and servent, binding our selves with an inviolable resolution to keep a constant course in it, but of this there is no doubt.

               <p>That a set Forme of Prayer is Lawful, much need not to be said, the very newnesse of the contrary opinion is enough to shew the vanity and falsenesse of it: It being contrary to the Judgment of approved Councells, Learned Fathers, and the continual Practise of the Church.</p>

                  </gap> of which, many neglect to come to them, and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> doe it in a perfunctory and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, which is an extreame fault. Better were it, that men would came to this disjunction; either it is lawfull to use them or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>lawfull, why doe they not use them constantly, and in a reverent and holy manner. One thing there is, which if it were well considered, would breed in the hearts of men another esteem of our publique prayers then there is. And that is, that besides the end of obteyning the things we want (wherein yet publique prayer hath the promise) there is another end in praying, and that is to worship God, and to performe a service to him, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of which, there are two places of Scripture un-answerable, <hi>Luke 2. 37. Hannals worshipped God by fasting and prayers,</hi> the word used is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the proper word for worship, <hi>Acts 13. 2. They ministred to the Lord and fasted,</hi> the word u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whence the word Liturgy is derived. This me thinkes should breed in the hearts of men a reverend esteeme of this duty.</p>
               <p>Besides, how straight is that which is objected against the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of it, as that the Spirit is stinted, when wee are settered with words appointed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The freedome of the Spirit stands not so much in the extent of the words, as the intensnesse of the zeale wherewith they are uttered. Besides if this argument were good, it would swell against conceived prayer, for if he that heareth, hath a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger spirit then he that prayeth, there is to him the same stinting o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> restraint.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60192:12"/>
Againe it is objected, that we cannot pray for occasionall neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities. Therefore we bind not only to a set forme: but men may, and ought to use besides, private prayer, wherein we may expresse our private, accidentall, and particuler occasions. And if they be more publique, there are prayers before and after Sermon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Minister is left at more liberty? And if it be yet more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall belonging to the State or Church, we adde it to the publike prayers, as it is in the <hi>Gun-powder-treason, times of War, dearth, &amp;c.</hi> But there needs not much be said to convince the judgement: that which is chiefely to be desired, is, that they may be better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and more esteemed, especially seeing our publique prayers be holy and good, (and which should be a greater inducement) the Church hath commanded them: And if the Church be to be obeyed in indifferent things, as it is, much more in appointing of Gods owne Ordinances.</p>
               <p>And if a set forme of prayer bee lawfull, then the Lords Prayer must needes excell, being dedicated by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and is therefore to bee more frequently used, and withall Reverence both in minde and gesture. Nor doth this want the practise and approbation of the Auncient, it is <hi>Cyprians</hi> speech. <hi>Quanto efficacius impetramus quod peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Christi nominae si ipsius Oratione petamus.</hi> And Saint <hi>Augustine.
