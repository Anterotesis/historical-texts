            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In a parlament of the 27. of <hi>H.</hi> 6. a challenge of Seat in parliament betwixt the Earles of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundell</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire</hi> was examined and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted <note place="margin">Rott.

            <p>In that great capitall cauſe of the Duke of <hi>Suffolke, 28. H.</hi> 6. I find not the King once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the debates, but the Duke appealing from his tryall by Peerage to the K. is brought from out the houſe of Lords to a private cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where the King (after the Chancellor in groſſe had declared his offence, and refuſall) him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (but not in place of judgement) adjudged his baniſhment.</p>
            <p>By the Rolls of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. it appeareth that hee <note place="margin">Rot. Parl.

was ſome dayes preſent at debates, and with his owne hand the 31. day of the parlament delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Bill of Trade there read: but had the Memoriall remained, it is no doubt but hee would have beene found as frequent in his great <note place="margin">Ex regiſt.

            <p>Of <hi>H.</hi> 8. memorie hath not been curious; but if he were not often preſent, peradventure that may be the cauſe of the diſorder, which the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Recorder <hi>Fleetwood</hi> in his preface to the <note place="margin">Ex Annalib.

Some as bad, or worſe, when the people have had too much of that, and the King too little, the danger no leſſe. To cut out of either of theſe paternes to follow were but to bee in love with the miſchiefe for the example. The cleerer I preſent this to your Highneſſe, the nearer I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the uprightneſſe of your heart, (the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fortune of your happy ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>Pardon (moſt ſacred Majeſty) that I offer up to your admired wiſedome my weake, but duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obſervations out of all the former ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering.</p>
                  <p>In Conſultations of State, and deciſions of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48380:8"/>
private plaints it is cleare from all times, the King was not ouely preſent to advice and heare, but to determine alſo.</p>
                  <p>In the caſes Criminall, and not of blood to barre the King apart were to ſeclude him the Star-Chamber (as far from reaſon as example:) The doubt is then aloud in crimes meer capitall.</p>
                  <p>I dare not too much commend the times that left theſe Patternes, either for the cauſes or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, but wiſh the one and the other never more.</p>
                  <p>To proceed by publick Act of Commons, Peeres, and King, was moſt uſuall: Appeales are gone by the Law of <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth. Of this now in debate, the way I feare is yet obſcure. As great adviſe of State is as needfull for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as for the Iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>The example in the cauſe of the Duke of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, 28. H.</hi> 6. where the King gave judgement, was proteſted againſt by the Lords.</p>
                  <p>That of the Duke of <hi>Clarence, 6.

In both of theſe the King was ſometimes preſent; but which of theſe may ſuit theſe times I dare not gheſſe.</p>
                  <p>That of 1. <hi>R.</hi> 2. of <hi>Gomenys</hi> and <hi>Weſton</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by the Commons plaint for Treaſon was tryed by the Lords in abſence of the King, but ſentenced by the Lord <hi>Scroop</hi> Steward for the King: The Accuſed were of the ranke of the Accuſers, Commons, and not Lords.</p>

How this will make a preſident to judge in cauſes Capitall a peere of Parliament, I cannot tell, but I ſhould conceive a way anſwerable as well to Parlament as other Courts.</p>
                  <p>If the King and the Lords were Traytors, and the common Aſſentors to the Iudgement, to heare together the charge and evidence, the Lords (as doth the Iurie in other Courts) to withdraw, to find the verdict; and then the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, for the K. to pronounce the ſentence; it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſo by way of Act: a courſe that carryeth with it no exception, and likely to avoyd all cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Queſtions of your Highneſſe preſence there.</p>
                  <closer>If your humble Servant hath in this expreſſion of his deſire to doe you ſervice, preſumed too farre, his comfort is, that where Zeale of Dutie hath made a fault, Benignitie of Goodneſſe will grant the pardon.</closer>
