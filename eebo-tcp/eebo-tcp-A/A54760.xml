         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Certain Pamphlet has lately appear'd in the World
without any Name, which has daringly presum'd
to call that <hi>Pretended,</hi> which you have adjudg'd
and voted Real, I mean the Popish Plot. And indeed it has
been one of the chief designs of the Papists ever since the first
discovery, one of their most laborious endeavours, as well
by Writing as by slanderous reports, to vilifie and render
insignificant that Evidence, which you have both approv'd
and justifi'd; though not before you found it fairly fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:64376:3"/>
the Basis of important Truth. However, that they might
not triumph in the conquests of their Pens, as in the success
of their busie Councils, I undertook this brief Essay to stop
the career of the first, leaving the greater work to a more
mighty Power.</p>
            <p>I have not from hence taken any occasion in the least to
wander among other differences among us, but kept to the
subject; firmly believing the Infallibility of your Counsels
after such a serious Debate, and that it was impossible that
your Prudence should be impos'd upon by one single person,
to weigh and determin as you did. And I thought it would
be more for the honour of a National concern to dedicate
this small Offering to your tribunal, then guiltily to put my
self forth into the World like the Popish Vindicator in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise.
Which is the best Apology I can make, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of this Publick, but most humble Address of</p>

NARRATIVE
OF THE
Popish Plott
VINDICATED:
In ANSWER to
A Scurrilous and Treasonable LIBEL
CALL'D
A Vindication of the English Catholicks, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>CAtiline</hi> in the hight and heat of his Impious Conspiracy,
at what time he was designing the Murther of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
the Massacre of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fathers, and the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Rome</hi> it self by Fire and Sword, had yet the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to enter the Senate, and with a plausible Harangue to justifie
his Innocency. An attempt almost as bold as his March to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Sack of his Native Countrey. In like manner an Imp of
the same Brood, a Traitor of the same facinorous Principles (for the
Abettors in such important cases as these are as bad as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
and Actors) after such lucid and apparent Discoveries of
Papistical <hi>Catilines</hi> and <hi>Cethegus</hi>'s, after so many Examinations of
National Councils and Assemblies, so many Convictions and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
so much unwearied pains and high Expences to disintangle
the Guilty from the Noozes of the Law; has presum'd to steal into
the World, a malicious piece of Labour in Vain, which he calls in
down-right Gibberish, <hi>A Vindication of the Inglish Catholicks from the
pretended Conspiracy against the Life and Government of his Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</hi>
A specious Title indeed, wherein the Venerable Impostor, by
condescending to allow the King his due and undenyable Epithite
of <hi>Sacred,</hi> thinks to charm the Readers Ear, and lay the foundation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64376:4"/>
of his Delusion. It is a thing very easie to ascribe to the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of God the inseparable Title of <hi>Sacred;</hi> but whether such a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
proceed from the real Motives of Duty and Allegiance, or
from the glozing Inducements of constrain'd and Time-serving Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
is many times greatly to be question'd: And indeed never
more to be suspected than at this time, from a Person who pretends
to write a Vindication of the profess'd Enemies not only of our
most Sacred Monarch, but of all Protestant, or as they otherwise
term them, <hi>Heretical Princes.</hi> For if his business be not to Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
those whom we Accuse, his Vindication signifies nothing. I
must needs say indeed, that his Title salutes us with the prospect
of a very lame Story, and an Enterprize undertaken by halves, in
regard he only takes up the Cudgels for the <hi>Inglish Catholicks;</hi> as
if the <hi>Foreigners</hi> were Saints: But he will find himself under a
foul mistake, and that he ought to have prepar'd his Fullers Earth
and his Rubbing Brush for both alike, both being equally sully'd
with the same Crimes, and stain'd with the same bloody Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>The occasion of the Dispute is Truth. The Protestants would
have her on their side, the Catholicks court her to take their part.
To which purpose the private aim of their Vindication is to prove
there was no Popish Plot; the Publick design, to render the First
Discoverer a meer <hi>Caitiffe;</hi> so not to be believd, and consequently
that <hi>England</hi> was at that time and still is govern'd by persons either
strangely credulous, and stupidly unwary, or else as strangely malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Bloodthirsty. Ponderous Accusations to be thrown upon the
Government and Religion of a Nation.</p>
               <p>In the first place therefore it behoves us stricttly to Examine, who
this <hi>Titan</hi> of a Vindicator is, who so boldly dares to Scale the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of Soveraign Majesty, and impeach at once the Prudence and
Justice of Three <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> And then for whom all this Bustle is
made, for whom all this Toyl and Labour is undertaken; who
these pretended Inhabitants of <hi>Salem</hi> are, that breathe out such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of wrong and injury. Who if they once appear such as
we more than justly suspect them to be, will come very far short
of their swelling Expectations.</p>
               <p>There is no question then to be made but that this Potent Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
is a <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> what Title he bears, or what Order he
Musters under, it nothing imports. For of all those Religious Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities,
confirmed by those Imaginary Vicars of Christ, call'd Popes,
there is little or no difference to be made. They are all grown corrupt;
there is not one doth good, no not one. Pride was the Foundation
of their Humility; Impiety of their Devotion, and Interest of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Policy confirm'd and supported their Hypocrisie.</p>
               <p>This is not only one Doctor's Opinion; for take them altogether
<hi>Higglede Pigglede,</hi> one with another, and then hear the Character,
which the great and Famous <hi>Mezeray,</hi> an Author of their own
Profession bestows upon them. <hi>On ne sgauroit, sans rougir Parler,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>We cannot, without Blushing,</hi> sayes he, <hi>speak of the Vsury, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
the Drunkenness, and Dissoluteness of the Clergy in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
of the Licentiousness and Villanous Debaucheries of the Monks in
particular: The Luxury, the Pride and Prodigality of the Prelates;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64376:4"/>
the shameful Sloth, the stupid Ignorance and Superstition both of the one and
the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another place the same Historian speaks in general, that <hi>Harry</hi>
the fourth, during his Reign, <hi>detected above Fifty Conspiracies against
his Life, the most of them contriv'd and fomented by the Church-men
and Religious Orders.</hi> Upon which he makes this remark; <hi>So many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Effects does indiscreet zeal produce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you examine in particular the several Guilds and Societies of those
Papistical Votaries, that so numerously overspread the several Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Europe,</hi> you shall find the <hi>Benedictines</hi> Taxed and upbraided for
their excessive Pride of Habit, their Silken Garments and their guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Shooes, for their Gluttony and Epicurism, and for their excessive
Wine-bibbing, in the primitive times of their Institution. Nay, you
shall find them conspiring to Poyson the Founder <hi>Benedict</hi> himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he held them too strictly to the Observation of his Rules,
From this Order sprang the Monks of <hi>Clugny,</hi> the Monks of <hi>Camal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doli,
Val' Ombrosa, Grandmont,</hi> the <hi>Carthusians,</hi> the <hi>Cistertians</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardines,</hi>
the <hi>Humiliates,</hi> the <hi>Praemonstrates,</hi> and several other Petty
Orders.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Humiliates,</hi> who one would in charity think, should have
been the most harmless and Dovelike people in the World, they were
such a notorious Generation of Vipers, that <hi>Pius</hi> the V. not able to
endure their enormous courses of living, and terrified with their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
assassination of Cardinal <hi>Borroméo,</hi> their Protector, abolished the
whole Order, and would no longer suffer such Vermin within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of his Jurisdiction. Of the Rest, you have this lovely Character
given in general, without any complemental or partial exception, by an
ancient <hi>English</hi> Poet.</p>

                  <hi>Honorius</hi> a Presbyter of the Church of <hi>Autun</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> speaking of
all the whole Rabble, <hi>Contemplare,</hi> saith he, <hi>Monachorum Conciliabula,

               <p>If you survey the fourth <hi>Classis</hi> of Mumpers, Sturdy Beggars, Scrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cravers,
and Spittles, of which number are the <hi>Carmelites, Dominicans,
Franciscans, Minors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> certainly a worse Character cannot well be
given to men, than that which <hi>Nicolaus Gullus,</hi> the seventh Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Master of their Order has conferr'd upon them: Who not only
in a very high measure impeaches their Sloth, their Ignorance, their
Lust and Luxury, but calls them Reprobates, Stigmatiz'd fellows,
Vagabonds, Tale-bearers, Citizens of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Tail of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
drawing after it the third part of the Stars. And these were
they that to uphold the credit of their Mumping Trade, report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and defended it for truth, that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> went a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dominicans</hi> had their rise from Forgery, Fraud and Imposture,
from feigned Miracles, Visions and Apparitions of the Mother of
Christ, now the derision and Laughter of the World; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Politicks of <hi>Rome,</hi> which having experienced the success of
their Founder <hi>Dominick</hi>'s Invectives to the utter destruction of above
a hundred thousand Murther'd <hi>Albigenses,</hi> thought it a piece of their
Ecclesiastical prudence to cherish and propagate such dexterous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of their Cruelty.</p>
               <p>Upon the same Foundations were rear'd the great Priviledges of
<hi>Franciscans,</hi> and <hi>Minorites,</hi> whose crimes, iniquities, impostures, lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Vices of all sorts and sizes, have been the Themes that
have employed the Pens of sundry Learned men, that could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to detect their Enormities. Nor could any thing be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
in History, than that Hellish piece of Villany which was
acted at <hi>Bern</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> upon occasion of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Minorites</hi> and <hi>Franciscans,</hi> about the Conception of the
Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> In which Story the Reader may find the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and two of their own Saints, St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi>
and St. <hi>Katherine,</hi> most audaciously rather nefariously counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
to support their own Assertion. The Relation is to be read
in <hi>Stumpsius</hi>'s Annals of <hi>Switzerland.</hi> Of these <hi>Mendicants, Nicolaus
Clemangis,</hi> Arch-deacon of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> raises a very severe and general
Question: <hi>Quid commendabile de ipsis dicere possumus? Petrus de Aliaco,</hi>
a Cardinal, stiles them, <hi>Hominibus onerosos. Polydore Virgil</hi> calls them,
<hi>Fraudulentorum hominum Sectam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> how they have behav'd themselves in the World,
you may easily see by their Expulsions out of so many Kingdoms
and Common-wealths: Particularly after that Villanous Attempt
upon the Sacred Person of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth by <hi>Iean Chastel,</hi> by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Act of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> it was Enacted, <hi>That the
Priests and Scholars of the Colledge of</hi> Clermont, <hi>and all others of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of</hi> Jesus, <hi>as being corrupters of Youth, disturbers of the publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
and Enemies of the King and Kingdom, should depart the Kingdom
in fifteen dayes, and that their Goods and Revenues should be employ'd in
Charitable works, as the Parliament should think fit.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64376:5"/>
Father <hi>Guignard,</hi> in whose Chamber several Scandalous Libels
were found against <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> was condemned
to be Hanged; and Father <hi>Guerit,</hi> who had been <hi>Chastel</hi>'s Tutor, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
to a perpetual Exilement.</p>
               <p>Of this same mysterious Tribe are all those pretended imitators of
<hi>Iesus,</hi> who having made all <hi>England</hi> ring with their amazing Villanies
and Parricides, have made all <hi>Europe</hi> stare at the Impudence of their
Defences and Denials: For what they cannot Deny, they Vindicate;
what they cannot Vindicate, they Deny; as if there were no truth in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
and that all were falshood but what they coyn in their Mints of
Lying and Equivocation, to support their unsanctified endeavours to
maintain and propagate the power of Antichrist. I say what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Deny, they try to Vindicate. And thus because they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Murther of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Sixtus</hi> the first then Pope, had the
impudence to applaud the Fact, with the Epethites of <hi>Insigne &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morabile,
&amp; longè Majus quam illud Sanctae Iudith.</hi> Which when once
that Lamb of God, who pretends to forgive all the crimes in the world,
had done, no wonder <hi>Mariana</hi> and <hi>Verona</hi> follow'd his steps, the one
in Vindication of <hi>Iacob Clements,</hi> the other of <hi>Iohn Chastel;</hi> no wonder
there should be a Book published at <hi>Doway,</hi> in which the Jesuits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd
the Act of the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> of Absurdity and Injustice;
or that the Jesuits should excite, exhort and encourage <hi>Ravaillac</hi> to
compleat that unhallowed murther which others had so unsuccessfully
attempted. This may suffice to give you a short prospect of the
Credit of the whole <hi>Roman Catholick Clergy,</hi> of which I may say in
brief, as <hi>Callimacus</hi> says of the <hi>Cretans,</hi>
                  <q>

                     </gap>:—Or,</q>
As <hi>Hesiod,</hi> in his Theogonie of the Lying Priests of his time,
<q>

                  </q>
Or rather according to the Character given to the unruly vain Bablers
and Deceivers of his time, by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> out of <hi>Epimenides:</hi>
                  <q>

               </p>
               <p>How then comes it to pass, that men who for so many Ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have been persons of a profligate credit, however they may blind
the World with an outward Sobriety, they that have long ago for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
all their Reputation for common Honesty and Morality; for
what signifies the Morality of discharging the Expences of daily
necessities between Neighbour and Neighbour? what imports an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
civil conversation in obedience to the Law, when at the same
time they are clandestinely designing against those very Neighbours
to deprive them of their Political Tranquility, and hazarding their
Estates by Invading the Soveraign Protection of Both. I say then
how comes it to pass that such persons of profligate credit, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of a profligate Religion; a vicious and mishapen Mixture of
Ceremony and Superstition, that will not pass the Muster of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reason; should be such Sisters and Winnowers of Truth? What
have they to do to be so strictly Inquisitive after the Motes in other
mens eyes, that have such massy Beams in their own? Why should
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64376:6"/>
it be such an improbability to believe, that people that were so active
in their Contrivances against Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi>
the first, should be so unlikely to Plot against <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. As
if the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks had but newly entertained the <hi>Charm</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi>
into their Breasts, and that it was no protection against their
Violences, when as truly worn by his <hi>Predecessors.</hi> With what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
can they presume to be the Judges of the pretended perjuries
of other Man, who themselves trample under foot the solemnity of
<hi>Swearing;</hi> have invaded and corrupted all the Laws of Testimony, and
with the Canker and <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> of their Diabolical Equivocations
have endeavoured to corrode and dissolve the very Ligaments and
Bands of Humane Societies? Because <hi>they</hi> deny, <hi>we</hi> must not be believ'd;
because they assert, there's no Contradiction to be made against them.
A most ignenious project indeed, to propagate the grand Mystery of
Iniquity. What a golden Age it would be among Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Ruffians and Murtherers, and all sorts of Malefactors, were they
but once allow'd to defend their Villanies by their own bare denyal of
the facts, or the Recrimitation of their Accusers. But this Vindicator
and his Crew, because they are no better than such, would fain have
it so to be, that it might be at their own pleasure to Govern the belief
of the World. Because they have render'd all their sayings, their
writings and their Attestations of as little Credit as the <hi>Alchoran;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a thing impossible for any other men to speak Truth. And
yet while they are Sweating, Toyling, Moyling, Panting and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to Stop and Undermine the Truth of Evidence, encouraging
and employing the debauched Pens of Criminals and Protestants in
Masquerade, setting their mercenary Emissaries for pitiful Rewards and
Tavern expences, to fill the Town and Country with their Stories,
Lyes and Fables, to delude Belief and trouble the Stream of succeeding
History, they do but act the same things of which they accuse others,
rather disclosing and evincing than concealing their own shame, and
manifesting the Verity of their foul deeds.</p>

               <p>The Truth is always better detected by a Patient silence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

Vindications, which make it Evident that so much Bustle, so
much stir is not for nothing.</p>
               <p>They confess there was a Plot, but they say it was contriv'd by
others, and not by them. And to that purpose, they endeavour'd to
throw their Meal-Tub-shams upon the Innocent; But the success of
the Proof on both sides was far different; for many of theirs have
suffer'd, none of ours were so much as question'd. And yet such was
their Diligence, such the discouragement of ours, such the strength of
their Party, that perhaps it might have gone hard with some persons,
had there been the least appearance of Truth in what was design'd
by those Knights of the Meal-tub, and crafty Secretaries of Collonel
<hi>Mansel</hi>'s pretended Letters. But all those Elaborate Engines of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
being Providentially overturn'd and render'd unsuccessefull, what
can men of Reason Judge but that all their Windings and Shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
all their Forgeries and Reproaches, all their Rolling <hi>Sisyphus</hi>'s
Stone, are but the Effects of their disappointed Fury to see their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64376:6"/>
tottering Religion more weakned and Expugned by their own Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
practices, that have thrown upon their Nonsensical Superstition
the additional stains and defilements of Treason and Murder, and
awaken'd the Jealousies of all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> to put in Execution
the Motto of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. <hi>Perdam Baylylonis Nomen,</hi> more than all
the Opposition either of <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then all the several Orders of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, and this
Vindicator of the <hi>Inglish Catholicks,</hi> being of the same Gang, are so
far from being Persons of Credit, that they are not only the Subject of
every Satyrical Pen, but the Religious Scorn and Indignation of so
many good and grave Men of their own Profession; we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
that those Thunder-bolts of <hi>Perjury</hi> and concocted Lyes which
they toss with so much Rage at others, will not prove so Fatal as vain
Malice suggests to men of their own lewd Principles.</p>
               <p>Now then to the Particular difference between the Vindicator and
Dr. <hi>Oats.</hi> And first let us see whence comes this dismal Shower of broad
Arrows, and barbed Defiances. It seems, <hi>Non omne malum ab Aquilone;</hi>
a little brush of Misfortune from the South, St. <hi>Omers</hi> and <hi>Doway</hi> must
Club to vindicate the <hi>Inglish Catholicks.</hi> Two Reverend Seminaries of
Mischief, where are the best Forges and the best Artists, as Famous for
Forming Lyes and Reproaches against the Protestants, as the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Montpellier</hi> for making of Tweezers. What Instructors of Youth
they are, is yet fresh in Memory, upon their sending such a Knot of
young Striplings, furnished and fortified with all the Sleights of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
to lye and forswear themselves for Conveniency; a Vertue
which the <hi>Iesuits</hi> thought both Rationable and Justifiable, as being
Applauded by <hi>Lucians Philospeudes,</hi> the Vindicators particular Author.
So that I am afraid there is but little hopes of Truth to come from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these places, where the Masters are so ready, and the Scholars so
apt to learn the Mystery of Lying. His Address to the Reader, he calls to
the <hi>Courteous Reader</hi> (for indeed the Reader must be very courteous
that takes notice what he says) and tells him, he is <hi>to examine a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
which is singular in its kind.</hi> He means something else, whatever
it is; help him Mrs. <hi>Cellier.</hi> For certainly this was not the first dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that ever was made of Popish Conspiracy and Treason in <hi>England,</hi>
and therefore not singular in its kind. But he endeavours to explain
himself, saying, <hi>It is an Original; for its Author found none to copy:</hi>
and he <hi>hopes none will ever copy him.</hi> In truth, I don't understand him
yet; 'twas very discourteously done to chop Nonsence upon a courteous
Reader at the first dash. It was a violent strain to usher in a Quibble.
But whatever the Vindicator meant, the Author of the Original ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meant it should be other. He does well to confess it an <hi>Original;</hi>
for then you may be sure it was the Authors own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No work,</hi> he says, <hi>so like the True Narrative, as</hi> Lucians <hi>True Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
What did this Fool mean to bring the <hi>True Narrative</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi>'s
<hi>True History</hi> together, between which there is no more Paralell or
Similitude than between an Oyster and a Pippin. If he did it to shew
his Learning, he is cursedly mistaken to conclude the falshood of the
true Narrative from the truth of <hi>Lucians</hi> true History. For to tell him
the truth, Lucian<hi>'s true History</hi> is no true History; so that by the force
of his Antithesis, <hi>Lucians</hi> true History being feigned, the <hi>True Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive</hi>
must be <hi>true.</hi> However like one that never read <hi>Lucians</hi> true Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64376:7"/>
he essayes to make out his Comparison, and sayes, <hi>Lucians true
History is witty, the True Narrative stupid.</hi> Go on—<hi>That delights,
this grieves; That laughs, this bites.</hi> A very pretty description of a true
History. However in so doing, it did the Office it was intended for;
it did both grieve and bite, but none but those that deserved it, which
was a greater Argument of its being true, than any the Vindicator
has brought out of <hi>Lucian</hi> to prove it false. So that I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
this Conceit of the Vindicators was conceived in his Heel; as
<hi>Lucian,</hi> in his True History tells ye, the Men in the Moon conceived,
and not in his Head. However he has placed it in the Forefront
of his Battel, to shew ye the strength of his Imagination.</p>
               <p>He sayes, <hi>He never saw the man.</hi> Non imperte—<hi>and so
knows nothing of him but by hear-say, and his works, which discover his
better part, his soul:</hi> I find the shallow Vindicators Prospective-glass
was too short to discover his Soul; but as to his Body, it being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
among the <hi>Iesuits</hi> to abuse those they never saw in their lives,
he adds, <hi>That his Physiognomy in a Pamphlet</hi> is said <hi>to be an Index to all
Villany, and that any letter'd man may read</hi> Rogue <hi>in his face.</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
in the Vindicator two Jesuitical perfections, Malice and Rasca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
from the single authority of a Pamphlet to call a man <hi>Rogue,</hi>
that he never saw in his life. And who wrote this Pamphlet? A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Fortune-teller of their own Gang. A very easie way of defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
to borrow Reproaches from one another. However there
be that say, if they had had his face, they would not have chang'd
it with any of the five Jesuits that were hang'd. <hi>Certain it is, that
being presented to the Bishop of St.</hi> Omers <hi>for Confirmation, he stopt when
he came to</hi> Oats, <hi>because he doubted whether his heart was prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Love, in whose face He perceived
signs of great Malice.</hi> It seems then, the Vindicator <hi>Berogu'd</hi> the man
he never saw, by his own Confession, upon trust; the more
Knave he for his pains; for he was not certain of the first, but
he is certain of This. And what does this signifie? As if the
Bishop of St. <hi>Omers</hi> spoke nothing but Gospel. Men must be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd
by such Enemies to Truth as the Vindicator, because such
disciples of <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> as the Bishop of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> shoot their fools
bolts at Random against a Young Scholars face. An excellent
Reward for a Proselite that came to be admitted into their foppish
Religion. But to return your Bishop Physiognomie for his Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomie;
St. <hi>Francis,</hi> one of his great Saints, was such a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
ill-look't, beetle-brow'd fellow, that when he came to <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
the Third for the Confirmation of his Rule, the Pope bid him
<hi>go wallow with the Hogs, (for whom he was fitter company than for men)
and not trouble him with his Rules.</hi> So much may the Pope, much more
the Bishop of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> be deceived in Humane Physiognomie.</p>
               <p>The Vindicator goes on; <hi>He stiles himself</hi> (quoth he) <hi>Doctor of
Divinity, and sayes he commenced Doctor at</hi> Salamanca. <hi>Which cannot
be; First, for he never was at</hi> Salamanca.</p>
               <p>To which the Doctor answers, That it may be, for First, he was
at <hi>Salamanca.</hi> Now whether the Doctors Argument be not as good
as the Vindicators, I leave to any ordinary Logician: Nay it is more
probable that the Doctor should know whether he was at <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
or no, than a man that never saw him in his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64376:7"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> None but Priests, <hi>saith He,</hi> are admitted to that Degree in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Vniversities, and he never was a Priest.</p>
               <p>To this the Doctor makes answer, that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is in a very great
errour: For that Father <hi>Landayada,</hi> when he was only a <hi>Clericus Minor</hi> was
made a Doctor, and that he was not made a Priest till some time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
But the Doctor could not stay for his Priesthood, because of his
urgent occasions in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Vindicator tells ye a story of the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Tuam,</hi> how the
Doctor <hi>wrote to him for Holy Orders,</hi> which the Bishop deny'd him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the <hi>ill Charracter</hi> he heard <hi>of</hi> his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who does this Vindicator write to? certainly not to the Protestants;
and then what does his Vindication signifie? Here is an <hi>Irish</hi> Priest, that
pretends to an Archbishoprick in the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Dominions, to
which he has no more right than <hi>Tom Thumb,</hi> one that lives under the
ill Character of an Exile, a Renegado, one that has renounc'd his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to his Soveraign, and as a Foreigner gives Him only the Title of
<hi>Most Serene King of Great Britain;</hi> and because this Hedge Archbishop
would not give the Doctor what he had no Power or authority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
and to excuse himself pretends an <hi>ill Character</hi> of the Doctor, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this must pass for currant. 'Tis easily believ'd, that they who usurp
all the good Characters to themselves, have none to spare for the Doctor,
the Capital Enemy of their Treasons and Impieties. It argues nothing
but meer spite and malice to lay general Accusations against a mans Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomy,
and reproach him with the general Term of an <hi>ill Character,</hi>
when they lay nothing in particular to his charge. And so good night to
this silly Objection.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He had not Learning sufficient for any Degree in a Catholick Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.</hi>
That's strange! How then come so many Dunces, Blockheads,
<hi>Ignoramus</hi>'s and stupid Theologists, to obtain their Degrees in Catholick
Universities. A thing so common, that there is nothing more frequently
complain'd of than the doltish Ignorance of the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy. But the
Doctor tells the Vindicator, that he is still resolv'd to assume the Title in
spite of his teeth; and still asserts it to be his Right; and that he had
once a fair <hi>Diploma</hi> to have justifi'd the Truth of it, (if any truth may be
justifi'd to such opinionated and headstrong Mules as the Vindicator and
his Gang) but that <hi>Fenwick, White,</hi> and <hi>Wilmot</hi> rifl'd his Study, and took
it from him, as the Monks of <hi>Doway</hi> serv'd a reformed Brother of Theirs,
by robbing him of his Letters of Orders, to the end he might not be able
to justifie his Ordination. Nevertheless the Doctor is not so bare of Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
but that <hi>Fenwicks</hi> Papers sufficiently witness'd before the Lords, that
the Charges of his Proceeding at <hi>Salamanca</hi> were payd by the Society here
in <hi>London:</hi> A fair Argument, that the Dr. had as much Learning as the
<hi>Quoter</hi> of <hi>Lucians True History,</hi> and as well deserved his Degree for it, as
He will do for his <hi>Vindication.</hi> And thus the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> against his will,
happens to speak an unlucky piece of Truth, That the Doctors <hi>Doctorship
and Papists Treason were both hammer'd on the same Anvil.</hi> For no question but
<hi>Salamanca</hi> was as deeply concern'd in the Plot as St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, <hi>quo he,</hi> I appeal to all who know any thing of the Iesuites, whether
it be credible that <hi>Oats</hi> a Scholar, should be employ'd in Negotiations of State,
of most dangerous nature and highest consequence?</p>
               <p>Oh! are ye come to your Appeals? Then we shall deal well enough
with ye.</p>
               <p>Who would think it <hi>credible</hi> that the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> those Doctors of Policy,
those Engrossers and Forestallers of Learning, should employ such a pitiful
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64376:8"/>
poor <hi>Scholar,</hi> as <hi>Iean Chastell</hi> the Son of a Draper, in such a <hi>Negotiation
of State,</hi> of such a <hi>most dangerous Nature and highest consequence,</hi> as the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a Sacred King? Who would think that that same <hi>Pythagoras</hi> of a
<hi>Iesuite,</hi> should run the Risco of being his Tutor and Instructer to prepare
him for the fact? And yet so it was without any Equivocation, and there
was a fair Attempt made, for which the <hi>Iesuits</hi> were expell'd <hi>France,</hi>
Father <hi>Guignard</hi> was hang'd, and the Philosopher <hi>Gueret</hi> condemned to
perpetual Banishment.</p>
               <p>Now after all this, who would think the Jesuits and other Papists should
be so impudent, as to come with their <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands,</hi> and <hi>How is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bables,</hi>
to Vindicate themselves from the Guilt of the Assassination?
Who would think they should go about to lay their Crimes upon the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> as the Vindicator and his Gang lately endeavour'd to father their
Treasons upon the <hi>Presbyterians?</hi> and yet they were so Impudent, and did
so. For with your good leave, Mr. Vindicator, <hi>Litera Scripta manet,</hi>
there's no fence against the Record of allow'd History.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Libel Printed at <hi>Doway,</hi> against the <hi>Decree</hi> of the
Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> was so confident as to averr, that it was <hi>Fram'd and
compos'd on purpose to render the Iesuits Odious. How is it probable,</hi> cryes the same
Author, <hi>that</hi> Chastel, <hi>such a Proficient in Philosophy, should suffer himself to be
perswaded, that Kings might be Murther'd? How is it likely, that</hi> Chastel
<hi>should so positively affirm, that such approv'd Doctors should write and teach the
same?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the courteous Reader may plainly see, this way of <hi>Iffing</hi> and
<hi>Anding,</hi> and <hi>Appealing,</hi> is no more than their old way of Shamming and
Shifting, reviv'd by the <hi>Compendium,</hi> and imitated again by this same
Learned Reader of <hi>Lucian.</hi> Certain it is, they could not be without some
body to do the Drudgery of Transaction: And why their Pupil <hi>Oats,</hi>
a Scholar, as they themselves call him, might not be as fit a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to go of their Messages, carry their Letters and open 'em by the way,
as any of their learned Priests; why he might not be thought to have
behav'd himself so well among them, as to be trusted, and entrusted,
and trusted again, there has nothing happen'd in the sequel of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
that could make any man think the contrary. Neither indeed
was there that vast difference between the Doctors despised parts, and
the Elevated Capacities of them that were hang'd, but that he might
be an Associate with better men than they at any time. And there is
no greater Argument of his being one of their Chief Instruments, than
the Mistaken Judgment that they made of his Physiognomy. For the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator
confesses they <hi>intended him much good, if his nature had been sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
of good Advice.</hi> Otherwise 'twas very ill done of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> so
lovingly to entertain a person in whose face they <hi>read Rogue,</hi> and was
so obnoxious for the Ill <hi>Characters</hi> of his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> but that through
those very Errors of their silly skill in Phisiognomy, they look'd upon
him as a fit Engine to carry on their designs. So that from his own
conclusion revers'd, since there was nothing of Strangeness or Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the Plot, as being a common piece of Papistical practice, it is
as little strange or Improbable, that <hi>Oats a Schollar</hi> should be employed
in it.</p>
               <p>He would perswade us in the next place, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> was <hi>never employ'd
by Iesuits,</hi> because he says, he knew the Generals <hi>Hand and Seal,</hi> and had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times seen his Name; Yet in the first place, <hi>never hit his name right.</hi> It
might be very true that the Doctor had seen his name, and yet never see it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64376:8"/>
truly written. 'Tis a frequent thing in <hi>England</hi> for strangers to misspell one
anothers names, and it is as frequent to prosecute and sue persons by names
mis-spelt, and yet such a Misnomer invalidates neither the Prosecution nor the
Action. He was right in the bulk of the name <hi>Oliva;</hi> whether it were <hi>De Oliva,</hi> or <hi>Di Oliva,</hi> or <hi>D' Oliva,</hi> it was not a straw matter, neither were the
Letters tak'n in <hi>White</hi>'s Chamber produc'd to prove the wrong or right spell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the General's name, but that he was guilty of the Plot; which doing
so effectually as they did, 'twas not material to examin whether <hi>D' Oliva</hi>'s
name were spelt right or no.</p>
               <p>He says the Doctor mistakes the Inscription of the Seal, and that <hi>there
never was a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in any Iesuits Seal.</hi> A General and therefore very bold asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And yet he confesses the Seal varies, and sometimes contains one thing,
then another. But what is this to the purpose? for throughout all the true
Narrative the Doctor does not undertake to tell the <hi>Inscription</hi> of the <hi>Iesuits
Seal.</hi>
He saies indeed in his true <hi>Narrative,</hi> that <hi>I. H. S.</hi> signified the <hi>Iesuits:</hi>
He also says that the Commissions to the chief Conspirators <hi>were stamped by the
General of Iesuits,</hi> but concerning the form or fashion of the Seal, there is not
one single Syllable. The Vindicators business is to answer the true Narrative;
if he do not that, he does nothing. Alas poor silly <hi>Woodpecker!</hi> He come to
strike at the root of a discovery with such dull Tools as these! I had thought he
would have brought such dismal Instruments of Ruin, that would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd
the very Foundations of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> that he would have put off
his Doublet, fallen to work, and outdone <hi>Hercules</hi>'s twelve Labourers: Instead
of this, he comes in sneaking like some superannuated Pigmy, with a couple
of formal sentences, which his Grandmother taught him, or else collected out
of <hi>Gregories Morals,</hi> or some such musty Author; as if he had quitted the
force of Reason, and intended to proceed by the more lazy way of <hi>Miracle.</hi>
Alas! we knew that <hi>the speaking of material contradictions weaken the Credit of
a Witness;</hi> we knew what <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Falshood</hi> were, without the aid of his
Nonsensical Information. Then he rambles into the Tryals of <hi>Ireland, Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
and <hi>Langhorn,</hi> which no way belong to his Province, and for Reply to
which we shall referr the Reader to Dr. <hi>Oats</hi>'s Vindication in Answer to the
<hi>Compendium,</hi> from whence this feeble Vindicator has rifl'd both his matter and
his Observations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he proceeds and says,</hi> The Doctor declar'd in Parliament, He had no
body considerable to accuse besides those he had nam'd, but after he accused some of
the very Prime, whom before he had not nam'd.</p>
               <p>From this Suggestion, though absolutely false, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> would have
the Dr. <hi>Evidently perjur'd.</hi> To which purpose he sets up a Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
consisting of himself, and by the help of a Scrap of <hi>Latin,</hi> and a versicle
of Scripture nothing to the purpose (as being far more applicable to himself
and his party) condemns the Doctor, and declares himself satisfi'd.</p>
               <p>And thus you see, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has got a great Victory; he
has convinc'd himself; and so there's one of his great Labours over. One
would have thought he would have stop'd here, as believing the World
would have been fully satisfied in his Judgment. But he proceeds and sayes,
<hi>the manner of the Accusation is such, as any Knave by his Oath might bring any
person in Question.</hi> He means, the Accusation was an Accusation; for all the
World knows, an Accusation justified upon Oath, will bring the Parties
accused into Question. But Accusations of that Importance as are contain'd
in the <hi>True</hi> Narrative, are too high attempts to be carryed on by ordinary
<hi>Knaves,</hi> but only such extraordinary Knaves as themselves; such as they that
had so lately contriv'd to put their Shamms upon the Innocent, to cover their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64376:9"/>
own shame. But there was this difference between the Doctors Accusation
and theirs, that his was providentially upheld, theirs by Providence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have a long story,</hi> quoth the Vindicator, <hi>of Treasonable Words spoken, and
Treasonable Letters written by several, who all protest they never heard of any such
thing, till</hi> Oats<hi>'s Narrative appear'd.</hi> Assuredly this <hi>Fop</hi> of a <hi>Vindicator</hi> wrote
his Vindication to be laught at; for men were not such Fools to betray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And yet in some measure by the help of their dear Minion, Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they protested the Truth. They did not believe they had spoken Treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Words, or written Treasonable Letters, till the Doctors Narrative ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
both their Words and Letters were so adjudged: but then it seems
their Ears were open'd; and you do not hear the Vindicator urge their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
any farther than the appearing of the Narrative. The Story of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingfield,</hi>
as he by his own Confession relates it out of a Pamphlet, scribl'd by
one of his confederates (by which you may see from what Muck-hills of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he rakes his scoundrel Observations) to speak his own Language, is a
wicked Lye. For <hi>Bedingfield</hi> knew there was a Pacquet lay for him at the
Post-house; but not daring to fetch it himself, sent a Friend for it, and when
he had it, shew'd it another Cordial Friend, besought him to carry the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to Court, and to improve them to the best advantage (which the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
calls <hi>doing his Duty:</hi>) Thereupon the Letters were shewn in Council as
disown'd by <hi>Bedingfield,</hi> and an Argument drawn from thence of the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of the Plot, that men should of themselves produce Letters of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence;
but <hi>Bedingfield</hi> being sent for to be examin'd about them, could
not be found high nor low; he had prudently withdrawn himself out of
harms way. The Story of <hi>Atalanta</hi> had taught <hi>Bedingfield</hi> that piece of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
who not daring to trust himself to an Escape with such papers about
him, like those that scatter Gold to prevent the swiftness of pursuit, sent his
troublesome Pacquet to employ the debates of the Council, when the business
was new and scarcely believ'd, while he shifted for himself. Otherwise Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bedingfield</hi> might as well have carryed his Innocent Pacquet to Court
himself, as have troubled his Friend. And it had been a noble piece of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
for such a <hi>Grave Father</hi> to have appear'd, and by the Discovery of the
Doctors Knavery, as they call it, to have diverted the Tempest so blackly
threatning the heads of his dear friends. But to give the Vindicator Scripture
for Scripture, out of the very next words to his Quotation, in the first <hi>Epistle</hi>
to <hi>Timothy;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The rest of the Paragraph is meer Canting and Mockery of God and
Men; the more ridiculous for his quotation of <hi>Whitebread.</hi> As if he had

of Executed Traytors.</p>
               <p>But now he will <hi>follow the Deponent step by step.</hi> There's something in
that, for all this while he has done nothing. <hi>And what</hi> he <hi>says,</hi> shall be
confirm'd <hi>by</hi> the <hi>undoubtedly true Attestation</hi> of Arch-bishop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd

the rest of his bloody <hi>Canaille;</hi> Murtherers shall give it ye under their

Drive on Coachman. <hi>For though in Equity our bare Denyal ought
to be preferr'd before his Asseverations,</hi> when the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is Chancellor,
not otherwise; <hi>for, in dubio favendum est reo, prius quam Actori,</hi> which
is utterly deny'd him, when hitherto neither Justice nor Reason have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64376:9"/>
made any doubt of the Guilt of his Party; <hi>Yet he will prove irrefragably
what he advances;</hi> that is, if he can. However his heart is good, and he
promises fair; so that if the old Proverbs of <hi>Curst Cows</hi> and <hi>Threatned
Folks</hi> do not help us, we are all at a loss. In the two following Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs
you shall find him Accoutring Himself to make his publick Entry,
putting on the Vizor of a starched Humility, dressing himself in all Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments
of Dissimulation and Hypocrisie, Flattering the King whom he
abhorrs in his heart, Colloguing with the Parliament which he abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
and acting all the tricks of Jesuitical Mountebankry that St. <hi>Omers</hi>
Magazine could furnish him withall.</p>
               <p>He says, he will not <hi>repeat the Seditious and Traiterous words of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Sacred Person;</hi> that is to say, he owns 'em all to be true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will not put himself upon impossibilities, to Vindicate the <hi>English
Catholicks</hi> in this particular. As for his complement to His Majesty, 'tis
only to be lookt upon as the forced Effect of Papistical Dispensation, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
at this conjuncture. There's never a time that he calls the King
<hi>Sacred,</hi> but he receives Absolution. Else he would endure a long demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and a severe chastisement in Purgatory, to call that person <hi>Sacred</hi>
whom he knows to be Excommunicated by his Lord God the Pope,
and depriv'd of his Dominions by his Ecclesiastical Censures. <hi>Certainly,</hi>
saies he, the words <hi>were never spoken by any Papist, Priest or Iesuit.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they were; and some of them were hang'd for their pains; nor
is it the first time they have done so. The Papists, and among them the
Monks and Jesuits, were they that unking'd <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and
left him nothing but the bare Title of <hi>Henry Valois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Monks and Jesuits were they that made the Pulpits of <hi>Paris</hi>
ring with their Rebellious Declamations against their Soveraign. And the
whole Faculty of Theology then among the Papists esteemed the chiefest of
<hi>Christendom,</hi> gave it for their Opinions, that the <hi>French</hi> were Absolv'd from
their Allegiance to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Valois.</hi> And does the Vindicator believe there
were neither Papists, Monks nor Jesuits of that Facalty?</p>
               <q>—Credat Iudaeus Apella.</q>
               <p>What Priest, Monk or Jesuit durst give the Title of <hi>Sacred</hi> to <hi>Henry of
Navarr,</hi> whom <hi>Sixtus</hi> the V. their Head and Lord, by whom they all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
had condemned for a Heretick, depriv'd of his Dominions, and declared
incapable of Succeeding to the Crown. The <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> the <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its,</hi>
and allmost all the <hi>New Orders of Religion,</hi> (among which we are to
believe there were neither Papists nor Monks) were they that contriv'd
and fomented the League of the <hi>French</hi> Papists against their two Soveraigns,
<hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Father <hi>Claude Matthieu,</hi> a Jesuit, was
call'd <hi>Le Courier de la ligne,</hi> because of his continual Posting to <hi>Rome</hi>
for the advancement of that Rebellion. And can any man be so stupid
as to imagin, that all this while those Fryars, Monks and Jesuits, never
spoke treasonable words, when they utter'd nothing but Treason in their
Pulpits; never wrote Treasonable Letters, without which such a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could never be carryed on; or believ'd the Title of <hi>Sacred</hi> belong'd to
Pope-condemn'd and Anathema'd Princes?</p>
               <q>—Credat Iudaeus Apella.</q>
               <p>I fetch not these Instances out of Protestant Records, but from their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64376:10"/>
own Historians. From whence I argue the Falshood and Arrogance of this
quacking Vindicator, and by which all men of Sence and Story may see
what credit there is to be given to the rest that follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Did</hi> he <hi>see</hi> his <hi>Observations would be Offensive to any in Authority, he
would suppress them.</hi> No, no—'tis well enough; For though this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Vindicators be an Impudent Reflection upon the Supream
Authority of <hi>England,</hi> and those who at present Govern the Helm of State,
yet some compassion may be shew'd to his sawcy Supposition, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Blindness, in regard that by divulging his inconsiderate Malice, he
has rather justified the proceedings of those in Authority, than Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
those Miscreants whom they punished. <hi>The Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi>
are mightily beholding to him for his Acknowledgments, though 'tis
verily suppos'd, They will hardly return him their Thanks, unless he will
vouchsafe to come over and fetch it himself. He did ill, when he was in
such a Courteous vein, not to thank 'em too for Voting what was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
in the Narrative to be Truth: Then the disproof of the true Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
would render him an <hi>Illustrious Vindicator</hi> indeed. Nothing could
be sufficient for his recompence, but the Pontificate it self. But the lewd
progress he makes presages so ill of his side, that if he ever come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
in the Church, it must be by his Duncery, and not by his Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.</p>
               <p>But now he returns to the King, and <hi>hopes His Majesty will not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with harmless Endeavours to Vindicate persons wrongfully accused.</hi> He
forgets his Title of <hi>Sacred</hi> already; and Blaspheming that <hi>Sacred</hi> Majesty
which he pretends to reverence, presumes to tell the King, that those
persons whose Crimes and Treasons he himself had so patiently and with
so much consideration examin'd, were <hi>wrongfully accused.</hi> Yet not content
with this, under the disguise of humble Admonition, from his Castle of
St. <hi>Omers,</hi> more daringly assails his <hi>Sacred</hi> Honour, and Taxes him of
shedding Innocent Blood. Who would not now believe this Miscreant
Vindicator Himself, to be one of those that contriv'd the Assassination of
his <hi>Sacred</hi> Person, that so irreligiously Attacks and Undermines his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Reputation? And what is all this clamor for? Onely for putting to
deserved Death a company of Varlets and Vagabonds, who ought to have
been hang'd, if for nothing else, for only Scaperloytring within the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Limits of his Dominions. He is now got into a Preaching hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and sayes, <hi>Defence of Life and Honour is commanded by the Law of
Nature.</hi> 'Tis so, and therefore his most Sacred Majesty is resolv'd to
take the best care he can to preserve his own, and the Life and Honour
of his Subjects, from the Villanous Attempts of the <hi>Vindicator</hi> and his
Confederates. <hi>For,</hi> pursues he, <hi>should we admit the Reproaches of Traitors,
Conspirators, Plotters, King-killers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we were not fit to live in any State.</hi>
'Tis very true; and therefore because they could not avoid those Reproaches,
that's the very reason they have been expell'd out of so many States and
Kingdoms, and particularly out of This. And so to his</p>

                  <p>Well—here Friend—what's your business?</p>
                  <p>

               <p>It is a very irrefragable Argument indeed, and I suppose such a one
as they call at St. <hi>Omers, Argumentum ad Hominem;</hi> that is, the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
calls to Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> being a Man, and tells him, If it be so—'tis so—
If it be otherwise—'tis otherwise—From whence I argue, that if
the Logick of St. <hi>Omers</hi> be no profounder, it may be easily fathom'd.</p>
               <p>Well then for once we will grant, that if the Doctors Narrative be
true, he merits Reward; if false, he deserves Punishment. Now what's
the Consequence? Why the Consequence is this. If the Narrative be
<hi>false, no Crime can be greater than</hi> His. If <hi>true, no reward can be too great.</hi>
I appeal to both the Universities, whether this be not acutely argued?
But, Heaven be prais'd, the Logical fit is over, and the <hi>Vindicator</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
himself to his former method of rambling Discourse, which better
agrees with his humour, if I may not say Capacity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You boast,</hi> saith the Vindicator, <hi>of your inbred Loyalty, which neither your
Education nor your Discourse confirm.</hi> Suppose a man be bred a <hi>Turk</hi> or
a <hi>Iew,</hi> what is that to the purpose how he was educated in his Youth?
He left his Fathers Education, and came to you to St. <hi>Omers</hi> for Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
why did not you teach him better? We had thought you had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
your Vindication against the Doctor, not his Eather. Now for
his Discourse, you say, the Doctor <hi>calls concealing Treasons and concurring
with Treasons (the subject of his Majesties Pardon) Human frailties, as if he
esteemed them little Peccadillo's, and Venial sins.</hi> Pray, Mr. Vindicator, where
were your Brains? or how long did you scratch before you hit upon this
learned Exposition of yours. For he sayes no such words, and the sence
of what he writes you most falaciously misinterpret. The Doctor sayes
only this, that the Narrative had its <hi>rise</hi> from his <hi>inbred Loyalty,</hi> and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits
<hi>support</hi> under God to <hi>his Majesties gracious Pardon for several humane
frailties in the Management:</hi> As much as to say, His Majesties Gracious
Pardon of several Humane frailties in the conduct of his discovery, were
the support of it against the Machinations of such subverters of Truth
as the Vindicator. His Pardon for concealing your Treasons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with your Crew, was a Pardon of another nature, which there
was no occasion here to mention: By the way, good Mr. <hi>Screw-sence,</hi>
in your Reply, be sure to tell us what you mean by <hi>Little Peccadillo</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>To what the Doctor says, <hi>That the many encroachments of the Papists
upon Princes for these thousand Years, prove their Inclinations for the future.</hi>
You answer, <hi>What will the Encroachments of the Presbyterians prove?</hi>
What's that to you, or what is it to the purpose? The Encroachments
of the Presbyterians are no Excuses of the Encroachments of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.
The Presbyterians stick strangely in your Stomach. I find you
want Employment. You would fain animate the Protestant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
against the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> 'Tis true, we know you could help 'em
to a Massacre or two at a short Warning. But at present there is no
such occasion. In the mean time, what say you to the Encroachments
of the Papists? That's your Charge. With much adoe at length you
say, That the Rebellions, which you mincingly call the <hi>Disorders</hi> of the
Catholicks, were <hi>like Agues in the Spring, neither painful nor dangerous,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64376:11"/>
and leave the Body more healthy than before.</hi> So you conclude that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
may be Rebels, massacre, murder, play the Devils with two Sticks,
'tis all for the health of a Kingdom. So you murder'd <hi>Henry</hi> the third,
and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, for the Health of the Kingdom? God preserve
<hi>England</hi> from your Papistical Agues. Here's a Vindicator of the <hi>Inglish
Catholicks</hi> indeed, to support and encourage Treason, while he endeavours
to vindicate 'em from it! The <hi>Catholicks</hi> have great hopes of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the True Narrative.</p>
               <p>He is offended that the Dr. Charges the late <hi>unnatural War</hi> upon the
<hi>Papists.</hi> But 'tis very true, for all his Ale and History; for had not the
Papists perpetrated that Inhumane Massacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> those other heats of
a few violent Spirits had soon been overmaster'd. But when the Papists by
that bloody means had conjur'd up the fears and jealousies of the Nation
for the common safety, 'twas high time to disarm Papists, and put Priests
and Jesuits to death. Afterwards, when the Kingdom was all in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion,
the Papists flock'd to the King not so much out of Loyalty, as to
protect themselves from the Revenge that threaten'd the Crimson Fact they
had committed. Then for the service they did the King, it was none at
all, but rather an injury; for they did but weaken and pull down his, as
the <hi>Huguenots</hi> by adhering to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, advanced and Strengthened
the Duke of <hi>Guises</hi> party, to the destruction of both those unfortunate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.
We could give the <hi>Vindicator</hi> a cluster of Evidences of the Disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of the <hi>Inglish Catholicks</hi> to their Native Soveraigns. Particularly, how
unlikely a thing it is, that they who would have murthered King <hi>Iames</hi>
in his Cradle, should prove Loyal to his Father? that they should fight
out of Loyalty for the preservation of his Majesties Crown, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Cause? No, no, they hop'd by that Disunion, which they appear'd
in only to advance and render more desperate, that there would be no
need of Catholick Arms to reduce them to the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, but that in
time they would pave the way to it themselves. But being defeated of
their hopes, then they fell to their old way of Plotting, according to the
method of the Doctors Narrative. Had the Dr. added, that the Papists were
the first Contrivers of the late Wars for the <hi>health</hi> of the Nation, the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator
would have been pleased; but because he did not, therefore he was
displeased: And because he cannot be reveng'd upon the Doctor, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he falls pell mell again upon the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> asking questions with
one side of his Mouth, and answering them with the other. Who did
this? The Presbyterians; Who did that? The Presbyterians. Who did
the t'other thing? The Presbyterians. But to retaliate his Kindness, the
Vindicator must give us leave to ask a few questions in the same manner.
Who massacred the poor innocent <hi>Albigenses?</hi> The Papists. Who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that bloody Butchery in <hi>Paris?</hi> The Papists. Who massacred the
poor harmless <hi>Piedmontors?</hi> The Papists. Who were the Actors of that
impious Tragedy in <hi>Ireland?</hi> The Papists. Who were the Contrivers
of this last horrid Plot? The Papists. So that the Vindicator does but
sharpen his own weapons against his own and the breasts of his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and the <hi>dirt of Rebellion</hi> still remains as foul as ever upon their own
Hypocritical Habits. I will ask the Vindicator but one Question more;
Who they were that brought a Petition to <hi>Oliver Cromrel,</hi> wherein they
promis'd that if He would Tolerate the Popish Religion in <hi>England,</hi> they
would assist him to extirprate the Family of the <hi>Stewards?</hi> And whether
they were not as like to proffer a thousand Pounds for the discovery of
his Majesties Escape after <hi>Worcester</hi> Fight? As long as it was the Act of
the Papists, 'tis no matter for the Mistake of a Name or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64376:11"/>
Upon his next Repetition of the following Expression in the Epistle, <hi>What
Arguments can perswade them to be true to their natural, who profess Allegiance,
out of Conscience to a Foreign contrary Soveraign?</hi> He Answers <hi>readily, no
English Papist doth so.</hi> He may well say readily; for such Answers, indeed,
are very readily coyn'd. But I say, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> thou lyest: For if the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Papist do not do so, he is no Papist, but a Mungrel. To prove this, he
renounces his Religion, and says, <hi>That the Pope, out of his temporal Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is no more regarded than the D. of</hi> Parma, <hi>or the Prince of</hi> Monaco.
This is another manifest untruth; For it is the positive Doctrine of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
that by meer Divine Right, the Pope is supream and sole Monarch of
the World; and that all Monarchs and Princes are his Vassals (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
his authority in temporals as well as spirituals): Insomuch, that the
Legat of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> told <hi>Frederick Barbarossa</hi> to his face, <hi>That he held his
Empire at the pleasure of the Holy Father;</hi> which if they did not believe for
Gospel, and that they were not tyed in greater Bonds of allegiance to the
Pope, than to their native Princes, they would never so often have
revolted and renounc'd their fidelity to their Soveraigns, as they have
done upon every trifling Excommunication from the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And it
would be a ridiculous vanity for the Pope to assume to himself a power of
depriving Princes of their Kingdoms, which is a supream authority in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals,
if he thought the people did not believe themselves bound to obey
him in temporals as well as spirituals. 'Tis the fear of temporal accidents,
not the spiritual Fulminations, that has scar'd so many Princes, and brought
the Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> almost to a morsel of Bread. But this same <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>
and his crew, are such a parcel of obstinate, willful Vermin, that
they will believe nothing in the World, either of History or Reason, that
makes against them, be it never so certain, never so plain.</p>
               <p>All the rest of this Chapter is nothing but ribble-rabble, as wide from the
purpose, as <hi>Dan</hi> from <hi>Bersheba.</hi> Now we are come to the <hi>Contradictions</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">A Discovery in the Address to the Reader.</head>
               <p>'TIS very true, here is a prodigious yelping and bawling, a hideous
Black <hi>Sanctus</hi> of <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Contradictions, Contradictions</hi> and <hi>Lyes,</hi>
beyond all the yells and dins of <hi>Green-Hastings</hi> and <hi>Mackarel.</hi> But now
I think on't, I can tell what's the matter; the Jesuits are ringing all their
Bells backward to raise the Country upon Dr. <hi>Oates:</hi> And yet after all this
confounded noise, enough to startle all the wild Beasts in a <hi>Lybian</hi> Forrest,
the Vindicator tells us not a word what a Lye or a Contradiction is; as if
that men of sense were such silly Partridges to Cowre under the Lowbells of
Jesuitical clamour. These Jesuits are a pack of Knaves that must be look'd
after. 'Tis a Thousand pound to a Nutshell, but that this deceitful <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
may have arraign'd and condemn'd for Lyes and Contradictions, those
things which are not so; and that for Perjury, which deserves no such sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
And therefore, for the better discovery of the Vindicator's fraud,
it will not be amiss to produce the several definitions of <hi>Contradictio, Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacium,</hi>
and <hi>Perjurium,</hi> that so the Vindicator's pretended accusations being
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64376:12"/>
brought to their several Tests, the juggles of this St. <hi>Omers</hi> Pamphleteer,
may more easily be made apparent.</p>
               <p>A Lye, then, is that by which a false thing is signified either in word or
deed, with an intent to deceive.</p>
               <p>A Lyar is one that delights to speak a Falsity which he knows to be so;
or a Truth which he believes to be false.</p>
               <p>On the other side, he is no Lyar who tells a thing that is false, which he
verily believes to be true; he may be said to err, not to tell a Lye.</p>
               <p>Now in this first Chapter he tells us, the Deponent says,</p>
               <p>The Narrative was presented to His Majesty the 13th of <hi>August</hi> last, and
sworn upon the Sixth of <hi>September.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, like a great Knave (for 'tis fit he should have as good as he brings)
he calls Two <hi>Great Lyes;</hi> for as to the first, he says, the Narrative <hi>contains
things averr'd to have happened upon the</hi> 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 <hi>of</hi> September <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</hi>
And what of all this? The Narrative was presented privately in
<hi>August,</hi> at what time, and till the Eighth or Ninth of <hi>September</hi> following,
the Deponent remained undiscovered.</p>
               <p>To the next he answers, That the <hi>Dr. and Sir</hi> Edmund-bury Godfrey
<hi>assure it was sworn the Twenty-seventh of</hi> September. That is false; for the
date of the Certificate which he carps at, is only the date of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Godfrey</hi>'s Certificate, that it was sworn before him, not when it was
sworn.</p>
               <p>But suppose these passages had been both false, where is the intent of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
that made them Lyes? The intent of deceiving must have lain in the
falsity of the Narratives being actually presented, or actually sworn to;
which being really true, the error of a trivial circumstance, is but one
of your <hi>Little Piccadillo's</hi> as you call them.</p>
               <p>And now Mr. Vindicator, are not you a pitiful, idle, inconsiderate, both
Fool and Knave, in a vindication of the <hi>English Catholicks</hi> from so horrid a
crime as they lye under, which should have been weighty and great, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
and Porter-like to give a Gentleman the Lye to posterity, upon
such silly, illiterate, pitiful and low-conceited inadvertencies as these? Give
me leave to tell you, Sir, you have hitherto shewed us nothing but the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms

               <head type="sub">Containing his Informations from Spain.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter the Vindicator pretends to tell us of abundance of Lyes:
For as yet, I meet with neither <hi>Contradictions,</hi> nor <hi>Perjury.</hi> Observe
now how he makes them out.</p>
               <p>He denies that <hi>Strange</hi> the Provincial, <hi>Keines, Langworth, Harcourt and
Fenwick did write a Treasonable Letter to</hi> Suiman <hi>at</hi> Madrid, <hi>concerning the
contriving and plotting a Rebellion in</hi> Scotland; And yet you see there was a
Rebellion in <hi>Scotland</hi> soon after, which makes it shrewdly suspicious, or in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64376:12"/>
plain English altogether credible. But what's his Reason? Because there
was never any such Letter. How does he prove it? By the Attestation of
<hi>Strange</hi> himself, the very first person accused of the Plot in the Doctors
Narrative. And then again, he says, <hi>It never was the practise of the Iesuits,
that many should sign their Names with the Provincial.</hi> Neither does the
Doctor say any such thing; He says, they wrote the Letter, that is, they
were present at the Writing of it, which is the same thing: So that the
Attestation of <hi>M. K. R. S. C. B.</hi> and the rest of his <hi>several confederate Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
was only a trifle of supererogation.</p>
               <p>He denies that <hi>Morgan, Wright</hi> and <hi>Ireland were imployed to preach as
Presbyterians to the disaffected</hi> Scots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How does he know all this? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no English <hi>Iesuit was ever sent into</hi> Scotland. Wright <hi>was infirm, and
went into</hi> England <hi>for his health.</hi> As if <hi>England</hi> had not been in his way to
<hi>Scotland.</hi> But <hi>he was recall'd shortly after.</hi> How long that might be, God knows,
considering how the Jesuits are able to stretch such a Whitleather word
as <hi>shortly.</hi> And as for <hi>Morgan</hi> and <hi>Ireland, they never were out of</hi> England.
Just as he denied his being in <hi>London,</hi> because he was in the liberties of
<hi>Westminster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He denies that the Dr. broke up those Letters at <hi>Burgos,</hi> and read the
Contents. His Reason?—Because he has told ye, <hi>there were no such Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
therefore he could not read the Contents.</hi> This is just like their silly
pleading at <hi>Newgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Third Article he has found a nest of <hi>Lyes,</hi> no less than Four at a
time, denying, <hi>That</hi> Ashly, Blondel, <hi>and the Two</hi> Peters'<hi>s sent Twelve Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
into</hi> Spain, <hi>Eight to</hi> Valladolid, <hi>and Four to</hi> Madrid, <hi>as appear'd by their
several Patents, who were obliged by the Iesuits to renounce their Allegiance to
His Majesty of</hi> Great Britan <hi>in the hearing of the Deponent.</hi> 1. Because the
<hi>Students</hi> are <hi>never sent away by any but the Rector, or Vice-Rector.</hi> With the
Vindicator's favour, the Jesuits have no such Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
but which the Rector or the Provincial may dispence with upon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Besides the Rector has his <hi>Consultores</hi> or Assistants, whom he may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
to act for him.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Never any Patent among Iesuits had more than one name.</hi> There's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
says to the contrary; If Twelve Scholars have Twelve Patents, what
need of more than one Name in a Patent?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Because there is not one word of renunciation in the Oath of those Colledges.</hi>
Who said there is? They might renounce their Allegiance to the King,
and yet not take the Colledge-Oath.</p>
               <p>4. He could not hear a thing done in a place where he never was: but
he never was at <hi>Madrid;</hi> therefore. But he was at <hi>Madrid</hi> in spite of your
Teeth, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Nor could the Dr. hear it done at <hi>Valladolid;</hi> for the Oath
is never tendered to the <hi>Novices, till they have past a whole year in that place.</hi>
You mistake the point, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Dr. talks not of the Oath, he speaks of the
Renunciation, without which, their very admittance would have defil'd the
Colledge.</p>
               <p>He denies, as being Two more <hi>Lyes, That Dr.</hi> Armstrong <hi>brought Letters
subscribed by Five Iesuits, in which was expressed that the Iesuits in</hi> London
<hi>intended to dispose of the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because <hi>those Letters were sign'd by more than the Rector:</hi> For which, he
brings his former Attestation of <hi>Iohn an Okes and Iohn a Stiles.</hi> What a
strange thing this is! He will not allow Five men to subscribe their own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64376:13"/>
2. Because <hi>there never was any such thing contain'd in those Letter, as they
protest who wrote them;</hi> As by their Attestations appears.</p>
               <p>He denies, <hi>that</hi> Suiman <hi>wrote, that the King of</hi> England <hi>was poyson'd.</hi>
Upon what ground? Why, because <hi>neither</hi> Suiman <hi>nor any other person ever
heard such news.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He denies <hi>that</hi> Strange, Gray, <hi>and</hi> Keines <hi>wrote in a Letter to</hi> Suiman, <hi>that
they were using all diligence to get the King dispatch'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because <hi>it is false that ever</hi> Strange <hi>writ any such Letter;</hi> as appears by
his own Attestation.</p>
               <p>2. Because <hi>it is false that the</hi> Dr. <hi>was ever at</hi> Madrid; which they prove
by Three Attestations of their own drawing.</p>
               <p>He denies <hi>that at the same time, at</hi> Madrid, <hi>the Deponent ever saw a Letter
from</hi> Strange, Grey, Keines, Langworth, Fenwick, Ireland <hi>and</hi> Harcourt,
<hi>wherein they exprest their sorrow the business was not done, through the faint-heartedness
of their man</hi> William.</p>
               <p>1. Because <hi>he was never there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Because <hi>it was against the custom of Iesuits,</hi> already repeated. But this
was upon an extraordinary occasion; and besides, they were then in a place
where they were not tied to observe Customs.</p>
               <p>3. Because <hi>there never was any such Letter;</hi> as by their own attestations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
               <p>I marry, <hi>Sir,</hi> here's the Sparring Argument at last.</p>
               <p>He denies, <hi>That</hi> Pedro Hieronymo de Corduba <hi>Provincial of</hi> New-Castile,
<hi>sent a Letter by the Deponent to</hi> Strange, <hi>wherein he promised Ten thousand
pound for their pains, if they could get the business dispatch'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because P. H. de Corduba <hi>was never Provincial of</hi> New-Castile. 'Tis
not a straw matter whither he were or no.</p>
               <p>2. Because <hi>he left</hi> Valladolid <hi>upon the 30th of</hi> October, <hi>and not the Third
of</hi> November. The Vindicator was hard put to't to cavil so strictly for a
day.</p>
               <p>3. Here's their old friend in a corner, that never fails 'em; because <hi>there
was no such Letter,</hi> as their own Knight o'the post avers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But besides this, there are Three improbabilities in the case, That the</hi> Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<hi>of</hi> Castile <hi>should go about to allure the English Iesuits with such a reward,
who needed rather a Bridle than Spurs.</hi> You are still upon mistakes; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was not to reward the Jesuits, Ten thousand pound was a Fleabite to
what they expected; but to shew there should be no want of Money, should
their Chapmen ask too dear.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That he who could not dispose of any money out of his Province, should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
them such a sum.</hi> By your favour, <hi>Sir,</hi> but he might, when it was
money entrusted in his hands, and left to his disposal upon such and such an
accompt.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>That he should trust the</hi> Dr. <hi>with such a Letter, whom he had newly cast
out of the Colledge.</hi> That very thing argues all you have said about the
Doctors Expulsion, to be a St. <hi>Omers</hi> Lye; which exceed our English Lyes
Ten times as much in bigness, as one of your Onions surpasses ours.</p>
               <p>Thus Gentlemen you have seen what this Nickapoop of scurrilous Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
has hitherto called Lyes, and how he has proved them. 'Twas not so,
because it was not so—'twas not so, because it could not be so—and it could not be so, because they themselves say so—<hi>Ergo.</hi>—Now I would fain know of you, good Mr. Vindicator, whither if you, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64376:13"/>
another as bad as your self, should both steal a Horse, and your friend
escaping, you should be taken, arraign'd, and the matter of fact prov'd, I
say, I would fain know, whether if you, being asked what you had to say
for your self, should pretend the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> stole the Horse; or if that
would not serve, you should protest you knew nothing of the Horses being
stolen, till you were Indicted; and that your confederate, that was with
you, should attest it under his hand, that you did not steal the Horse; Do
you believe that these evasions should save you from being hang'd? 'Tis an
experiment, I assure you, well worth your coming into <hi>England</hi> to make
tryal of, in regard, that if you escaped upon those excuses, it would very
much conduce to strengthen the Arguments of your Vindication; and

variety, wherein as he proceeds according to his former method, the
Answers will be the more ready at hand. It is averr'd by no meaner a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
than <hi>Casaubon,</hi> a man of great Learning and unspotted reputation, that
a Jesuit in <hi>France,</hi> with his own mouth, asserted to him, <hi>That if Iesus Christ
were again upon earth, lyable to death, as he was, and any one should reveal to
him as his Confessour, that he had a design to kill him; before he would reveal that
Confession, he would suffer Christ to be murther'd.</hi> In the same manner, we
may as well believe, that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> and his trayterous Brood, bred up
in the same blasphemous principles, so positive in the denyal and evading
such apparent Truths, and so notoriously prov'd in so many publick Courts of
National Judicature, would deny the very being and coming into the world
of that eternal Deity whose Name and Order they profess, were it for their
disadvantage to allow it.</p>
               <p>The Vindicator's conceit of his strength, and his fond belief that men of
reason will believe his Contradictions, because he asserts 'em, and confirms
'em by the attestations of men involv'd in the same guilt, does but help to
ruine his Papal <hi>Chimera;</hi> and those swarms of Clamours, Contumelies and
Calumnies, which he calls <hi>Lyes, Contradictions</hi> and <hi>Perjuries,</hi> will in the
end sting his Vindication to death. For Vindicators losing their end, like
bad Surgeons, by their ill-applied Plaisters, rather inflame and fester, then
asswage and heal. And indeed I might well enough conclude, as having
shewn the Reader, plainly enough, the proportion of this <hi>Hercules,</hi> by what
his puny Arguments have hitherto been; but we are forc'd to <hi>follow him step
by step,</hi> as he does the Narrative, and to humour the Fool in his folly, to
prevent the Coxcombs crowing upon his own Dunghil of St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe then how this Infidel of Truth proceeds.</p>
               <p>He denies that <hi>Strange, and Nine other Iesuits wrote a Letter to Ashby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
they had an intent to stab the King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64376:14"/>
1. Because <hi>Strange</hi> avers it <hi>to be false</hi> in Attestation <hi>G.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Because <hi>Nine Iesuits never subscribed with their Provincial.</hi> You must
have it over and over again. I tell ye, the Customs of Jesuits in Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Colledges are different things. Besides, the Doctor himself has
sworn, that he both saw and read the Letter, which is much more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
then your Attestation <hi>C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for your observation upon the Text; for I find you are at a loss
how to remove this Block out of your way. You say <hi>to hear</hi> the Dr. <hi>speak,</hi>
a man would think nothing more ordinary in Jesuits Letters, then to <hi>write of
poysoning, shooting, stabbing and dispatching Kings.</hi> Nothing more frequent
in their Sermons and Writings, and therefore not so much to be wondered
at in their Letters. But you <hi>hear,</hi> that <hi>several of their Letters were perused,
and no such thing found in them.</hi> You heard with your harvest ears. For
though you so easily believe your own Brethren, we are not bound to believe
you.</p>
               <p>He denies <hi>That the same Fathers wrote other Letters to</hi> de la Chaize, <hi>with
thanks for his charity, and care of propagating the Catholick Religion; and that
the Deponent carried it to St.</hi> Omers, <hi>and thence to</hi> Paris. And his Reason is,
because <hi>the</hi> Deponents <hi>whole journey from St.</hi> Omers <hi>to</hi> Paris <hi>was a Lye.</hi> As
if any man would be such a Fool to tell a Lye which all the World could
convince him of. The Vindicator's neater way, would have been to have
denied there were any such Towns in the World as St. <hi>Omers</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> and
then he had hit it.</p>
               <p>He denies <hi>That</hi> Ashby <hi>shew'd the Deponent, at his return from</hi> Paris, <hi>a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to</hi> Strange <hi>and others in</hi> London, <hi>shewing, that they had stirred up the</hi>
Scots <hi>to Rebellion, and that Twenty thousand would be in Arms, if</hi> France <hi>broke
with</hi> England.</p>
               <p>He denies <hi>that a way was made for the</hi> French <hi>to Land in</hi> Ireland, <hi>that the</hi>
Irish Catholicks <hi>were to rise, or that Forty thousand Black Bills were ready for
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because <hi>the Deponent never return'd from</hi> Paris, <hi>as having never beeen
there;</hi> which is verified by Attestation <hi>D.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Because <hi>such a Letter was never written,</hi> by the averment of Attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>G.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Because <hi>no English Iesuit ever dealt with</hi> Scotch Presbyterians.</p>
               <p>4. Because <hi>they never dealt with</hi> Irish Papists <hi>disposed to Rebel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Because <hi>there were no Black Bills prepar'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Because <hi>there was no way made for</hi> French <hi>landing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How is this prov'd? Because here are no less then Six <hi>Becauses.</hi> And Six
<hi>Becauses,</hi> with an Attestation <hi>D.</hi> and an Attestation <hi>G.</hi> make an Argument
sufficient to confound all the Reason in <hi>Europe,</hi> were there Ten times more
then there is.</p>
               <p>He denies <hi>that by Letters of the 18th of</hi> December <hi>it was specified that</hi>
White <hi>was made Provincial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because he was not declar'd so, till the 14th of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1678. This is an
evasion. He might not be declar'd till the 14th of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and yet notice
given of his Election before, without any violence done to Madam <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He denies <hi>that</hi> White <hi>ordered a Sermon against</hi> Otes <hi>in the Sodality Church.</hi>
Why? <hi>Because he had no power before he was declar'd.</hi> But what if he took
upon him a little more then he needed? they durst not contradict him. And
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64376:14"/>
for the Rectors, they have no such power as he talks of by the publick Rules
of the Order.</p>
               <p>And he denies there was any thing mention'd of <hi>Oaths;</hi> because <hi>Coniers</hi>
protests to the contrary, and the <hi>Copy</hi> shews it; as if they that Copy, could
not leave out what they please.</p>
               <p>He denies <hi>Coniers</hi> was ordered to exhort <hi>all to stand by their new Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,</hi>
because it was never practised, and then telling us the <hi>Sodalitie</hi> Church
was not a <hi>convenient place for such a Sermon,</hi> concludes the Deponent to be
<hi>no such Confident of the Iesuits as he pretends.</hi> 'Tis not to be question'd but
that they wish he had not been. But it seems he was more their Confident
then the Vindicator. For he goes only the old Pack-horse-rode; the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
was acquainted with all their new methods, which the conjuncture of
new affairs requir'd. Your great men, Friend Vindicator, were moving out
of their Sphear, and therefore no wonder if they acted eccentrically.</p>
               <p>And this answer may serve for your fopperies and strain'd Evasions of the
13<hi>th.</hi> Article. Only take notice that Evasions are as bad as lies at any time;
for they do not only include a lye, but endeavour to cloak the lye which
the Evader labours to smother.</p>
               <p>He denies that <hi>Blundel</hi> was made Ordinary of <hi>Newgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seems the word <hi>Ordinary</hi> offends his Worship. Let him choose what
title he pleases, 'twas an employment of the same nature, which for once
he confesses, yet calls it a lye. For he hopes <hi>if the Provincial did employ any
one in works of charity, order'd him to visit prisoners, to relieve or prepare them
for a good end,</hi> he was not to be blam'd for it. Very true, but he was to
blame to send his agents upon Messages forbidden by the Law, only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
the Consciences of men in misery, and out of a covetous interest, to
prevent the slipping of any grise by their Mill.</p>
               <p>He denies it was done by <hi>Patent;</hi> call it what you please, Patent or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or Commission, it seems it was done; and that's sufficient.</p>
               <p>He denies that the said <hi>Blundell</hi> ever <hi>instructed</hi> any <hi>Youth in London,</hi> or
<hi>taught them Treasonable Doctrine.</hi> Upon what ground? because <hi>'tis false and
improbable.</hi> How then came the Act of the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> to call 'em
<hi>Seducers and Corrupters of Youth?</hi> To evade which common practice of theirs,
he says the <hi>Iesuits might be beg'd for fools, to teach such Doctrine;</hi> he means
rank downright Treason, for then they may be hang'd like Knaves for their
Labours. But for all his tricks, and shifts, and doubtings, let me tell this
Pumpkin of a Vindicator, that the seed and the fruit are very different in
shape, and yet the seed sends forth the fruit.</p>
               <p>From this discourse of so many Letters, he takes an occasion to aim full at
the Deponents face, and thinks to give him a mauling rub: <hi>You seem</hi> (saith
he) <hi>quite through your Fabulous Narrative to represent St.</hi> Omers <hi>as the center
of Iesuits Transactions, when they that know. St</hi> Omers, <hi>know 'tis the worst
serv'd with Letters, of any considerable Town in the Low-Countries.</hi> Well <hi>Gaffer
Fabulous,</hi> what would you infer from all this? You infer more than you can
answer from what the Deponent has sworn; but not believing that enough,
you would be <hi>inferring</hi> to the same purpose from what he never said. He
does not accuse St. <hi>Omers</hi> for being the <hi>center</hi> of all the Jesuits Transactions,
nor the Center of the World, nor the Center of <hi>Europe,</hi> or any Center. But
indeed since you put us in mind of it, it seems to have been the Nursery of
the Conspiracy. But what's the meaning of this impertinet Insinuation?
To prove that there were no Treasonable Letters sent to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> because
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64376:15"/>
they are so ill serv'd by the Post. Silly Mortals! what need had they of the
Post, who had such a trusty Messenger as the Deponent.</p>
               <p>He denies that upon receipt of the above-mentioned Letters, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
words were spoken by <hi>Nevil</hi> and <hi>Fermor</hi> in the <hi>Iesuits</hi> Library at
St. <hi>Omers,</hi> or that the Deponent heard them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For, saith he,</hi> the words were never spoken when the Letters were receiv'd,
because there were no such Letters.</p>
               <p>This, with the <hi>Vindicators</hi> leave, I take to be direct Nonsense, <hi>When the
Letters were receiv'd, there were no such Letters.</hi> But let it be what it will, he
has three Attestations, <hi>E. K. Q.</hi> to make it out. And lest they should fail,
he puts his hand in his Pouch, &amp; pulls out a Contradiction. Here I had thought
to have produced the definition of a contradiction. But because this is only a
contradiction of the Vindicators own framing, I shall defer that trouble till a
better opportunity. He says, the Letters must be written upon <hi>Ian.</hi> 1, 2, but
takes the longest time, and then <hi>appeals to the Post-master, whether a Letter
could come in 24 hours from</hi> England <hi>to St.</hi> Omers. I know not what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
there was that the Letters should be written upon the first of <hi>Ianuary.</hi>
The Deponent swears no such thing; but he swears he heard the words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon the third of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and tells ye where; 'tis no matter when the
Letters were written. And now <hi>what think you, Sir? are not these pretty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
to trouble the world with? You might have very well spar'd your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
and your Appeal, unless they had been more to the purpose.</p>
               <p>But he says the <hi>Deponent went on the third of Ianuary in the morning to
Watten,</hi> and <hi>dined there, as appears by the Day-book of the Seminary,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be at St. <hi>Omers</hi> that Afternoon. A worthy Record indeed!
and much for the Honour of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> when they're at such a pinch to bring
their waste-paper in Evidence! What low and ridiculous thoughts has this
Vindicator of mankind, to think that sense and reason would suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be sway'd by the Day-book of the Seminary of St. <hi>Omers?</hi> Had the
dispute been for no more than half an hours absence, they would have
brought the record of the Seminary Day-book to prove the Deponent was
gone to the <hi>House-of-Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the 21, 22, 23, and 24 Articles, he says so very little, that it is just
nothing; so that we are to believe he grants them for truth. And if they be
true why not all the rest? Nay since he has given us an Inch, we'l take an
Ell, and tell the Vindicator to his Teeth they are all true, for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
because they are confirm'd by that <hi>worthless</hi> Oath of the Doctor (as he
most Jesuitically calls it) which his railing and reviling language has only
barkt at, no where been able to penetrate.</p>
               <p>It is a sentence of the Wise, <hi>Calumnia semper opprimit meliora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on the other side we have this to relieve us: <hi>Iustos mores mala non at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingit
Oratio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so let us go seek out our Vindicator again. As good fortune will have
it, see where he comes, all-to-be-new-recruited with the zealous inspirations
of Brandy and Satan, to gratifie his Papistical, blind, and superstitious fury.</p>
               <p>He denies, <hi>That</hi> White <hi>and other Iesuits writ a Letter on the tenth of</hi>
March, <hi>declaring that the Clergy were a sort of Rascally fellows, that had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wit nor courage to manage such a great design,</hi> meaning the Plot.</p>
               <p>Here, <hi>saith he,</hi> the Deponent throws an apple of discord to sow dissention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Clergy and the Society.</p>
               <p>To pass by his polite Metaphor, which shews him to be either a great
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64376:15"/>
Dunce, or a meer <hi>Novitiate,</hi> I would fain know <hi>cui bono?</hi> What should move
the Deponent to do a thing already done to his hands? 'Tis well known
what opinion the rest of the Clergy have of the unlimited pride of
the Jesuits in general, and their haughty advancement of themselves above
their brethren; so that it was not the Deponents work either to unite or set
them together by the ears; for any man with half an eye may see the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
intention, which was only to introduce their contemptible reflections
upon the Clergy, as a circumstance to prove how curious they were in their
Trayterous Instruments. But this is only a surmise of the Vindicators, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for fear it should not turn to account, he brings his two never failing
friends to nick it, that is, his own Averment and Attestation <hi>E.</hi> Very proper <hi>Don
Quixot's,</hi> and <hi>Sancta Pancha's</hi> to encounter the Wind-mills of his own erecting.</p>
               <p>He denies, <hi>That the Deponent saw a Letter from</hi> White, <hi>mentioning that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
had been made to assassinate the King at several times,</hi> by <hi>William</hi> and
<hi>Pickering,</hi> had <hi>opportunity offer'd it self.</hi> For missing whereeof, he denies also,
<hi>that</hi> William <hi>was chid, and the latter had twenty strokes with a discipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His reason is, because he says, <hi>that no body ever heard of it but by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents
Narrative.</hi> And then he desires the Deponent to give a reason why
<hi>White</hi> should only chide <hi>William</hi> that was his Man, and whip <hi>Pickering,</hi> over
whom he had no jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>By the way <hi>William,</hi> was not <hi>Whites</hi> man, but a servant to the whole Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>London,</hi> and so was <hi>Pickering,</hi> being under their Hire, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
both equally under the Jurisdiction of <hi>White</hi> their Provincial Now
I appeal to common sense, and the judgment of those who have read or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the extent of Papistical authority in Penances, whether these lame
and miserable shifts be excuses sufficient to vindicate the Conspirators from
the intended Assassination of a Monarch? One would think that Mistris
<hi>Cellier</hi> had been Midwife to the Vindicators Invention, his Vindication is so
like the <hi>Fables</hi> in her <hi>Malice defeated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He denies, <hi>That there were any Letters from</hi> White <hi>and others of the fifth of</hi>
April, <hi>that</hi> Morgan <hi>and</hi> Lovel <hi>were return'd from</hi> Ireland; <hi>who said,</hi> 40000
Irish <hi>Horse and Foot were ready to rise at ten days warning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denies also,</hi> That the Provincial summon'd a General Consult to be held
at <hi>London,</hi> and that the Deponent was summon'd to assist at it as a Messenger
from Father to Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now what's his proof that all this was not so? Why because he says,</hi>
there is not one word of truth in all the Article, except the calling of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
<hi>And then</hi> for the 40000 men, they were never any where but in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents
Addlehead, and Lying Narrative.</p>
               <p>Here's a Vindicator for ye now! tell me where ever was such another in the
world! One that carries Gunpowder in his mouth, sets fire to his tongue, and
with one <hi>puff</hi> of a <hi>denial</hi> blows ye an accusation, be it as ponderous as all <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henge,</hi>
into a perfect annihilation. Caitiffs of <hi>Newgate,</hi> be of good comfort, from
henceforth defie Justice and the Gallows, bid the men of St. <hi>Pulchers</hi> melt down
their useless humming Passing-Bell, and put the money in their Pockets. For
now let your crimes be what they will, never so plainly prov'd by Oaths and
Testimony, 'tis but saying the Deponents are <hi>Addle-heads,</hi> and their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<hi>Lying Narratives,</hi> and you shall be forthwith set at liberty without fees.</p>
               <p>This wonder-working <hi>Operator</hi> lives at the Seminary of <hi>English</hi> Jesuits

               <p>THE Business of the Congregation takes up a whole Chapter; 'twas
an ugly Business, my Lord, and begat a world of hanging-evidence,

No, they are not, there are some of 'em hang'd. But what need of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement?
we question not the readiness of them that are living, and of
hundreds more in the place of them that are wanting, to swear all that, and
ten times more, upon such an unavoidable occasion as this. There is nothing
safe either in this or the two other worlds from the denials of the Jesuits. They
deny there is a God by their actions and Doctrine; and should ye affirm there
is a Devil, because he is the father of Lyes, they would deny that easily, as
being the fathers of Lyes themselves. Upon Earth you see what the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
has deny'd already, and you shall see what he still denies. He denies that
upon the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April 1678, stil, nov. Warren,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Preston, Marsh, Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</hi>
Sir <hi>Iohn Warner,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Brett, Pool, Nevil,</hi> in all with the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
about nine, went from St. <hi>Omers</hi> towards <hi>London.</hi> For, 1. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Liege</hi> was not of the number. 2. Sir <hi>Tho. Preston</hi> never stir'd all
the while from <hi>Liege.</hi> 3. Sir <hi>Iohn Warren</hi> remain'd at <hi>Watten.</hi> 4. Sir <hi>Robert
Brett, Pool, Nevil,</hi> and the Deponent remain'd at St. <hi>Omers.</hi> And to prove
this, he bids you see Attestations, <hi>I, H, F, D,</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> 'Tis very well,—
briskly done,—well go on—</p>
               <p>He denies, <hi>That these met in a consult in</hi> London <hi>with</hi> Fenwick, Blondel
<hi>and</hi> Gray, <hi>and others, to the number of fifty Iesuits, at the</hi> White-horse-<hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
in the</hi> Strand.</p>
               <p>For why? neither <hi>Fenwick, Blundel,</hi> nor <hi>Gray</hi> were there. 2. <hi>There were
only fifty.</hi> 3. They never met at the <hi>White-horse</hi>-Tavern, <hi>as they are ready to
swear, and protested to the</hi> Vindicator, <hi>they did not know of any such Tavern in
the</hi> Strand, <hi>till the</hi> Deponent <hi>inform'd them of it.</hi> It may be not, because he
was to give them notice of the Place. He should have done well to have told
us where they did meet; and then the truth might have been easily found
out. The Deponent swears <hi>he was at the Consult held in</hi> May, <hi>to attend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulters,
and deliver'd their concerns from company to company.</hi> To this the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi>
says nothing but what was said by the Jesuits at their Trials, where
their Defences made 'em ridiculous.</p>
               <p>He denies, <hi>That after they left the</hi> White-horse-<hi>Tavern, they divided into
several Companies, as being against the nature of a Congregation.</hi>

               <p>You still forget, Mr. <hi>Vindicator,</hi> that this was no <hi>Congregation</hi> according to
the Statutes of the Society, but such a Consultation as <hi>Catiline</hi> held at <hi>Rome</hi> for
the subversion of his Country. And it is the nature of such Consults to be kept
on foot by private Committees, for the better carrying on the design.</p>
               <p>Lastly, whereas the <hi>Deponent</hi> swears, <hi>That within 3 or 4 days after, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to St.</hi> Omers <hi>with the Fathers that came from the other side of the Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He absolutely denies there was any such thing. And these are the Lyes
which he pretends to be sworn to in the Narrative in reference to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
at the <hi>White-horse</hi>-Tavern.</p>
               <p>And now Mr. Vindicator, give me leave to tell ye, you may be Canoniz'd
for a Fool, but never for a Saint; for you have spoil'd your Cause in this

very Chapter. I expected that here you should have shewn all your Wit
and Rhetorick, the cream of your Eloquence, that you should have strew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole Chapter with your Flowers, your Metaphors, and your Sorites;
that you would have gor'd us with your forked <hi>Dilemma's;</hi> that you would
have displayed all your Hocus Pocus tricks, all your doublings and shiftings;
that you would have shewed us your Wards and Traverses, and all your
Fencing dexterity; but never was Tiptoe-expectation so deceiv'd: here is
not so much as one gentile piece of Sophistry; nay, he must be a good Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
that can extract so much as one poor dram of common sense out of all
his elaborate undertaking, but <hi>you lye,</hi> and <hi>'tis false:</hi> terms of Art which I
find in no sort of Logick, but that of St. <hi>Omers.</hi> He that pretends to such
good Intelligence, could not choose but know, how these very objections
had been canvassed, how the defences of his Martyrs were exploded, how
the testimonies of his St. <hi>Omers</hi> striplings, sent of Fools errands, to swear in
<hi>verba Magistri,</hi> were baffl'd; and therefore in his topping Vindication to
raise nothing new, but to say less then they then said for themselves, less
then what had already been promulgated by others, was but only a lazy
Epitome of the <hi>Compendium,</hi> and shewed the Vindicators Brains were dryer

but a putrid matter, which might have been as well blown out of his Nose,

               <p>Says he, the Deponent swears that <hi>Tho. White</hi> came to St. <hi>Omers</hi> upon the
Tenth of <hi>Iune</hi> 1678, and on the Eleventh spoke treasonable words against
the King and Duke in the presence of <hi>Richard Ashby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further, <hi>That</hi> White <hi>told</hi> Ashby, <hi>a Minister had endeavour'd to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Iesuits odious, by Englishing their</hi> Morals, and the Provincial <hi>sent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
into</hi> England <hi>to kill the</hi> Translator, <hi>which the Deponent undertakes to
do, having 50 l. reward promised him by the said Provincial, and then that the</hi>
Provincial <hi>and the</hi> Society <hi>in</hi> London <hi>would procure the death of</hi> Dr. Stilling-fleet.
What says the Vindicator to all this? Why, he says the Deponent
Lyes; and the White's <hi>dying Speech, and his Attestation before his death, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
that the Depositions are false.</hi> He forgot to quote the Martyrs Kinsman,
Mr. <hi>Iennison</hi>'s Attestations too, and then like <hi>Iael,</hi> he had Nail'd the Drs.
Depositions to the Ground.</p>
               <p>The Deponent swears, <hi>That</hi> Ashby <hi>told him that the Rector of</hi> Leige, <hi>when
he was</hi> Procurator <hi>at</hi> Paris, <hi>did reconcile the</hi> Lord Chancellor Hyde <hi>upon his
death-bed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Vindicator says is false; <hi>For the Rector of</hi> Liege <hi>has declar'd the
contrary, and that he never saw the</hi> Lord Chancellor <hi>in his life.</hi> Then it seems
it was <hi>Ashby</hi> the Jesuit that ly'd, and not the Doctor.</p>
               <p>He denies <hi>That on the 23d of</hi> June <hi>the Deponent was sent for</hi> England <hi>to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the motions of the Fathers in</hi> London, <hi>with 4 l. for his charge, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of 80 l. for his services in</hi> Spain <hi>and elsewhere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things the Vindicator denies stifly, as being circumstances of great
moment; Nay, if you'l let him hold stakes himself, he'l lay ye a wager of a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64376:17"/>
Hundred to One upon his own side. And the reason of this confidence is
this, that there is a Papistical necessity i'the case, that the thing must be so.
In the foregoing Fourth Chapter there was a necessity that the Deponent
should be under Lock and Key at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> from the 10th of <hi>December stilo
novo,</hi> till the 23d of <hi>Iune;</hi> and therefore they swear, and attest, and damn
themselves it was so. Now it is not convenient for the Deponent to be at St.
<hi>Omers;</hi> now they swear he was never admitted, and only a while there upon
ance.</p>
               <p>He would infer, the Deponent could not be sent the 23d of <hi>Iune to attend
the motions of the Fathers,</hi> because, he says, <hi>he was ordered</hi> Ten days before
<hi>to go for</hi> England <hi>to kill the Translator of the</hi> Jesuits Morals. As if a man might
not be sent into <hi>England</hi> upon Two Errands; or that the Fathers would have
been so rigid to have check'd the Deponent for non-attendance, when they
knew how well he was employing his time. <hi>The killing of the Translator of the
Morals, and the attending the motion of the Fathers,</hi> were no such distinct em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
but that they might be both conferr'd upon the Deponent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Neither is there any such desperate flaw in the depositions, but a very
great probability that the Deponent might be promised 50 <hi>l.</hi> for the Murder,
and 80 <hi>l.</hi> for his services in <hi>Spain.</hi> But here the Vindicator has ye again, and
denies the Deponent ever did any services to the Jesuits in <hi>Spain,</hi> unless it
were in <hi>exercising their patience by his unsufferable manners.</hi> What those were,
the Lord knows, for he gives us no account of them. And yet if the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
could have spar'd us any Instances, we cannot believe but he would have
been very ample in his Relations. We cannot imagine this concealment of an
Enemy so outrageously imbitter'd, <hi>Orco implacabilior,</hi> as the effect of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
And therefore for want of other Argument, he is dropt into such a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical
story of a Roasted Horse, much like the Tale of St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Wife of
Snow, that you would think him sitting in some old Chimney-Corner, canopied
with a Bacon-flitch, and lulling the credulous ears of the old woman of the
House for the benevolence of a Rasher. Never did the Island of Dreams pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a more empty piece of vanity; by means whereof, this <hi>Nug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>poly-loquides</hi>
would endeavour to prove that the Deponent was never admitted, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
rejected, and did what he did out of revenge.</p>
               <p>He says, That when that <hi>good man, White,</hi> as he calls him, but as we with an
<hi>alias</hi> character him, that Traytorly Jesuit, was made <hi>Provincial,</hi> then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
made his Addresses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let him say what he pleases, they have confessed the Dr. to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the Colledge a Month before they will allow <hi>White</hi> for <hi>Provincial;</hi>
and one of their attestations confirm it: They swear and vow he stay'd there
above half a year afterwards, and stirr'd not out but twice all that while. No
sign of his being so extreamly notorious for his bad life and conversation. And
yet when this bears too hard upon the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> here must be a Fable form'd,
how his admission was deny'd above a month after he was admitted, and how
he was dismissed, and yet kept close in the House. The Vindicator should have
told us the date of his dismission, and for what particular crime; but that he
carefully conceals. Where are his Attestations <hi>A. B. C.</hi> and I know not what
flim-flams for that? But he was admitted and not admitted, dismissed and kept;
and then he swore, <hi>he would be reveng'd.</hi> A very probable Tale, that he should
be so plain with such a sort of people, when fast in their clutches, whose ways
of preventing his fury, he so well understood. And then he said, <hi>he must be a
Iesuit or a Iudas; if he were not a Iesuit he should be damn'd.</hi> Truly 'twas ill
done of the <hi>Provincial,</hi> not to use his charitable endeavours to prevent a
young man from Two such dangerous precipices.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64376:17"/>
But that the Reader may be no longer in the dark, we'l tell him when the
Doctor was dismiss'd; He was dismiss'd when upon some glimmering of the
Discovery, that <hi>Good Man</hi> the <hi>Provincial</hi> struck him with his Cane, and gave
him a Box o'th' Ear in his Chamber at <hi>London.</hi> A very rude way of dismission
indeed, and a very <hi>great affront,</hi> as the Vindicator call'd it. So that we agree
about the manner, but not as to the Time. After that, the Doctor dismissed
himself, by running down Stairs out of the Provincials Lodgings, having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard what a severe chastisement they were preparing for him, if they
could but Trapan him again to St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly, if the rest of the Jesuites of St. <hi>Omers</hi> were no better then those that
were Hang'd, or the Vindicator, hardly worth that, I see no prevailing reason
any man had to be so greedily covetous of their Society. Nor do I believe
the Doctor cared a Straw for their Company, but only for the advantage of
watching their contrivances, and disclosing the Conspiracies they were then
brewing for the destruction of his Prince and Country.</p>

               <p>THe Narrative declares, <hi>That in Iuly</hi> Ashby <hi>came to Town to dispose of
the</hi> 10000 l. <hi>procured by</hi> La Chaise, <hi>and that he should Treat with Sir</hi>
Geo. Wakeman <hi>to Poyson the King, as also to procure the Assassination of
the Bishop of</hi> Hereford. To this the Vindicator replies, <hi>That</hi> Ashby <hi>before his
Death declared all this to be false, as the Iesuits of St.</hi> Omers <hi>themselves attest.</hi>
And all this he clinches too with a <hi>How is it probable, that had there been any
such thing,</hi> Ashby <hi>should communicate it to one who had by him been so disgracefully
dismist by the Provincials Order,</hi> &amp;c. This is another Dismission which we
never heard of before; so that he may sheath his <hi>How is it probable</hi> again, as
being a very blunt piece of business.</p>
               <p>The 34 Article, the Vindicator sayes, <hi>Is all false, and that there is not one
word of Truth in it,</hi> upon the credit of Attestation <hi>G.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the 35 he says, Ashby <hi>and</hi> Blundel <hi>both protested it was false.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the 36 he sayes the same upon <hi>Ashbys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Thus you see what an Esteem one Traytor has for another, and how wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they credit each other. Like the Story of the Caldron and the Cabbage.
As if the Vindicator and the rest of his Bloody Gang, had made a Compact
together, to this purpose, Do you make a Vindication, Deny, Lye, Defie,
Decry, and what ever you assert, we'l all Swear to.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, that you are to Believe what they attest, I prove thus.</p>
               <p>The Legend of St. <hi>Germain</hi> says, That that Saint rais'd up a dead Ass to
life again. The Legend of that Saint is to be believ'd, <hi>Ergo,</hi> You must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Vindicator and his Attestators.</p>
               <p>In the 38 Article the Doctor deposes, <hi>That</hi> White <hi>wrote to</hi> London <hi>to</hi>
Fenwick, <hi>that he had ordered twelve Iesuits to go for</hi> Holland, <hi>to inform the</hi>
Dutch, <hi>that the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>intended to make himself King, but they got

This the Vindicator sayes, with more then ordinary Choller, is a Lye
malitious and ridiculous; malitious, in charging such an odious business upon
the Jesuits. Not so malitious neither, History has charg'd the Jesuites with
far greater Crimes committed in <hi>Holland</hi> then this. No less then the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the same as fairly intended <hi>Maurice Nassau,</hi>
both perpetrated by persons instigated, encourag'd, embolden'd, hired, paid
and Missionated by the Provincial and Rector of <hi>Doway,</hi> and other Jesuites,
as <hi>Thuanus,</hi> whom the Vindicator, if he dares, may deny for a good Testimony,
more at large relates.</p>
               <p>A Ridiculous, in supposing that the <hi>English</hi> Jesuites have either credit or
acquaintance with the States of <hi>Holland.</hi> The Fool will turn Changling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the end of his Vindication. As if we thought the Jesuites had no more
wit than to appear in <hi>Holland</hi> in all their formalities. No, no, they have their
shapes and their disguises, and if they want credit or acquaintance, they
want neither Money nor Insinuation to procure both, unless they be all such
Dunces as the Vindicator. He I confess is no great man of Language, he'l
tell ye ye Lie, and 'tis False,—And fearing that neither his <hi>Malitious,</hi> nor
his <hi>Ridiculous</hi> would serve his turn, in his own natural Delivery, he affirms,
<hi>The Iesuites never had any such design, and that no Iesuit or Iesuits were sent about
it.</hi> All which we find him endeavouring to prove thus, for it is sometimes
requisite to let you see the quint Essence of his Arguments.</p>
               <p>Six Jesuites could not be spared out of the Seminary of St. <hi>Omers</hi> upon
such a Design.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi> Not Twelve out of the whole Province.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again.</hi> They that stopt at <hi>Watten,</hi> could not be sent to <hi>Holland;</hi> for
had they been sent, they had gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi> They were not sent, because they did not go.</p>
               <p>To the 39 Article he answers, That <hi>Blundel</hi> protested he never heard of
any such Letter, and so refers ye to Attestation <hi>E.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 41 Article the Doctor deposes, That <hi>Fenwick</hi> told him that the
Jesuits had 60000 l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> and 100000 l. <hi>in Bank,</hi> and that he lent out
money at 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> This he denies, and wonders how it should be true.
But it is a Proverh fix'd upon the Jesuits,
<q>Quod Vultur est Milvo, id Iesuita est Monacho.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that it is no wonder that the most Covetous, Proling, Scraping, Racking,
Cozening, Cheating, purloyning Order in the World, should have 60000 l.
<hi>per Annum,</hi> and a hundred Thousand pound in <hi>Banck.</hi> The Vindicator little
understood what belongs to sums beyond his own Seminary Exhibition; and
<hi>Fenwick</hi> was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>illy Jesuit-Broaker. There be those who have better calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the Jesuits Incomes, that could have informed the Vindicator that
their Revenues above 20 years ago, amounted to two Millions of Crowns in
Gold yearly, which is above 500000 l, <hi>per Annum,</hi> a sum far greater then what
the Vindicator admires at. And there is no question to be made, but that
they who were contriving the ruin of Princes and whole Nations, had some
of their bulky Banck disposed of near the Scene of their Expences requisite
for such a design. And for the Jesuits Consciences, we leave them to their
Brethren the Jews to take measure of them by their own.</p>
               <p>The 42 Article deposes, that <hi>Harcourt, Fennick, Keynes,</hi> and another of
the Society, <hi>declar'd their intentions to raise a commotion in the Kingdom of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:64376:18"/>
and Dominion of <hi>Wales, which appear'd also by several Letters shewed the
Deponent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Vindicator calls a <hi>Lye without any signe of Truth, and would
have any one of these Letters produced.</hi> What would it have signified? For
the Vindicator would have brought somebody to protest there were no such
Letters written, Produce their Letters, and either they make their Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
Comments upon them, or else deny their own hands, which has not
sav'd their Necks for all that. That's such a Flim Flam Story, for a Sancha
Pancha of a Vindicator, to bid us produce Letters, when he himself has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to venture his Soul, and all the pains of Hell and Purgatory to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
what ever can be produc'd, which bare denials and attestations out of
the Clouds, and that with such a daring and audacious Impudence, as if Truth
were only confin'd to that foul skulking hole of Iniquity and Treason at St.
<hi>Omers.</hi> And then with a plausible Insinuation, They that all our modern Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
have Character'd for the grand Incendaries of the World, They that
are Chronicl'd for their Murders and Massacres, and their inflaming all the
Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> and disturbing the repose of Church and State over all
Christendom. They shall come to a pitiful, idle, nonsensical Vindicator,
and bid him cry to the Deponent for deposing the Truth, and detecting their
hateful Conspiracies, <hi>What a Commotion you have rais'd in England, all the
World may see.</hi> Yes, and all the World (no question) by the vanity of this
Vindicators attempt, by the sordidness of his Defence, do plainly see who
were the Original cause of all this Commotion; not the Deponent; for the
Enterprize, had it not been Truth, would have sunk such a mean and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<hi>Slanderer</hi> as he. But those aspiring, topping Sons of Perdition, whose
wicked Principles oblige them to lay, (if they can bring it to pass) all the
Princes and States of <hi>Europe</hi> at the feet of a Leud and Prophane Antichrist.</p>
               <p>To the 43 Article, <hi>That no Messengers were sent by the Names of</hi> Moor <hi>and</hi>
Sanders, <hi>with instructions to carry themselves like Nonconformist</hi> Scots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He says little, but seems to be in an Extasie, and wonders whom the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
means, for he never could hear of any Jesuit of those Names. A very
likely thing indeed, that never any <hi>English</hi> Jesuit (at any time) bore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Names of <hi>Moor, Sanders,</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> so vulgar almost in every Society of
Ten. But what needs all this Amazement? No body says they were Jesuits,
nor sent as Jesuits, but as Messengers or Emissaries, any thing but Jesuits.
And thus you see what is the main thing impos'd upon the Vindicator to do;
he is to deny right or wrong; at which his fidelity is so nimble, that rather
then not deny, he will deny what was never averr'd. You shall see, when he
finds that his Vindication has done more harm than good, He will deny there
was ever any such thing written, or ever seen in the World.</p>
               <p>To the 44. <hi>That the Iesuites communicate the secret Counsels of the King, which
they purchase with their money, to</hi> La Chaise <hi>the French Kings Confessor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He sayes positively, all this is false, and to make it out, tells ye, <hi>There was
no need of purchasing Intelligences while the Coffee-houses stood.</hi> He would make
us believe the Jesuits were the arrantest Ideots in Nature, as if we thought that
Coffee-house Intelligence were the purchase which they Fish'd for with their
Silver-hooks. No, no, 'twas they themselves, who then, and still do, make
those Coffee-houses he prates of, the <hi>Nurseries of Rebellion,</hi> by their own
Emisaries, daily employ'd, to divulge their Lies and Forgeries,
<q>Et ambiguas in vulgum spargere voces,</q>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:64376:19"/>
on purpose to cast a mist before the Eyes of the people, and gather strength
to renew their disappointed Villanies: So that his Coffee-house Inference is
nothing but a meer Smoak.</p>
               <p>The 46 Article deposes, <hi>That the Letters from St.</hi> Omers <hi>expressed great
joy, that Sir</hi> G. W. <hi>had undertaken the business.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which he Replies, it is false, that ever Sir <hi>G. W.</hi> undertook the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
for why? it appears so by the publick Verdict of the Jury at his Tryal.</p>
               <p>An Argument of the Vindicators own Framing against himself; for by the
same inference it is apparent, that all that was Sworn against the rest that were
Hang'd, was true, because the Publick Verdict of the Jury found 'em Guilty.
See how these fellows glory in one Acquittal, and yet it is a thing frequently
observ'd, That many times the greatest Fellons escape, when lesser Criminals
are Condemn'd. By which the whole Nation may see of what a dangerous
consequence it is to shew the least grain of Mercy to the Unmerciful. And
yet the Argument is not so potent neither, when we consider how much
men of Reason are dissatisfied with that Acquittal, and how the Papists laugh
in their Sleeves, and sing Jubilate, not so much for the escape of the Person,
as the success of their underhand dealing.</p>
               <p>The rest of the Chapter is so Ridiculous, that I pass it over, as being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               <p>
                  <hi>ART.</hi> 55. Mr. <hi>Jennison</hi> said, That if the King did not become <hi>R. C.</hi>
he should not be long <hi>C. R.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Vindicator calls a <hi>groundless Lye;</hi> but says withal, if
any such thing were said, <hi>It was because of the Presbyterians, and not of the
Papists.</hi> So then, the Question is not so much, Whether Mr. <hi>Ienison</hi> spoke
the words, but whither he spoke them of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or the <hi>Papists?</hi> If
he spoke them of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> they were true: If of the <hi>Papists,</hi> they
were false. What an open piece of Impudence this is, to Arraign a whole
Deposition for a groundless Lye; and yet with the same Breath to confess
they might be spoke? If he has not been soundly <hi>Pickering'd</hi> already for
this mistake, he notoriously deserves it.</p>
               <p>Article 57. Fenwick <hi>told the Deponent, that he had Writ that the King was
gone to</hi> Windsor, <hi>and that honest</hi> William <hi>and the</hi> Fathers <hi>were ready to attend
the Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he says, the first part might probably be true, but the latter part is
false; as also, that <hi>Fenwick</hi> told him of the <hi>Contents of the Letter.</hi> How then
came the Deponent to know of the Information given of the Kings going to
<hi>Windsor?</hi> 'Tis plain he knew it, and he Swears <hi>Fenwick</hi> told him, and you
Mr. Vindicator must produce some other Intelligencer, or else your Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will hang o'the Hedge.</p>
               <p>Article 58. Keines <hi>Preach'd a Treasonable Sermon to Twelve persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
That Protestant Princes were</hi> ipso facto <hi>Deposed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64376:19"/>
Nothing more confirms the Truth of the thing, then the Subject of the
Sermon. But this he calls a <hi>Train to blow up any man that the Deponent should
mark out for Destruction.</hi> How common a thing it is among the Jesuits, to
<hi>lay Trains</hi> against, not only the Reputations, but the Lives of Great Men,
they themselves sufficiently know; and to requite that knowledge of theirs,
we know as well how hard a Task it is here for the Deponent to pick and
choose the Subjects of his Accusation considering before what Judges he must
appear. The Vindicator should have done well to have come into <hi>England,</hi> and
liv'd half a year or so at <hi>Newgate</hi> before he began his great work, they would
have taught him far better pleading then this: And yet he has the <hi>Effronterie</hi>
to pretend from hence great inconveniencies, <hi>if Perjury continue Paramount,
and Knaves be rewarded.</hi> Never did Mortal speak more like a Knave then
this Vindicator; for the Deposition only supposes they were men of Quality,
and yet he grounds a Perjury upon it. See how cursedly this great <hi>Atlas</hi> of
the Catholick cause crickles at the hamms. A voice I hear, but nothing do
I see, speak who thou art, that we may return thee thanks for thy Learned
Paraphrases.</p>
               <p>Article 59. Keines <hi>advis'd a Gentleman in or about</hi> Westminster, <hi>to remove
thence, least God should destroy him with the Sinners of that City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well! what doth the Vindicator say to this? why—<hi>That</hi> Keines <hi>protested
he never said any such thing; and any man that knows both, will take his word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Deponents Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I would advise <hi>Keines</hi> rather to croud among the Dominicans, under
the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> Petticoat, then come hither to try the Experiment.</p>
               <p>Article 60. Keines <hi>said it was endeavoured to dispatch 48 at</hi> Wiudsor; <hi>that</hi>
Corker <hi>and the</hi> Benedictines <hi>had promised</hi> 6000 l. <hi>that two of them own'd it, and
that their business was to remove the</hi> Stuarts <hi>out of the way: and that</hi> Coniers <hi>laid
a wager, that the King should not live to eat any more Chrismas Pies, &amp;c.</hi> This the
Vindicator calls <hi>Poetry,</hi> as being one of the Tragical Order himself. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is the matter, here's neither <hi>ye Lye,</hi> nor Attestation <hi>G:</hi> surely the man
forgot himself, or else these two great Cronies of his were tir'd and gone to
sleep. Only he throws himself upon <hi>Corkers</hi> acquittal: a very slight Bladder
to Swim with in such an intended Sea of Blood. For though <hi>Corker</hi> were
acquitted, it was for want of double Evidence which the Law required: Not
that the Court believ'd him Innocent; and therefore they gave new orders
to Detain him, which was but sour Sawce to the sweet Morsels of his acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
Truly this Article, great Man of might, requir'd a more <hi>Garagantua</hi> like
Vindication. You should have rous'd all your <hi>ye lyes,</hi> and <hi>'tis falses,</hi> and now
he lyes under Conviction and embodied all your <hi>Attestations</hi> to have given
Battle to this Article: and if you could have got all St. <hi>Malo</hi>'s Dogs to have
help'd ye, all had been little enough.</p>
               <p>Article 61. Keines <hi>took the Deponent to an Assembly of the</hi> Dominicans, <hi>where
six were met in the name of the rest, with their Provincial, to comply with the fathers
of the Society. There also met five Iesuits.</hi> Keines <hi>demanded of the</hi> Dominicans
<hi>money to carry on the business of Killing the King:</hi> The <hi>Dominicans</hi> answered,
<hi>They were poor, but would give their assistance and Counsel. Hence the Deponent
was sent with the Proposals to the</hi> Carmelites, who answered, <hi>Their prayers to
God and the Blessed Lady should not be wanting, and that was all they could give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What says the Vindicator to all this? why, since you needs must have it,
He says, <hi>All those that know the Emulations that have been, and still are, between
the</hi> Dominicans <hi>and the</hi> Jesuits, <hi>will scarce believe those would meet to comply with
these.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:64376:20"/>
Oh! Mr. Vindicator, you are ill read in History: <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> could
well agree to remove the King of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Though the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi>
jangle about the Conception of the Virgin, they may agree for all that, about
the Conception of a Plot. Nay, the Pope himself could reconcile himself to
the <hi>Turk,</hi> and call him into the bowels of <hi>Italy</hi> to help him at a dead lift. You
are a whole <hi>Dutch</hi> League too short of a Vindication yet.</p>
               <p>Art. 62. Blundel <hi>said his Workmen wanted Oyle, which the Deponent supposed
to be Sheeps Fat.</hi> Coniers <hi>said, the Hill people were fools to set upon 48 at</hi>
Windsor, <hi>but he would speak to his Worship in other Language then in</hi> Tormentillo,
<hi>but that if his Shirt on his back should know how, he would burn it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this the Vindicator denies, and sends ye to Attestation <hi>S,</hi> as the Dice
in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fortune-book send ye to the Philosopher <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> 64. That <hi>Fogarthy</hi> is a main Agent in this Hellish plot. That he told the
Deponent he was present when Sir <hi>G. W.</hi> was contracted with; and that he had
hir'd four Ruffians to mind the Kings Postures at <hi>Windsor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he says, the first is a <hi>Lye,</hi> the second is a <hi>Lye,</hi> and the third is a
<hi>Lye.</hi> Most Serene and Polite Vindicator, we greet thee Well. <hi>Cicero</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
could have said no more. From whence I argue thus.</p>
               <p>He that tells another man <hi>he Lyes</hi> three times, has the better of the
Dispute.</p>
               <p>The Vindicator tells the Deponent he Lyes three times,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Vindicator has the better of the Dispute.</p>
               <p>Now to turn the Argument,</p>
               <p>The Vindicator tells me, the Pope is not Antichrist.</p>
               <p>I tell the Vindicator he Lyes three times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Pope must be Antichrist.</p>
               <p>And so there's a <hi>Rowland</hi> for his <hi>Oliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus done with the Quintescence of his Ingenuity, we shall come
to the drossy part of his Wit, which lies in his Reflections. By which, if he
knew how, he would fain insinuate strange Chimera's into the peoples Heads,
as <hi>Bufalmacco</hi> in <hi>Boccace</hi> frighted his Master with Dor-flies, and bits of lighted
Wax-candles.</p>
               <p>And to this purpose he terrifies ye with the Inconvenience of Blank Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations.
<hi>For,</hi> says he, <hi>the Deposition concerning four Ruffians, was filled up by</hi>
Jenisons <hi>naming four Innocent persons to get a false Witnesses Reward to pay his
Debts, and supply his want of money.</hi> There's now for Mr. <hi>Ienison,</hi> I think he
had better have held his Tongue. The Vindicator finds another substantial
Evidence come in to confirm the Narrative, and therefore he must be bespaul'd
with his Jesuitical drivel. But those <hi>Innocent persons</hi> never came in to justifie
themselves, and in regard the Law of the Land supposes them guilty that fly
for it, it is not for his Pie-Powder-Court at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> to determine who are
guilty, and who are Innocent in <hi>England;</hi> or to dive into the reasons of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens Loyalty; as if none but the necessitous could be Loyal, and none
but Fugitives Innocent: Or as if the Justice of <hi>England</hi> accus'd or condemn'd
any man to please the Kings Evidence; or that the Kings Evidence were so
dear to him, that he would sacrifice his Justice to their private Interest. Brain
of a Taylor you are too sawcy.</p>
               <p>He goes on, <hi>No man can be secure in the way of a Mad-Dog, or an Impudent
lying Witness,</hi> such as your Mungrel Attestators, <hi>as long as the Clamours of the
Rabble are so loud, that neither Iustice or Reason can be heard.</hi> He's mistaken,
Reason and Justice have both in a good measure been so well satisfyed, that I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64376:20"/>
dare say, they will never appeal to St. <hi>Omers</hi> for the redress of their Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.
By the way, Gentlemen, you are to consider whom this Brain of a
Taylor calls the <hi>Rabble:</hi> none but the Lords and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> you
your selves, and the whole Body of the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Those,</hi> says he, <hi>were wisest that embraced a voluntary Exile.</hi> He is mistaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
they are no voluntary Exiles, they were Banished by the Law of the
Land, and were but intruders into the Kings Dominions. They were the Pest
of the Nation, that escaped the provision of divers wholesome Statutes, like
old cunning Vermine, <hi>Let them that stay behind, look to themselves as well as they
can.</hi> You speak like an Oracle; let 'em Fee their Counsellor, and take his
advice.</p>
               <p>Article 65. <hi>That the Deponent at</hi> Madrid, <hi>had seen the Lord Embassador, Sir</hi>
William Godolphin <hi>at Mass, and was perfectly inform'd by the Arch-Bishop of</hi>
Tuam, <hi>that the Embassador held great correspondence with the Arch-Bishop, and that
a Iesuite had read to him</hi> Philosophy <hi>and Divinity. That</hi> Suiman <hi>a Iesuite, in a
Letter to the Deponent the 30th of</hi> July <hi>Newstile, did specifie, that Sir</hi> William
<hi>was as industrious as any man could be, to answer the expectation of the Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here,</hi> says the Vindicator, <hi>are as many Lyes as Periods.</hi> For,
<list>
                     <item>1<hi>st,</hi> 'Tis False.</item>
                     <item>2<hi>ly,</hi> 'Tis False.</item>
                     <item>3<hi>ly,</hi> 'Tis False.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This puts me in mind of a Scene in <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi>'s <hi>Alchymist,</hi> where <hi>Face</hi>
and <hi>Suttle</hi> undertake to teach <hi>Kastril</hi> to Quarrel. The Jesuites I liken to <hi>Face</hi>
and <hi>Suttle,</hi> the Vindicator to <hi>Kastril. Face</hi> and <hi>Suttle</hi> teach <hi>Kastril</hi> their Art,
<hi>Kastril</hi> well instructed, takes a peek at the Doctor. Now <hi>Kastril,</hi> come—
shew your parts,—'Tis False,—ye Lye, quo he—How! Child of Wrath
and Anger, the loud Lye! why so sodain, say we. Nay, look you to that, I
am aforehand, quo <hi>Kastril.</hi> Talk to him of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> you
Lye quo <hi>Kastril;</hi> talk to him of a Letter from <hi>Suiman,</hi> you Lye cryes <hi>Kastril.</hi>
Nay, say <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Suttle,</hi> if you don't quarrel him out of the world, you do
nothing. Presently <hi>Kastril,</hi> you Deponent, if you wont get ye out of the
world, ye Lye.</p>
               <p>This is just the Vindicators chollerick method of Proceeding, the Battoons
of his Rhetorick, with which he thinks to Cudgel us out of our Senses, and
the Doctor out of his Reputation. But what said the Curtesan <hi>Thais</hi> of that
same Swash-Buckler <hi>Thraso</hi> in <hi>Terences Eunuchi?</hi>
                  <q>

                  </q>
A meer <hi>Fizzle-Sucker,</hi> that thinks to blow up Solemn Oaths and Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with the windly Eructations of Scurrility and foul Language. Language
that issues from his Mouth with a steam as putrid as the Exhalations of the
Tyrant <hi>Gelo's</hi> Breath. Language so undecent, so unbecomming any person
that pretends to so much Learning as to put Pen to Paper, that it cannot be
imagin'd that any man but of common Education, of indifferent Breeding,
or but ordinary Generosity, which abominate scurrility and rudeness in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
will harbour the least belief of such a nasty and slovenly Writer.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64376:21"/>
For as there are some certain Ragamuffins that deserve to be Kick'd out of
all Society; so there are some books to be Kick'd out of all Credit, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest, none more deservedly then this same fardel of impertinent Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fianisme.</p>
               <p>He challenges the Deponent, <hi>to produce the Letter of the 30th of Iuly from</hi>
Suiman, <hi>which he might have done, because directed to himself.</hi> What a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
would he here put upon the People? He knows that Letters of this
Nature being once read by those to whom they are directed, to their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they
are by them taken away, and laid up among their <hi>Archiva,</hi> and yet he
ors, challenges the Deponent to produce what he knows to be out of his reach.
It seems it was not so convenient for him to be now so punctual in declaring the
Customes of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> as upon other occasious, which made him omit this.
<hi>If,</hi> says he, <hi>the Arch-Bishop of</hi> Tuam, <hi>or the Iesuit, being Subjects of the King,
waited on his Majesties Embassador, they did but their Duty.</hi> They were under
no such obligation, being no Subjects of the King, in regard they deny him
that Allegiance and Supremacy which the Law of the Land requires to make
them so. King and Subject are the <hi>Termini Relativi,</hi> Duty and Protection
are the Relations between those Termes: No Duty, no Subject: no King,
no Protection. And thus it may be said, that no <hi>English</hi> Roman Catholick
is a Subject to the King. They live under his <hi>Moral</hi> Protection, as Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Forraign Traders, not under his <hi>Relative</hi> Protection, as Subjects.
But the Jesuites are so far from being no Subjects, that they are Traytors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd by the Law; and therefore for an Embassador to correspond with such,
I suppose is a Priviledge which no Prince or State in Christendom allows their
Forraign Ministers. Now you shall see how the Vindicator strives to dis-intangle
himself. He sayes, <hi>'Tis absolutely false, that their past any intimate correspondence,
chiefly in Publick concerns:</hi> That is to say, <hi>'tis absolutely false,</hi> and it is not <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
false.</hi> The <hi>Affirmative</hi> was <hi>singular,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Negative</hi> should
have been <hi>Universal.</hi> In the Name of St. <hi>Dominic,</hi> what did you mean to
meddle with that word <hi>Chiefly</hi> for? Oh, cry ye Mercy, 'twas to shew your
parts, and to let us see, that you could tell a Man <hi>he ly'd,</hi> and yet confess 'twas
true what he said, both at the same time.</p>
               <p>To the 67 Article he only gives six Lyes, sends ye to three or four of his
Paltry Attestations, and says no more. So that six being twice three, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of an Argument already drawn from his own Topicks, if we tell him he
Lies six times, the Article is true, and we are even with him.</p>
               <p>To the 69 Article, he answers, <hi>that</hi> Blundel <hi>the Traytor protested he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the business.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, says he, <hi>It seems the 22. of</hi> August <hi>was well employ'd, for though the
Deponent had neither eat nor drank, nor stopp'd all the day,</hi> He went to such a
place, and such a place, and such a place; met with such a one, and such a one,
and such a one; heard this Discourse, and that Discourse; saw these Letters
and t'other Letters, and what then? why it could not be, unless the <hi>day had
bin as long as that in which</hi> Joshua <hi>fought against the</hi> Philistines; <hi>or that himself had
been as busie as</hi> Menechmus <hi>seeking his Brother.</hi> Who says there's no Wit stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at St. <hi>Omers?</hi> Here are a brace of <hi>Similes,</hi> the one out of the <hi>Bible,</hi> the
other out of <hi>Plautus's Menaechmei;</hi> excellently well-match'd, like a black and
white Coach-Horse both at one Pole, and as much to the purpose as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of <hi>Lucians True History.</hi> However, you see by this he had read three
Books, <hi>Lucian, Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>Plautus.</hi> Now, what's the use of these two <hi>Biblio-Plautinian</hi>
Hyperboles? To prove that a man must be Perjur'd, because he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64376:21"/>
went Twelve hours without eating or drinking. What a Perjur'd fellow was
St. <hi>Marin</hi> of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mini</hi> to fast six whole days together; and <hi>Batthaeus</hi> the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
to macerate himself so long without eating or drinking, till the Worms
bred in his Teeth? What a Perjur'd Knave was St. <hi>Dominie,</hi> to dispatch as
many Penances in six days, as serv'd for a hundred years? I think he was much
more busie for the time, then the Deponent or <hi>Menaechmus</hi> either. What a
Perjur'd Villain was St. <hi>Francis</hi> to fast 40 days together in honor of St. <hi>Michael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
There's ne're a poor Souldier in a Campaigne that marches Twelve hours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sustenance, but must be Perjur'd. Not a man in the world that dispatches
more business in a day, then the Vindicator would have him, but must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.
Certainly this is some <hi>Stylite</hi> newly crept out of a hollow Pillar, that
talks so ridiculously of the affairs of the world. Mr. <hi>Asinego,</hi> if you want Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
go and Read your own Legends, the Narrative I find is above your
fathoming.</p>
               <p>Article 70. On the 24<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h</hi> of August, <hi>Blundel</hi> told the Deponent, <hi>That the
Catholicks would shorten the Kings days; and that the Protestant Religion stood on
its last Leggs.</hi> Here we have gain'd one point at length: For saith he, <hi>Had
this been produc'd at the beginning, it might have been tollerable, but to bring it where
it stands, was senceless.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it were true at the beginning, it is true where it is. Truth is confin'd to
no place, and therefore we shall take no care to remove it, if you have no better
Reason. Oh! but he has a Reason: For that after the Deponent had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Carmelites</hi> dissenting from the Business, he now says
<hi>All Catholicks.</hi> He does not say the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Carmelites</hi> dissented; he
Swears that both pleaded Poverty, but the <hi>Dominicans</hi> offer'd them their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Assistance and Money: The <hi>Carmelites</hi> promised to assist them with their
Prayers to God, and our Blessed Lady. Hoping that if God would not hear
their Prayers, our Blessed Lady would. So that Heaven's be Prais'd, this Article
as if it were the Lawrel Tree of the Narrative, stands not so much as blasted
by all his Thunder. And then

               <p>Article 72. Blundel <hi>shew'd the Deponent the Bull, by which the two Arch-Bishopprioks,
21 Bishoppricks, two Abbey's and six Deaneries are disposed of. Nor are there
any Prebendaries or other places undisposed of.</hi> To this he answers only with Periods,
Heaven's! quo he, setting him upon his Tayle, and lifting up his two Paws
like a Bear in Astonishment. Such Benefices to be bestow'd without the Kings
consent! As if it were likely his Holiness would ask the King of <hi>England</hi> leave
to dispose of the Popes Benefices. All in one Bull! That so carelesly sent! so
carelesly produc'd! Not one Protestant to be continu'd! No, if it were to
save his Soul. All the promoted Persons ignorant of their Advancement! who
can swallow such Mountains of Incredibility? Rub his nostrills with a little
Spirit of <hi>Bezoar,</hi> the man has been in a desperate Agony. What a contraction
there is upon the Vindicators Wind-Pipe on a suddain. He will make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
by and by, that his Gullet is no wider then the passage from Purgatory to
Heaven. He can swallow the <hi>Incredibility</hi> that his Holiness should ask leave
of the King to dispose of the Popes Benefices: The <hi>incredibility</hi> that any one
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64376:22"/>
Protestant should be continued in his Living; which I can hardly swallow m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and yet he cannot swallow the probability of the Popes trusting the <hi>Bull</hi>
with his own Creatures, that one <hi>Bull</hi> should pass for all, at a Conjuncture
when too many <hi>Bulls</hi> would make too much Roaring; nor the probability that
the parties concern'd and promoted knew of it; because he says, they did not.
I warrant ye, were it an Attestation <hi>G.</hi> or <hi>D.</hi> he would swallow it, though it
were as big as the Globe of the Earth, But I am inform'd by several Physitians,
that the Jesuits Stomachs have a particular Antipathy against Narrative Pills;
shew a Jesuit a Narrative Pill, and it puts him into a fit of the Quinsie imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
His <hi>Vvola</hi> will close and shut up like a Misers Buttery hatch upon

to the Fathers here, acquainting them, that 8000 Papists were ready to rise, to
assist the disaffected <hi>Scots,</hi> when required by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Iesuits there. That one

               <p>To all this Vindicator cries, <hi>Not one word True.</hi> What are his Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Because there never was any meeting of</hi> English <hi>Iesuits in</hi> Edenburgh.
2. No English <hi>Iesuits in</hi> Scotland. 3. <hi>Never</hi> Lovel. 4. <hi>Nor any Servant of

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver there. 5. No correspondence of</hi> English <hi>Iesuits in</hi> Scotland. 6. <hi>No
knowledge of Affairs of that Kingdom but by the Gazetts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He would make us believe that <hi>Scotland</hi> was one of the happiest Kingdoms
in <hi>Europe,</hi> as if the Air of that Country would no more admit of the Vermine
of Popery, then <hi>Ireland</hi> endure the Venome of Toads and Spiders. But how
does he come to know all this? Nay, that's a secret,—Some body, it may
be suppos'd, has told him, and he tells you, and his <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> you must take
for Gospel. However, suppose they were <hi>Scotch</hi> Jesuites that met at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
(for the Article says nothing of <hi>English</hi> Jesuites) what's to be said then?
Why then he'l Swear there never was a <hi>Scotch</hi> Jesuit upon the Face of the
Earth. So that the Vindicator is ready prepar'd for ye, come at him which
way ye will. Now, can any body believe this Vindicator cares what he says,
that will assert so positively, that never any <hi>English</hi> Jesuits met at <hi>Edenborough</hi>
since the Creation of the world? That the Jesuites hold no correspondence
with <hi>Scotland.</hi> That they who correspond with <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> should
forbear to correspond with <hi>Scotland,</hi> where there is such advantagious Brewing,
to the disturbance and molestation of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art. 75. Tho. White</hi> writ to <hi>Blundel,</hi> that he was inform'd of some Discovery,
yet he should not desist the business in hand. That he should thank <hi>Fogarthy</hi> for his
Care of the business of 48, meaning the King; and for his forwardness to assist those
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for whose good success he would pray.</p>
               <p>This he confutes by the strength of his Politicks: <hi>For,</hi> saith he <hi>had there
bin so horrid a Plot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Some burnt at <hi>Wild-house.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and</hi> White <hi>had heard it was discovered, he should have order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Conspirators to have desisted, secur'd their Persons, and made away their
Papers.</hi> 'Tis very true, but there are many Fool-hardy persons that are often
washed to the Skin for ventring into the Shower, believing 'twill presently
blow over. The Conspirators design was so well laid, and their Party so Strong,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64376:22"/>
thought nothing would have been heard, much less believ'd against them. And
therefore none but such shallow Pates, and of as little Sence as the Inventer of
these Suppositions, but will believe that <hi>White</hi> had all the reason in the world
to command them to go on. For it is not to be thought, that Men of such
High undertakings, and that knew upon what Foundations they Trod,
were to be Bug-Beard out at the whispring of an uncertain Report. Nay, it
behov'd them to go on with more vigour, when they knew how easily the
suddain Expedition of one single Assassination would have prevented the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of that Rumour. Had the Deponent, says the Vindicator, said that
White <hi>had desired their Prayers for the Preservation of himself, his Province,
and all the Catholicks, his Narrative might have been Believ'd.</hi> To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
so much Praying for persons, that had secur'd their persons and their
papers? But 'tis much to the same Effect; for had he gone the Vindicators
way, and accus'd <hi>White</hi> for desiring the Prayers of his fellow Traytors upon
such an accompt, he had but made a Discovery, and so he did, by taking his
own Courses, So that the Vindicator seems now to be angry at the Deponent,
not for discovering the Plot, but for not doing it that way he would have had
him. But to make him amends, if he will be pleased to come and make any
farther and real Discoveries himself, he shall have his Liberty to use his own
Method.</p>
               <p>The 77 Article, contains the Deponents Entertainment at the Provincials
Lodging.</p>
               <p>This he calls coherene Nonsence. <hi>For none,</hi> says he, <hi>who knew</hi> White <hi>in his
Vigour, will believe he could beat so stout a man as the Deponent, considering the weak
condition he was in when he came to</hi> London. What made him venture his
weak Carkass at <hi>London.</hi> It must be no ordinary occasion certainly that made
him hazard the Inconveniencies of Sea and Land in that weak condition.
This Vindicator can believe that St. <hi>Denis</hi> when he was in a weaker conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when he had his Head cut off, could run with it in his Hand above a
League, and yet now he thinks it such a Miracle for the Provincial of the
Jesuites, to give an Inferior that durst not resist him, and yet had so highly
incensed him, a blow or two of Correction with his Cane. And yet his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was not so weak neither, but that he could stand well enough at the
Bar long after that, to tell a company of flim flam Lyes and Falsities, without
the assistance of <hi>Aqua Mirabiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rest is onely a Repetition of the words of the Narrative, with some
few Comments, and a Story of his own framing, so little to the purpose, as
if he had made it his business to play the Fool. But at last he concludes, that
for all their fears of the Deponent, White <hi>kept his ordinary Lodgings, removed
no Papers, left those under his Conduct in their ordinary Stations, &amp;c.</hi> Which
alone to Posterity will be a convincing proof of his Innocency. That is to
say, <hi>White</hi> believ'd that the Deponent was a Person, whose Information
would be easily crush'd by the ponderous weight of the Popish Interest, and
so he resolv'd to go with the Plot. It was not his Innocency, but the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Zeal, and the great encouragements and probability of success
that hardned him to merited Destruction. <hi>Quos Deus vult perdere,</hi> was the
Fate that hung over his Head. His stay at his Lodgings could be no convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
proof to Posterity of his Innocency, in regard that that very act of his,
render'd him a Criminal, by which he had at that very time forfeited his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64376:23"/>
to the Law of the Land. And therefore he could not stay to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
what he had forfeited by his stay: but he had a longing desire to see
the utmost of what He had bin so long a Spinning, and was snapt in the
midst of an insensible Vexation, to see the Labour of many Months and
Years lost.</p>
               <p>As for his Chapter upon the <hi>Commissions given to the Nobility,</hi> I pass it by,
in regard the Persons themselves are yet to make their Desences; which if they
prove no better then what their officious Vindicator present us with, is a very
Ominous Prospect of their success. However to give them an Essay of his
Rhetorick, He tells them what <hi>a wise man said,</hi> a very bad beginning my
Lords, for it seems it is not your Advocate that is the <hi>Wiseman,</hi> but another
Man, and that's apparent by his thus spoiling his own Market. For the Lords
will certainly go to the Wiseman, and not to the Fool, I mean the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
But what says the Wiseman? Why, this Wiseman concluded, That
<hi>either what</hi> Homer <hi>and</hi> Ovid <hi>writ of the Lyes, and</hi> Aesop <hi>of Beasts, were no Fables
or the English Conspiracy is a Fable</hi>—Truly the Wiseman did not speak very
good sense, whoer'e he were. He meant, that <hi>if what</hi> Homer, Ovid, <hi>and</hi>
Aesop <hi>wrote, were no Fables, then the English Conspiracy was no Fable.</hi> But those
were, therefore this is—This I suppose is the Wisemans Conclusion: but
with the Wisemans leave, all the World allows there was a great deal of truth
couch'd under those Fables, and that very considerable truth two, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
and attested to be so by the Testimony of several Ages. So that if
the Narrative be so like those Fables, it follows that there is a great deal of
Truth couched in the Narrative. Had not the Vindicator bin a Fool, he might
have bin as Civil to the Lords as the Wiseman, and not have stood outfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and denying like a Sott in so many Pages what a <hi>Wiseman</hi> has granted
in two Lines. And now being in the Company of Lords, he is not asham'd
to tell ye what he is, as good a Traytor, and as worshipful a Conspirator, as
any of the rest; Never the less, quoth he, <hi>we suffer for the Truth;</hi> that is, as
his Brethren <hi>Faux</hi> and <hi>Ravillac</hi> did, for the Truth of their Crimes. <hi>And the
Truth shall set us free,</hi> that is, when they have the grace to believe in Christ,
as the <hi>Truth</hi> in that place spoken of, and not the Popish Plot. However,
had he bin so ingenuous as to have quoted the Scripture right, and put in
<hi>You</hi> instead of <hi>Us,</hi> it had come rightly from him, as thus—<hi>We,</hi> that is, the
Vindicator and the Lords, <hi>suffer for the Truth, And the Truth shall set</hi> You,
the Deponent <hi>free.</hi> I would wish the Vindicator to let Scripture alone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he understood it better. And so to his
<q>Word of Advice to the Deponent.</q>

               <p>BUT here you shall find, that before he comes to play the Fool, he
plays the Knave; and assumes to himself very arrogantly and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciously
to have convinc'd the Deponent of <hi>Evident Vntruths, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Perjuries,</hi> and <hi>Shameful Perjuries,</hi> when he has no more done
it, than he has remov'd the Southern <hi>Tropic</hi> into <hi>Lapland.</hi> He has not
assign'd one Perjury in all his ribble rabble discourse, but only like the
lying Products of <hi>Smithfield</hi> Wit, swells his Title to put off his Book.
Nay he talks so ridiculously, so idly of Perjury, that he does not seem
to know what it means. He uses the word to fright Fools, as Nurses
make use of Raw-head and Bloody-bones to fright Children with, yet
neither know what they say.</p>
               <p>His Party have been told that <hi>Perjurus</hi> is one <hi>qui male Iurat ex animi

falsum jurat, non decipiendi animo hoc facit, sed quia rem ita se habere
putat.</hi> Let him prove that the Deponent hath Sworn any thing through
the whole Narrative <hi>Scienter &amp; ex animo Sententia</hi>—Nay, let him
prove that the slips of memory as to names or time, were ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Perjury, then the Pope shall give him the great Motto of
<hi>Eris mihi magnus Apollo:</hi> and we will grant him the Cause. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent

               <p>Caitiff of a Vindicator upon the False and Knavish Assertions of
his own Brain to call a man Perjur'd; and to think meerly with Din and
Noise to stop the Inquisition and pursuit of Truth after Treason and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!
No, he must not imagine <hi>England</hi> yet so easily scar'd and deluded
by such a <hi>Priapus</hi> of a Vindicator as He. So that I may say to Him, as

               <p>His slanderous Tongue will never do the Deponent Harm—</p>
               <p>But what sort of Counsel is it that this same <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, half Fox, half
Goose, pretends so freely to bestow upon the Deponent? He believes
that he has disabl'd the Deponent to follow the <hi>Trade of a Witness,</hi> and
therefore advises Him <hi>to take to some more honest, though less gainful way
of living.</hi> A very specious piece of advice indeed—But when we
consider from whence it comes, and the aim at which our <hi>Adviser</hi> drives,
it appears to be only a drowsie piece of Exhortation, glaz'd and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
over for the Palate of the Common People. Good Counsel ought
to be without respect of Interest for the sole benefit of the Person to
whom it is given. The <hi>Vindicators</hi> Advice to the Deponent is quite
contrary. He and his Party have been acting one of the foulest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
that History can Parallel; and he advises the Deponent to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64376:24"/>
be quiet for the future, and to forbear his farther Prosecution. Very
good advice truly. Now I would fain know of our Suttle <hi>Vindicator,</hi>
what way the Deponent shall take to follow his advice? The Parliament
of <hi>England</hi> are satisfied in the Truth of his Discovery; they are satisfied
that the Vindicator and his Accomplices are guilty of the Villanies
and Treasons of which the Deponent accuses them; and they require
and expect from the Deponent that he should do his duty, and go on
as he has begun. Which way now shall the Deponent proceed to take
his advice, and smother those crimes which he has so impertinently
attempted to vindicate? The Deponent therefore, good Mr. Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,
not believing either your pittiful Rhetorick; and more pitiful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
sufficient to perswade him to do a thing so unjust and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
gives you this answer out of <hi>Tacitus, Se neque Proditoris, neque
hostium consiliis uti. He is resolved to make use neither of the Counsels of
a Traytor, nor his Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is this for? For the good of the Deponents Soul. How
does he prove it? from a mis-quoted place of Scripture of the <hi>Psalmes,
Fill their Faces with shame, and they will seek thy name, O Lord,
Psalm</hi> 83. not 82. Now this was a complaint of <hi>David</hi> himself, upon
a Conspiracy against his Life and Government, as the Deponent had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of a Conspiracy against the Life of His Majesty and the <hi>English</hi>
Government. The other is another mis-quoted Text, from <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
in the <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> For, <hi>There is a shame that brings Glory and
Grace.</hi> And therefore he would have the Deponent asham'd of the
good he has done for the safety of his Prince and Country. As to the
first of these Texts, I cannot well understand how the Faces of men
could be well filled with more shame than to be publickly condemn'd
for Treason, and as publickly Hang'd for the Crime, and yet the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator
is so far from seeking the name of God, that he still persists in
the Devils name, lying and justifying those detestable Enormities for
which they suffer'd. And for the latter Text he speaks too late, for
the Deponent had appropriated that shame long before to himself,
when out of an abhorrency of their lewd Impieties, he forsook, their
<hi>Cercopum Coetus,</hi> their Dens of Treachery and Forgery, and betook
himself to make his Discovery, of which perhaps e're now he might have
reap'd the Consequences, that is to say, <hi>Glory and Grace,</hi> but for your
busie Machinations to undermine and prevent him. However the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
understands the Bible as well as your Worship, and finds a little
farther in the same Author, <hi>Strive for the Truth unto Death, and the Lord
shall fight for thee;</hi> which he believes to be far better Counsel than you
have given him. And indeed it had been impossible for him to have
Swum against such a stream, or rather Torrent of Opposition, had he
not had the strength of Verity to support and Buoy him up. He has
got the hatred of you and your Party most certainly; and the ill will
of those whom your sedulity has perverted: He contends dayly with
the reproaches of some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the envy of others, the dissimulation of others:
Only the Truth of his Narrative begets him some Friends among the
better sort of the Nation, and never more hopes than now, that others will
change their Opinions upon the sight of your lying and scandalous Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>

You say again, <hi>you have advanced nothing material but what is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
true.</hi> Which is one of the greatest Lyes that ever one single
man durst advance in the face of the whole World: There being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is either <hi>Material</hi> or <hi>True.</hi> For saith he, <hi>the chiefest points
are attested by Witnesses of umblemish'd Reputation.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Here's another Swinger. For as to their Reputation it is so far from
being <hi>unblemish'd,</hi> that it is the fowlest under the Sun. The Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Fugitives, Traytors and Conspirators with himself in as Bloody
a design as ever Popery hatch'd; and consequently <hi>Homines Triobolares,

Vindicators sollicitude for him in this particular, nor believes that his
Episcopal jurisdiction reaches into <hi>England.</hi> He makes an idle Story

reason of such a small accident as that, far more discreetly than the

               </p>
               <p>The next thing he troubles the World with, is a Sentence of the
Lord Chief Justices in Sir <hi>G. W</hi>'s Tryal. Which in regard it makes
nothing to his purpose, we shall leave to the better construction of
those, who no doubt will make a more favourable interpretation of
the words. Lord, what would these Fellows do with this Vile Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Deponents Body, if they had him at <hi>Rome,</hi> that have with so
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64376:25"/>
much inveteracy erected an Inquisition of his own Conscience, and a
Chief Justices Sentence to deprive him of his Salvation. Usurping a
vain Authority over both, as well knowing that neither the Deponents
Conscience, nor the Chief Justices words are at their command. From
the Lord Chief Justice he repaires to K. <hi>Salomon,</hi> and tells us, <hi>He that is
inconsiderate in his Language shall feel mischief.</hi> From whence he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to be a Fortune-teller, and bodes the Deponent bad Luck.</p>
               <p>In the first place he has confessed that the Narrative was Writ with a
great deal of Consideration, and then why may not the preceding words
be as true as these, <hi>A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth.</hi> Then
for his Prophetick Spirit we value it not of a Nut-shell, for the Proverb
tells us, 'tis the <hi>Wise man that Governs the Stars,</hi> and not such a Fool
as He.</p>
               <p>He talks of <hi>Eternal Damnation</hi> due to <hi>False Witnesses and Murtherers.</hi>
What's that to the Deponent? Let him and his Attestators look to that.
Oh but, quo He, I have prov'd him to be both by the <hi>Fore-going
Discourse,</hi> as he calls it. You have said so several times, but you must
come and tell us who you are, and make it out, before any man of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will believe a word you say. You will find it a hard task to make
the World believe you are able to write Common Sense, much less with
your Feeble Armes to expugn the Truth of the <hi>Narrative.</hi> If the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Catholicks had such a mind to a Vindication, they should have
done well to have made choice of some Person of more Wit and more
Learning, considering the Importance of the Charge with which they
entrusted him, than your empty Skull affords.</p>
               <p>Having thus tost your little Squibs of Advice at the Deponent, you
throw your Fire-balls at the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> whom you call the
<hi>Giddy Rabble of London.</hi> An Expression you might have forborn, had
you had the least grain of prudence in your hollow <hi>Pericranium;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how much you have already exasperated 'em, by your late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation
of their City, and laying their pretended Habitations in Ashes.
You may be sure they have not yet forgot it, nor who were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
and Contrivers of their Calamity. They find it in the Narrative,
which because you have so slenderly attack'd, they must still and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
And therefore you must not blame the <hi>Rabble of London,</hi> for
being kind to the Person that discover'd your Villany. I know not
what farther Designs you and your Confederates may have against the
<hi>Rabble of London,</hi> that you threaten 'em so hard, but I believe for all
your Vindication, they will have a narrow eye upon your future Actions,
and continue as severely diligent as ever in the preservation of themselves
from your <hi>Clandestine Machinations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You say that <hi>Whitebread and his Fellow Sufferers pray'd for the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
at their Executions.</hi> They had broken the Gallows Custom else.
'Tis usual, and therefore no wonder. All your Thieves, Murderers,
and Malefactors are mighty tender hearted, and Pardon all the World
like so many Popes, before they turn off. But you may assure your
self, 'twas more than the Deponent ever car'd for, or desired at their
hands, and so you may tell the rest of the <hi>Surviving Iesuits,</hi> that you
say <hi>Pray for him still:</hi> For he is fully satisfied, how far the Prayers of
the wicked will reach Heaven. So that you may go Whistle with your
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64376:25"/>
Friendly Admonitions, pack up your Awls, and conclude that you have
lost both your <hi>Labour,</hi> and your <hi>hearts desire;</hi> for that you are never
like to have him in your Clutches at St. <hi>Omers</hi> again.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Attestators</hi> and <hi>Attestations</hi> themselves, they are such
as one would think he had intended a Vindication of the <hi>Spanish</hi> and
<hi>Flemish</hi> Catholicks, not of the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Persons themselves, certainly never was such a parcel of
Vermin Muster'd together out of the Temple Walks, or the Black-pot
Houses in <hi>White-Frayars,</hi> particularly Jesuits and Mule-men; generally
Fugitives, Traytors of the same Gang with himself, Conspirators in the
same Plot, and impeach'd for the same Crimes for which some of their
Fellows have already been Hang'd and Quarter'd by the Law of the Land,
and all after a fair Tryal, a deliberate Verdict, and the Sentence of
their Judges. To tell you more of them, they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Testes
Domestici,</hi> such as the Vindicator has at home, that is, within the Verge
of Papistical Jurisdiction, ready for his and their own advantage. And
so to bring Evidence of this nature, is no more than what <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his
Third Book <hi>de Oratore,</hi> cites, as the saying of <hi>Catulus,</hi> of a certain vain
declaimer of that time, <hi>Stultitiae suae quamplurimos testes domestico prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conio
colligere,</hi> to bring a Rabble of Knights of the Post, or People of
his own Stamp to attest his own folly. In a word, they are most of
them of St. <hi>Omers</hi> Breed, and what Ropes of Testimony have been sent
from thence, we have had experience sufficient and publick enough. As
for that same Dr. <hi>Linch</hi> that pretends to be Arch-bishop of <hi>Tuam</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
What does he at <hi>Madrid?</hi> If he claim his Dignity from the sole
head of the Church in that Kingdom, who is the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi>
why does he absent himself from his Diocess, an Exile from his Duty and
his Prince's favour? If he claim under any other Authority, he is a Rebel;
and then, what have we to do with him or his Attestation either? And
the same may be said of <hi>Strange, Warren, Warner, Blundel,</hi> and the rest
of his <hi>English</hi> Crew. Then for the Attestations themselves, being only
the Subscriptions of such <hi>unblemish'd Gentlemen,</hi> could ever any man
but a Vindicator of the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks imagine, they should be of
any value here? Suppose that an <hi>English</hi> Jesuit should commit a Felony
in <hi>England,</hi> and fly to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and being afterwards Out-lawd for
the Crime, should send an Attestation under his own Hand, that he was
Innocent and knew nothing of the matter; is it possible for any man to
believe that such a piece of wast Paper would be sufficient to acquit
the Fellon, and Perjure the Witnesses that accus'd him? They that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
this <hi>Attestation-monger</hi> so precisely concerning the Deponents
Physiognomy, might as well have inform'd him that our Law admits of
no such Rubbish in Criminal Causes, as the Scrawls of Forraign publick
Notaries: <hi>Viva voce</hi> Testimony carries all in such Cases. Our Law is
so far from admitting a Criminal to attest, that it will not allow him to
swear in his own Cause. 'Twere a fine thing indeed, that they who dare
not shew their faces in <hi>England,</hi> should be believed upon the credit of a
Forraign scrip of Paper. And it is no less a wonder that such Sir <hi>Politico</hi>'s
as the Jesuits, should be such Cuckow-brains, as to send their Billets into
<hi>England</hi> for the Vindication of the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks, where they knew
the Law so little valu'd them—So that being no more than <hi>Caeca Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:64376:26"/>
blind Certificates, and as the Poet ca'ls them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
cunning artifices of deceit, it follows then, that all their
Protestations to Heaven contain'd therein, were fram'd and modell'd
<hi>animo decipiendi,</hi> only to delude the ignorant and unwary People, and
surprize their belief with the gaudy luster of <hi>most worthy and unblemish'd
Witnesses.</hi> Whereas coming to the touch, they prove to be only a
Company of Exiles, Traytors and Rebels, their Attestations for that
reason meer trifles, and that for their Protestations, they might as well
have protested by their <hi>Skeanes</hi> and the <hi>Winds,</hi> like the Antient <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
Now then if the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks be not Vindicated by their own
Laws, the Vindicator has done nothing, his Mountain hath not brought
forth at all, the Mouse is there still. And then what becomes of his
confident Assertion, that he had advanced nothing but what was <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
and <hi>true?</hi> What will become of all these Forgeries, Lyes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
and Perjuries, with which he has so impudently and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
defam'd and Scandaliz'd an approved Narrative? <hi>Tibullus</hi> tells him,
<q>
                     <l>—Venti</l>
                     <l>Irrita per terras &amp; summa freta ferunt.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while the Plot is still Popish, the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks are
ne're the better, and the <hi>Vindicator</hi> loses <hi>his hearts desire.</hi> Three
mischievous accidents to one that pretends to have spent so much <hi>labour</hi>
for those very ends and purposes. The Vindicator therefore should have
done well to have remembred the Story of that famous Lawyer, <hi>Papini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
who being flatter'd by <hi>Caracalla,</hi> to Vindicate him for the Murther
of his Brother <hi>Geta,</hi> made answer <hi>that Crimes of that nature were sooner
committed than excus'd.</hi> 'Twas easier for his Brethren the Jesuits to act
as they did, than for him to excuse their Villany when perpetrated.
There is that Guard of Providence over Truth, which is not to be forc'd
from her defence by the threatning aspect, or reproachful Scandals of a
more terrible <hi>Gorgons</hi> Head than his.—Though Power and Policy
assail her both at once, 'tis but a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from which all the fury and
State-Policy in the World will be forc'd to retire at length with shame
and loss. So that considering the difficulty of the task, and the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity
of the Undertaker, there is no necessity that he should go pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
and dispose of his body by way of despair, for the loss either of
his <hi>Labour,</hi> or his <hi>hearts desire.</hi> For to say truth, it was a very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
thing for him to think that the People of <hi>England</hi> should be Hector'd
out of their Senses by a single <hi>Gladiator</hi> of St. <hi>Omers.</hi> However if it
be impossible for him to Survive his Misfortunes, he may do as he
pleases.</p>
               <p>Thus we see upon what Supporters the Vindication of the <hi>English</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
is founded. Upon the <hi>ipse dixit</hi> of the Vindicator himself, and
the Attestations of the Criminals accus'd. The crime from which the
Vindicator goes about to clear his Friends, is the Popish Plot. The
way he assumes to accomplish his ends, is to render the Discoverer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
and contemptible, thereby to make their Credit Superiour to
his. To this end, the Vindicator talks big of the Deponents Life and
Conversation. But neither he nor any of the Attestators, with all their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64376:26"/>
Aspick Venom and inveterate Malice, tax him with any of the common
Vices incident to Youth. You heart not a tittle of those, but only of his
<hi>ill Manners.</hi> What these were they do not particularize. But at length
we may pick 'em out, and they appear to be Passion and Aspiring. Nay
they croud in another <hi>Peccadillo</hi> too, which they call <hi>Poverty.</hi> To all
which how many of the Greatest among the Great, the Learnedst among
the Learned, the most Pious among the Pious have been Subject, I leave
to all the World to judge who have read any thing of Story. This
is still but the misconduct and miscarriage of Humane Frailty, which it
is at our Liberty, and which indeed we ought to forgive in one another.
But Treason, Murder, Assassination of Princes, Firing of Cities are
Crimes, Crimes of the highest Nature, Crimes which none can forgive
but God and his Vice-gerent the King. This Person then, who while he
liv'd among them, was no more than Passionate and Lofty, comes and
Discovers a Popish Plot carry'd on by a Gang of Conspirators against the
King and Kingdom, makes out a Narrative of their Proceeding, and
Sweares to the Truth of it. To acquit themselves, they do not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come fairly to the Test, but as soon as they think that by their Magick
Policies and Industrious Contrivances they have lull'd the Prosecution of
their Villanies asleep, they give Order to the Vindicator to deny the
whole matter of Fact, from the <hi>Alpha</hi> to the <hi>Omega</hi> of it, and to call the
Discoverer Rogue, Lyar, Perjur'd, to load him with Obloquy, and upon
his own Dung-hil to crow up their own Credit: while their Spies on the
one side, watch him as the <hi>Ichneuman</hi> does the <hi>Crocodiles</hi> Eggs, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Pen-man with Matter for his Scribblement, and they on the other
side furnish him with their own Attestations of their own Innocence, and
by that means believe they shall discharge themselves of a Passionate man.
And why? because they say the Credit of Traytors and Rebels is beyond
the Oath of a man of <hi>ill Manners</hi> among them. Come, come, Beloved,
this will never do; this is not the way to Vindicate your Friends nor your
selves neither, by calling your accuser, who has been smart enough with
ye hitherto, Perjur'd and Lyer a t'other side the Sea, like the Carrier
that defy'd the Lord Mayor upon <hi>High gate-Hill.</hi> Your clearest and most
effective course will be to crave Passes, come over, enter the Lists with
him, beard him, face him, out-face him, disprove him, turn him and
wind him, and convince him into a <hi>Niobean</hi> silence. Then write your
Vindication, you'l need no <hi>Bilbo</hi> Merchants then to help you out at a dead
lift. Till you have done all this, your Attestations indeed may serve to
make Pellets for Pot-guns, but though you should hit your great Enemy
full in the Brest with a hundred of 'em, they will never do him a Pins worth
of Harm.</p>
               <p>But now to speak a little more of their Credit, since they stand so much
upon it, I do find in the Edict of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for their Expulsion out
of <hi>England,</hi> that their Credit is highly there advanced for their lewd and
desperate Arrogance; for their prying into the Counsels of Princes; for
their Exciting Forraign Potentates to invade the Queens Dominions; for
their Libels against Her Government, and Traiterous attempts upon her
Person. Vertues so proper for the carrying on such a Plot as these men
of credit are accus'd of, and out-facing and out-brazening it at a distance,
when they have done, that I find no reason why men that are accus'd of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64376:27"/>
the same Crimes, men of the same clay, Pot-sherds of the same tincture
with those that have been Branded for so many Ages, should have that ill
opinion of themselves, as to think themselves so unlikely to be Guilty;
and so good an opinion of their musty Attestations, as to put them in
Competition with the solemn Oath of a Person never Criminal but in their
Society.</p>
               <p>This and what has been already said at the beginning, may suffice to
shew the value of this same so much exalted <hi>Credit</hi> of the Vindicators
Order of <hi>Iesus,</hi> which if they dare be so confident as to gain-say, I dare
be so hold as to produce Twenty times as much more. So that with so
little credit as they have to call the Discoverers Oath <hi>Worthless,</hi> was but
like the boast of a Bankrupt far from Neighbors.</p>
               <p>To say the truth their Religion it self is a Religion of no Credit. A
Religion founded upon Forgery. A sort of Devotion that no man of
reason can admit into his Belief or Conscience. A Religion in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of its Professors so Diametrically contrary to all the Precepts of
the Founder of Christianity that nothing can be more. Their Muster
Roll of Saints to be sported with, as <hi>Lucian</hi> Laughs at the numerous
Train of the Heathen Deities in his <hi>Councel of the Gods.</hi> Their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
to be contemned rather than disputed against; Their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
as Fabulous as <hi>Mandevil</hi>'s Travels. Their excessive Pomp, their
inordinate Pride, their Luxury, their Sodomy so infamous, as if they
plac'd all their felicity in the enjoyment of the pleasures of this World.
Their Superstitions and Ceremonies Foppish and Ridiculous. In short,
a Religion which their Popes themselves have vilify'd with their own
mouths, while one deridingly retorted to his zealous Friend.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Non si chiava in questa Religione, non durera.</l>
                  <l>Ne're make such a bustle about this Religion, 'twill not last.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And another exulting in his Riches, cry'd out.</p>
               <q>O quantum nobis profuit haec fabula de Christo?</q>
               <p>Certainly then for the Professors of a Religion of so little Credit, to
advance their <hi>worthless</hi> Attestations above the Oath of a Person professing
a Religion so sincere and Orthodox, as that of the Protestants, and for
them to be believ'd, would be the greatest Paradox in Nature. But it
seems that having lost its Religious Credit, it must be now supported by
Bloody Maxims of State; by the Murder of Princes, and the Massacre
of their Subjects. The first Religion in the World, that ever subsisted
by its own Ecclesiastical Politicks. The <hi>Iews</hi> lost all by revolting from
the Ordinances of God; they lose all if they revolt from the Maxims of
the Devil. The Maxims of the Papal Government are easie enough to
be seen: by which it appears that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have taken little
notice of the Oracles of God, but altogether consulted the most inward
Recesses and Penetralia of Humane Wit. Insomuch as the Author of the
Life of <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> tells ye, the reason of the Diuturnity of the Papal
Government is not to be taken from the Verity of the Religion, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64376:27"/>
from this benefit peculiar to the Government, that it always falls into the
hands of Old men, and consequently men Grave, Prudent and Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative.
Which is the cause that the Papal Government still gets ground,
or at least never loses. Whereas other Monarchs being successive, and
subject to the misconducts and miscarriages of Minors, Protectors and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites,
lose more in a few years, than the Wisdom of many that succeed
is able to make good. So then, what Trust or Credit there is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the words, actions or Protestations of the Professors of the refined
Politicks of Humane Wit, I leave to all the World to judge.</p>
               <p>Yet certainly this exquisite Politeness, this studied exactness of Humane
Policy, is not always the most successful, not does it always obtain it's
end. Sometimes those men of Parts peg up their Invention too high;
or else while they Weave their designs so thin and subtle, they become
transparent, and being discover'd, degenerate into Folly.</p>
               <p>Assuredly such a piece of refin'd cunning, was that of the Jesuits, to
think to clear themselves, by throwing their Crimes upon the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.
One of the greatest Arguments, no doubt, of their Guilt. For
never in this World did Innocence go about to acquit it self the Recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of other. Reason and Justice requires, that the Guilty should
clear themselves, before they accuse other people.</p>
               <p>What the Papists, what the Jesuits, what the Popes themselves have
been, what their Maxims and their Tenents are, we have already shewn,
and shall do more if they require it, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have trampl'd upon
the Heads and Crowns of Princes, been the Authors and Fomenters of
most of the Rebellions of the Subjects of <hi>Europe.</hi> That their Political
Tenents are the Extirpation of Hereticks, otherwise call'd the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Kingdoms, the Deposition and Murther of Princes, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all, mental Reservations, and Equivocations with God and Man.</p>
               <p>These men being now accus'd of no more than what has been their
practice for so many years; These men, because they are Detected to
have done no more than what is as natural to 'em as their Mothers Milk;
to have acted only according to those Principles which they learn't with
their first Rudiments of Spelling, to clear themselves, would fain throw
their Crimes upon the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> under that Notion aiming at the
whole Body of the Protestants in general.</p>
               <p>But the Presbyterians must bear the Burthen of their Calumnies, by
reason of the miscarriages in the years forty two, before and after.</p>
               <p>As for the Protestants in General, the Vindicator should have done
well to have produced his Histories where they have been such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
Mutineers and Rebels against their Princes.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> how lately were they the chiefest support of their Natural
Soveraign against their Rebellious Papistical Subjects, whom the Pope
and the Jesuits had Leagu'd together to their utter Extirpation.</p>
               <p>The Protestants of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> could not be call'd Rebells, for
that they made no opposition upon the account of Religion, but for
the maintainance of their Antient Franchizes and priviledges, from the
Oppression of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was not their Lawful Soveraign neither.
Nor did they do what they did, in a Tumultary way, but under the
Conduct of a Prince, who had as much right to the Soveraignty among
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Philip</hi> the Second. Nor did they during the contest, send any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64376:28"/>
one to Murther the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as the Jesuits, his great Creatures did
to Assassinate two great Princes of the House of <hi>Nassau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Protestants of <hi>Germany,</hi> their Wars were carry'd on by
their own Princes, who were as free as the Emperour himself.</p>
               <p>The Protestants of <hi>England</hi> never got the Power of the Government
into their hands by Rebellion, but by the act of their own Monarchs
themselves. By the assistance of the Protestants Queen <hi>Mary</hi> obtain'd
the Crown. And the Protestants were they whom she Martyr'd for
their kindness, who yet nevertheless made no other resistance against her,
but by their patient submission to her Cruelty. But the papists were they
that were so restless in their Conspiracies against Her Successor.</p>
               <p>But the Chief pretence of their Malitious cunning, is the late Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>England,</hi> of which Presbyterians are by them charg'd to be the
chief Designers, Authors and Instruments.</p>
               <p>I must confess, there can be no Pen but that of a Jesuites, that dares
adventure to justifie that Rebellion. But since it was His Majesties most
Gratious Pleasure that all the publick transgressions of those years, should
be Buried in the Tomb of a General Oblivion, it was an unpardonable
injury to His Majesties Act of Pardon, to revive forgiven offences, to
improve Scandals, and raise surmizes of Facts committed, for which
there is not the least appearance of Proof.</p>
               <p>The Vindicator had a greater business then this to do, before he had
open'd such a Villainous absurdity; that is, he should have prov'd that
the Papists and Jesuits, were not the Abettors and Seducers of those Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
at that time, in regard they acted nothing but by their Doctrine
and Principles, and that so truly, as if <hi>Bellarmine, Lessius, Suarez,
Mariana,</hi> and the rest of that Crew had been their only Masters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salmonet</hi> also in his Troubles of <hi>England</hi> tells us, that after the battel
of <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> several Priests were found among the Slain of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Army. So Couragious were Popish Emissaries to accompany the
Presbyterian Souldiers, for fear they should falter in their Rebellious
Fortitude. And it is the opinion of Wise and Learned men, that that
Rebellion was rais'd and foster'd by the contrivances of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When those Presbyterians saw their errors, and had voted to restore
the King with Honour and Safety, they were no longer for the Turn of
the Jesuitical Party, who presently therefore forsook them, and joyn'd
with the Army Party, that was not only the Stronger, but driving on
the Design which they aim'd at themselves, which was the Destruction
of His Majesty, to which intent and purpose they insinuated themselves
into the Chief Committees of the Independent and Fift-Monarchy Faction.</p>
               <p>For proof of which Dr. <hi>De Moulin</hi> tells ye of a Select Number of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,
that were sent from the whole Number of Jesuits in <hi>England</hi> to
the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> to consult for the advancing and securing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Cause in <hi>England;</hi> which they found no better way to bring to
pass, then by making away the King, who had then yielded to the making
several Acts for Extirpation of Popery. He tells ye of one <hi>Sarabras</hi> that
was present, and Triumphing at the Murther of the King; and of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Priest and Confessor, who when he saw the Fatal Stroak given, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
his Sword and cry'd out, <hi>Now the Greatest Enemy we have in the
World is gone.</hi> And the Author of <hi>Fair Warning</hi> affirms, that one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64376:28"/>
                  <hi>Sibthorp,</hi> in a Letter to Father <hi>Medcalfe,</hi> acknowledged that the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
were the Contrivers of the Kings Murther. And it was the Opinion
of Secretary <hi>M.</hi> that the Irreligion of the Papists was chiefly guilty of
the Murther of the late King, the Odium whereof, they were then about,
to file to the account of the Protestants. Now that men of such leud Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
as these, men so strongly accus'd, and so likely to be Guilty, and of
whose Number some have already Suffer'd upon the same Accusations, I
say that such men should go about to invalidate the Testimony that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
against them, by recriminating upon another Party before they have
acquitted themselves, and that so unseasonably and with so little probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of proof, was one of the most Sottish pieces of Jesuitical cunning that
ever History Recorded.</p>
               <p>It seems then, that if the Jesuits Plot had not been Discover'd, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
never had been heard of. But the Jesuits Plot being once brought
to Light, they began to look about 'em, and so they found the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Plot in a Midwives meal-Tub. Here was strange good luck, and
strange bad luck; strange good luck, to find a Plot so Miraculously;
Strange bad luck, to make so little of it. And what was the Reason? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was a Jesuitical not a Presbyterian Plot. And indeed it was a
wonderful symptome of despair, and that they were come to the last push,
to hope for success from a Plot carry'd on in a hurrey, that had fail'd so
unhappily in the Confultations and premeditations of so many years. But
there is yet a greater Argument of the pretended Presbyterian Plot, for
that it was not plac'd right, as being fix'd upon Men that were become
those <hi>Foelices Agricolae,</hi> that now well understood their own happiness.
persons that have a fairer prospect of their own Interest and Safety, as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understanding both to be so entirely wrapt up in the Safety of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
as absolutely to oblige them to venture their Lives and Fortunes
for the Preservation of His Sacred Person, His Crown and Monarchical
Dignity. Therefore it was that they were so Cordially Zealous, and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
assisting in his Restoration; since which they have enjoy'd those
Blessed Fruits of Freedom, Rest and Peace, of which Men of their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
would never go about to deprive themselves by the Folly of a Meal-Tub
Plot, or to sully that Reputation for their Loyalty, wherein they
have ever since continu'd, with designs and Counsels, the most Ridiculous
and vain that ever Vanity it self produc'd. They cannot be ignorant of that
Immortal hatred which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Jesuits bear them.
<hi>Campian</hi> the Jesuit has told 'em roundly the Intention of his Associates.
<hi>As for our Society,</hi> saith he, <hi>I would have you to know,</hi> writing to the
Counsellers of the Queen of <hi>England, That all we who are of the Order of
Iesus, where-ever dispersed over the face of the whole World, have made a
Holy League, to extirpate the Hereticks by all means and ways whatever,
whereby we shall easily surmount all your Contrivances against Vs, nor shall
we ever despair as long as one of Vs remains alive.</hi> So then it would be
the most inconsiderate piece of Rage, the most besotted piece of Fury in
the World, for Protestants to lend their helping hand to assist the Malice
of such an Inveterate Enemy for the Destruction of each other. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
so little to be suspected from the Wisdom and Piety of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
that it would be almost a Crime to mention it farther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:64376:29"/>
And now to Conclude, let the World take this Character of the
Scandalizer of the Presbyterians, and the Vindicator of the <hi>English</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
that he is a man of the most passion, and the least Reason that
ever put Pen to Paper, and so I leave him against next time, to learn more
Wit and more Manners.</p>
