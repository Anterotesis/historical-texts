            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen we consider the visible world with its Essence; and consider the life of the creatures, then we finde therein the likenesse of the invisible spirituall world, which is hidden in the visible world, as the Soule in the body; and see thereby that the hidden God is nigh unto all, and through all; and yet wholly hidden to the visible Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> We have an example hereof in the minde of man, which is an invisible fire; that is inclined to light, and darknesse; <hi>viz.</hi> to Joy, and Sorrow; and yet in it selfe is none of these; but onely a Cause thereto; an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, incomprehensive Sourcive fire; and yet as to its own Essence is included in nothing, save onely in the <hi>Will</hi> of life.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> The body cannot comprehend the minde; but the minde comprehends the body; and brings it to Love, or <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> dislike; this likewise is to be understood of the word, and Power of God; which is hidden to the visible Sensible Elements:
<pb facs="tcp:29914:3"/>
and yet dwelleth through, and in the Elements; and worketh through the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> life, and <hi>Essence,</hi> as the minde in the body.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> For the visible sensible things, are an essence of the invisible: from the invisible, and incomprehensible, the visible, and comprehensible is proceeded: the visible <hi>Essence</hi> is come to Bee from the expression, or Spiration of the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Power: the invisible Spirituall Word of divine Power worketh with and through the <hi>Visible Essence,</hi> as the Soul <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>In.</hi>
                     </note> with and through the body.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> The inward Spirituall soul of man was breathed in to the visible <hi>Image</hi> by the <hi>in-Speaking,</hi> or inspiration of the invisible Word of the divine Power; (for an understanding to the Created Image) wherein mans Science, and knowledge of the invisible, and vissible Essence consisteth.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> Thus man hath now received Ability from the invisible Word of God to the re-expression: that he again expresseth the hidden word of the divine Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into formation, and severation: in manner and forme of the Temporall Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and formeth this spirituall Word according to Animals, and Vegetables; whereby the invisible wisdome of God is pourtraied, and modelized into severall distinct formes: as we plainly see, that the understanding of man expresseth all powers in their property, and giveth names unto all things; according to each things property; by which the hidden wisdome is known, and understood in its power: and the hidden God is made manifest <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>In.</hi>
                     </note> with the visible things; for the Delight, and play of the divine Power: so that the invisible might play with the visible; and therein introduce it selfe into the sight, and Sence of it selfe.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> As the minde doth introduce it selfe with the body, and by the body into Sences, and thoughts; whereby it worketh, and Acteth Sensibly to it selfe; so also the invisible world (worketh) through the visible, and with the visible world: we are not in any wise to conceit that a man cannot search out what the hidden divine world is, and what its Operation, and essence is, for on the visible Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Creation we see a figure of the internall Spirituall operation of the powerfull world.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> And we ought not to think otherwise of God; but that he is the most inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ground of all Essences; and yet so, as that he cannot be comprehended of any thing by the own-peculiar power of the thing; but as the Sun doth introduce it selfe with its light, and Power into the sensible living things; and worketh with [or in] all things: and introduceth it selfe also into an essence; the same like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is to be understood concerning the divine Word with the life of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> Seeing then this visible world is the expressed, Formed word, according to Gods Love, and anger: <hi>viz.</hi> according to the Grand Mystery of the Eternall Spirituall nature, which spirituall world is hidden in the visible; and yet the humane Soul is a sparke out of the Eternall Speaking Word of the Divine Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Power: and the Body an <hi>Ens</hi> of the Stars, and Elements; and also as to the internall ground an <hi>Ens</hi> of Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> of the hidden world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath Might, and Ability to speak of the Grand Mysterie whence all Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences doe Originally arise.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. And <hi>John</hi> saith further: <hi>By the same were all things made: and without it was not any thing made that was made: In it was the life, and the life was the light of men:</hi> heere O man take now this light of life, which was in the Word and is Eternall: and behold the <hi>Being</hi> of all <hi>Beings,</hi> and especially thy <hi>Selfe</hi>; seeing thou art an <hi>Image,</hi> life, and being of the <hi>unsearchable</hi> God; and a Likenesse as to him: heere consider time, and Eternity; Heaven, Hell: the world: light, and dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse: paine, and <hi>Source:</hi> life, and death: Something and Nothing: Here examine thy self, whether thou hast the light and life of the Word in thee, so that thou art able to see, and understand all things: for thy life was in the Word; and was made manifest in the <hi>Image</hi> which God Created; it was breathed into it from the Spirit of the word: now lift up thy understanding in the light of thy life; and behold the <hi>Formed</hi> Word: Consider its inward Generation; for all is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the light of life.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Saist thou, I cannot; I am corrupt, and depraved? heare me! thou art not as yet borne againe of God: otherwise, if thou hadst again that same light, then thou couldest: Goe to then! we all indeed come far short of the Glory, which we ought to have in God: but I will shew thee somewhat: have a care; and conceive it aright: be not a Mocker, as the Confused <hi>Babel</hi> is. Lo! when we would speake of the Being of all Beings; then we say, that from God, and through God are all things: for Saint <hi>John</hi> saith also, that <hi>without him was not any thing made, that was made.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. Now saith Reason, whence or how hath God made Good, and Evill, Paine, and Joy, Life and Death: is there any such will in God which maketh the evill?

                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. Now then behold thy selfe, and consider what thou art: view what the outward World is with its Dominion; and thou shalt finde,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29914:6"/>
that thou with thy outward <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Beeing,</hi> art the outward would: thou art a little world out of the Great world: thy outward light is a <hi>Chaos</hi> of the Sun and Stars: else thou couldst not see <note n="n" place="margin">Or receive light from the Sun.</note> by the light of the Sun: the Stars give the <hi>Essence</hi> of distinction in the intellective Sight: thy body is fire, aire, water, earth: therein also lyeth the Metaline pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, for of whatsoever the Sun with the Stars is a Spirit, of that the Earth with the other Elements is a <note n="o" place="margin">

                           <p n="6">6. When I take up a stone or clod of earth and look upon it; then I see that which is above, and that which is below, yea, the whole world therein; onely that in each thing one property hapneth to be the chiefest and manifest; according to which it is named: all the other properties are joyntly therein; onely in distinct degrees and centres, and yet all the degrees and centres are but one onely centre; There is but one onely root whence <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ll things proceed: it onely severizeth it selfe in the Compaction, where it is Coagulated: Its originall is as a Smoak or vaprous breath from the Great Mystery of the Expressed Word; which standeth in all places in the re-expressing that is, in the Re-breathing (or ecchoing forth) a likenesse according to it selfe: an Essence according to the Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. But now we cannot say, that the outward World is God, or the speaking word, which in it self is devoid of such essence; or likewise that the outward man; is God: but it is all onely the expressed Word: which hath so coagulated it self in its re-conception to its own expression; and doth still continually coagulate it self with the 4 Elements, through the Spirit of the desire (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Stars) and bringeth it selfe into such a motion and life; in the mode and manner as the Eternal Speaking word maketh a <hi>Mysterie,</hi> which is <hi>Spirituall,</hi> in it selfe; which <hi>Mystery</hi> I call the <hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Eternall Nature</hi>; where the Eternall <hi>Speaking Word</hi> bringeth it selfe into a Generation, and also maketh such a Spirituall World in it selfe; as we have materially in the Expressed Word.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. For I say, the inward world is the Heaven wherein God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; and the outward world is expressed out of the inward: and hath onely another beginning then the inward; but yet out of the inward; it is expressed from the inward (through the motion of the <hi>Eternall Speaking</hi> Word) and closed into a beginning, and End.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. And the inward world standeth in the <hi>Eternall Speaking Word:</hi> the Eternall Word hath spoken it (through the wisdome) out of its owne Powers, Colours, and <hi>Vertue,</hi> into an <hi>Essence,</hi> as a <hi>Great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi> from Eternity; which <hi>Essence</hi> also is onely as a Spiration from the <hi>Word</hi> in the wisdome, which hath its <hi>re-conception</hi> to Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it selfe; and with the <hi>Conception</hi> doth likewise <hi>Coagulate</hi> it selfe, and introduceth it selfe into formes, after the manner of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eternall Word: as the Powers, Colours, and <hi>Vertue</hi> doe generate themselves in the word through the wisdome; or as I might say, out of the wisdome in the Word.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Therefore there is nothing nigh unto, or a far off from God:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29914:6"/>
one world is in the other: and all are onely one: but one is Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the other Corporeall: as soul, and body are in each other; and also time and Eternity are but one thing; yet in distinct beginnings: the spirituall world in the internall [<hi>Principle</hi>] hath an Eternall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the outward a temporall: each hath its birth in it selfe: but the <hi>Eternall Speaking Word</hi> ruleth through and over all: yet it can neither be apprehended or Conceived, either by the Spirituall or externall world, that it should stand still; but it worketh from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Eternity, and its <note n="p" place="margin">Or operate.</note> Worke is Conceived; for it is the <hi>Formed Word</hi>; and the <hi>working Word</hi> is its life, and incomprehensible: for it is without all <hi>Essence</hi>; as a bare understanding onely, or a Power that <note n="q" place="margin">Or worketh it selfe out in the <hi>Essence.</hi>

Albeit the Eternall [<hi>Essence</hi>] in reference to the Temporall, is Spirituall; yet the true Spirit is much more Subtile, then that which it maketh to a Substance in the <hi>conception</hi>: for out of the Substance, the true intellective Spirit primely proceedeth, which before the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> is only a Will, and not manifest to it self: for the will doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore introduce it selfe into Substance and <hi>Essence</hi> that it might be manifest to it selfe.</p>
                              <p n="10">10. Now we are to consider of the Severation in the fire: when the fire is enkindled, then is the <hi>fire-blaze</hi> or <hi>Flagrat Salnitrall,</hi> where the powers doe mutually unfold, and display themselves, and come into division, where the Eternall onely power of God, doth manifest it selfe, and in the distinction, doth Sunder it selfe into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties both Spiritually and Substantially: as is to be seen in this World: whence also the manifold <hi>Salts</hi> doe arise: which with the <hi>Creation</hi> came to be such <hi>Matter,</hi> which in the Eternity was onely a Spirituall <hi>Essence,</hi> but in the beginning of Time became Gross and hard.</p>
                              <p n="11">11.

                              </p>
                              <p n="12">12. And heere is the Originall of the Eternall Death, or devora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in this Devoration is the highest <hi>Arcanum,</hi> or <hi>Secret:</hi> for the true essentiall lively Spirit and understanding proceedeth out of this devoration, and maketh another Beginning; for the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is Gods, who introduceth himselfe from the <hi>Abysse</hi> into <hi>Bysse</hi> to his owne Contemplation: but this Beginning, which proceedeth againe out of the devoration, is a Spirituall Beginning, and maketh three worlds: namely; 1. The <hi>darke fire-world</hi> in heat, and cold; a <hi>Rawnesse</hi> wholly <hi>Austere</hi> devoid of <hi>Essence:</hi> 2. The other world is

the <hi>Spirituall</hi> light, or <hi>Angelicall</hi> world: 3 And the third began with the beginning of time: when God moved both the <hi>inward</hi> worlds: he thence brought forth and created this outward visible world into a <hi>forme</hi> of time.</p>

THe <hi>fift</hi> Forme or Property, is the <hi>Love-desire; viz.</hi> the <hi>holy life</hi>; or the displayed <hi>light-fire</hi>; which is awakened or raised up in the wrathfull Consuming fire: that is; it receiveth its lustre, and shine from the fire; a similitude whereof we have in all outward fires: where we see that the <hi>light</hi> ariseth in the <hi>fire</hi>; but yet hath far nother <hi>Source</hi> then the fire: for the fire is painfull, but the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29914:11"/>
light is meeke, pleasant, Lovely, and yeeldeth <hi>Essence.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="2">2. The <hi>Fire</hi> causeth light, and aire; and out of the aire cometh the water by reason of the meekness of the light; for the <hi>Lubet</hi> to the fire is mortified in the <hi>fire-blaze:</hi> and so, that which is mortified in the fire is a <hi>meeke</hi> Essence, yet its only a Spirit: but when it proceedeth from the fire in the light, it <hi>Coagulateth,</hi> and is the <hi>death</hi> of the fire: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the fire goeth out: but if it be of a spirituall nature it is the <hi>food,</hi> and refreshment of the fire: and we see plainely, that every burning fire putteth forth an aire, and out of the aire a water: which aire and watry Spirit the fire draweth againe into it selfe, for its owne life and lustre: else if it cannot have it; it is soone <hi>extinct,</hi> and goeth out: that is; it smothers: for the aire is its life; and yet it begetteth the aire.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Thus likewise we are to consider of the <hi>divine</hi> Beeing: how the Eternall Understanding of the <hi>Abysse</hi> introduceth it selfe into the <hi>Bysse</hi> and Essence: <hi>viz.</hi> into an Eternall <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Devoration,</hi> wherein the manifestation of the <hi>Abysse</hi> consists; and is an Eternall <hi>Love-play</hi>; that the <hi>Abysse</hi> doth so wrestle sport and play with it selfe in its owne conceived [or amassed] <hi>Bysse:</hi> it gives it selfe into the <hi>something</hi>; and againe takes the <hi>something</hi> into it selfe: and thence brings or gives forth another thing: it introduceth it selfe into a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> and desire; moreover into Power Strength, and Vertue, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually produceth one degree from the other, and through the other, that so it might be an Eternall <hi>Play,</hi> and <hi>Melody</hi> in it selfe.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. And this we are to consider of in the <hi>fifth</hi> Forme of Nature: when the Powers of the Eternall Word or understanding, are made manifest through the Eternall spirituall fire, in the Eternall light of the <hi>Majesty,</hi> (that each Power or <hi>property</hi> is manifest in it self, and entreth into a Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Tasting, Smelling, Hearing, Seeing <hi>Essence</hi>; which is effected through the fire, where all things become Spritfull, quick and full of life:) even then one Property entreth mutually into another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they are all proceeded out of one: <hi>viz.</hi> out of the <hi>free Lubet:</hi> therefore also this <hi>free Lubet</hi> is yet in all, and they all joyntly desire to enter again into this <hi>free Lubet; viz.</hi> into the <hi>One</hi>; and there, when one tasteth smelleth feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth heareth and seeth the other in the <hi>Essence,</hi> they doe embrace each other in their <hi>holy</hi> Conjunction: wherein then the reall divine Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of joy consisteth; so likewise the growing and flourishing life of this world: as may be understood by way of Similitude in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Properties,</hi> and the light and power of the Sun.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. The divine Kingdome of joy in the <hi>Heaven</hi> of God (<hi>viz.</hi> in God manifested in his <hi>Expressed</hi> or <hi>Spirated</hi> Essence, as I might speake it to the understanding) consisteth in the <hi>Love-desire: viz.</hi> in the <hi>Power</hi> which hath manifested it selfe through the fire in the light: for the fire giveth unto the meeke <hi>free Lubet</hi> Essence and <hi>Source</hi>; that it is Severized, and moved, and becomes a Kingdome of joy.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. And thus we are to consider of the darknesse; whatsoever is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring Love in the light, wherein all things <hi>rejoyce</hi> and melodize in Love: that in the darknesse is an enmity: for the fire is cold and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29914:12"/>
hot in the darknesse: moreover bitter astringent Compunctive; the Properties are wholly <hi>rigorous</hi> and full of enmity and oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they seeke not the <hi>One:</hi> but onely the advancement of their own might: and the greater their <hi>Elevation,</hi> and inflammation is; the <hi>Greater</hi> is the <note n="o" place="margin">The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of joy.</note> joy in the light.</p>
                              <p n="7">7. That which is good and <hi>holy</hi> in the <note n="p" place="margin">Or light of power.</note> powerfull light that in the darknesse is anxious and <hi>adverse</hi>; the darknesse is the greatest <hi>enmity</hi> of the light and yet it is the cause that the light is manifest: for if there were no <hi>Black,</hi> then <hi>white</hi> could not be manifest to it selfe: and if there were no Sorrow, then joy were also not manifest to it selfe.</p>
                              <p n="8">8. Thus the joy doth triumph in it selfe, that it is not as the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: and the Sorrow triumpheth in it selfe, that it is a Might and strength of the fire, and light: hence arise Pride, and <hi>Selfe-will</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the darke fires Might giveth the <hi>Essence</hi> and motive <hi>Source</hi> to the light: which did so affect, and move King <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that he exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe in the roote of the fire, to rule and domineere over the fire, and light, and therefore was cast out of the light into darknesse: and the light withdrew from him.</p>
                              <p n="9">9. Therefore understand us well heere, what Hell and the darke world or the Anger of God, is: of which the holy Scripture speaketh plainly that there is an hell, that is, a <hi>Gulfe</hi> of Desperation, or <hi>pitt</hi> devoid of the hope of God and all good: now we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it to be any locall Place apart, but it is the first ground to the Eternall Nature: the <hi>place</hi> is between the Kingdome of God and this world, and maketh a peculiar <hi>Principle,</hi> dwelling in it selfe, and hath neither <hi>place,</hi> nor locall abode, and is every where, but inhabiting it selfe onely, and yet it giveth <hi>Essence</hi> to the light-and outward-world; that is, it is the Cause to the <hi>Source, viz.</hi> the <hi>Fire:</hi> and is the whole <hi>Beeing</hi> of all Gods <hi>Beeings.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="10">10. In the <hi>darknesse</hi> he is an Angry zealous God, and in the <hi>fire-Spirit</hi> a Consuming fire: and in the <hi>light</hi> he is a mercifull <hi>Loving God:</hi> and in the Power of the light, he is especially, above all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, called God: and yet 'tis all but God manifested; who mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth himselfe through the <hi>Eternall Nature</hi> in ingredient Properties: else, if I would say what God is in his <hi>Depth:</hi> then I must say: that he is wholly without Nature, and Properties: being an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Originall, of all <hi>Beeings</hi>; the <hi>Beeings</hi> are his manifestation, and thereof we have onely <hi>Ability</hi> to write; and not of the unmanifested God, who also were not known to himselfe without his manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station.</p>

                              <p n="14">14. This harmony of hearing seeing feeling tasting and smelling, is the true <hi>intellective</hi> life; for when one power entreth into another then they embrace each other in the Sound, and when they penetrate each other, they mutually awaken and know each other; and in this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge consists the true <hi>understanding</hi> which is innumerable, immense, and <hi>Abyssall,</hi> according to the nature of the Eternall <hi>Wisdome, viz.</hi> of the <hi>ONE,</hi> which is <hi>ALL.</hi>

                              <p n="3">3. But if we would speake of the heavenly or divine <hi>Essentiality,</hi> wherein the divine powers, doe introduce themselves againe into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings more externally, then we must say, that the powers of the formed, and manifested Word, doe againe in their Love-desire intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce themselves into an <hi>Externall Essence,</hi> according to the property of all the Powers; wherein they, as in a mansion, may Act their Love-play, and so have somewhat, wherewith and wherein, mutually to play and melodize one with another, in their wrestling sport of Love: and this is thus to be understood.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. As a Minerall Power lieth in the earth, and is enkindled by the <hi>Sun:</hi> whereby it beginneth to stir and spring, and becomes desirous of the powers of the Sun, and attracts them into it: but in this long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desire it doth amasse it selfe and forme it selfe to a <hi>body, viz.</hi> a root, or the like: from which roote, there groweth forth in this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry desire, such a body, or hearb as the first Power was; thus likewise the manifested Powers of God doe forme themselves into an <hi>externall Degree: viz.</hi> into an Essence, or <hi>Corporallity</hi>; to speake in reference to the Spirit, whereas we must onely understand a Spirituall Essence, but yet Corporeall or Essentiall, in reference to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: as the water is a <hi>thicker</hi> substance then the Ayre: for the ayre penetrates the water: the like is to be understood concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Powers and Essence.</p>

Curteous Reader, understand the sense aright and well; the meaning is not to be understood so, as if the <hi>Seven Properties</hi> were <hi>divided,</hi> and one were neere by another, or sooner manifest then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: all Seven are but <hi>as one:</hi> and none is the first second, or last: for the last is againe the first; as the first introduceth it selfe into a <hi>Spirituall</hi> Essence; even so the last into a <hi>Corporeall</hi> Essence: the last
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29914:15"/>
is the body of the first: we must speake thus apart, to write it down and decipher it to the Consideration of the Reader: they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely the Manifestation of God; according to Love and Anger; <hi>Eternity</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p n="23">23. But this we are to marke; that each Property is also essentiall: and this essence is joyntly as one Essence <hi>in the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> and its a <hi>Mysterium,</hi> whence heavenly plants spring forth out of each, Powers property: as the earth is a <hi>Mysterium</hi> of all trees, and hearbes so also of the grasse and wormes: and the foure Elements are a <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> of all Animalls: and the <hi>Astrum</hi> a <hi>Mysterium</hi> of all operations in Animalls and Vegetables.</p>
                                 <p n="24">24. Each property is to it selfe essentiall, and hath also in its Essence the Essence of all the other six formes; and maketh the essence of the other six formes also essentiall in its essence; as we see in the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>stones,</hi> especially in <hi>Metalls,</hi> where oftentimes in One Compacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all seven metalls are couched together: and onely one property is principall, which doth Coagulate, and captivate all the rest in it selfe: and alwayes one is more manifest then the rest: according as each property hath its powerfull predominancy in a thing: the like is also to be understood in <hi>vegetables</hi>; where ofttimes in an hearb or peece of wood, there is an Astringent sowre harsh bitter anxious or Sulphrous property, also a fiery sweet or luscious flashy or watry quality.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THe Eternall, and Temporall nature is especially under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the darke and fire world, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>foure first formes:</hi> as 1. in the astringent desire: 2. in the bitter Compunction: 3. in the Anguish, or Sensation. 4. In the fire; where the Severati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceedeth forth in the <hi>Enkindling</hi> [of the fire] in the <hi>Flagrat</hi>; but the powers both in the internall and externall world, are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in the <hi>light,</hi> or love-fire <hi>viz.</hi> in the love-desire.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. For their first ground is the Eternall <hi>Word viz.</hi> the <hi>One</hi>; wherein all things are coucht: the Second ground is the free <hi>Lubet</hi> of the word; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>wisdome</hi>; wherein all the Colours of the onely Power are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the will of the Deity: the third ground is the <hi>Love-desire</hi>: wherein the free <hi>Lubet</hi> with its colours and vertues of the powers hath exacuated it selfe through nature; and introduced it selfe through the fires inflammation into a Spirituall <hi>Dominion</hi>; which [<hi>Lubet</hi>] display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it selfe with the powers in the light in an Eternall Kingdome of Joy.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The fourth ground is the <hi>oyly Spirit</hi>; in that the free <hi>Lubet</hi> doth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29914:16"/>
amasse it selfe in the fiery Love-desire in the <hi>meeknesse</hi>: as in its own peculiar forme: and co-amasseth the Lustre, and essence of the fire and light, and introduceth it into the first Essence; which power of the fire and light in the meekness of the free <hi>Lubet</hi> in the oyly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, is the true and <hi>holy Tincture.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. The fift ground is the <hi>watry Spirit,</hi> arising from the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the fire, where the first Spirituall Essence in the Astringent harsh darke desire was consumed in the fire: now out of the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the fire there proceedeth forth a <hi>Spirituall Essence</hi>; which is the oyly ground; and a <hi>watry Essence</hi> from the mortification, which depriveth the fire-spirit of its wrath; so that it is not able to set its wrathfull properties on fire in the oyly ground: so that the fire must burne through death, and be onely a light: else the oyly ground would be <hi>enflamed:</hi> thus the fire in its Devoration, must beget the water, <hi>viz.</hi> its death; and yet must againe have it for its life: else neither the fire nor the light could <hi>subsist</hi>: and thus there is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Generation, devoration, receiving, and againe Consuming; and yet also its thus an Eternall <hi>Giving:</hi> and hath no beginning nor End.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Thus we now understand what God and his Essence is: we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians say, that God is threefold, but onely one in <hi>Essence</hi>: but that we generally say and hold that <hi>God is threefold in person,</hi> the same is very wrongly apprehended and understood by the ignorant, yea by a <hi>great part</hi> of the learned: for God is no person save onely in <hi>Christ:</hi> but he is the Eternall Begetting Power, and the Kingdome, with all Beeings; all things receive their Originall <hi>from</hi> him.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. But that we say of God; he is <hi>Father, Son, and holy Spirit</hi>; that is very rightly said: onely we must explaine it: else the un-illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated minde apprehends it not, the Father is first the will of the <hi>Abysse:</hi> he is without all Nature or beginnings: the will to Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; which doth conceive it selfe into a <hi>Lubet</hi> to its own Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. And the <hi>Lubet</hi> is the Conceived Power of the will, or of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and it is his Son, heart, and Seat: the first Eternall Beginning in the will: and he is therefore called a Son, because he receiveth an Eteernall beginning in the will, with the wills owne <hi>Conception.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">8. Now the will speaketh forth it selfe by the Conception out of it selfe, as a Spiration, or manifestation: and this <hi>Egresse</hi> from the will in the <hi>Speaking</hi> or Spiration is the Spirit of the Deity; or the third Person as the ancients have called it.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. And the <hi>Spirate</hi> is the wisdome; <hi>viz.</hi> the Power of the Colours, and the <hi>Vertue</hi> of the will, which it Eternally conceiveth to a Lifes-Center, or Heart for its habitation; and doth again Eternally speake it forth out of the Conception; as from its owne Eternall forme; and yet eternally conceiveth [or Comprehends] it for his Hearts <hi>Centre.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="10">10. Thus the <hi>Conception</hi> of the will <hi>viz.</hi> of the Father is from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Eternity, which conceiveth his <hi>Speaking</hi> Word from Eternity,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29914:16"/>
and speaks it forth from Eternity to Eternity; the <hi>Speaking</hi> is the mouth of the wills manifestation: and the <hi>Egress</hi> from the Speaking or Generation, is the Spirit of the Formed Word; and that which is spoken forth, is the Power, Colours, and Vertue of the Deity: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Wisdome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="11">11. Heere we cannot say with any ground: that God is three Persons: but he is <hi>threefold</hi> in his Eternall Generation: he begetteth himselfe in <hi>Trinity</hi>; and yet there is but onely one <hi>Essence</hi> and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to be understood in this Eternall Generation; neither Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, nor Spirit, but the onely Eternall Life, or Good.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. The <hi>Trinity</hi> is first rightly understood in his Eternall Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; where he manifesteth himselfe through the Eternall Nature, through the Fire in the light.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. Where we understand <hi>three</hi> properties in <hi>one</hi> onely Essence: <hi>viz.</hi> the Father with the <hi>fire-world:</hi> and the Son with the Love-desire in the light, <hi>viz.</hi> with the <hi>light-world,</hi> or with the great Meeknesse in the fire; and the holy Spirit with the moving life in the <hi>Tincture</hi>; in the oyly, and watry life: and Dominion; who is manifest in the fire, and light: <hi>viz.</hi> according to the Property of the free <hi>Lubet,</hi> that is, the <hi>Divine</hi> property, he is manifest in a great fiery flame of light, and <hi>Love:</hi> and then according to the property of the darke fire-world, in a <hi>wrathfull,</hi> painefull, Sourcive property: and yet he is the onely <hi>one</hi>; in the light he is the Love-fire-flame: and in the enkindled fire in nature he is a Consuming fire, according to which God is called a <hi>Consuming fire</hi>; and in the darke wrathfull Source he is an <hi>angry zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous avenger,</hi> in which property the Spirits of the darke world consist.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. The Father is onely called an holy God in the Son, that is, in the power of the light in the divine Kingdome of joy; <hi>viz.</hi> in the great <hi>meeknesse</hi> and Love: for that is his proper manifestation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is called God: in the fire he is called an angry God: but in the light, or Love-fire he is called the holy God: and in the darke nature he is <hi>not</hi> called God.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. We must make distinction; each world hath its Principle, and Dominion: indeed <hi>All</hi> is from one Eternall Originall: but it severiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it selfe into a <hi>twofold</hi> Source: a Similitude whereof we have in the fire, and light: where the fire is painefull, and <hi>Consuming,</hi> and the light meeke and <hi>Giving:</hi> and yet the one were a nothing without the other.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. The fire receiveth its Originall in <hi>nature</hi> but the light hath its Originall from the free <hi>Lubet; viz.</hi> from the <hi>Powers of the Deity:</hi> the will of God doth therefore introduce it selfe into <hi>a fire,</hi> that he might manifest the light and the powers, and introduce them into <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="17">17. Albeit I have written heere of the formes of nature (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the etetnall nature) yet it must not be understood as if the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were circumscribed, or limited: his <hi>wisdome,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> in divine property is devoid of limit or measure, innumerable, infinite, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable; I write onely of the <hi>properties</hi>; how God hath manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29914:17"/>
himselfe through the <hi>internall,</hi> and <hi>externall</hi> nature; which are the <hi>chiefest</hi> formes of his manifestation.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. These seven Properties are to be found in <hi>all things</hi>; and he is void of understanding that denyeth it: these seven properties, make, in the internall world, the <hi>holy Element; viz.</hi> the holy natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life, and motion: but this onely Element severizeth it selfe in this externall world, into foure manifest properties: <hi>viz.</hi> into foure Elements: and yet it is but one onely; but divides it selfe into <hi>foure head-Springs: viz.</hi> into fire, aire, water, and earth.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. From the fire ariseth the aire: and from the aire the water; and from the water the earth, or a Substance which is earthly: and they are onely the <hi>manifestation</hi> of the one internall Element, and are, in <note n="t" place="margin">Or before.</note> respect to the internall, as an <hi>enkindled smoake,</hi> or vaprous steame: so also the whole <note n="u" place="margin">Or Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</note> 
                              <hi>Astrum</hi> is nothing else, but Powers breathed forth from the inward fiery darke and light world; from the <hi>Great Minde</hi> of <hi>Divine Manifestation</hi>; and is onely a formed Modell or Platforme, wherein the great minde of divine Manifestation, beholds it selfe in a time, and playeth with it selfe.</p>

                           <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Creation of Angells, and their Dominion.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. THe Creation of Angells had a beginning, but the <hi>Powers</hi> out of which they are created never had any beginning; but were concomitant in the birth of the <hi>Eternall beginning</hi>; not that <note n="x" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Viz.</hi> The Powers.</note> they are the holy Trinity, or in the same; but they were conceived of the desire of divine manifestation, out of the Eternall darke fiery, and light-nature; out of the <hi>Manifested Word,</hi> and introduced into creaturely formes and shapes.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. God who is a Spirit, hath by and through his manifestation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced himselfe into <hi>distinct Spirits,</hi> which are the voices of his Eternall pregnant harmony in the Manifested Word of his Great Kingdome of joy; they are Gods Instrument, in which the Spirit of God <hi>melodizeth</hi> in his Kingdome of joy: they are the <hi>flames</hi> of fire and light, but in a living understanding Dominion.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Powers</hi> of the Deity are in them, in like manner, as they are in men, as <hi>John</hi> saith <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>the life of men was in the word</hi>; so also the life of the angells was in the word from Eternity: for <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 30. its written; <hi>in the Resurrection they</hi> (understand men) <hi>are as the Angells of God in Heaven.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. And as we understand principall-formes in the divine manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the Eternall nature: so likewise we are to understand <hi>Arch-angells,</hi> or Angelicall <hi>Principalities,</hi> with many <hi>legions:</hi> but especially in <hi>three Hierarchies</hi> according to the property of the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> and also the <hi>three Principles,</hi> as cannot be denyed.</p>
                           <p n="5">
                              <pb n="27" facs="tcp:29914:17"/>5. As 1. One <hi>Hierarchy</hi> is to be understood according to the darke world with the Kingdome of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who hath plunged himselfe thereinto; and the <hi>other</hi> is understood with the light fiery, and darke world: and the third is understood with the <hi>Mystery of the outward world</hi>; wherewith the internall hath made it selfe manifest.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Each <hi>Hierarchy</hi> hath its princely dominion and Order: <hi>viz.</hi> they in the <hi>darke</hi> world, in Gods wrath; and those in the <hi>holy</hi> world, in Gods Love; and they which are in the <hi>outward</hi> world, in Gods great wonders, both according to Love, and Anger.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. They which are in the darke world beare the Name (or the names) of the great <hi>Anger</hi> of God according to the Properties of the Eternall nature in the wrath: and they, which are in the light beare the names of the <hi>holy</hi> God, <hi>viz.</hi> of the divine <hi>Powers:</hi> and they which are in the creation of the wonders of the outward world, beare the names of the <hi>manifested powers</hi> of the outward world; <hi>viz:</hi> of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Stars, and foure Elements.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. They which are in the darke world, domineere in the <hi>nature</hi> of the manifested wrath: <hi>viz.</hi> in the properties of Gods Anger, and have their Princely Dominions therein: and they which are in the holy world rule in the Powers of the <hi>Triumphant</hi> world: <hi>viz.</hi> in the great holy Kingdome of joy in the <hi>wonders</hi> of the holy wisdome: and they which are in the outward world reigne over the Powers of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and <hi>foure Elements,</hi> and have also their Princely Dominion over the world; and their Kingdomes and Principalities, for defence against the destroyer in the wrath.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Each Country hath its Princely <hi>Angel-Protectour</hi> with its <hi>Legions:</hi> also there are Angells over the foure Elements, over the fire, and over the aire, over the water, and over the Earth; and they are altogether only <hi>ministring Spirits</hi> of the Great God, <hi>sent forth for the Service of those which shall obtaine Salvation</hi>; as its written, <hi>the Angell of the Lord encampeth about them that feare him:</hi> they are the officers, and Servants of God in his Dominion, who are active and full of motion.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. For God never moveth himselfe save onely in himselfe: but seeing his manifestation of the Eternall and Externall Nature is in <hi>Combate</hi>: thereupon the Spirits of the darke world are against the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the holy world but especially against <hi>man,</hi> who is manifest both in good and evill: God hath set the one against the other, that his <hi>Glory</hi> might be manifest both in his Love, and in his Anger.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. For as we <hi>men</hi> have Dominions upon the <hi>Earth:</hi> so likewise the Superiour Hosts under the <note n="y" place="margin">Or Starry Skie.</note> 
                              <hi>Astrum</hi> have their Dominions: so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the oyly Spirits in the Element Aire: the whole <hi>Deep</hi> between the Stars and the earth, is inhabited and not void and empty. Each Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion hath its owne Principle: which <hi>seemes</hi> somewhat ridiculous to us men; because we see them not with our <hi>Eyes</hi>; not considering that our eyes are not of their Essence and property; so that we are neither able to see nor perceive them; for we live not in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, therefore we cannot see them.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. As in the <hi>Divine</hi> Manifestation of the Divine Powers, one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29914:18"/>
orderly proceedeth forth from another, even unto the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall manifestation: the like also is to be understood of the Angells or Spirits: they are <hi>not all</hi> holy which dwell in the <hi>Elements</hi>; for as the wrath of the Eternall Nature is manifest in the darke world; so likewise, in the outward world, in its property.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. Also the Spirits of the externall world are <hi>not all</hi> Eternall, but some are onely <note n="z" place="margin">Having a beginning, and an end. Temporall.</note> inchoative, which take their Originall natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the Spirit of the externall world, and passe away through na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and onely their <hi>shadow</hi> remaines, as of all other <hi>Beasts</hi> upon the Earth.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. Whatsoever reacheth not the holy Element and the Eternall fire-world, that is devoid of an Eternall life; for it ariseth out of time: and that which proceedeth out of Time, is consumed and eaten up of <hi>Time</hi>; except it hath an <note n="a" place="margin">Eternall being, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, life or Principle.</note> 
                              <hi>Eternall</hi> in its Temporall: that the Eternall doth uphold the Temporall.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. For the Eternall dwelleth not in time: and albeit it be <hi>cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with the Essence of time; yet the Eternall dwelleth in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in it selfe, and the Temporall in the Temporall: as it is to be understood with the <hi>Soule</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> of man; where the Soule is from the Eternall, and the externall body from time; and yet there is an Eternall in the Temporall body; which verily disappeared in <hi>Adam</hi> as to the <hi>Eternall light</hi>; which must be borne againe through Christ.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. And we are not to understand, that the holy Angells dwell onely above the <hi>Stars</hi> without the place of this world, as reason which understands nothing of God, phancieth: indeed they dwell without the Dominion and Source of this world; but in the <hi>place of this world</hi>: albeit there is no place in the Eternity: the place of this world, and also the place without this world is <hi>all one</hi> unto them.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. For the beginning of the Source, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>foure Elements,</hi> together with the <note n="b" place="margin">Or Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Orbe.</note> 
                              <hi>Astrum</hi> maketh onely <hi>one place:</hi> there is no place in the internall; but <hi>All</hi> wholly <hi>entire</hi>: whatsoever is above the <hi>Stars</hi> without this world, that is likewise internally without the foure Elements in the place of this world; else God were divided.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. The <hi>Angelicall</hi> world is in the lieu or place of this world <hi>internally</hi>; and this same worlds <hi>Abysse</hi> is the Great darknesse, where the <hi>Devills</hi> have their Dominion; which also is not confined or shut up in any place; for the Eternity is also their <hi>place,</hi> where there is no <hi>Bysse:</hi> onely the Essence, and property of their world is the <hi>Bysse</hi> of their habitation; as the foure Elements are the habitation of our <hi>externall humanity:</hi> they have also in the darknesse an Element, according to the darke worlds property, else God were divided in his wrath; for where ever I can say, here is God in his Love: even there I can also say; that God is in his Anger, onely a <hi>Principle</hi> Severs it.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. Like as we <hi>men</hi> see not the Angells and Devills with our eyes; and yet they are about us, and among us: the reason is, because they dwell not in the Source and Dominion of our world; neither have they the <hi>property</hi> of the externall world on them: but each Spirit
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29914:18"/>
is cloathed with his owne worlds Property wherein it dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. The beginning of each worlds Source, is that limit, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides one world from the view and ken of the other: for the <hi>Devills</hi> are a nothing in the heavenly Source: for they have not its Source in them; and albeit they have it, yet it is unto them as if it were shut up in death; like as an iron that is red hot; so long as the fire pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, its <hi>fire:</hi> and when the fire goeth out, its <hi>a darke</hi> iron: the like is to be understood concerning the <hi>Spirits.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="21">21. So likewise the Angells are a nothing in the darknesse; they are verily in it: but they neither see nor feele it: that which is a <hi>paine</hi> to the Devills, that same is a <hi>joy</hi> to the Angells in their Source: and so, what is <hi>pleasing,</hi> and delightfull to the Devills, that the Angels <hi>cannot abide: there is a great Gulfe between them</hi>; that is, a whole birth.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. For what else is able to sever the light from the darknesse, save onely a birth of Sight, or light: <hi>the light dwelleth in the darknesse and the darkenesse comprehendeth it not,</hi> John 1. As the externall Sun-shine dwelleth and shineth in the darkenesse of this world; and the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse comprehends it not: but when the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, then the darknesse is manifest: Heere is no other Gulfe between them, save onely a birth.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. Thus we are likewise to conceive of the Eternall light of God, and the Eternall darknesse of Gods Anger: there is but one onely ground of <hi>All</hi>; and that is the Manifested God: but it is severed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sundry Principles and properties: for the Scripture saith, that <hi>the holy, is unto God a good Savour to life,</hi> understand to the holy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life: <hi>viz.</hi> in the Power of the light, and <hi>the wicked is unto God a good savour to death:</hi> that is in his wrath: <hi>viz.</hi> in the Essence Source, and Dominion of the darke world.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. For the God of the holy world, and the God of the darke world, are <hi>not two</hi> Gods: there is but <hi>one</hi> onely God: he himselfe is the whole Beeing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is <note n="c" place="margin">In his wrath, Plagues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Hell Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Evill and Good, heaven and hell, light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and darknesse, Eternity and time, Beginning and End: where his love is <hi>hid</hi> in any <note n="d" place="margin">Beeing Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> thing, there his Anger is <hi>manifest:</hi> in many a thing Love and Anger are in equall measure and weight; as is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in this outward worlds Essence.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. But now he is <hi>onely</hi> called a God according to his light in his Love, and <hi>not</hi> according to the darknesse, also not according to this Outward world: Albeit he himselfe be <hi>ALL,</hi> yet we must consider the Degrees; how one thing mutually proceeds from another: for I can neither say of heaven, nor of darknesse, or of this outward world; that they are God: <hi>none of them</hi> are God: but the expressed and formed Word of God; a <hi>Mirror</hi> of the Spirit which is called God: wherewith the Spirit manifesteth it selfe: and playeth in its <hi>Lubet</hi> to its selfe with this manifestation as with its owne Essence, which it hath made: and yet the Essence is not sundred from the Spirit of God: and yet also the <hi>Essence</hi> comprehends not the <hi>Deity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="26">26. As body and Soul are one; and yet the one is not the other; or as the fire and the water: or the aire and the earth are from one
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29914:19"/>
Originall, and yet they are particularly <hi>distinct</hi>; but yet they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually bound to each other: and the one were a nothing without the <hi>other:</hi> and thus we are to conceive and consider likewise of the Divine Essence; and also of the divine Power.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. The Power in the light is Gods Love-fire; and the Power in the darkenesse is the fire of Gods anger: and yet it is but <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>fire:</hi> but divided into <hi>two</hi> Principles, that the one might be manifest in the other: for the flame of anger is the manifestation of the great Love: and in the darknesse the light is made knowne, else it were not manifest to it selfe.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. Thus we are to understand; that the <hi>evill,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Angells dwell neere one another: and yet there is the greatest immense di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance [betweene them]: for the <hi>heaven is in hell</hi>; and the <hi>hell is in heaven:</hi> and yet the one is not manifest to the other: and although the Devill should goe many millions of miles desiring to enter into heaven, and to see it; yet he would be still in hell, and not see it: also the Angells see not the darknesse, for their <hi>Sight</hi> is meere light of divine Power; and the Devills sight is meere darknesse of Gods Anger: the like is also to be understood of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and againe of the <hi>wicked</hi>: Therefore in that we in <hi>Adam</hi> have lost the <hi>Divine</hi> Sight; in which <hi>Adam</hi> saw by the divine Power: <hi>Christ</hi> saith: <hi>you must be borne anew; else you cannot see the Kingdome of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="29">29. In the fire-Spirit we are to understand the <hi>angelicall Creation:</hi> where the will of the <hi>Abysse</hi> introduceth it selfe into <hi>Bysse:</hi> and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth the Eternall <hi>Speaking Word</hi> or life with the fiery birth; <hi>viz.</hi> with the <hi>first Principle,</hi> where the spirituall Dominion is manifest by the fire-birth: In this Spirituall fire, all Angells doe take their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; <hi>viz.</hi> out of the formes to the fire-Source; for no <hi>creature</hi> can be created out of the fire: for it is <hi>no Essence</hi>; but out of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the fire a Creature may be apprehended in the desire <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>verbum Fiat</hi>; and introduced into a creaturall forme and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. And therefore there are many, and divers <hi>sorts</hi> of Angells: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in many distinct <hi>Offices:</hi> and as there are three formes to the fire-Source; so there are also <hi>three Hierarchies</hi>; and therein their Princely Dominions: and likewise <hi>three worlds</hi> in one another as one; which make <hi>three Principles</hi> or Beginnings: for each Property of the Eternall Nature hath its Degrees; for they doe explicate and mutually unfold themselves in the fire-blaze, and out of those degrees, the different <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> of Spirits, is created.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. And we are to understand nothing else by the Creation of the Angells and of all other Spirits; but that the <hi>Abyssall</hi> God hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced himselfe into his manifested Properties and out of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties into living <hi>Creatures:</hi> by which he possesseth the Degrees, and therewith playeth in the properties: they are his Strings in the <hi>All-Essentiall Speaking:</hi> and are all of them tuned for the Great <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of his <hi>Eternall Speaking Word:</hi> so that in all degrees and Properties the voice of the unsearchable God is manifest and made knowne: <hi>they are all created for the Praise of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="32">32. For, All whatsoever hath life, liveth in the <hi>Speaking</hi> Word:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29914:19"/>
the Angells in the Eternall Speaking; and the Temporall Spirits in the re-expression or Ecchoing forth of the Formings of Time, out of the Sound, or <hi>breath of time</hi>; and the Angells out of the <hi>Sound of Eternity: viz.</hi> out of the voice of the manifested word of God.</p>
                           <p n="33">33. And therefore they beare the names of the severall <hi>degrees</hi> in the manifested voice of God; and one degree is more holy in the Power then another; Therefore the Angells also in their <hi>Quires</hi> are differenced in the Power of the Divine Might: and one hath a more holy <hi>Function</hi> to discharge then another; an example whereof we have by the <hi>Priests</hi> in the <hi>old Testament</hi> in their Ordinances; which were instituted after an angelicall manner.</p>
                           <p n="34">34. Albeit earthly; yet there was even such an angelicall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and meaning coucht therein; which God did represent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jesus</hi> which was to come into the humane Property; and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with Israel in the Type, at the Eternall which was to come, which, <hi>Jesus</hi> out of <hi>Jehova</hi> did restore, and introduce into the humane, property; which the <hi>Earthly Reason</hi> hath neither apprehended or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: but seeing the time is <note n="e" place="margin">Manifest or come about.</note> borne, and the beginning hath againe found the End, it shall be manifest, for a witnesse unto <hi>all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>: sheweth the Spirit of <hi>Wonders.</hi>

                           <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> with his Legions.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. ALbeit <hi>selfe-Reason</hi> might heere cavill at us, and say, we were not by, when this was done: yet we say that we in a <hi>Magicall manner</hi> according to the Right of Eternity, were really there, and saw this: but not I, who am I, have seen it; for I was not <hi>as yet</hi> a Creature; but we have seene it in the <hi>Essence</hi> of the Soule which God breathed into <hi>Adam.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. Now then, if God dwelleth in this same Essence; and hath from all Eternity <hi>dwelt</hi> therein: and manifesteth himselfe in his own mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and looketh back through the Essence of the Soule, into the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of all Beeings; what then hath <hi>Reason</hi> to doe, to taunt, and cavill at mee about that, wherein it selfe is blinde? I must warne Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; that it would once behold it selfe in the Looking-Glasse of the understanding, and consider what <hi>it selfe</hi> is; and leave off from the Building of mad <hi>Babel</hi>; it will be time.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> came not to passe from Gods purpose or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; indeed it was known in the wrath of God, according to the property of the darke world, how it could or would come to passe; but in Gods holinesse, <hi>viz.</hi> in the light, there was no such <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> manifest in any such property; otherwise the holy God must have a devillish or hellish wrathfull desire <hi>in his Love</hi>; which is nothing so; but in the Centre of the Eternall nature, <hi>viz.</hi> in the formes to fire, there is verily such a property, in the Darke impression.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="32" facs="tcp:29914:20"/>4. Every good Angell hath the <hi>Centre</hi> in him; and is manifest in a creaturall Property in one <hi>degree</hi> or other in the Centre; what property is <note n="f" place="margin">Chiefest, most predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant. or manifest.</note> greatest in the Creature, according to that, it hath its office, and Dominion.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Yet the Angells, which were created out of the degrees of the Centre, were created <hi>for</hi> and to the light; the light was manifest in <hi>All</hi>; and they had Free will from the Manifested will of Gods will.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. <hi>Lucifer</hi> had still been an Angell, if his <hi>owne will</hi> had not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him into the fires-Might, desiring to domineere in the strong fiery-Might, above and in all things as an absolute sole God in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and light; had he but continued in the <hi>Harmony</hi> wherein God had created him; [what would have cast him out of the light?]</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Now Reason saith, he could not: then tell me who compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him? was he not I preethee the most <hi>glorious Prince</hi> in heaven: had he introduced his will into the Divine <hi>Meeknesse,</hi> then he could [have been able to stand;] but if he <note n="*" place="margin">In his own will, which was from the Eternall will, was both the possibility and Ability.</note> would not then he could not; for his owne desire went into the <hi>Centre:</hi> he would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe be God; He entred with his will into <hi>Selfe</hi> 
                              <note n="g" place="margin">Selfe-hood, or Selfenesse.</note>; and in Selfe is the <hi>Centre</hi> of Nature; <hi>viz.</hi> those properties wherein his will would be Lord and Master, in the house.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. But God created him for his Harmony, to play with his <hi>Love-Spirit</hi> in him, as upon the musicall Instrument of his manifested and formed Word: and this the <hi>selfe-will</hi> would not.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Now saith reason; how came it, that he would not? did not he know the Judgement of God and the fall? yea, he knew it well enough: but he had no <hi>Sensible Perceivance</hi> of the fall; but onely as a bare <note n="h" place="margin">Or Notic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Theory, in the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his minde.</note> knowledge; the fiery <hi>Lubet</hi> which was potent in him: did egg him on; for it would faine be manifest in the Essence of the <hi>wrath; viz.</hi> in the root of fire: the darknesse also eagerly desired to be <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aturall,</hi> which drew <hi>Lucifer,</hi> its crafts-Master, in the great Potency of fire; indeed it drew him not <note n="i" place="margin">Outwardly.</note> from without; but in the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and <hi>will</hi> of his owne fiery and darke Essence: the Originall of the Fall was within the Creature and not <hi>without</hi> the Creature: and so it was in <hi>Adam</hi> also: Selfe-will was the beginning of Pride.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Thou askest; what was that which did cause it in himselfe? Answer: his great beauty, and glory; because the will beheld what it selfe was in the <hi>fiery</hi> mirror: this Lustrous glance did move and affect him so that he did eagerly reach after the Properties of the <hi>Centre</hi>; which forth-with began effectually to worke: for the Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Austere Desire, <hi>viz.</hi> the first forme or property, did impresse it selfe, and awakened the compunction, and the <hi>Anxious</hi> desire: thus this beautifull Star did overshadow its light; and made its Essence wholly Astringent, rigorous, and harsh, and its meeknesse and true Angelicall Property, was turned into an Essence <hi>wholly</hi> Austere, harsh, rigorous and Darke: and then this bright <hi>Morning Star</hi> was undone; and as he did, so did his Legions: and this was his fall.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. He should have been wholly resigned in the holy Power of God; and heare what the Lord would speake and play by his owne Spirit in him; this, <hi>Selfe-will</hi> would not doe; and therefore he must
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29914:20"/>
now play in the darke: yea his will is yet opposite; albeit now after the fall he <hi>cannot will [viz.</hi> to resigne to the divine will of the light] for his meeknesse, whence the Love-will ariseth, is shut up and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againe into a <hi>Nothing: viz.</hi> it is retired into its own Originall.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Now the Creature still remaineth, but wholly out of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre <hi>viz.</hi> out of the <hi>Eternall Nature:</hi> the free <hi>Lubet</hi> of Gods wisdome is departed from him; that is, it hath hid it selfe in it selfe; and letteth the wrathfull fire-will, stand: as hapned to <hi>Adam</hi> also, when he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined after Evill and good, then the free <hi>Lubet</hi> of the <hi>holy worlds-Essence</hi> did disappeare in his Essence.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. This was the very death, of which God told him, <hi>that if he did eat of the tree of the knowledge of good, and evill; he should dye the very same day:</hi> thus it was in <hi>Lucifer,</hi> he dyed to the holy divine world, and arose to the wrathfull world of Gods Anger.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. Thou saist; wherefore did not God uphold him, and draw him from the evill inclination? I preethee tell me <hi>wherewith?</hi> should he have poured in more Love and meeknesse into this fire-Source? then had his Stately light been more manifest in him; and the Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glasse of his owne knowledge, had been the <hi>greater,</hi> and his owne fiery Selfe-will the <hi>Stronger</hi>: I pray was not his High light, and his own-selfe-knowledge, the Cause of his fall.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. Should he then have drawn him with <hi>Rebuke?</hi> was it not his purpose aforehand to <hi>rule</hi> the magicall ground as an Arstist: his Ayme and endeavour was for the <hi>Art,</hi> that he would play with the Centre of the <hi>Transmutation</hi> of the Properties; and would be and doe, all whatsoever he alone pleased; had he not known this, he had still remained an Angell in <hi>humility.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="16">16. Therefore the children of darknesse, and <hi>the children of this world</hi> also, <hi>are wiser then the children of the light</hi> as the Scripture saith. Thou askest, why? they have the Magicall <hi>roote</hi> of the Originall of Essences manifest in them: and this was even the desire of <hi>Adam</hi>: however the Devill perswaded them that <hi>they should be wiser; their eyes should be opened, and they should be as God himselfe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="17">17. This folly caused King <hi>Lucifer</hi> to aspire, desiring to be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, and absolute Lord, like the Creatour. The <hi>water</hi> of meeknesse had been good for his fire will; but he would none of that: hence it is, that the children of God must be the <hi>most plaine, syncere and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>; as <hi>Esaias</hi> prophecyed of Christ; <hi>who is so simple as my servant the righteous one who turneth many unto righteousnesse: viz.</hi> 
                              <note n="k" place="margin">Or to.</note> upon the way of humility.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. All Angells live in humility and are resigned to the Spirit of God, and are in the Eternall <hi>Speaking</hi> Word of God as a well-tuned pure-Sounding Instrument, in the harmony of the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; of which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is chiefe Master, and Ruler.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. But the <hi>Devill</hi> hath forged to himselfe a strange fooles-play; where he can act his gulleries with his sundry Enterludes, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guizments; and demeane himselfe like an <hi>Apish foole</hi>; and transforme himselfe into monstrous strange, and hideous shapes and figures: and mock at the Image of Angelicall <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi>; and this was his ayme and intent, for which he departed from the harmony
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29914:21"/>
of the Angelicall Quires: for the Scripture saith, <hi>tthat he was a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer and lyar from the beginning</hi>; his jugling feats, and fictions, are meere strange figures and lies; which God never formed in him; but he brings them to formes and shapes in himselfe: and being that they are contrary to his <hi>Creation,</hi> they are lies and abominations.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. He was an Angell, and hath belyed his Angelicall forme and obedience; and is entred into the Abomination of fictions, lies, and mockeries: he hath awakened the envious <hi>hatefull</hi> formes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the darke world, in his Centre, whence wrath and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty springeth: he sate in heavenly Pomp and glory; and introduced his hatefull desire, and malicious will, into the Essence, <hi>viz.</hi> into the water-Source; and cast forth his streames of Enmity and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. His Properties were as the venemous stings of Serpents, which he put forth out of himselfe: when the Love of God was <hi>withdrawn</hi> from him, he figured his Image, according to the Property of the wrathfull formes; (wherein there are also evill Beasts, and wormes in the Serpentine shape,) and infected, or awakened the <hi>Sal-niter</hi> of the Centre of nature in the Expressed Essence, in the Generation of the Eternall nature; whence the Combate arose, that the Great Prince <hi>Michael</hi> fought with him, and would no longer endure him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven among the fellowship of the holy Angells.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. For which Cause the <hi>will</hi> of the <hi>Abysse: viz.</hi> of the <hi>Eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> moved it selfe, and swallowed him downe, as a treacherous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured wretch, into the <hi>Gulfe</hi> and <hi>Sinck</hi> of Eternall darknesse: <hi>viz.</hi> into an other Principle: the Heaven spewed him out of it selfe; <hi>he fell</hi> into the darknesse <hi>as lightning,</hi> and he lost the mansion of God in the Kingdome of Heaven, in the holy Power; and all his servants with him: There he hath the Mother for his enchanting delusions; there he may play them jugling feats, and <hi>Antick tricks.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="23">23. Moreover we are to know, that he had his Royall Seat in the Place of this world: therefore <hi>Christ</hi> calleth him a <hi>Prince of this world: viz.</hi> in the Kingdome of darknesse in the wrath in the place of this world.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. His Kingly Throne is taken from him; and another hath pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it in the heavenly worlds Property, in the place of this world: he shall not obtaine it again.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. Also (at the instant of the Creation of the Stars and foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) <hi>another King</hi> was established over him, in this place in the Elements; which albeit we could mention; yet at present it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>Silence</hi> by reason of the false Magick; also by reason of other Superstitions and Idolatries we will not speake any thing of it heere: and yet hint <hi>enough</hi> unto our School-fellowes.</p>

                           <head>CHAP. X. Of the Creation of Heaven and the Outward World.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. IT seemes strange, and wonderfull to <hi>Reason,</hi> to consider how God hath Created the Stars, and foure Elements; especially when it doth contemplate, and consider of the Earth with its hard Stones, and very rough indigested harsh, substance; and seeth, that there are great stones rocks and cliffes created, which are in part <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,</hi> and very hindersome, to the employment of the Creatures in this world: then it thinks, whence may this <hi>Compaction</hi> arise in so many formes, and properties: for there are divers sorts of stones, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers mettalls, and divers kindes of Earth whence manifold hearbs and Trees doe grow.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Now when it doth thus muse and contemplate, it findes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, save onely that it doth acknowledge, that there must be an hidden Power and Might, which is Abyssall, and <hi>unsearchable</hi>; which hath Created all things so; and there it sticks; and runs to and fro in the Creation, as a bird that flies up and down in the aire; and lookes upon all things, as an Oxe upon a new doore of his Stall, and never so much as considers what it selfe is; and seldome reacheth so far as to know, that man is an Image extracted out of this <hi>whole Beeing:</hi> it runneth up and downe as a Beast void of understanding: which desireth onely to eat and procreate; and when it comes to its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree as to search out and learne Something; then it searcheth in the outward <hi>fiction,</hi> and artifice of the <hi>Stars</hi>; or else in some carved worke of outward nature: it will by no meanes simply and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely learne to know its Creatour; and when it comes to passe that one attaineth so far, as to teach the knowledge of him; yet then it calleth him a <hi>foole,</hi> and phantastick; and <hi>forbids</hi> him the precious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of God, and imputes it to him for sin, and revileth him therein.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Such meer Animalls we are, since the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi>; that we doe not so much as once consider that we were created in the Image of God; and endued with the right naturall and genuine <hi>understanding,</hi> both of the Eternall, and Temporall nature; so as to minde and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke our selves by Great Earnestnesse, to re-obtaine that which we have lost: whereas we have yet that very <hi>first soule,</hi> wherein the true understanding lyeth: if we did but seriously labour to have that light which we have lost, to shine againe in us; which yet is offered unto us out of <hi>Grace.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. Therefore <hi>there will be no excuse at the great day of the Lord, when God shall judge the Secret</hi> and hidden <hi>things of mankinde,</hi> because we would not learne to know him, and obey his voice; which daily hath knocked amongst us, and in us; and resigne up our selves unto him; that so our understanding might be <hi>opened:</hi> and a very Severe Sentence shall he receive who will undertake to be called Master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              <pb n="36" facs="tcp:29914:22"/>
and <note n="l" place="margin">Sir.</note> 
                              <hi>Rabbi</hi>; and yet neither knoweth the way of God, or walketh therein, and that which is yet more heinous <note n="m" place="margin">Or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth.</note> 
                              <hi>forbiddeth those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know,</hi> and walke therein.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. The Creation of the outward world, is a manifestation of the inward Spirituall <hi>Mystery: viz.</hi> of the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Eternall Nature, with the <hi>holy Element:</hi> and was brought forth by the Eternall <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Word through the motion of the inward world as a Spiration; which Eternall Speaking Word hath expressed the Essence out of the inward Spirituall world; and yet there was no such Essence in the <hi>Speaking,</hi> but was onely as a breath or vaprous exhalation in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the internall, breathed forth, both from the property of the darke world, and also of the light world: and <hi>therefore</hi> the outward Essence of this world is good and Evill.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. And we are with very entire and punctuall exactnesse to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this <hi>Motion</hi> of the Eternall Mystery of the Spirituall world. 1. How it came to passe that such a wrathfull rough grosse and very Compunctive Essence and Dominion, was brought forth and made <hi>manifest,</hi> as we see in the outward formes of nature, as well in the moving things, as in the stones and Earth. 2. Whence such a wrath did arise, which hath compacted and introduced the <hi>Powers</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties into such a harsh nature, [or rude quality] as we see in the earth and stones.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. For we are not to thinke, that there is the like in <hi>Heaven, viz.</hi> in the Spirituall world; in the Spirituall world there are onely the properties of <hi>Possibility</hi>; but not at all manifest in such a harsh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; but are as it were swallowed up; as the light swalloweth up the darknesse, and yet the darknesse doth really dwell in the light, but not apprehended.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Now we are yet to search out, how the desire of the <hi>darkenesse</hi> became manifest in the Power of the light; that they both came mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually into the Compaction, or <hi>Coagulation</hi>: and yet it affordeth us a far greater and more profound consideration; that when man could not stand in the Spirituall Mystery of the <hi>Paradisicall,</hi> property, [and estate] that God <hi>cursed</hi> this Compaction, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earth; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed an Earnest judgement to sever the good in this Compaction again from the Evill: so that the good must thus stand in the Curse, that is, in <hi>death</hi>; he that doth heere see nothing is indeed blinde; why would God curse his good Essence; if something were not come into it, which was opposite to the <hi>Good</hi>; or is God at odds with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as reason would be ready to phancy: for it is written in <hi>Moses</hi>; that <hi>God looked upon all that he had made, and behold it was very good.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="9">9. Now <hi>Man</hi> for whose sake the earth was accursed; had not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced any thing into the earth, whereby it was now made so Evill, as to cause God to curse it, save onely the false and faithlesse <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his desire to eat of the evill and good: so as to awaken the vanity; <hi>viz.</hi> the Centre of nature in him, and to know Evill and Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from which desire the hunger entred into the earth; whence the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward body was extracted as a <hi>Masse</hi>; which set the hunger of its desire againe upon its mother; and araised the root of vanity out of the dark Impression of the <hi>Centre</hi> of nature, whence the <hi>Tree</hi> of Temptation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29914:22"/>
                              <hi>viz.</hi> Evill and good, grew manifest to him; and when he did eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Earth was accursed for his sake.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Now if man by his Powerfull Desire, did awaken the wrath in the Earth; what might then <hi>Lucifer</hi> be able to doe, who was likewise an enthroned Prince, and moreover had many <hi>Legions? Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> had the will of the Strong Might and Power of the Centre of all Beeings in himselfe, as well as <hi>Adam, Adam</hi> was onely one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but <hi>Lucifer</hi> was a King, and had a Kingdome in possession: <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> in the Spirituall world, <hi>viz.</hi> in the heavenly <hi>Sal-niter</hi> in the Generation of the Manifested Word: he was an enthroned Prince in the manifested Power of God: therefore Christ calleth him <hi>a Prince of this world:</hi> for he sate in the Essence, understand in the Spirituall Essence, whence this world was breathed forth as a Spiration.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. He it is that by his false desire, which he introduced into the Essence, did awaken the <hi>wrath</hi> in the internall; as <hi>Adam</hi> araised the <hi>Curse</hi>; he raised the Centre of nature with his darke wrathfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the like wrathfull properties: for he had <hi>first</hi> awakened the wrath of God in himselfe; and then this awakened wrath entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its <hi>mother, viz.</hi> into the <hi>Magicall</hi> generation; out of which <hi>Lucifer</hi> was created to a Creature: whereupon the Generation was made proud and aspiring contrary to the <hi>Right</hi> [or law] of Eternity.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Also he sate in his Angelicall forme in the good holy Essence, as to the Generation of the <hi>divine meekenesse</hi>; and therein exalted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to domineere in the will of his wrath above the meeknesse, as an <hi>absolute</hi> peculiar <hi>God</hi> contrary to the Right of Eternity.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. But when the <hi>Speaking</hi> Eternall Word in Love and Anger, for his malicious iniquity sake, did move it selfe in the Properties; <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Essence</hi> wherein <hi>Lucifer</hi> sate; to cast this wicked Guest out of his habitation into Eternall darknesse; then the <hi>Essence</hi> was compacted: for God would not beteem that he should any longer have these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested Powers, wherein he was a Prince; but created them into a <hi>Coagulation,</hi> and <hi>spewed him out</hi> of them.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. And in this Impression, or Conjunction, the Powers, <hi>viz.</hi> the watry and oyly Properties, were compacted; not that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> did compact, or Create them; but the Speaking Word of God, which dwelt in the manifested <hi>Powers,</hi> and properties: the same tooke away the disobedient childs <hi>Patrimony,</hi> and cast him out as a perjured wretch out of his inheritance into an Eternall <hi>Prison,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the house of darknesse, and Anger; wherein he desired to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster over the Essence of Gods <hi>Love</hi>; and rule therein as a jugler, and <hi>Inchanter,</hi> and mix the holy with unholy, to act his jugling feats and proud pranks thereby.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. And we see very clearly with quick-sighted eyes, that it is thus: for there is nothing in this world so evill, but it hath a good in it: the <hi>Good</hi> hath its rise Originally out of the good or heavenly Property, and the <hi>Evill</hi> hath its descent from the property of the darke world; for both worlds, <hi>viz.</hi> light, and darkenesse, are in each other as one.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. And therefore they also went along <hi>together</hi> into the Compacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Coagulation; and that from the <hi>Degrees</hi> of the Eternall nature:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29914:23"/>
                              <hi>viz.</hi> from the properties to the fire-life; and also from the properties in the oyly, and Spirituall watry lights Essence.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. For the <hi>Metalls</hi> are in themselves nothing else but a water and oyl; which are held by the wrathfull properties; <hi>viz.</hi> by the Astringent Austere desire; that is; by a Saturnine Martiall, fiery property; in the Compaction of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> to be one body: [or congealed bulke] but if I wholly destroy this body, and severize each into its own property; then I clearly finde therein the first Creation.</p>

inferiour, if it were not enkindled by the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi>: the same is the heart of all externall Powers; and it is the Open <hi>Punctum</hi> even to the <hi>Tenth Number</hi>; if we were not so blinde as to contemne all that we see not with our Calves-eyes, it were right and requisite to reveale it; but seeing God hath hidden the <hi>Pearle,</hi> and also himselfe, from the sight of the wicked; therefore we'l let it alone, yet hint enough to our <hi>School-fellowes:</hi> we will not give our Pearle unto <hi>Beasts.</hi>

                              <p n="56">56. Thus we understand what the outward heaven is, namely the Powers or Conception of the water: the word or Power <hi>Fiat,</hi> which began with the beginning of the world is yet still <note n="b" place="margin">Or in the creating.</note> a <hi>Creating</hi>; it yet continually createth the <hi>heaven</hi> out of the water: and <hi>the Spirit</hi> of God still <hi>moveth upon the water:</hi> and the holy water is yet continually Separated from the water under the firmament.</p>
                              <p n="57">57. This holy water is that, of which Christ told us, <hi>that he would give us it to drinke: that should spring up in Vs to a fountaine of Eternall life</hi>: the holy heavenly Corporallity doth consist therein; it is the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> which he brought from heaven; and by the same, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced heavenly Paradisicall Essentiality, into our dead or decayed body; and quickned ours in his; understand in the <note n="c" place="margin">Mark or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</note>

                              <p n="59">59. Thus we understand how the holy heaven, wherein God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, moveth in the <hi>Fiat</hi> or the Created [<hi>heaven</hi>], and that God is <hi>really present</hi> in all places; and inhabiteth all things: but he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prended of <hi>Nothing.</hi> Hee is manifest in Power in the inward heaven of the <hi>holy</hi> Essentiality; <hi>viz.</hi> in the Element. This <hi>holy Element</hi> (in the beginning or inchoation of the foure Elements) did <hi>Penetrate</hi> through the Earth; and sprang [or budded] forth in the <hi>holy Powers</hi> Property, and bare fruits, of which man should have eaten in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly manner: but when it did disappeare in man; the <hi>Curse</hi> entred into the Earth; and so Paradise was <hi>quasht</hi> in the foure Elements; and continued retired in it selfe in the inward Element; there it stands <hi>yet open</hi> unto man, if any will depart from this worlds Essence, and enter into it upon the <hi>Path</hi> which Christ hath made open.</p>

                           <head>CHAP. XI. Of the Mystery of the Creation.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Reason</hi> of the outward man saith; whence is it, that God hath not revealed the Creation of the world unto man; that <hi>Moses,</hi> and the children of God have written so little there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, seeing it is the Greatest and most principall worke, whereon the <hi>Maine</hi> depends.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Yes! deare <hi>Reason</hi> smell into thy owne bosome; of what doth it Savour: contemplate thine owne Minde; after what doth it long; likely, after the cunning <hi>delusions</hi> of the Devill: had not hee known this ground, very like he had been yet an <hi>Angell</hi>; had he not seen the <hi>Magicall</hi> birth in his high light, then he had not desired to be a selfish Lord and maker in the Essence.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Wherefore doth God hide his children, which now receive the Spirit of knowledge with the <hi>Crosse</hi>; and cast them into tribulation, and mire of vanity? for certaine, <hi>Therefore,</hi> that they might play the Tune of <hi>miserere</hi>; and continue in <hi>humility</hi>; and not sport in this <note n="i" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Text,</hi> Time.</note> life with the light of nature; else if they should espie, and apprehend what the <hi>Divine Magick</hi> is: then they might also desire to imitate the Devill, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did, for which cause it is hid from them: and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Moses,</hi> or any other, <hi>dare</hi> write clearer thereof, untill the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creation beholdeth the End of the world in it selfe: and <hi>then</hi> it must stand open.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And therefore let none blame us: for the time is come about: that <hi>Moses putteth away his vaile from his Eyes,</hi> which he hung before his face when he spake with Israel: after the Lord had spoken with him: <hi>Moses</hi> desired to see it: in that he said, <hi>Lord if I have found grace in thy sight: let me see thy face</hi>; but the Lord would not; and said, <hi>thou shalt see my back part: for none can see my face.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. Now the Eye of God was in <hi>Moses,</hi> and in the <hi>Saints,</hi> they have seen and spoken in the Spirit of God, and yet had not the <hi>through-vision</hi> of the Spirituall birth in them, save <hi>at times</hi> onely: when God would worke wonders; as by <hi>Moses,</hi> when he did the wonders in Egypt: <hi>then</hi> the Divine Magick was open unto him: in manner and wise as in the Creation.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. And this was even the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Lucifer</hi>; that he would be a God of nature; and live in the <hi>transmutation</hi>: and this was even the Idolatry of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29914:27"/>
the <hi>heathens,</hi> in that they understood the Magicall birth they fell from the onely God unto the <hi>magicall birth</hi> of nature, and chose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselves <hi>Idolls</hi> out of the Powers of nature.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. For which cause the creation hath remained so obscure; and God hath covered his children in whom the true light shone, with <hi>tribulation</hi>; that they have not been manifest unto <hi>themselves,</hi> Seeing <hi>Adam</hi> also according to the same lust, did imagine to know and prove the Magick, and <hi>would be as God</hi>; so that God permitted him, that he defiled his heavenly Image with the vanity of nature; and made it wholly darke, and Earthly, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> also did with the Centre of nature; when he of an Angel became a Devill.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Therefore I will seriously warne the Reader, that he use the Magick <hi>aright: viz.</hi> in true faith and humility towards God: and not meddle with <hi>Turba Magna</hi> in a <hi>Magicall</hi> manner: unlesse it conduceth to the honour of God, and Salvation of mankinde.</p>
                           <p n="9">9 For we can say with truth: that the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> is yet a Creating: albeit it doth not create Stones, and earth; yet it Coagulateth formeth and worketh still in the same Property: All things are <hi>possible</hi> to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as it was possible for it in the beginning, to generate stones and Earth, also the Stars, and foure Elements, and <hi>did produce</hi> them, or worke them forth out of one onely ground; so it is, still, unto this day: by the strong Desire (which is the <hi>Magicall</hi> ground) All things may be effected, if man use nature aright, in its order to the worke.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. All Essences consist in the <hi>Seven Properties:</hi> now he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Essence; he is able by the same Spirit of that <hi>Essence,</hi> whence it is come to be an Essence, to change it into another forme, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to introduce it into <hi>another</hi> Essence; and so make of a Good thing an Evill, and of an Evill thing a Good.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. The <hi>Transmutation</hi> of all things must be effected by <note n="i" place="margin">Assimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> 
                              <hi>Simility: viz.</hi> by its owne native Propriety: for the <hi>Alienate</hi> is its Enemy: like as man must be regenerated againe by the divine Essentiality in the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; by the simility in his <hi>holinesse</hi> of the divine Essentiality, which he lost.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. And as the false <note n="k" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Magus</hi> or Magician.</note> 
                              <hi>Magist</hi> woundeth man through Inchantment with the Assimulate, and through the desire introduceth Evill into his Evill <hi>viz.</hi> into the Assimulate; and as the upright holy faith or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine desire</hi> also entreth into the Assimulate, and forfendeth man, so that the false desire takes no place.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. Thus all things consist in the <hi>Assimulate</hi>; Every thing may be introduced into its Assimulate, and if it comes into its Assimulate, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in its Property be it Good or Evill, and beginneth <hi>effectually</hi> to worke: as is to be seen both in Good and Evill.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. As for example: let a man take downe a little <hi>poyson:</hi> it will presently receive with great desire the poison in the body, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>rested</hi>; and therein strengthen it selfe, and begin to worke pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully; and corrupt and destroy the <hi>Contrary: viz.</hi> the Good: and that now which the Evill is able to doe in its property; that likewise the Good can doe in its property: when it is <hi>freed</hi> from the wrath, it may also introduce its Assimulate into the <hi>reall</hi> true <hi>joy.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="15">
                              <pb n="47" facs="tcp:29914:27"/>15. The Essence of this world consisteth in Evill and good: and the one cannot be without the other: but this is the greatest <hi>iniquity</hi> of this world; that the Evill overpowreth the Good; that the Anger is <hi>stronger</hi> therein then the Love; and this by reason of the <hi>Sin</hi> of the devill, and men; who have disturbed nature by the false desire, that it mightily and effectually worketh in the <hi>wrath</hi> as a poyson in the Body.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. Otherwise if nature in its formes did stand in the Property in Equall weight, and in equall <hi>Concord,</hi> and Harmony, then one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty were not manifest above the other: heat and cold would be equally poyzed in the operation, and qualification: and then <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi> would be still upon the Earth: and though it were not without man; yet it would be in man: if his properties were in equall weight [number and measure, if they did yet stand in the Temperature] then he were incorruptible and immortall.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. This is the <hi>Death,</hi> and misery of man and all creatures that the Properties are divided, and each aspiring in it selfe, and powerfully working, and acting in its <hi>own</hi> will: whence <hi>sicknesse</hi> and paine ariseth: and all this is hence arisen; when the one Element did manifest and put forth it selfe into foure properties: then each property desired the <hi>Assimulate viz.</hi> an Essence out of and according to its selfe; which the Astringent <hi>Fiat</hi> did impresse, and Coagulate; so that Earth and Stones were produced in the properties.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. But now we are to consider of the greatest Mystery of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward world between the <hi>Elements</hi> and the <hi>Astrum:</hi> the Elementall Spirit is severized from the Astrall Spirit, and yet not parted asunder, they dwell in each other as <hi>body</hi> and <hi>Soule:</hi> but the one is not the other: the Astrall Spirit make thits bodies as well as the Elementall, and that in all Creatures; in Animalls, and Vegetables.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. All things of this world have a <hi>twofold body viz.</hi> an Elementall from the fire aire water and Earth; and a Spirituall body from the <hi>Astrum</hi>: and likewise a <hi>twofold Spirit: viz.</hi> one Astrall the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. <hi>Man</hi> onely (among all the Earthly Creatures) hath a <hi>threefold body, and Spirit</hi>: for he hath also the internall Spirituall world in him; which is likewise twofold: <hi>viz.</hi> light, and darknesse; and also cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, and Spiritually: this Spirit is the <hi>Soule</hi>; but this body is from the <hi>water of the holy Element,</hi> which dyed in <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, disappeared as to his life, when the divine Power departed from him, and would not dwell in the awaked vanity.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. Which <hi>holy body must be regenerated, if his</hi> Spirit <hi>will see God</hi>; otherwise <hi>he cannot see him; except he be againe borne anew of</hi> the <hi>water</hi> of the holy Element <hi>in the Spirit</hi> of God (who hath manifested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in Christ with this same water-Source: that his disappeared bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may be made alive in the <hi>holy</hi> water and Spirit: else he hath no sense, nor sight in the holy life of God.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. This <hi>twofold outward body</hi> is now punctually to be pondered, and considered of, if we would understand nature: and without this understanding let none call himselfe a master [or <hi>Learned</hi>] for in these (bodies) the dominion of all externall creatures, and Essences is couched:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29914:28"/>
they oftentimes are <hi>contrary</hi> one unto another; whence Sicknesse, Corruption, and death ariseth in the body; that one <hi>severeth</hi> from the other.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. The <hi>Sydereall</hi> body is the highest excepting the <hi>divine</hi> in man: the <hi>Elementall</hi> body is onely its Servant or dwelling-house, as the foure Elements are onely a body or habitation of the dominion of the Stars.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. The Elementall Spirit, and body; is <hi>inanimate</hi> and void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: it hath onely Lust and desire in it: <hi>vegetation</hi> is its right life: for the aire hath no understanding without the <hi>Astrum</hi>; the <hi>Astrum</hi> giveth the distinct understanding of the knowledge of all Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences in the Elements.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. But the inward light, and power of the light, giveth in man the right <hi>divine understanding</hi>; but there is no right divine apprehension in the Sydereall Spirit: for the <hi>Astrum</hi> hath another Principle: the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereall body dwelleth in the Elementall; as the light-world in the darknesse: it is the true <hi>rationall life</hi> of all Creatures.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. The whole <hi>Astrum</hi> is nothing else but the externall expressed Word in the Sound: it is the instrument whereby the holy Eternall Speaking Word Speaketh and formeth externally: it is as a <hi>Great Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of unsearchable manifold Voices and Tunes, of all manner of instruments: which play, and melodize before the holy God.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. For they are meere Powers which enter into and mutually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace each other, whence ariseth the Sound in the Essence: and the desire <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fiat</hi> receiveth this Sound, and maketh it <hi>Substantiall:</hi> this Substance is a <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Stars: which the Elements receive into them: and Coagulate it in them, and hatch it, as an Hen her <hi>Eggs:</hi> whence the true rationall life is in the Elements: and thus also the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereall Spirit is hatched, and Coagulated in all Creatures.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. For the Male and Female, doe mutually cast a <hi>Seed</hi> into one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; which is onely a Sulphur of the <hi>Astrum</hi> and foure Elements, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it is hatched in the Matrix, and Coagulated to a <hi>living Spirit.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="29">29. And when the fire is enkindled in the Seed which is sowne in the Matrix: the Spirit severs it selfe againe from the body, as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate; as the light from the fire according to the right of the Eternall nature: and two become manifest in <hi>one, viz.</hi> a Spirituall body from the <hi>Astrum,</hi> and a fleshly body from the foure Elements.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. And this Sydereall Spirit is the <hi>Soule of the great world</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on <hi>Punctum Solis</hi>; and receiveth its light and life from it: as all the Stars doe take light, and power from the <hi>Sun</hi>; so likewise their Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. The <hi>Sun</hi> is the Centre of the <hi>Astrum:</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> the Centre of the foure Elements: they are to one another as spirit, and body: or as man and wife: albeit the <hi>Astrum</hi> hath another wife, where it hatcheth its Essence, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Moone,</hi> which is the wife of all the Stars; but especilly of the <hi>Sun</hi>; I meane it in the Essence of operation.</p>
                           <p n="32">32. Not that we meane, that the <hi>Astrum</hi> is wholly arisen from the <hi>Punctum</hi> of <hi>Sol,</hi> in that I call it the Centre of the Stars; it is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the Powers: the Cause that the Powers of the Stars doe Act in the <hi>Essence</hi>: it openeth their Powers, and giveth its Power into them;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29914:28"/>
as a <hi>heart</hi> of the Powers, and they mutually rejoyce in its <hi>Essence,</hi> that they are moved to act or desire, in its <hi>Essence.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="33">33. And even here lyeth the great Mystery of the <hi>Creation, viz.</hi> that the internall (<hi>viz.</hi> God.) hath thus manifested himselfe with his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Speaking Word (which he is himselfe) the externall is a <hi>Type</hi> of the internall: God is not alienate: <hi>in him all things live and move,</hi> each in its Principle, and degree.</p>

                           <head>CHAP. XII. Of the six dayes Workes of the Creation.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. THat <hi>God hath created Heaven and earth, and all things in six dayes,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> saith; is the greatest Mystery, wholly hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the <hi>externall Reason</hi>: there is neither night, Morning or Evening in the <hi>Deep</hi> above the Moone; but a Continuall Day from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of the outward world even to the End of the same.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And albeit the Creation was finished in such a time as in the length of <hi>six dayes:</hi> yet the dayes-workes have a far more Subtle [or abstruce] meaning: for the <hi>Seven Properties</hi> are also understood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; <hi>Six</hi> whereof belong to the Active Dominion to good and Evill; and the <hi>Seventh (viz.</hi> the Essence) is the <hi>rest:</hi> wherein the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties rest, which God hath expressed, and made visible.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. We have in the Dominion of the <hi>Planetick Orbe</hi> the figure, how the six properties of the Active life (which rest in the Seventh) have in six dayes introduced and manifested themselves out of the inward Spirituall world in an externall visible world of foure Elements: for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29914:29"/>
the Planetick Orbe hath its rise from the <hi>Punctum</hi> of <hi>Sol</hi>: for there was the <hi>Royall Place</hi> of the <hi>Hierarchies</hi>; of which the whole <hi>Circle</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Stars in the internall and externall) is a Member or <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. But seeing the <hi>Prince</hi> of the Hierarchies (when he sate in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Essence in the rest) did fall, and Aspired for the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Eternall</hi> nature; he was cast into the darknesse: and God by his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on created him another Prince out of this Place (but <hi>without</hi> divine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding) for a Ruler of the <hi>Essence</hi>; and that is the Sun.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. From this Place proceeded in the Divine Motion the Seven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of nature: (understand the <hi>Planets</hi>) which governe the Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Beeing in Good and Evill (in which [Essence] <hi>Lucifer</hi> sate, and whence he was cast) and lost his Dominion in the Essence; and as the Seven Properties have their Dominion in the <hi>beginning of Each day</hi> in the weeke: even so were the six dayes-workes of the Creation.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. For <hi>Lucifer</hi> forsooke the <hi>Rest</hi> of his Hierarchies, and entred into the Eternall disquietnesse: now <hi>God hath created all things</hi> of this world in <hi>six dayes and rested on the Seventh day</hi> from the Creation, which is <note n="n" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Dies Saturni vel Sabbathi.</hi>
                              </note> 
                              <hi>Saturday</hi> according to the Scripture, that is, from the day of Rest, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand from the <hi>Eternall day</hi> of Rest he hath moved himselfe to the Creation; and in the first forme of nature he began the <hi>first</hi> day: that is; he hath brought it forth out of the <hi>Impression</hi>; and moved himself with his Word: this was the most inward motion according to the Speaking Word of Power.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Then began in the expressed Word <hi>Sunday,</hi> that is the <hi>Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall Day,</hi> where the Powers did mutually worke in each other in great holinesse and glory; for on Sunday the Enkindled <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Salniter</hi> of the Earthly Property was created out of the great deep of the whole Hierarchie, out of the Spirituall worlds into a <note n="o" place="margin">Or Lump.</note> Masse (which is the <hi>Terrestriall Globe</hi>) and put forth out of the Austere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the first forme of Nature.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Even then began the <hi>first houre of the first day:</hi> and the Power of Nature did mutually rule in great joy in the expressed Word; out of which Power of joy the <hi>Sun</hi> was created on the <hi>fourth day</hi> in the Princely Place: so that this Power whereout the Sun was created, <hi>ruled</hi> the <hi>first houre</hi> of the beginning of the world; and so it began its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, which continueth even unto the <hi>End</hi> of the world: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun ruleth the first houre on Sunday; and the day is <hi>rightly</hi> so called.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. The words of <hi>Moses</hi> concerning the Creation are exceeding clear; yet unapprehensive to reason: for he writeth thus: <hi>In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 
                              <hi>and the Earth was desolate and voide: and it was darke upon the deep; and the Spirit of God moved upon the water, and God said let there be light, and there was light: and God saw that the light was good: and God Severed the light from the darknesse; and called the light Day; and the Darknesse Night: and</hi> 
                              <note n="p" place="margin">The Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Morning were the first day.</note> 
                              <hi>out of the Evening and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was the first Day.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="10">10. The whole Understanding is coucht in these words: for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is the first motion: which came to passe when Prince <hi>Michael</hi> fought with the <hi>Dragon</hi>; when he was spewed out with the Creation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29914:29"/>
of the Earth: for even then the Enkindled Essence (which with the Enkindling did Coagulate it selfe into Earth and stones) was <hi>cast out</hi> of the internall into the externall.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. And he, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dragon fell from Heaven (viz.</hi> out of the holy world) upon the wrath of the Earth <hi>as lightning:</hi> as it is written: <hi>I Saw Sathan fall from Heaven as lightning</hi> saith Christ: moreover it was <hi>wholly darke</hi> in the deep above the Earth: and the Austere enkindled wrath was manifest: for Hell was prepared for him, whereinto he fell <hi>viz.</hi> into the Great darknesse of the first Principle, wherein he liveth.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Here now lyeth the <hi>vaile</hi> before Reason, that it cannot looke into the eyes of <hi>Moses</hi> for he saith: <hi>and the Earth was desolate and voide:</hi> yea Desolate indeed; had not the Spirit of <hi>God moved upon the</hi> internall <hi>water</hi> (which was amassed with the <hi>Fiat</hi> in the Heaven) and had not God said, <hi>let there be light:</hi> the Earth should have been yet Desolate, and void.</p>

                              <p n="13">13. WIth the Word, when God said, <hi>Let it be light</hi>; the Essence of the <hi>Ens</hi> did powerfully move it selfe in the lights Property, not onely in the Earth but also in the whole <hi>Deep</hi>: <note n="p" place="margin">Out of which Power or vertue in the lights Property.</note> whence on the fourth day the <hi>Sun</hi> was created, that is, enkindled in its Place; and in this word <note n="q" place="margin">
                                    <hi>Germ. Schuff.</hi>
                                 </note> 
                                 <hi>Fiat</hi> the Earths Masse, and also the very Power which is called heaven, Amassed it selfe in the Essence all which before was onely a <hi>Spirit,</hi> a Spirituall Essence.</p>
                              <p n="14">14. And with the Speaking, as God spake; <hi>let it be light:</hi> the holy Power, which was amassed in the wrath; moved it selfe: and became light in the same Essence, in the Power; and with this comming to be light: the <hi>devills</hi> might and strength was wholly withdrawn from him in the Essence, for heere the light shone in the now anew awakened Power, in the darknesse; <note n="r" place="margin">Light.</note> which the Prince of wrath could not <note n="s" place="margin">Receive or perceive.</note> comprehend; it was also of no benefit to him, for it was the light of nature, which is <hi>uselesse</hi> to him.</p>
                              <p n="15">15. And <hi>Moses</hi> said: <hi>God severed the light from the darknesse</hi>; which is thus to be understood; the darkenesse remained in the wrathfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, not onely in the Earth but also in the whole <hi>Deep:</hi> but in the lights Essence the light of nature did arise [or spring forth] from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>quintessence,</hi> whence the <hi>Astrum</hi> was created; which Essence is Every where <hi>in</hi> the Earth, <hi>and above</hi> the Earth.</p>
                              <p n="16">16. Thus the darknesse remained in the wraths Property in the Essence of the Earth, and also in the whole deep of this world, and the naturall [light] remained in the lights essence, as a working life; through which, the <hi>holy Element</hi> did operate, and worke; in which Operation, <hi>Paradise</hi> 
                                 <note n="t" place="margin">Sprang.</note> budded through the Earth, and beare fruit untill the <hi>Curse</hi> of God, and then the holy bloomings or growth, ceased, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Element remained as an <hi>inward heaven</hi> stedfast, retired in it selfe; and yet it doth diffuse its Power through the light of nature, yet not so powerfully as in the beginning, for the <hi>Curse</hi> is the cause of its with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing; indeed there is no totall departing; but yet it is nothing so now as before the Sin of the Second created <hi>Prince, Adam.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="17">
                                 <pb n="52" facs="tcp:29914:30"/>17. Thus in the first motion of the <hi>Verbum Fiat,</hi> the Heaven (that is, the Circle, so far as the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> reached it selfe forth to the Creation) was Amassed, or enclosed; and the Earth was amassed with the <hi>Verbum Fiat,</hi> and created to the Planetick Orbe; Thus by the Separation, <hi>viz.</hi> of the light and darknesse; and by the <hi>expelling</hi> of Prince <hi>Lucifer,</hi> we are to understand the Creation of the <hi>first</hi> day.</p>
                              <p n="18">18. Now the first day with the manifested word did <hi>convey</hi> it selfe through the other five dayes-workes even into the day of <hi>Rest</hi>; where the beginning entreth againe into the End; and the End againe into the beginning; for the first <hi>motion</hi> of the word (where the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath enkindled it selfe in the Essence) is the joy of the <hi>Creation,</hi> or Creature; which did open it selfe with the other dayes through all the Properties of nature; where <hi>each</hi> Property may be called a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: for it hath and bringeth also its Peculiar operation and efficacy along in it selfe into the <note n="u" place="margin">Understand into the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties or dayes.</note> rest, and each day one Property did move and manifest it selfe; wherein a Peculiar Sundry worke was manifested, and <hi>revealed.</hi>

                              <p n="19">19. THe <hi>Second day</hi> we call <hi>Munday,</hi> and therefore, because the Moone <hi>ruleth</hi> the <hi>first houre</hi> of the day: and it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the ancient <note n="x" place="margin">Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</note> wise men have understood somewhat thereof in the light of nature, which they have kept <hi>Secret</hi> and mysticall, rather deciphering it by figures then clearly explaining it: and it is to be seen in the <hi>Names</hi> of the seven Planets, that they have for certaine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the same: in that they have given them names according to the <hi>Seven</hi> Properties of Nature; which doe so wholly agree and accord, as well with the Creation as Nature, that me thinks they have <hi>in part</hi> understood the ground of the Creation aright, seeing the names of the Planets have their rise and derivation so fully, and punctually out of the <hi>language of Nature:</hi> but the reason why it hath not been made clear plaine, and manifest is (as before mentioned) because of the <hi>false</hi> Magick that it might remaine hidden unto the Artists of <hi>jugling</hi> and Collusion in nature, by reason of the Great Abuse; wherefore we also shall still let it so remaine, and yet hint <hi>enough</hi> to the understanding of our school-fellowes.</p>
                              <p n="20">20. Now of the Second day <hi>Moses</hi> writeth thus: <hi>and God said let there be a firmament between the waters:</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</note> 
                                 <hi>and let it divide betweene the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: then God made the firmament; and divided the water under the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the water above the firmament; and it was so; and God called the firmament heaven, and out of the Evening and morning was the Second day.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="21">21. <hi>Moses</hi> saith; that <hi>out of the Evening and morning was the Second day</hi>; that is; out of the manifestation of the first, the Second manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station proceeded and brake forth; and saith further; that <hi>on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day God created the firmament of Heaven: and Separated the waters; the water under the firmament from the water above the firmament</hi>; heere now lieth the hidden vaile, wherein we have hitherto been pointed and directed unto, a heaven <hi>Scituate</hi> a far off above the Stars without the place of this world: so very blinde is Reason as to God that it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29914:30"/>
nothing of him; and doth not consider, that the Scripture saith of God: <hi>am not I he, which filleth all things:</hi> and that <hi>time and place cannot divide him:</hi> much lesse is it understood what <hi>the water above the firmament</hi> is which they will flatly hold to be a place afar distant, <hi>viz.</hi> above the Stars, whither also, we have been shewn into heaven.</p>
                              <p n="22">22. But seeing that God out of <hi>Grace</hi> doth bestow upon us the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; therefore we will set it downe for our fellow-schollars who are able to apprehend it; and yet herein we shall write nothing for the <hi>Selfish</hi> wiselings of outward <hi>Reason</hi>: for they have it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the eyes of their reason, and they cannot misse: they can judge all things: what the Spirit of God <hi>revealeth,</hi> that must be a <hi>Heresy</hi> unto them, albeit they doe not understand it: so that they remaine without, and doe not so much as once know God.</p>
                              <p n="23">23. <hi>The Firmament</hi> is the Gulfe betweene time and Eternity: but that God calleth it <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>maketh a division of the waters</hi>; gives us to understand, that the heaven is in the world and the world is not in heaven.</p>
                              <p n="24">24. <hi>The water above the firmament</hi> is in heaven and <hi>the water under the firmament</hi> is the externall Materiall water.</p>
                              <p n="25">25. Heere we must understand the difference between the holy and the outward water: the water above the firmament is <hi>Spirituall</hi> in the birth of the holy Element; and the water under the firmament is <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> for it is apprehended in the Darke Impression, the <hi>Curse</hi> and the <hi>Awaked vanity</hi> is therein, and yet one water is not without the other.</p>
                              <p n="26">26. When I looke upon the externall water then I must also say, heere is also the water above the firmament in the water under the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament: but <hi>the firmament</hi> is the <hi>middle,</hi> and the gulfe therein between time and Eternity; so that they are distinct; and I see with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall eyes of this world <hi>onely the water under the firmament:</hi> but the water above the firmament, is that, which God hath appointed in Christ to the <hi>Baptisme</hi> of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> after that the word of the divine Power had moved it selfe therein.</p>
                              <p n="27">27. Now the outward water is the <hi>instrument</hi> of, the inward; and the inward water is understood [therein]; for the moving Spirit in the word is hee which <hi>ruleth</hi> the inward water in the <hi>Baptisme:</hi> deare Christians; let this be spoken to you: it is the <hi>reall</hi> ground.</p>
                              <p n="28">28. But that <hi>Moses</hi> saith, God created the firmament, and <hi>called it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; is the most intimate Secret, of which the earthly man is <hi>not</hi> able to understand any thing: the understanding is barely in the <hi>Power</hi> of the water above the firmament, <hi>viz. in the Heaven,</hi> or (as I might set it down) in the Spirit of God; if he be awaked in man in the water above the firmament, which disappeared in <hi>Adam,</hi> as to his life; that [man] seeth through all; otherwise there is <hi>no</hi> understanding heere; but all is dumb, and dead.</p>
                              <p n="29">29. The <hi>creating of the heaven</hi> is understood, first how the <hi>Speaking</hi> Word hath <note n="y" place="margin">Conceived or formed.</note> amassed the manifested Powers of the Spirituall world, wherein it is manifest, worketh, and also ruleth: secondly, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the <hi>manifested</hi> Powers of the externall world, which the Spirit hath amassed into the Essence of foure Elements, and closed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the externall <hi>firmament:</hi> that the Devill, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prince of Anger
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29914:31"/>
cannot reach them; by which he would worke with the internall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: so that the Powers of Eternity doe worke through the Powers of time, as the <hi>Sun</hi> illustrates the water, and the water comprehends it not, but feeles it onely; or as a <hi>fire</hi> doth through-heat an iron, and the iron remaineth iron: so likewise the outward heaven is passive, and the inward worketh through it, and draweth forth an externall <hi>fruit</hi> out of the outward; whereas yet the inward heaven lieth hidden therein in the <hi>Firmament</hi>: as God is hidden in the Time.</p>

IN the Originall of the Eternall nature, which is an <hi>Eternall Originall,</hi> the manifestation of the six dayes workes is very clearly to be found; how the Eternall Word hath unfolded them out of the <hi>invisible</hi> spirituall [Property] and brought them into the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:</hi> also the forme thereof is to be found in the Planetick Orbe, if any hath skill to apprehend it.</p>
                              <p n="33">33. For in the Eternall natures birth there is an Eternall day; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God hath manifested, and made visible in <hi>six</hi>

                              <p n="34">34. And we are to understand nothing else by the Creation; save that the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> hath amassed the Spirituall birth, and introduced it into a visible externall dominion, and Essence: for we see it very clearly in the <hi>writings</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi>; albeit <hi>we have</hi> a glasse <hi>besides</hi> to see: that when God the first day had created the Grosse part into a <note n="d" place="margin">Lump or <hi>Chaos.</hi>

                              <p n="35">35. Now the third accomplishment of the third dayes worke, is the moving growing life, in which on the first day the light of nature did shine in the Essence of the <hi>Ens</hi> after an externall manner: it shone likewise now through the Second day, <hi>viz.</hi> through the <hi>water</hi> and the <hi>heaven:</hi> and in this shining light the expressed Word did move it self in the Essence, and wrought effectually; and even then the power of the expressed Word from the light of the inward nature did <hi>pullulate,</hi> and spring forth, through the externall nature out of the heaven through the <hi>earth:</hi> [and so] now the Potentate who was a King and great Prince hath lost his Domination; for the Essence of the <hi>wrath</hi> was captivated in the light of nature and he with it: and so he lyeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween time and Eternity, <hi>imprisoned</hi> in the darknesse, untill the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>

In the third dayes worke the <hi>Sulphureous, Mercuriall,</hi> and <hi>Saltish</hi> life out of the Centre, was opened out of the Anguish in the outward worlds Property; and yet there is no anguish to be understood untill the fire, but onely a <hi>sencelesse</hi> forth-driving life, <hi>viz.</hi> a growth: for the fire-blaze ariseth out of the anguish, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the <hi>third forme</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and this is the <hi>Salnitrall Flagrat,</hi> which Severizeth the Powers in the Properties, which was moved in the <hi>third</hi> dayes worke, where the Properties opened themselves, and were mutually unfolded in the <hi>Salnitrall Flagrat,</hi> each out of it selfe; which the Impression did againe receive into it selfe, and made them <hi>Corporeall</hi> in the water; and thence arose and proceeded trees, hearbs and grasse: each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty became <note n="g" place="margin">Or putting or budding forth.</note> excressive in the <hi>Salniter,</hi> and did manifest it selfe with fruit: as we see plainely, how the <hi>Property</hi> of the darke world did mightily force it selfe along in the outward Power: whereupon some hearbs and plants are so <hi>venemous</hi> and malignant; for the Earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of both the inward worlds into a Compaction.</p>
                              <p n="37">37.

                              <p n="38">38. In the third dayes worke, God moved the third Property of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sulphrous Source, in which the <hi>fire</hi> Enkindled, and in the fire <hi>Flagrat</hi> is the division of the powers; where each Property became manifest in it selfe: now when God said, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth grasse hearb, and trees:</hi> that is nothing else, but that when he moved the expressed Word of the Powers in the properties, the properties found and felt the light of nature in them; whereupon they became <hi>hungry,</hi> and were impressed, that is, amassed and Compacted or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated: now when as the light of nature found it selfe in a <hi>Perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and the nature did feele it selfe in the sweet light; thereby arose in the Coagulation the dominion of <hi>joy, viz.</hi> the pullulation and growth: for all growth consisteth in the light, and water, when the

                           <p n="1">1. THe <hi>fourth day Mercurius</hi> hath the <hi>first houre</hi> of the day, who causeth the <hi>Sensitive</hi> life: heere we understand very fully and exactly the ground of the manifestation of the inward nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the externall: for on the fourth day the <hi>Sun and Stars</hi> were created, which are the right Mercuriall life: heere the fires property opened it selfe in the <hi>Sulphrous</hi> Source through the water, and the fift Essence became manifest through the light of nature, which is a <hi>Mercurius Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitri,</hi> an incentive <hi>Mercurius,</hi> a quick perceptive <hi>Mercurius.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. In the third forme of nature there is a Sencelesse life in <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercurius,</hi> but in the <hi>fourth</hi> there is a <hi>feeling</hi> life: for the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are made painefull in the fire: and in the <hi>oleous</hi> [life] they become meeke pleasant and full of joy: therefore now the motion in the oyly is feeling from the painefullnesse.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Heere we now understand very fundamentally how the <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the fire of the Eternall nature hath manifested it selfe in the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the outward world, with forme, and <hi>shape:</hi> for in the Enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the fire in the <hi>Salnitrall Flagrat, two</hi> Essences doe Severize, <hi>viz. one</hi> watry from the Devoration in the fire: where the fire devoureth the rough harsh Source of the Impression in it selfe; then out of the Consuming there proceedeth a great <hi>Meeknesse,</hi> which is mortified to the fire, and is unsensible, and giveth the water-Source.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly</hi> the fire-Source doth sever it selfe likewise into its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>viz.</hi> the properties to the fire-Source, (which now with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling of the fire are full of paine and sence); this <hi>fire-Source</hi> could not subsist, unlesse it did againe devoure [or take] the water into it selfe, whereby it doth strengthen it selfe: whence also the <hi>Salnitrall Flagrat</hi> ariseth, where the <hi>wrath</hi> is dismayed at the Essence of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>meeknesse</hi>; whence the feeling, so also the <hi>Lustre</hi> of the fire ariseth.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. For that water which is devoured in the fire is dissolved into a <hi>Spirituall oyle,</hi> in which the fire shineth; and out of the oyle proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Aire, viz.</hi> the moving Spirit of the fire which is motive in the fire.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The Aire is nothing else, but the <hi>moving life,</hi> where the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Word doth diffuse it selfe in the water-Source through nature,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29914:32"/>
through the powers of nature, through the fire, in the <hi>oyle</hi> of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>light:</hi> it is the fires life: but it is mortified to the fire, and yet it is made manifest by the fire; it is the <hi>life</hi> of nature according to the property of meeknesse.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Thus <note n="h" place="margin">Or by, or with.</note> in the enkindling of the fire in the <hi>light</hi> of the fire, which is the light of nature, <hi>foure</hi> Properties are to be understood, <hi>viz.</hi> a fiery, an airy, and an oyly wherein the light is manifest, and a watry; all which, doe originally spring forth out of the <hi>first desire</hi> to nature; in that the free <hi>Lubet</hi> introduceth it selfe into a desire, and nature: and they all <hi>display</hi> themselves through the fire into a moving life; and yet there is <hi>no intellective</hi> life, but onely Properties to the true life: the <hi>intellectuall</hi> life is the <hi>Spirated Word</hi> which manifesteth it selfe through the properties: these properties are impressed in the CreaT; that is, in the <hi>Verbum Fiat,</hi> and brought into an Essentiality; wherefrom is come a <hi>Sulphur Salnitri,</hi> that is; a Magicall <hi>Astrum,</hi> in manner and mode as the <hi>Minde</hi> of man is; which also hath thence its Reall Originall.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. This Salnitrall and Sulphureous property, was brought forth out of the third dayes worke, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the fire-<hi>flagrat</hi>; and thence the <hi>fourth</hi> motion is arisen, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mercuriall, which the <hi>Fiat</hi> hath amassed, and impressed it into it, and made it visible, which are the <hi>Starres</hi>; which are nothing else but properties of the powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatsoever narure is in a little Sparke in it selfe, that the whole <hi>Astrum</hi> is in its Circle; and what nature is in its hiddennesse, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretnesse, the same the <hi>Astrum</hi> is, in an open working life: under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it thus.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Each Star hath the property of all Stars in it but <hi>hidden</hi> in nature, and it is manifest onely in <hi>one sole</hi> Property: else, if the whole nature were manifest in each thing, then all things, and Essences would be <hi>but one thing</hi> and Essence: and therefore God hath by his Speaking Word moved the <hi>Sulphur Salnitri</hi> according to the properties, that the <hi>distinct</hi> Severation might be manifest: and this manifestation is a <hi>Mercurius</hi>; for the the Eternall Speaking Word, which is called God, hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested his voice or will, through nature.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Therefore the whole <hi>Astrum</hi> is a pronounced voice (or breathed tone) of the Powers, an expressed Word, which doth againe give forth from it selfe its spiration and speaking out of the Properties; it is an <hi>Eccho</hi> out of Gods Love and Anger; out of the darke and light world.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. <note n="i" place="margin">Next the Stars.</note> After the <hi>Astrum</hi> are the <hi>foure Elements,</hi> which also have their Originall out of this fountaine: which also, have their mutuall <hi>Spira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> [or outbreathing]: they also speake forth their properties out of themselves, and they are as a <hi>Body</hi> of the Stars: for they speake, or breath forth from themselves, a <hi>corporeall</hi> Essence; and the Stars doe breath forth a <hi>Spirituall</hi> Essence: and this twofold Essence ruleth mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in the visible world, as body, and Soule.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. And we give you this rightly to understand, in each Element there lieth a <hi>whole Astrum,</hi> the fire hath a whole <hi>Astrum</hi> in it, and also the aire, wrter, and earth: but it is <hi>not</hi> manifest in them: therefore God hath enclosed [or encircled] the <hi>Place</hi> of this world with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29914:33"/>
                              <hi>Astrum</hi>: that it might enkindle the other <hi>Astrum</hi> in the foure Elements, that the manifest <hi>Astrum</hi> might worke in the hidden Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Astrum</hi> of the foure Elements, and procreate <hi>wonders</hi>; for so a wonderfull figure and Property may be produced out of a thing, which otherwise is impossible for nature to doe, in its owne [naked] Selfe.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. Also we are to know that there is an <hi>Astrum</hi> in the <hi>divine</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick; which is the fountaine of the Eternall Minde of the Abysse, whence nature, and all Essences are arisen: likewise there is an <hi>Astrum</hi> in the manifest <hi>heavenly</hi> world, and also an <hi>Astrum</hi> in the darke <hi>hellish</hi> world: and these <note n="k" place="margin">Or Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</note> 
                              <hi>Astrums</hi> are but <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>Astrum,</hi> but they are Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verized into distinct degrees and <hi>Principles</hi>; that which is in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward world open and manifest in the <hi>Figure</hi>; the same is manifest in <hi>Power</hi> in the Spirituall world, and <hi>not</hi> in formes.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. And we understand; that the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> on the fourth day moved the <hi>fourth</hi> Property of nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the fift Essence, and opened it out of the Sulphureous property out of the fire-<hi>flagrat, viz.</hi> out of the third Property: and thus an <hi>Astrum</hi> became manifest in the Aire which are <hi>the visible Stars</hi>: and an <hi>Astrum</hi> in the fire, which is the <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall life</hi> of all Creatures: and an <hi>Astrum</hi> in the water, which is the <hi>vegetative life:</hi> and an <hi>Astrum</hi> in the Earth, which is the <hi>wrathfull Earthly life.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="15">15. The Fiery, [<hi>viz. Astrum,</hi>] giveth Soule; and the aiery, Spirit; the watry, affordeth the mansion of the soule and the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> bloud; wherein the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the fire and light dwelleth; and the Earthly, giveth flesh: and every of the foure <hi>Astrums,</hi> giveth a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>body</hi> according to its Property: onely God hath thus associated one unto another, that the one might be manifest in the other, and be joyntly together one body: like as all the foure Elements are onely <hi>one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> but they divide themselves into foure Properties according to the <hi>Centre</hi> of nature.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. These foure<note n="l" place="margin">Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                              <hi>Astrums</hi> doe procreate out of themselves their <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, viz.</hi> the outward nature, that is, the Soule of the outward world, as a constantly enduring Minde; wherein lieth the Omnipotency, as a manifest great <hi>Mystery</hi>: in this Officer God hath awakened and raised a <hi>King,</hi> or as I might set it down by way of Similitude a nature-God with <hi>six Counsellers,</hi> which are his assistants: that is, the <hi>Sun</hi> with the other <hi>six Planetick Stars,</hi> which were spoken forth out of the seven Properties out of the place of <hi>Sol</hi>; and in the Speaking were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a rouling <hi>Sphear</hi> according to the Property of the Eternall Generation in the Centre of nature: and this was opened in <hi>seven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> out of the birth; where the first degree of the motion in the light of nature, (from the inward Spirituall fire and light world) was the <hi>Sun,</hi> which receiveth its Lustre from the Tincture of the inward fire and light world: it standeth as an opened <hi>Punctum</hi> to the fire-world.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. And with the Spiration, the sixfold life of the six degrees of the dayes-workes and formes of the Centre, came forth externally and Severized it selfe, after the kinde and nature of the eternall birth: as first, <hi>Venus</hi> which is the water-Source out of the meeknesse out of the mortification in the fire, which is a desire of <hi>meeknesse</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. NOw when God had Opened the <hi>Astrum,</hi> and foure Elements as a moving life, wherein the Superiour <hi>Astrum</hi> gave the distinction in the moving life and actuated the <hi>foure Astrums</hi> in the foure Elements; then he Educed out of the Essence of all the <hi>Astrums,</hi> and Elements (through the motion of his Speaking Word in the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Fiat,</hi> the Impresse, or expresse; as the Power of that same life, which was free from the paine, and amassed it through the <hi>Verbum Fiat,</hi> and spake forth that same life (by the holy Eternall Speaking Word through the <hi>Fiat</hi>) into formes and shapes, according to the properties of the <hi>Astrums</hi> in the Spirituall <hi>Corpus,</hi> in which the <hi>Fiat,</hi> or the desire attracted the Elements according to the outward Essence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it selfe, as a body.</p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <pb n="60" facs="tcp:29914:34"/>2. And thence were <hi>creatures</hi> produced in all the foure Elements; in each <hi>Astrum</hi> according to its Property: as <hi>birds</hi> in the <hi>Astrum</hi> of the Aire: <hi>fishes</hi> in the <hi>Astrum</hi> of the water: cattle and foure-footed <hi>beasts</hi> out of the <hi>Astrum</hi> of the earth, and foure Elements: so likewise <hi>Spirits</hi> in the fire-<hi>Astrum,</hi> which also is in the other Elements: and we see very exactly in the difference of the creatures that the degrees of the <hi>Astrum</hi> [or constellations] are so distinct, and various: for the <hi>wormes</hi> of the Earth live in the third degree, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>fire-flagrat,</hi> in the <hi>Sulphur, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> in the life devoid of understanding; and whereas they have an understanding [or instinct] by the enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Superiour <hi>Astrum,</hi> in which third degree in the property, also grass, hearbs, and trees doe stand, and yet they receive assisting influence from the <hi>Superiour [Astrum]</hi> in the Enkindling, by which they are otherwise qualifyed.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And we see, that each kinde hath a Spirit and body according to the <hi>Degree</hi> of its <hi>Astrum</hi>; for we understand, that out of one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation [or <hi>Astrum</hi>] many kindes of creatures doe proceed: the cause whereof is, that each <hi>Astrum</hi> hath againe its <hi>degrees</hi> in it: for there is in each <hi>Astrum,</hi> whatsoever all the <hi>Astra</hi> have; but yet in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry distinct degrees in the manifestation; and therefore the <hi>Properties</hi> in each <hi>Astrum</hi> are manifold: so also divers sorts of creatures are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from each <hi>Astrum,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of each kinde is from the <hi>Astrum,</hi> but all kindes must use the foure Elements; for they arise out of that fountaine whence all the <hi>Astra</hi> doe originally proceed:</p>
                           <p n="4">4. On the <hi>fift</hi> day <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath the dominion the <hi>first houre</hi> of the day among the <hi>Planets</hi>: and that, because he hath his Originall in the Creation of the <hi>Astrum</hi> out of the <hi>fift Degree</hi> of nature, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the power of the Sulphureous and Salnitrall oyle, and that on the fift day, this joviall property was opened and educed, out of the fourth dayes property<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a <hi>pleasant</hi> powerfull <hi>life,</hi> out of all the Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: unto which life God created all Creatures (except man) each out of the property of his Constellation; out of his Degree; so that they might all live in the <hi>Soule</hi> of the outward nature, and be under the Government of <hi>one Officer</hi>; which is the outward Constellation wherein the <hi>Sun</hi> is chiefe Regent.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Each Constellation hath its Compaction of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi>: the <hi>Sulphur</hi> giueth <hi>Essence,</hi> and <hi>Mercurius</hi> give <hi>Spirit</hi> into the Essence: and from both these <hi>Sal</hi> is generated, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the sharp <hi>Fiat</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the property of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi>: and out of these three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, <hi>viz.</hi> out of <hi>Sulphur Mercurius</hi> and <hi>Sal</hi> all creatures entred into a life and creaturall beeing: and now such as the Sulphur was on each place in every <hi>Punctum</hi> in the property, as was taken or conceived in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> in the motion of the fift Property, in all the Elements; even such a creature was opened or brought forth, as the Compaction was Coagulated in each <hi>Punctum:</hi> and so each Kinde had its Spirit and Seed in it, to generate, and bring forth againe.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The two <hi>Sexes, viz.</hi> the male and its female arise from the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the watry and fiery Tincture in Sulphur: for the Separation was in the <hi>Verbum Fiat:</hi> where, out of one Sulphur in one onely <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> two Sexes came forth out of one Essence, <hi>viz.</hi> the fiery property
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29914:34"/>
in it selfe to a <hi>male,</hi> and the lights or waters property, to a <hi>female,</hi> where then both tinctures severed.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. And as we see, that the fire cannot burne without the water, and the water were a <hi>nothing</hi> without the fire, and they mutually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get one another, and also doe againe vehemently desire each other; and their right life consisteth in their <hi>conjunction</hi> in that they have produced each other and afterwards doe enter into, and mutually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, each other as <hi>one</hi>; where also they are againe changed in the fire into <hi>one:</hi> and yet doe againe proceed forth from the fire in one <hi>Essence, viz.</hi> in an oleous Property, in which they stand in the bond of the highest Love-desire; for their light shineth in the oyle: and as the fire-world <hi>desireth</hi> the light-world and the light world the fire-world, as Father and Son: the like also is to be understood of the <hi>two Sexes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">8. The <hi>Female</hi> is from the <hi>male</hi>; as the tincture of the light and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is from the fire: and they joyntly belong together in nature as <hi>one:</hi> thus the one may not be without the other, and they have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ardent Longing after each other for the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the light, <hi>viz. Venus Tincture</hi> desireth the fires-<hi>tincture</hi> and the fire the lights, as its <note n="*" place="margin">Meekning.</note> pleasing delight.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. For <hi>Venus</hi> giveth Essence, and the fire taketh the Essence to its life, and yeeldeth out of the received Essence the <hi>light</hi>; and in the fiery light the <hi>oyle,</hi> and out of the oyle againe the <hi>water</hi> and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and hence it is that all creatures doe desire copulation each with its owne kinde; and so they doe generate a third, <hi>viz.</hi> an Assimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late according to two in one: every <hi>Ens</hi> brings forth a Similitude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it selfe.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. And we see very clearly that each Kinde is created out of a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry <hi>Ens,</hi> each out of a different degree: and how each kinde liveth in its mother whence it hath taken its Originall; and that it cannot live in another Degree: as the <hi>Beasts</hi> upon the earth; which are a <hi>limus</hi> of the earth and aire: therein they live; and thence they take their food and nourishment; for the <hi>Fiat</hi> extracted them out of the Earths Property and amassed them in the fift manifestation of the Essence as a Sulphur of the <hi>fift Ens</hi>; whereon the <hi>foure</hi> depend.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. The <hi>Birds</hi> were created in the Sulphur of the aire, therefore they flye in their mother: also the <hi>fishes</hi> in the Sulphur of the water: and the <hi>wormes</hi> in the Sulphur of the Earth: thus each thing liveth in its mother whence it was taken in the beginning, and the contrary is its death.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. And the Essence, and life of this time is nothing else, but a <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the inward Spirituall world; what the possibility of Eternity hath in it, and what kinde of spirituall play is in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the inward spirituall world, accordingly it came forth into a creaturall beeing, out of good and evill, into a Time, and that through the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Motion.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="13">13. And hereby the Kingdome and Dominion of the Prince of the <hi>place</hi> of this world was taken from him, for the <hi>Ens</hi> hath introduced it selfe into another Principle, wherein he <hi>cannot</hi> be; for he was not made a creature in this Principle, and he hath no life therein, save

onely in the property of the awakened wrath in the <hi>Vanity.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. THe Sixt day in the Creation is <hi>Friday,</hi> on which <hi>Venus</hi> rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>first houre</hi> of the day; which doth rightly signifie unto us the order of the degrees, how the Eterall-speaking Word hath manifested it selfe with nature, through the time; how the <hi>Spirit</hi> hath brought forth the six Properties of nature into <hi>six degrees</hi> or dayes, into a working life, and yet hath introduced them all againe into the <hi>Seventh, viz.</hi> into the <hi>Rest,</hi> or into the mansion, wherein they should worke; denoting, that all whatsoever they should worke manifest and produce out of the wonders of the Eternall wisdome, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter into the <hi>one, viz.</hi> into the Rest; which is the Seventh Property; <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>house</hi> of the working life, wherein it should stand as a <hi>figure</hi> to the Contemplation of the Great Glory of God.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Now when God had educed the five dayes of nature through five properties or degrees, into five Constellations, (all which are <hi>not</hi> indeed <hi>Constellations,</hi> but a fountaine of an Astrall Property) <hi>viz.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Sundry Peculiar heaven; as it might be given and expressed to the understanding: then he did on the <hi>Sixt</hi> day educe out of the <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall</hi> property, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the fift Constellation, the sixt, <hi>viz.</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the Joviall Power, the fiery Love-desire; wherewith the ruleth through <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Constellations:</hi> whence it is, that each life doth long after its likenesse; that is, it againe desireth such a creature as each life hath in it.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Each life desireth, in this <hi>Venus</hi> Property, to generate againe, such a creature as it is in it selfe: hence ariseth the strong ardent imagination and fiery <hi>desire,</hi> that the properties doe againe desire into <hi>one, viz.</hi> into the fountaine whence they proceeded; for in the same they may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate the Assimulate of themselves.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Now when God had educed this fiery Love-desire out of the Centre through all the properties, then nature was now desirous (in this Love-property) of the likenesse of God, <hi>viz.</hi> a Similitude accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and in the <hi>Generation</hi> of the holy Love-desire; that so this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Constellation of the Love-desire, might also be <hi>creaturized,</hi> and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurized.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. And being this Love-desire was Educed out of all the properties of nature and the heavens, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the <hi>Verbum Fiat:</hi> wherein all the Creatures lay from <hi>Eternity</hi> in a Mystery; and introduced into a Separation, <hi>viz.</hi> into a sundry distinct Degree: therefore now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty longed to be an <hi>Image</hi> of all degrees and properties: <hi>viz.</hi> a living rationall and <hi>understanding</hi> Image, according to the manifestation of this manifested property.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Now said the Speaking Word in the <hi>Verbum Fiat; Let us make man</hi>: that is out of the <note n="*" place="margin">Masse or Mixture.</note> Mesh of all Essences; out of the Property of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29914:35"/>
all Powers and Constellations; the Love-desire desired a <hi>Limus</hi> out of all Essences for a living Image: <hi>An Image that may be like</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble Us: <hi>and let them have dominion over the fish of the Sea and over the fowle of the aire; over the Cattle and over all the Earth, and over every worme</hi> (or creeping thing) <hi>that creepeth upon the Earth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. Understand this thus: the <hi>sixt</hi> Property of nature (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Love-desire</hi>) was produced expressed or breathed forth out of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and was the desirous life in the joy, <hi>viz.</hi> in the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: this was not it selfe a <hi>Limus</hi>; but it was the desire to the <hi>limus:</hi> for the Speaking Word which God expressed, moved therein: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>intellectuall</hi> life; God was therein manifest.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. This manifested word of God, desired in this Love-desire a <hi>limus</hi> out of the earth, and all the created Essences, out of all the Constellations and degrees, for a <note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Corpus.</hi>
                              </note> Body, unto it selfe: therefore God said, <hi>an Image that may rule over fish, fowle, beasts, wormes, and over the Earth,</hi> and all the Essences of the Constellations: now if it must have dominion therein, then it must be thereout, for each Spirit ruleth in its <hi>mother</hi> whence it is arisen and proceeded; and eateth of its mother.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. But heere we must rightly understand this Love-desire in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Word; the expressed Word had in this <hi>Venus-desire</hi> the desire of all heavens, that is of all entities and properties in it self, <hi>viz.</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the inward Spirituall <hi>holy heaven,</hi> which is the mansion of the power of God; and of the outward <hi>created heaven</hi> with the heavens of all constellations and Elements; yet not essentially [or in substance] but as a Spirituall desire: and these properties, desired in the Spirituall desire to be essentiall.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Now the Text in <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh very clearly and fully: where it saith; <hi>and God created man in his owne Image; in the Image of God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated hee him</hi>: by the creating is understood the body, which is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Spirituall</hi> body and a <hi>Corporeall</hi>; for the <hi>Venus</hi>-desire is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall body, and that which it hath attracted unto it self in the <hi>Fiat</hi> into the desire of the spirituall body, that is a <hi>fleshly</hi> body: the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> it self did figurize and forme it into a Spirituall man, out of all the <hi>three Principles, viz.</hi> according to the inward divine world, both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fiery-light-world and the outward world.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. And the Spirituall body is the Image of God: which the <hi>Fiat</hi> cloathed with the Essence out of all the Essences, <hi>viz.</hi> it cloathed it with the heavenly holy Essence, the heavenly holy Corporality of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holy Love-desire: and from the outward Love-desire it was cloathed with the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth and the other Elements, together with the visible Constellation of the third Principle.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. The inward holy man was in the heaven of God, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man was in the outward heaven a <hi>limus</hi> of the outward heaven: and the inward man a <hi>limus</hi> of the holy Spirituall heaven: therefore saith <hi>Moses</hi> very right; <hi>God created man</hi>

Thus understand by the inward creating, the true heavenly Image, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>holy Spirituall</hi> man out of all the properties of the Angelicall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine world: understand the inward body for the <hi>one</hi> only <hi>Element,</hi> whence the foure were expressed: and understand the outward man for the <hi>outward</hi> world with the <hi>Stars,</hi> and <hi>foure Elements viz.</hi> fire, aire, water, and Earth, and also for the outward Tincture, which is lincked with the inward in the holy expressed Word, and is onely <hi>Severed</hi> by a Principle: where also the inward putteth forth an externall life: the inward is holy and the outward [life or Principle] in the Tincture, were likewise <hi>holy,</hi> if the Curse were not come into it by reason of the awaked <hi>vanity</hi>: yet if the vanity be Severed <note n="*" place="margin">Or from.</note> by the Tincture: then it is holy and a <hi>Paradise,</hi> which shall open it selfe at the End of this world.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. And <hi>Moses</hi> saith further: <hi>God breathed into man the breath of life, and he became a living Soule:</hi> this signifyeth the living, Speaking, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Spirit, out of all the three Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the inward fire-world; which is manifest through the darke world: and out of the holy light-world, and out of the outward Aeriall world; this is the <hi>Soule.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="15">15. The inward fire-breath is the true Eternall Creaturall <hi>Soule,</hi> and the Lights-breath is the true understanding <hi>Spirit</hi> of the soul: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is an <hi>Angell:</hi> and the outward air-breath is the <hi>rationall</hi> Soule in the vegetative bestiall life, wherewith <hi>man ruleth over all the Creatures of this world.</hi>

                           <p n="16">16. As the onely understanding of the Abyssall unsearchable Deity, hath manifested it selfe with three Principles; so likewise he hath breathed in the true life out of all the three Principles into the <hi>Created Image:</hi> the body is a <hi>limus</hi> of all beeings, and the Soule is the <hi>expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> Word, <hi>viz.</hi> the Power and understanding of all Essences, <hi>viz.</hi> the manifestation of the divine Understanding.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. The Spirit of God hath inspired or given in it selfe, from the properties of all the <hi>three</hi> Principles, into the Created Image: <hi>viz.</hi> the Father of all Essences hath breathed or spoken forth the Spirit out of all the <hi>three</hi> Principles through his Eternall <hi>Speaking</hi> Word out of the whole Essence of the Powers; or as I might set it down, he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Egressed Sound or expressed voice of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; which through the motion of God did Educe and manifest it self, through the Eternall and Temporall nature; the same [Spirit] God did again <hi>in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Speake</hi> or as the Text in <hi>Moses</hi> hath it, <hi>breath in to this onely Image, for a Ruler of the</hi> body and all other <hi>Creatures.</hi>

                           <head>CHAP. XVI. Of the difference of the Heavenly and Earthly Man.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. WHen we consider the <hi>Image</hi> of God which God created in Paradise unto the Eternall uncorruptible life, then we can in <hi>no</hi> wise say of the grosse <hi>fleshy</hi> Image, that the grosse property of the earthlinesse is the Image of God, which can possesse the holy world: for it is not of the same Essence and <hi>Ens</hi>; whereof also Christ speaketh <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>The Spirit is life; the flesh profiteth nothing:</hi> also <hi>flesh, and bloud shall not inherit the Kingdome of Heaven:</hi> and yet verily the <hi>true</hi> Body is coucht in this bestiall grosse property; as the Gold in the Oare.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. All that is Earthly on man, that is bestiall and corruptible, and not man; Albeit God created Man an externall body out of the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth: yet it is not to be considered of us, as now it is; for the true humane <hi>Body</hi> according to the <hi>inward world,</hi> is a Spirituall <hi>Sulphur,</hi> a Spirituall <hi>Mercurius,</hi> and a Spirituall <hi>Sal: each</hi> property of the Soul hath a Coporeall or Essentiall quality on it.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. God created such a Body, as the Soul was in its Essence, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Spirated Word of the understanding; and breathed the Soule thereinto for the <hi>Understanding</hi>; also the outward Sulphurean body, is in no wise the Grosse Beast, which passeth away and returneth not againe; the true reall body which is <hi>hidden</hi> in the Grosseness, is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall body, in comparison to the <hi>Grossenesse:</hi> it is created in deed in flesh and bloud; but in a fixed stedfast [uncorruptible flesh and bloud.]</p>
                           <p n="4">4. By the Lust and Imagination of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Grosseness was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; the True outward body is a Sulphureous, Mercuriall, and Saltish Property; a pure Essentiall <hi>Power</hi> according to the nature of the Soul: That which the Soule is in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the same is the true humane body in the <hi>Essence,</hi> as a mansion of the Soul.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. All the <hi>Properties</hi> of the inward holy Body, together with the outward, were (in the first man) composed in an equall harmony, none lived in <hi>selfe-desire,</hi> but they all gave up their desire unto the Soul, in which, the divine light was manifest, as in the holy <hi>heaven:</hi> the light shone through all the Properties and made an equall <hi>Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in the properties: all the properties gave their desire into the light, <hi>viz.</hi> into the manifested sweetness of God, which penetrated all the properties; in which Penetration they were all Tinctured with the <hi>Sweet Love:</hi> so that there was nothing but meer pleasing relish Love-desire and delight betwixt them.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The inward holy Corporallity <note n="*" place="margin">Of.</note> from the <hi>pure Element</hi> penetrated through the foure Elements, and held the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth (<hi>viz.</hi> the outward Sulphureous body) as it were swallowed up in it selfe; and it was really there, but in manner as the darkness dwelleth in the light, and yet its <hi>darknesse</hi> cannot be manifest for the light, but if the light extinguisheth, then the darknesse is manifest.</p>
                           <p n="7">
                              <pb n="68" facs="tcp:29914:38"/>7. Thus the inward man held the Outward captive in it selfe, and penetrated it, as a fire through-heats an Iron, that it seemes as if it were <hi>all</hi> fire: but when the fire goeth out, then the dark <hi>swart</hi> Iron is manifest.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Thus likewise was the <hi>first</hi> man when he stood in Paradise, in his fixed condition, in manner, as time is before God, and God in the time; and they are <hi>distinct,</hi> but not parted asunder: as the time is a play before God, so also the outward life of man was a play <note n="*" place="margin">Before.</note> unto the <hi>inward</hi> holy man, which was the reall Image of God.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. The outward Spirit, and Body, was unto the inward as a <hi>wonder</hi> of divine manifestation, according to the fire-darke-and light world, a mirror of the Great <hi>Omnipotence</hi> and <hi>Omniscience</hi> of God: and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was given unto it for a Ruler, and Guide.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. As God playeth with the time of this outward world, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the inward <hi>divine</hi> man should play with the outward in the manifested wonders of God in this world, and open the divine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in all Creatures (each according to his Property) so likewise in the Earth in stones and metalls, in which also there is a <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi> Essence, <hi>viz.</hi> one from the originall of the fire-dark-world, and one of the Originall of the holy-light-world.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. All this was given him for his play: he had the knowledge of <hi>all Tinctures:</hi> all was subject to him, he ruled in heaven and earth and over all the Elements, so also over all the Constellations; and that because the <hi>divine Power</hi> was manifest in him: no heat nor cold did annoy him; as a Tincture penetrates a body and preserves it from sickness, and as the warmth of the <hi>Sun</hi> defends the body from cold; so likewise the highest <hi>Tincture</hi> of the fire and light, <hi>viz.</hi> the holy Power of the inward spirituall Body, penetrated the outward Body of flesh and bloud, and took every outward Elementall properry, as also the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, into its preservation or protection.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. For as there was a Temperature in the body of the inward and outward man: so likewise there was nothing without the Body that could either destroy, or annoy this <hi>Temperature:</hi> as Gold indures in the fire, and as a Tincture <hi>penetrates</hi> all things, and yeelds or gives way unto nothing; so likewise, man was not subject unto any thing, save onely and alone to the onely God, who dwelt through him, and was <hi>manifest</hi> in him with rhe Power of the holy Essence; and this was an Image and likenesse of God, in whom the Spirit of God inhabited.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. <hi>Reason</hi> will understand us amiss, and say, I speak of a twofold man: but I say <hi>no</hi>! I speak onely of one onely man, which is a <hi>likenesse</hi> according to God, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the manifested God; according to the expressed Formed word of the <hi>divine</hi> Power; of divine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. As all things are in God <note n="d" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Text</hi> in Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> Essentially, and yet he himselfe is not that very Essence; and yet that Essence <hi>ruleth</hi> every Essence according to its Property; so likewise the inward spirituall man is an Image of the formed Word of divine Power, and the outward an Image of the inward, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>Instrument</hi> of the inward; as a Master must have an Instrument wherewith to finish and performe his work; so likewise the outward man from the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth and foure Elements, with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29914:38"/>
its outward Constellation, is onely an Instrument of the <hi>inward,</hi> wherewith the inward frameth and maketh what the inward Spirit of the soul willeth.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. As we see that the <hi>Will</hi> is the Master in all purposes and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; and see further, that the inward man hath <hi>divine</hi> will and <hi>desire,</hi> but the outward a <hi>bestiall</hi> will, which is so by reason of the fall: the whole man is but <hi>one</hi> onely man: but his property lyeth in Sundry <hi>degrees</hi> according to the inward and outward heavens, <hi>viz.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the divine manifestation through the <hi>Seven</hi> Properties of Nature.</p>

                              <p n="18">18. So likewise <hi>Saturne,</hi> or the Seventh Property of the Seventh day, is the <hi>Rest,</hi> or mansion of the other six dayes works, wherein they worke as a Spirit in the body: the <hi>Seventh</hi> Property standeth still as a senceless life.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. <hi>MOses</hi> saith; that <hi>when God had made man,</hi> that <hi>he planted a Garden in Eden, and there he put man, to till and keep the same: and caused all manner of fruits to grow, pleasant for the Sight and good for food: and planted the Tree of Life also and the Treee of knowledge of good and evill, in the midst.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. Heere lyeth the <hi>vaile</hi> before the face of <hi>Moses</hi>; in that he had a bright shining Countenance, that Sinfull <hi>Israell</hi> cannot look him in the face; for the man of vanity is not worthy to know what <hi>Paradise</hi> is; and albeit it be given us to know it according to the hidden man: yet by this description, we shall remaine as dumb, to the <hi>Beast,</hi> but yet be sufficiently understood by our fellow-schollars.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Garden <hi>Eden</hi> was a place upon the Earth where man was Tempted: and the <hi>Paradise</hi> was in heaven; and yet was in the <hi>Garden Eden</hi>; for as <hi>Adam</hi> before his <hi>Eve</hi> [was made out of him,] before his <hi>sleep</hi> was as to his inward man in heaven, and as to the outward, upon the Earth; and as the inward holy man penetrated the outward, as a fire through-heats an iron: so also the heavenly <hi>Power</hi> out of the Pure Element penetrated the foure Elements, and sprang forth through the Earth, and bare fruits, which were heavenly and Earthly, and were qualifyed [sweetly Tempered] of the divine Power: and the <hi>vanity</hi> in the fruit was held as it were swallowed up, as the day hideth the night, and holdeth it captive in it self, that it is not knowne and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Paradise</hi> was nothing else but the Seventh dayes property; the heavenly Essentiality of the second Principle is couched or shut up in the Earth, the <hi>curse</hi> of God hath hidden it, it <hi>budded</hi> (in the beginning of the world) through the Earthly Essentiality, as the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is in the time, and the divine Power is through <hi>all</hi> things; and yet is neither comprehended or understood of any earthly thing in selfehood.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. But in Paradise the Essence of the divine world <hi>penetrated</hi> the Essence of time, as the Sun penetrates the fruit upon a tree, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually works it into a pleasantnesse, that it is <hi>lovely to looke upon and good to eat:</hi> the like also we are to understand of the Garden in <hi>Eden.</hi>

                              <pb n="72" facs="tcp:29914:40"/>6. The word <note n="‖" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Ede</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Language of Nature.</note> 
                              <hi>Ede</hi> is nothing else, but what <hi>Moses</hi> saith of the Earth: <hi>that it was</hi> 
                              <note n="*" place="margin">Void.</note> eed, and <hi>empty</hi>: that is, it should not manifest its Might according to the wrath of vanity, it should be still, as a mother to bring forth: for the internall would <hi>rule</hi> through the externall, as the Spirituall world through time, heaven through the Earth; the <hi>Earth</hi> was empty without fruit: but the heaven was its husband, which made it fruitfull, and bare fruit by it untill the <hi>Curse,</hi> where heaven did hide [disappeare, or withdraw] it self, from the Earth.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. The whole world would have been a meer <hi>Paradise,</hi> if <hi>Lucifer</hi> had not corrupted it, who was in the beginning of his Creation, an Hierarch in the <hi>place</hi> of this world; but seeing God knew well, that <hi>Adam</hi> would fall; therefore Paradise sprang forth and budded onely in <hi>one certaine</hi> Place, to introduce and confirme <hi>Man</hi> therein; whom, (albeit God saw that he would again depart thence,) he would againe introduce thereinto, by Christ, and establish him anew in Christ, to Eternity in Paradise.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. For <hi>Lucifer</hi> poysoned the first Paradise with his false and wicked desire, therefore God promised to <hi>regenerate</hi> it anew in Christ; for the seventh day which God appointed for Rest, is nothing else but <hi>Paradise</hi> regenerate anew in the Spirit of Christ in the humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, wherein the poore soul shall <hi>rest Eternally</hi> from the Source of the six dayes-workes, <hi>viz.</hi> of the six properties of the life.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Also it is the Seventh time or manifestation of <hi>God,</hi> in which <hi>the Mystery of Gods Kingdome shall be finished,</hi> when it shall be againe <hi>Pure</hi> in the place of this world, when heaven shall be again manifest in the world, and the Devill driven out with his <note n="l" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Text</hi> evill Essence.</note> wickednesse: wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no <hi>unclean</hi> thing shall any more enter; for this world, in which, <hi>Adam</hi> was, before his <hi>Eve,</hi> must againe returne, as it was, before the Curse, in which, <hi>Righteousnesse shall rule</hi>: but the vanity shall be purged away through the fire of Gods Anger, and given to the dark world.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. But that <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>the Tree of life stood in the midst of the Garden</hi>; and presently next after setteth down, <hi>and the Tree of Knowledge of good and Evill:</hi> Heere lieth the vaile before his eyes, that the earthly Sinfull man, cannot behold him; for he is not worthy of it; for his earthliness in the <hi>Curse</hi> of the bestiall vanity, shall not inherit Paradise.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. The precious Pearl lieth in [the knowledge of] the difference of <hi>the two Trees</hi>; and yet it is but onely <hi>one,</hi> but manifest in two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes for <hi>the Tree of life standeth</hi> wholly <hi>in the midst of the Garden:</hi> for it standeth in two Principles, in the <hi>midst, viz.</hi> in the holy world, between the Eternall dark world of Gods anger, where God is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry zealous God, and a Consuming fire; and the outward visible world.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. The <hi>holy</hi> Power of God in the Tree, was the middlemost Kingdom, and Paradise was the outermost Kingdom; for the middlemost penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the outermost and manifested it self with the outward; this was the <hi>Knowledge of</hi> the <hi>Good</hi>; which <hi>Adam</hi> should have as little known, in its Originall, as the Evill: he was created for an Instrument of God, with whom God would manifest his wonders in <hi>figures</hi>; he should onely keep a child-like minde, and be resigned unto God.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. Now <hi>the Tree of the Knowledge of evill,</hi> was the dark world, which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29914:40"/>
also was manifest on this Tree; likewise the vanity, as <note n="m" place="margin">As at this Day.</note> now it is; all earthly fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was manifest therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore <hi>Moses</hi> distinguisheth the Tree, and saith, <hi>the Tree of life</hi>; thereby he understandeth the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of</hi> the Eternall <hi>life</hi> in the Tree; <hi>viz.</hi> the Second Principle; and by the words <hi>of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evill</hi> he <note n="n" place="margin">Or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth the wrath of the Anger of God, which was manifest by the Essence of the outward world, in earthlinesse in <hi>this Tree,</hi> of which <hi>Adam</hi> should not eat; for he should <note n="o" place="margin">Or eat.</note> have eaten with the inward mouth, and not with the Earthly desire but with the heavenly, for he had such fruit growing for him, which the inward mouth could <hi>enjoy</hi>
                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed the outward mouth did also eat thereof, but not into the wormes <hi>Carkasse.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="14">14. For as the light <note n="p" place="margin">Avalleth.</note> swalloweth up the darknesse, so the celestiall swallowed up the Terrestriall, and changed it again into <hi>That,</hi> whence it proceeded; or as the Eternity swalloweth up the Time, and in it, is as a nothing; so likewise there were two <hi>Centres</hi> in <hi>Adams</hi> mouth, for the Kingdom of God stands in Power; and <hi>Adam</hi> also before his <hi>Eve</hi> stood in the Kingdome of God, for he was male and female with both divine <hi>heavenly</hi> Tinctures: and neither the Fires or Lights Tincture or desire, should be manifest in him, for they should stand in <hi>Equall</hi> weight [in the true Temperature] resigned <note n="q" place="margin">Or to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </note> in God.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. But in <hi>the Tree of the Knowledge of good and Evill</hi>; the properties, <hi>viz.</hi> of Gods Love, and also the earthlinesse, as it is at this day in the <hi>Curse,</hi> were peculiarly manifest, each in it self, and did eagerly put themselves forth, that is, they were departed out of the <hi>likenesse</hi> out of the equall harmonious Accord; and all the three Principles were each of them, in an especiall manner, manifest in this <hi>Tree,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moses</hi> calleth it, <hi>the Tree of the knowledge of good and evill.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="16">16. Reason saith: <hi>wherefore</hi> did God suffer this Tree to grow seeing man should not eat thereof? did he not bring it forth for the <hi>Fall</hi> of man? and must it not needs be the <hi>cause</hi> of mans destruction? This is that, about which, the high schooles contend, and understand it not, for they goe about to seek and apprehend the <hi>inward</hi> in <hi>the outward,</hi> and it remaineth hidden and dead unto them, they understand not what Man is.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. Man was created out of all the <hi>three</hi> Principles; and was placed in the principle, in the properties of the inward and outward world, in equall number weight and measure: none of the Principles did <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> the other: there was an agreeing harmony: the Divine light temperized all the properties, so that there was a mutuall <hi>melody</hi> and play of unanimous Love between them.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. The Fiery dark world rejoyced in the holy light-world, and the light-world in the outward [world], as in its manifestation; again, the outward world joyed it selfe in both the inward worlds; as in its life: and there was a meer <hi>pleasing</hi> harmonious will, pleasure, and sweet delight, between them: the <hi>Mercury, viz.</hi> the Sounding, hearing, and feeling life, <hi>viz.</hi> the manifestation of the divine Word in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> did mutually penetrate all Essences, in a very exceeding joyfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. The property or <hi>essence</hi> of all the Three worlds reached <note n="r" place="margin">Or set their desire upon the light.</note> with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29914:41"/>
the desire after the light; and in the light the expressed Word was holy; this holy word gave its power and vertue to the <hi>Sound</hi> of the inward dark fireworld; and also into the <hi>Sound</hi> of the outward <hi>Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> world; <hi>viz.</hi> it gave it selfe into the inward <hi>fiery</hi> Word, or <hi>life,</hi> and also into the outward <hi>earthly life.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="20">20. Thus the holy divine World was <hi>predominant</hi> through all the three Principles of the humane Property, and there was an Equall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; and no Enmity or <hi>opposite</hi> will was manifest betwixt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but a meer harmonious affection and inclination of will, pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relish, ravishing melody, sweet Smell, a friendly smiling, and most pleasant Aspect, a meek and kinde sence, and mutuall fruition of delight.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. For, Man was on the sixt day, taken and created unto a divine <hi>likenesse and Image</hi> in the sixt manifestation of the Seven properties of the divine harmonious manifestation in the <hi>Expressed</hi> Power, which hath diffused and manifested it selfe through the fift property, <hi>viz.</hi> through the fiery Love-desire; his true lifes-Centre was the fift pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Eternall nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>fiery Love-desire</hi>; which held the Fire, and darknesse, hidden [or shut up] in it self, and used it to its joy and delight.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. But it is very needfull for us to understand aright in this place, whence the desire to fall away from the Equall Accord did arise both in the Hierarch <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and also in <hi>Adam</hi> the second Herarch or Royall Prince in the Divine Image.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. When the Eternall Onely God once moved himself through the Eternall Spirituall nature, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Eternall great <hi>Abyssall</hi> Mystery, and Comprized [or amassed] this Mystery into a Circumference or Place, to manifest his great wonders; and introduced the Eternall <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> into a formall visible contemplation, and manifested all the seven Properties of the inward Eternall Spirituall world, and introduced them into a Creation of the <hi>Angells</hi>; then all the properties were moved, and affected, and <hi>each</hi> desired to be in a Creaturall forme, in the Place, so far as the <hi>Verbum Fiat,</hi> had <note n="s" place="margin">Or given it selfe in.</note> put it selfe forth to motion and manifestation.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. And the Angelicall Princes also with their Legions, were taken and created out of the properties in the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi>; even from the first Centre where the Eternall <hi>Lubet</hi> betaketh it selfe into a desire, and introduceth it selfe into nature, unto the most externall manifestation, each hierarchy in its heaven or <hi>Property.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="25">25. But being <hi>Lucifer,</hi> was in his Creation or formation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties apprehended in the Principle of the Property, where the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling fire ariseth, where the light is manifest, <hi>thereupon</hi> he became so Aspiring in himselfe, as the <hi>most Mighty</hi> Prince; and being in the root of his Creaturall Originall, he understood the great Magicall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mystery of the Ground of all beeings, but yet in the <hi>dark</hi> property, which yet was now moved and affected; which Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>constellations</hi> also <note n="t" place="margin">Or would be.</note> desired to be manifest and creaturall in the darke world) thereupon it set its desire upon this mighty Prince and <hi>Hierarch.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="26">26. And hee, <hi>viz. Lucifer,</hi> turned himselfe away from the divine light
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:29914:41"/>
into the fiery Mystery, towards the darknesse, whence the fire ariseth; and so the Magicall <hi>Astrum</hi> of the Grand Mystery of the dark world, apprehended him; for, his desire, which the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> had extro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced through the fire in the light, turned it selfe back againe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, and would be <hi>like</hi> the Creatour of all beeings, and change him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and the Essence according to his owne pleasure.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. Thus he contemned the meeknesse in the light, <hi>viz.</hi> the Second Principle, which [ariseth] through the fire-death, (where the wrath or the <hi>Spirituall Essentiality</hi> of the wrathfull dark Property, dyeth in the fire; and out of which death of Devoration, the Second Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>viz.</hi> the holy Love-world of great meekness and humility, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated) and went back into the <hi>first</hi> Principle, <hi>viz. in magiam natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae</hi> into the Originall of the Eternall Nature; and would be an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient Artist: he would rule and domineer, in and above the whole Creation, and be a Co-former in <hi>all</hi> Properties.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. <hi>Thus</hi> the light was extinct to him, for he made his <hi>Angelicall</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence which stood in great meeknesse and in fiery Love-desire, wholly rough, Austere, cold, wrathfull and fiery, in the <hi>darke</hi> wrathfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; and the properties of Enmity instantly arose in him, for, in the light they could not be manifest; but when the light <hi>extinguished</hi> they were manifest; and he became a <hi>Devill</hi> and was driven out of the Angelicall world out of his <hi>own heaven</hi> of the Second Principle.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. Thus we are to know, that the fall befell him from his <hi>creature,</hi> for had he not turned away his creaturall desire from the divine meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Love, in Pride, and stubborne will to rule in the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the Pregnatresse which tooke him as a Player; he had <hi>remained</hi> an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell: had he continued under Gods Love-Spirit and will, then his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-Spirit and will, had not captivated him.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. But seeing he hath freely and willingly <hi>broken</hi> himselfe <hi>off</hi> from Gods Love-will; he hath now Gods Anger-will in him, wherein he must be a Manifestour and worker of the darke worlds Property, for <hi>it</hi> would also be creaturall; Heere it hath a right <hi>captive,</hi> that can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially act in Apes-sport; and now as the darke world is in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in its desire; such is also its <hi>Hierarch</hi> or Creaturall Prince.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. And heere it is very requisite for us to know aright, how man came to fall. Man was created in the <hi>stead</hi> and place of extruded <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer,</hi> understand the <hi>inward</hi> Spirituall man; he was created in the same heaven according to the inward humane Soul, and should pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the Hierarchy which <hi>Lucifer</hi> had lost; and hence the <hi>Devills Envy</hi> against man is arisen.</p>
                           <p n="32">32. But seeing God did well know; that the Devill would Tempt him, and not beteem him that honour; the deepest Love of God (<hi>viz.</hi> the high <hi>Name Jesus</hi> out of <hi>JEHOVAH</hi>) hath freely given it selfe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to regenerate this Hierarchy which <hi>Lucifer</hi> had defiled; and to <hi>purge</hi> it through the fire, and to introduce his highest Love thereinto, and to overcome the wrath (which <hi>Lucifer</hi> had awakened) with Love, and change it again into divine joy, <hi>viz.</hi> into an holy <hi>heaven</hi>; <note n="u" place="margin">Or unto which end the last judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</note> in which place the <hi>Last Judgement</hi> standeth: and this is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Man was chosen</hi> [or elected] <hi>in Christ Jesus before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world was laid.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <pb n="76" facs="tcp:29914:42"/>33. And for <hi>this end,</hi> God created man out of three Principles in One, that [being] he did not live wholly in the Place of Lucifer, that so he might help him; for God saw very well, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his wrath, that <hi>Man would fall</hi>; but he would bring him again through and in the <hi>Name Jesus</hi> through the corruptible Death, into the <hi>Royall</hi> Kingdome whence <hi>Lucifer</hi> was fallen; in whose stead <hi>the Man Christ</hi> God and man in one Person, should sit as an Hierarck, high Priest, or the Great Prince of men, in the Name and Power of <hi>Jesus</hi> out of <hi>JEHOVA.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="34">34. Therefore we are heere rightly to consider of the fall of man; how he stood in Paradise and was tempted; and what the Paradise was; man stood in three Principles, which indeed stood <hi>in</hi> man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>viz.</hi> in body and Soul, in equall Accord and harmony, but <hi>not without</hi> him; for the dark world hath another desire then the <hi>light-world</hi>; now the Image of God stood <hi>between</hi> three Principles; all which three did set their desire upon <hi>this Image</hi>; each would be manifest in <hi>Adam,</hi> and have him in their Dominion for a Ruler, and manifest <hi>their wonders</hi> through him.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. But hee <hi>viz.</hi> the man, should have introduced his desire onely into the <hi>Sixt</hi> Property of the divine manifestation, wherein he was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to an Image of God; he should be wholly resigned to God: he should onely live in the manifested <hi>Divine Word,</hi> in obedience to God, and not enter into his own will, but introduce his desire into Gods will, <hi>viz.</hi> into the sixt Property; that so the manifested Word of God might <hi>be his will,</hi> knowing, and Doing: even as the holy Angells doe so live and rejoyce onely in the Divine Will, and melodise in the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> as he doth open and manifest himself in them according to the Divine wisdome; and thus they live, will, and Act, with a child-like minde and will.</p>
                           <p n="36">36. Paradise, or the Garden in <hi>Eden</hi> did indeed stand with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, in equall <hi>Concord</hi> as to man: but the properties were in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves an Awaked hunger, each in it selfe; which verily the Divine light did againe intoduce into a <hi>Temperature:</hi> but the Devill opposed man, in his Enkindled Envy, and insinuated his venemous <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> into the humane Property, and Enkindled the humane proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the <hi>Centre</hi> in the first Principle of the Souls Property, wherein the Soul standeth in <hi>like</hi> Essence and Beeing, with the Angells and Devills.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. Whence <hi>Adams</hi> Imagination, and earnest hunger did arise, that he would <hi>eat of the Evill and Good,</hi> and live in his own will; that is, his will departed out of the equall Concord into the <hi>multiplicity</hi> of the properties: for he would prove, feele, taste, heare, smell, and see them; as the Devill did perswade them also in the Serpent; <hi>they should be as God and their eyes should be open</hi> in the properties, which also hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto them in the Fall, that they knew tasted saw and felt Evill, and Good: whence arose unto them sicknesse disease, paines, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption [or the dissolution of this carkasse.]</p>
                           <p n="38">38. And being the Divine Providence, did afore know that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> would tempt man,<note place="margin">

did, God did represent unto him, <hi>the Tree of life, and of the knowledge of Good and Evill,</hi> wherein the dissolution of the outward life was manifest.</p>
                           <p n="39">39. For it was long of <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was yet in Paradise, when he lusted after vanity, and brought his Imagination into the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> into <hi>that Essence,</hi> whence the <hi>limus</hi> of the outward body was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; and desired out of his mother to assay of the <hi>Enkindled va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> which the Devill had inflamed, thereupon the <hi>Fiat</hi> drew him forth such a Plant out of the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the Earth, whence also it had extracted <hi>Adams</hi> body, so that <hi>Adams</hi> hunger, <hi>had</hi> to eat.</p>
                           <p n="40">40. For the Essence in the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evill, and the hunger of the desire in <hi>Adam,</hi> were <hi>alike</hi>; what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired was represented unto him by the <hi>Fiat; Adams</hi> Imagination was the Cause of it.</p>
                           <p n="41">41. Reason saith; wherefore did God suffer it to come to passe? Christ said, <hi>if you had Faith as a graine of Mustard-Seed, and should say to this Mountaine be cast into the Sea, it should be done:</hi> I preethee, was not the Souls spirit sprung forth out of the Great Divine <hi>Omnipotence</hi> out of the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Eternall Spirituall nature, whence all Beeings were created, and should it not then be <hi>potent?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="42">42. He was a fire-spark of Gods <hi>Might,</hi> but when he was formed into a creaturall beeing of the Creatures, he withdrew into <hi>Selfe</hi> lust, and brake himself off from the <hi>Universall</hi> Beeing, and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a selfefullnesse, and so he wrought his own <hi>destruction,</hi> and this he had had, if Gods Love had not <hi>redeemed</hi> him.</p>
                           <p n="43">43. The Soules power was <hi>so potent</hi> before the vanity, that it was not subject to any thing; and so it is still powerfull, if the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were not taken away from it: it can by <hi>Magick</hi> alter all things whatsoever are in the outward worlds Essence, and introduce them into another Essence, but the <hi>vanity</hi> in the outward Aires Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath brought a darknesse thereinto, so that it doth not know it selfe, the <hi>Curse</hi> of God hath cast the defiled childe into the dirt, that it must pray for a <hi>Laver</hi>; and must be in this life time its <hi>own Enemy,</hi> that it may learne to be humble, and continue in the divine Harmony, and <hi>not</hi> become a Devill.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam</hi> was a <note n="z" place="margin">A husband and also a wife.</note> Man, and also a woman, and yet none of them [<hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi>] but a Virgin full of chastity, modesty and purity, <hi>viz. the Image</hi> of God: He had both the Tinctures of the fire, and light, in him; in the Conjunction of which, the own Love, <hi>viz.</hi> the Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall Centre stood; being the faire Paradisicall <hi>Rose-Garden</hi> of delight, wherein he loved himselfe; as vve also in the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Dead shall be such; as Christ telleth us: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>and</hi> 22. that <hi>we shall neither marry, nor be given in marriage, but be like the Angells of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. Such a Man, as <hi>Adam</hi> was before his <hi>Eve,</hi> shall arise and againe enter into, and eternally possesse Paradise, not a Man, or Woman; but as the Scripture saith, <hi>they are Virgins, and follow God, and the Lamb, they are like to the Angells of God,</hi> yet not onely pure Spirit, as the Angells, but in heavenly bodies, in which the Spirituall Angelicall body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiteth.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Seeing then <hi>Adam</hi> was created in Paradise to the Life Eternall in the Image of God; and God himselfe breathed his life and <hi>Spirit,</hi> into him; therefore we can well describe him, how he was in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and how he fell, and what he is now, and shall againe be at last.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. If God had created him <note n="a" place="margin">Or for.</note> unto the <hi>Earthly</hi> corruptible, miserable, naked, sick, beastiall, toilsome <hi>life,</hi> then he had not brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paradise; if <note n="b" place="margin">God.</note> he had desired [or willed] the <hi>bestiall</hi> copulation, and propagation, then he would instantly in the beginning have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Man, and woman, and both Sexes had come forth in the <hi>Verbum Fiat,</hi> into the division of both Tinctures, as it was in the <hi>other</hi> earthly creatures.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Every creature bringeth its cloathing from its <note n="c" place="margin">Or mothers body.</note> Dam; but <hi>Man</hi> cometh miserable, naked, and bare, in deepest poverty, and un-abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and is able to doe nothing; and in his arrivall to this world he is the poorest miserablest, forlornest, and most shiftlesse Creature amongst all kindes, which <hi>cannot</hi> at all help himselfe; which doth sufficiently shew unto us, that he was not created of God unto <hi>this</hi> misery, but <note n="d" place="margin">Or unto.</note> in his perfection, as all other creatures were, which [Perfection] the first man fooled away [or lost] by false lust; whereupon God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in his <hi>sleep</hi> did first figurize him in the outward <hi>Fiat</hi> to the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life in Man, and Woman, according to the Property of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Creatures, and hung upon him the wormes-<hi>Carkasse</hi> with the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall members for propagation, of which the poore soule is to this day ashamed, that it must beare a beastiall forme on the body.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Two fixt and stedfast Essences were in <hi>Adam; viz.</hi> the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all body <note n="e" place="margin">Or of.</note> from the Love-Essentiality of the inward Heaven; which was Gods <hi>Temple</hi>; and the outward body, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>limus</hi> of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was the mansion, and habitation of the inward Spirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which in no wise was manifest according to the vanity of the Earth, for it was a <hi>limus,</hi> an extract of the good part of the earth; which at the last Judgement shall be <hi>Severed</hi> in the Earth from the vanity of the Curse, and <hi>Corruption</hi> of the Devill.</p>
                           <p n="8">
                              <pb n="79" facs="tcp:29914:43"/>8. These two beeings, <hi>viz.</hi> the inward heavenly, and the outward heavenly, were mutually espoused to each other, and formed into one <note n="f" place="margin">Text, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi>
                              </note> body, wherein was the most <hi>Holy Tincture</hi> of the fire and light; <hi>viz.</hi> the great joyfull Love-desire, which did inflame the Essence, so that both Essences did very earnestly and ardently desire each other in the Love-desire, and loved one another: the inward loved the outward as its manifestation, and <hi>Sensation,</hi> and the outward loved the inward, as its greatest <hi>sweetnesse,</hi> and joyfulnesse, as its precious Pearle and most beloved Spouse, and consort; and yet they were not two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but onely one; but of a <hi>twofold</hi> Essence, <hi>viz.</hi> one inward, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly holy; and one from the Essence of time; which were espoused and betrothed to each other to <note n="g" place="margin">Or eternally.</note> an Eternall [beeing.]</p>
                           <p n="9">9. And the <hi>Magicall</hi> Impregnation [or conception] and birth did stand in this fiery Love-desire; for the Tincture penetrated through both Essences; through the inward and outward, and did awaken (or stir up) the desire; and the Desire was the <hi>Fiat,</hi> which the Love-<hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> [or Imagination] <note n="h" place="margin">Conceived.</note> tooke, and brought into a Substance; thus the likenesse of the <hi>expresse Image</hi> was formed in this Substance being a Spirituall Image according to the <hi>first:</hi> As the <hi>Fiat</hi> had conceived, and formed the first Image, <hi>viz. Adam,</hi> so also the likenesse was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived out of the first for propagation; and in this Conception also the Magicall birth was forthwith (effected,) where, in the birth, the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall body</hi> became externall.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Understand, if it had been that <hi>Adam</hi> had stood, then the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call birth had been thus [effected,] not by a sundry peculiar <hi>issue</hi> from <hi>Adams</hi> body, as now; but as the Sun through-shineth the water, and rends (or teares) it not; even so, the Spirituall body, <hi>viz.</hi> the birth, had been brought forth, and in its comming forth had become <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall,</hi> without paines care and distresse, in a great joyfullnesse, and delight; it had been in a manner, as both seeds of man and woman doe receive in their Conjunction a pleasant Aspect; even so also the magicall Impregnation and birth, had been a Virgin-like Image whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect according to the first.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. Which afterward, when <hi>Venus's Matrix</hi> was taken from <hi>Adam,</hi> and formed into a <hi>woman,</hi> must be done through Anguish trouble smart, pangs, and distresse; as God said to <hi>Eve; I will multiply thy Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes when thou conceivest, thou shalt now bring forth Children with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and thy will shall be subject to thy Husband</hi>; Wherefore? because it was sprung forth from the Mans will: <hi>Eve</hi> was halfe the <hi>Adam, viz.</hi> the Part wherein <hi>Adam</hi> should have loved and Impregnated himselfe; the same, when as he stood not, was taken from him in his <hi>sleep,</hi> and formed into a woman: therefore when <hi>Adam</hi> saw her, he said; she shall be called <note n="*" place="margin">Or Manness.</note> 
                              <hi>woman,</hi> because she is taken out of man.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Man should have walked naked upon the Earth, for the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (part) penetrated the outward, and was his <hi>cloathing</hi>; he stood in great beauty glory, joy, and delight, in a childe-like minde; he should have eaten, and drunk in a <hi>magicall</hi> manner; not into the body, as now, but in the <hi>mouth,</hi> there was the <hi>Separation</hi>; for so likevvise vvas the fruit of Paradise.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. All things vvere made for his sport, and delight; no <hi>sleep</hi> was
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29914:44"/>
in him; the night was in him as the day; for he saw with <note n="i" place="margin">Glorified, illustrious.</note> pure eyes in <note n="k" place="margin">in his own genuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate light.</note> peculiar light; the inward man, <hi>viz.</hi> the inward Eye saw through the outward; as we in the other world shall <hi>need</hi> no Sun; for we [shall] see in the divine Sight, in the light of the Peculiar nature. <hi>No</hi> heat, nor cold had touched them; there had also <hi>no winter</hi> been manifest upon the earth, for in Paradise there was an equall Temperature.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. The Tincture of the Earth had been their delight and pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; they had <hi>had</hi> all metalls for their play <hi>untill</hi> the time that God had changed the outward World: <hi>no</hi> feare or terrour had been in them, also <hi>no</hi> Law from any thing, or to any thing; for all had been <hi>free</hi> unto them; <hi>Adam</hi> had been their chiefe Prince; and they had lived in the world and also in heaven, inhabiting in <hi>both</hi> worlds at once; Paradise had been through the whole world.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. But seeing the divine <hi>Providence</hi> did well know, that <hi>Adam</hi> would not stand, being the earth was corrupted by its former Prince; in that the <hi>wrath</hi> of God had moved it selfe, and <note n="l" place="margin">Or tooke</note> Amassed the Essence into an Impression; <hi>therefore</hi> God created all manner of fruits and beasts, also all sorts of <note n="m" place="margin">Or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine healing Animalls ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables and mineralls.</note> 
                              <hi>Medicines</hi> for the future sicknesse of man; and likewise all kindes of <hi>meat</hi>; that the man might have food, and <hi>ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> also in this world.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. For he had determined to send <hi>another Prince,</hi> by whom he would redeeme man from his sicknesse and death, and purifie, and purge the earth through the fire of God, and introduce it into the <hi>holy</hi> (being) as it <hi>was</hi> when <hi>Lucifer</hi> was an Angell, before it came into such a <note n="n" place="margin">Or Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall being.</note>

                           <p n="17">17. And <hi>Adam</hi> was created onely <note n="o" place="margin">Or in.</note> unto the divine Image which should be eternall; and though it <hi>was known</hi> in the wrath of God, that man would fall; yet the <note n="p" place="margin">Or restorer.</note> 
                              <hi>Regenerator</hi> was also <hi>known</hi> in Gods Love; <note n="q" place="margin">

                           <p n="18">18. But that the Fall <note n="*" place="margin">Or might not so much as appeare to arise from the divine decree.</note> might <hi>not proceed</hi> (or come) from the divine Appointment, God made man perfect, and created, and ordained him unto Paradise, and forbad him the false lust, which the Devill stirred up through the <hi>limus</hi> of the earth, in <hi>Adams</hi> outvvard body, with his false Imagination, and Hungry-desire.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. And <hi>Adam</hi> was (before his <hi>Eve) forty dayes</hi> in Paradise, in the Temptation, before God made the woman out of him; if he had stood stedfast, then God had so confirmed him to <hi>Eternity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="20">20.

                           <p>ANd <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>God caused a deep steep to fall upon the man, and he slept, and he tooke one of the ribbes out of his side,</hi>

                              <hi>and built a woman thereof, and closed up the place with flesh.

                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. For we finde, that the woman was taken and formed in the <hi>Fiat</hi> out of <hi>Adams</hi> Essence; <note n="i" place="margin">Or out of his body and Soule.</note> both in body and soule. But the Rib betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>Adams</hi> dissolution, or breaking; <hi>viz.</hi> that this body should, and would be <note n="k" place="margin">Or destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>

                           <p n="3">3.

                           <p n="4">4. Even then, he forthwith sunke dovvn into a <note n="l" place="margin">faintnesse, or impotency.</note> svvound, into <hi>Sleep, viz.</hi> into an unability, which signifieth the death: for the Image of God vvhich is immutable, doth not sleep: whatsoever is eternall hath no time in it; but <note n="m" place="margin">Or with.</note> by the sleep the time was manifest in man, for he <hi>slept</hi> in the Angelicall world, and <hi>awaked</hi> to the outvvard world.</p>

Great and wonderfull are these <hi>Mysteries,</hi> which the world cannot apprehend; for it is as blinde in them, as a man that is borne blinde, is, to behold this world; but he that Regardeth and <hi>findeth</hi> them, hath great joy therein.</p>

                           <p n="17">17. The mans <hi>limbus</hi> which he kept when the woman was made out of him, was the Fathers property, according to all beeings; and the woman out of [or proceed from] the man, was the Sons proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according to all beeings, understand the <hi>heavenly</hi> part (both of the <hi>limbus,</hi> and <hi>matrix</hi>) therefore Christ became man in the womans part, and brought the mans part againe into the holy <hi>matrix,</hi> so that the <hi>limbus</hi> and female <hi>matrix</hi> were againe one <note n="b" place="margin">Or person.</note> Image, <hi>viz.</hi> a manly <hi>Virgin,</hi> above and in all the three Principles, as a creaturall formed God, in whom the Eternall unformed God dwelt, with universall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, both <hi>in</hi> the formed, and <hi>without</hi> the Formed [divine creature or God-man;] for thus was <hi>Adam</hi> also, before his <hi>Eve,</hi> and so must we also be in Christ, if we would be the Image and Temple of God.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. Now when the pregnant <hi>matrix</hi> was taken from <hi>Adam,</hi> the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was every way formed with such members for propagation as she is at this day; and so <hi>Adam</hi> also; for before vvhen <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Male and Female,</hi> he needed no such members; for his birth vvas <hi>Magicall,</hi> his Conception moving in the <hi>Matrix</hi> [was to be] done through <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; for the <hi>Fiat</hi> was manifest in him.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. And the bestiall wormes carkasse of the bowells, with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of other inward <hi>Principall</hi> members pertaining to the earthly

                           <p n="20">20. Reason will object against me, and say; God created <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning such a man, and even with all members <hi>as he now is</hi>; which, notwithstanding it cannot make out or demonstrate; seeing the soule is ashamed of this beastiall property: also I would faine know of this selfe-full <hi>Reason</hi>; whether or no such an <hi>Adam</hi> (if he were created so miserable, destitute, naked, and bare, unto this bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall life) were created <hi>to eternall life</hi> without defect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also without need distresse, and death? and whether this Sinck [or filthy carkase of earthly flesh and bloud] were the <hi>Paeadise,</hi> and <hi>Temple of God</hi>; and how could he have been able to defend himselfe from hurt, and ruine? for such a <hi>beast-like</hi> man may be drowned in the water, and burnt in the fire, and also crusht to pieces with Rocks, and stones.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. But if thou saist, that God did vvell know, that it <hi>should be so</hi> with <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore he created him so at the very first? Against this the Scripture declareth, saying, <hi>God created man in his Image, yea to the Image of God created he him</hi>; not to the <hi>beastiall</hi> Image; what Sin would God have imputed or charged upon man, if he had created him in a beastiall Image; what then would the <hi>new birth</hi> availe him [to what end then should he be borne againe?] The new birth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in reall Summe, this; That the Angelicall Image <hi>must be borne againe,</hi> which God created in <hi>Adam.</hi> God formed <hi>Adam</hi> in the Image of God, and though he knevv, that he would <hi>not stand</hi>; yet he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him the Saviour, who should bring him againe into the <hi>first Image,</hi> and therein establish him for ever.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. Novv it plainely appeares that <hi>Adam</hi> stood in the <hi>Divine</hi> Image and not in the <hi>beastiall,</hi> for he knew the property of all creatures, <hi>and gave Names to all creatures</hi> from their essence, forme and property; He understood the Language of nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the manifested and formed Word in every ones Essence, for thence the <hi>Name of every Creature</hi> is arisen.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. Now being he knew how the vvord of Power was <note n="c" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Text,</hi> stood in the forme.</note> 
                              <hi>formed</hi> in every creature, thereupon we cannot esteeme him <note n="d" place="margin">Or make a meer animall of him, as the schooles in their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish reason doe, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not what <hi>Adam</hi> was, before he lost the Image of God.</note> 
                              <hi>Beastiall</hi>; he was vvithout doubt <hi>Angelicall</hi>; for none other man shall arise, but such an one as <hi>Adam</hi> was before his <hi>Eve:</hi> God created him perfect, but he stood not in the <hi>Proba</hi>; whereupon it must now follow; that God suffered him to fall into the <hi>outward Magick</hi>; and ordained him to the Image of this world; and set him into the naturall life, <hi>viz.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <note n="e" place="margin">Degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</note> Corruption and new birth, for in <hi>heaven</hi> there is neither Male nor Female, but all one kinde in peculiar Love vvithout further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, in an Eternall <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="24">24. This therefore doth set forth unto us, that <hi>Adam</hi> dyed in Paradise, as God said unto him; <hi>if thou eatest of the Tree, thou dyest:</hi> he dyed to the holy [heavenly] Image, and lived to the awaked beastiall Image. For now, vvhen <hi>Adam</hi> did awake from sleep, he was indeed still in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, for the vanity in the flesh and Soule did <hi>not</hi> yet actually and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually worke, and was yet dumb, still, and sencelesse, <hi>untill they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29914:47"/>
did eat of the forbidden fruit</hi>; and then the earthly Dominion began to rise; then the vanity awaked, <hi>viz.</hi> the formes of the life, each in its selfehood, and <hi>forsooke</hi> severally their mutuall harmony, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with heat, and cold fell upon them; for the outward (Image or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) did assimulate [or ensource] with the inward, and the heavenly Image at last quite disappeared; which in <hi>Adams</hi> sleep, and also in his awakening, <hi>did yet live</hi> both in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> but in a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, and <hi>impotent</hi> manner.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. <hi>Adam</hi> in his <hi>Perfection,</hi> while he was man and vvife, and had the magicall conception in him, did amuse himselfe on (or Imagine after) the <hi>Beasts,</hi> and introduced himself into beastiall <hi>lust,</hi> to eat and generate according as the beasts doe: and so likevvise the <hi>Fiat</hi> tooke in the same lust, and formed him in his <hi>sleep</hi> even as the lust was; and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was formed in its place to the Conjunction of the beast-like copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for each Desire hath obtained its mouth to manifestation: Thus the Image of God formed it selfe in the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> into such a <hi>beast</hi> as vve are still to this day; and this same (was done) in it selfe, <hi>viz. Mans own Fiat, viz.</hi> the first forme of nature, which is the desire of Gods manifestation, did effect it, and none other maker <hi>from without</hi> him.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. We are not to conceive, that there was any thing else upon <hi>Adam,</hi> which made his <hi>Eve</hi> out of him, or that formed them both to the outward naturall life, save onely the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> in them, their own very propriate, and not any alienate (or any thing strange,) from vvithout them, as the first creation of <hi>Adam</hi> and all kindes of creatures, was so brought to passe; the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> Coagulated each <hi>Ens,</hi> and the manifested word Severed it selfe in the <hi>Ens</hi> according to its property, and formed the Creature according to its <hi>Astrum</hi> and kinde; where also in every <hi>Ens</hi> the <hi>Matrix</hi> was separated from the <hi>limbus,</hi> and formed into a Male, and Female, [into an He, and She.]</p>
                           <p n="27">27. The picturing of God as a man in making <hi>Adam,</hi> and aftervvard standing over <hi>Adam</hi> as he sleepeth, and making a woman out of him, is more <hi>Idolatrous</hi> then reall; and God hath earnestly forbidden in <hi>Moses to make the likenesse of any God,</hi> for he is no Image save onely in the Creatures, according to the Expressed Formed Word, both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the creatures of Eternity, and of time: he is no [<hi>such</hi>] ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, but a former of the properties, a creatour, and not (<hi>such</hi> a) maker.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. The Creating is the <hi>Fiat</hi> vvhich amasseth [or formeth], and the Word in the power of the Amassed [or conceived being,] gives the distinction according to the <hi>Ens:</hi> As the <hi>Ens</hi> is in the generation of the Spirit, so a thing is formed; for the body or substance of all things is nothing else but a <hi>Signature</hi> or mansion <note n="f" place="margin">Or of.</note> according to the Spirit, as the Birth is in the <hi>Ens</hi> where the Spirit formeth it selfe, so is likewise the body of all kindes of Creatures both in Animalls, and vegetables; as we plainly see, that the first Creatour, who hath moved himselfe and brought himselfe into a Creaturall Manifestation, hath left in all creatures a Power to their own <hi>Multiplication,</hi> or Encreasing, propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <note n="g" place="margin">

                           <p>NOw when <hi>Adam</hi> did <hi>awake from sleep,</hi> he saw his wife <hi>Eve</hi> standing before him, and tooke her unto him; for he knew that she was his owne; that she was his <hi>Matrix</hi>; and cast the property of his desire upon her, as he had done before when he loved himself, so now also the Fiery Tincture of <hi>Adams</hi> soule entered into the Spirits or lights Tincture in <hi>Eve.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. But they both stood yet in Paradise in the Garden in <hi>Eden,</hi> and knew neither Evill, nor Good; for they lived yet in joy, and delight, in the Kingdome of Heaven, and it was <hi>Eves first</hi> longing to eat of good and evill: for <hi>Adams</hi> desire had introduced and imprinted it into the Magicall Image while it was yet in <hi>Adams</hi> Essence, as a childe receiveth a marke [or Impresse] in the <hi>wombe,</hi> which the mother imprints on it.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Thus also <hi>Adam</hi> did Impress the false desire into his Essence, whence the woman was made: therefore the woman so soone lusted after the <hi>vanity</hi>; as to this day, meer earthly Lust of the flesh is found in <hi>most</hi> of them: so soone as this Sex comes but to any yeares, the selvish lust [and will] doth <hi>predominantly</hi> appeare in pride and glister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shewes of fleshly desires, and they soone long after the forbidden tree, contrary to the Virgin-like modesty, chastity, and angelicall humility.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The Abomination which <hi>Adam</hi> introduced into his <hi>Matrix,</hi> is so exceeding strong in them, that they are as 'twere <note n="h" place="margin">Or very weake, and poore.</note> in Naked <hi>shame,</hi> before the Image of God which God himselfe created in <hi>Adam, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must be subject to the man,</hi> in that they are the cause, that the vanity was enkindled, to which the Devill also was a strong <note n="i" place="margin">Sollicitour.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motour.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. For when he saw <hi>Eve,</hi> he then knew his insinuated desire in her, which he had introduced into <hi>Adam</hi>; the same did shew forth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it selfe in <hi>Eves lust</hi>; therefore the Devill came now in a strange forme, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Serpents <hi>Essence,</hi> which vvas <hi>the most suttle Beast,</hi> and laid himselfe on the tree of temptation towards <hi>Eve,</hi> that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced Concupiscence in <hi>Eve</hi> which the Devill had also infected, did <note n="k" place="margin">Was much taken with.</note> amuse it selfe upon the <hi>outward</hi> Serpent, and so one lust tooke another; whereupon <hi>Eve</hi> did strongly Imagine, and long after the forbidden fruit, which the Devill perswaded her to eat; <hi>and then her eyes should be opened, and she be as God, and know Evill and Good.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">6. Which indeed was true; this <hi>knowledge</hi> did stick in the fruit; for the Essences were discordant, and un-like therein; but he told her not that the <hi>enmity</hi> would awaken in the Essences of her body and that heat, and cold, moreover sicknesse, and death would force into her; Herein he was <hi>silent,</hi> and fairely coloured it over, and drew her
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29914:48"/>
in by collusion; as if God had withheld some great thing from them, which she might finde as a treasure; <hi>so craftily</hi> did he <hi>deceive Eve.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. And when she yeelded to discourse with the Serpent, she was taken in the voice; for the Devill infected the same with false delight, untill he perswaded her, <hi>she should be wise, if she did eat thereof.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">8. For the Devill thought, that if <hi>Eve</hi> should bring forth chidren in Paradise, then his <note n="l" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Text,</hi> his cause might prove naught.</note> Designe would <hi>miscarry</hi>: they might then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse his Angelicall Kingdome.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Now the question is: wherefore the Devill did deceive <hi>Eve</hi> by the <hi>Serpent</hi> onely, and not by some other meanes? could he not doe it in his owne forme, why did he even speake <note n="m" place="margin">Or in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </note> through the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to <hi>Eve?</hi> and wherefore did the Serpent addresse it selfe to the <hi>Tree</hi> to perswade her, against Gods prohibition?</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Heere the vaile lyeth before <hi>Moses</hi> his cleare eyes, for he sets down the Hystory very right, but how can an un-illuminated minde understand it; in that he writeth of the Serpent; saying, <hi>that the Serpent spake with Eve, and deceived her</hi>; whereas indeed <hi>it cannot</hi> speak, and also is onely a beast, <hi>without</hi> divine understanding, and in its <hi>selfe</hi> cannot know the Image of God, much lesse did the Serpent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the heavenly Powers, or the Prohibition.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. But heare what <hi>Moses</hi> saith: <hi>the Serpent was more subtill then any beast of the field, which the Lord God had made</hi>: Here the first question is, whence its suttlety came, that even the Devill would <hi>chuse</hi> to speake through its suttlety, and deceive <hi>Eve:</hi> Herein sticketh the Mystery.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. When God moved himselfe according to his Expressed Word, in the <hi>Verbum Fiat,</hi> according to <hi>both</hi> the inward worlds, <hi>viz.</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods Love and anger, according to the Eternall Nature of the darknesse, and according to the Eternall nature and power of the light; then all the properties in evill and good did <note n="n" place="margin">Or were brought into a Compacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> amasse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for the <hi>Fiat</hi> was the Centre in all those properties, as well as in those wherein the divine Power vvas manifest in <hi>holinesse:</hi> now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as each [centrall] point was opened; understand, according as the <hi>Lubet</hi> to the manifestation of the Grand mystery of all beeings [was in every <hi>punctum</hi>], even so the <hi>Fiat, viz.</hi> the first forme to nature, did apprehend and bring forth an <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>limus,</hi> out of the earth, and so also above the earth in each Magicall <note n="o" place="margin">Star.</note> 
                              <hi>Astrum</hi> according to the degrees of Severation; and so in the same <hi>Ens</hi> there was a Spirit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the same degree or magicall <hi>Astrum,</hi> and the <hi>Fiat</hi> did figure, and shape even such a body or <hi>corpus</hi> as the same Spirit was.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. Now being that Prince <hi>Lucifer</hi> did sit as an Hierach in divine pomp, and would domineere in divine power in the fires-might, above and in all, and contemned Gods Love, and humility, and entred with his false desire into the Essence of the expressed Word in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> as a <note n="p" place="margin">Or false Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.</note> Jugler or wicked Impostor, that would also forme and make [ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his proud perverse will,] thereupon he <hi>infected</hi> that same Essence, according to the darke worlds property; which came forth also in the <hi>Fiat</hi> into a Compaction, <hi>viz.</hi> into an <hi>Ens,</hi> wherein evill and good are mutually linckt together. For he (<hi>viz.</hi> the Devill) did as an Apostate rebellious Jugler desire the greatest <hi>suttlety</hi> proceeding
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29914:49"/>
from the Centre of nature, and would domineere in the <hi>Revealed</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick in the <hi>Fiat.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="14">14. And out of the like <hi>Ens</hi> proceeding from this Infected <hi>Ens</hi> (where Evill and Good was manifest in great Power), the Serpent was created in the <hi>Fiat:</hi> therefore <hi>Moses</hi> saith very right; <hi>it was more subtill then all the beasts of the field</hi>; for the Devills will, <hi>viz.</hi> his desire, which he introduced into that <hi>Ens,</hi> whence it was created, was in it; it had the Devills <hi>suttlety,</hi> and will; and as the Devill was an Angell in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and was from a good Essence, and yet introduced himselfe into an evill one: so likewise the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> was good before the Devills infection, before its creation, but in the Devills desire it was <hi>brought</hi> into a property of subtlety, and craft.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. For the Devills desire drew forth the Compunctive <hi>Stinging</hi> thorny sharp subtlety out of the Centre of nature, and introduced it through the Enkindling of the fire into the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Salniter, <hi>viz.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that property wherein he sate and was an Angell; and heere that very craft came forth along in the same <hi>Ens</hi> into a Compaction in the <hi>Fiat.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="16">16. For the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> was as to one part, <hi>viz.</hi> as to the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a great Power; as also there was a great Heavenly power in the Devill; for he was a Prince of God; and so he brought his extracted sublety and <hi>lies</hi> into a povverfull <hi>Ens</hi> desiring to play his <hi>enchanting</hi> feats thereby as a peculiar un-controulable God.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. This the <hi>learned Searchers</hi> of nature doe in like manner under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, <hi>viz.</hi> that there lieth excellent Art, and also vertue, in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Serpent; if the Devills poyson be taken from it, the greatest <hi>Cure</hi> doth then lie in it for the <hi>Healing</hi> of all fiery venemous hurts and distempers; yea the best <hi>Antidote,</hi> against poyson, and all whatsoever hath the Semblance of a fiery poyson; for therein the <hi>divine</hi> Povver ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a fiery <hi>Hunger,</hi> but hidden in the Curse of the Anger of God.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. As God doth dwell hiddenly in the Cursed Earth; so likewise it is heere; yet it is given to the wise <hi>Godly</hi> Searcher of the Art, and he need not be <hi>astonished</hi> or afraid of the Curse: for he shall rule in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power in <hi>faith</hi> over all creatures; if he were not so much capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated in a beastiall and proud manner in the Serpents Essence, our sence and meaning might be opened unto him, and he might here well finde the <hi>Arcanum</hi> [or Secret] of the world.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. This crafty Serpent vvas now in externall shew and <hi>Semblance,</hi> an exceeding well-favoured, comely, handsome, neat, fine, brave, pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty beast, accurately drest, and set forth, according to the pride of the Devill; <hi>not</hi> that we are to conceive, that the Devill was a creatour of the Serpent, but the <hi>Fiat</hi> was <hi>manifest</hi> in it according to Gods great good power, and also very potently <hi>manifest</hi> according to the power of his wrathfull Anger.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. This Serpent was a <hi>living</hi> figure of the Tree of Temptation; like as the Tempting Tree was a <hi>dumb</hi> power [or <hi>livelesse</hi> resemblance] so the Serpent was a living power, and <hi>therefore</hi> the Serpent applyed it selfe to this tree as to its likenesse, even the likenesse of its Essence; which the Devill saw, and possessed the Serpent in the part of his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,</hi> and introduced poyson, and armed its tongue, and spake out
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29914:49"/>
of its great Subtlety to <hi>Eve,</hi> so that she knew not the horrible Enemy, and very hideous ugly Guest the Devill.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. And the Devill <hi>therefore</hi> brought the Serpent to the Tree of Temptation, (being he saw that <hi>Eve</hi> was taken much with <hi>beholding</hi> of the Tree, and faine would eat of its fruit) that so he might make <hi>Eve</hi> 
                              <note n="q" place="margin">Or, forme strange Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of pride, in seeing the faire Serpent.</note> monstrous by the Serpent; and the true eye-marke [to reach the, reall understanding of the Serpents deceiving <hi>Eve</hi>] is <hi>this.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="22">22. <hi>Eve</hi> did now long after the fruit of the tree of the Knowledge of Good, and Evill; for <hi>Adam</hi> had introduced this lust into his <hi>Ens</hi> whence <hi>Eve</hi> was created: but now the Command stood against it, and she feared God, and <hi>would not</hi> doe contrary to the prohibition; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Devill <hi>cunningly</hi> insinuated into the Serpents <hi>Ens, viz.</hi> into the greatest <hi>Subtlety</hi>; and yet craftily puts forth the great power and wit in the Serpents Essence; that <hi>Eve</hi> might see, and know how pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wise and <hi>Subtill</hi> the Serpent was; and <hi>hung</hi> there upon the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden tree, and it did <hi>it</hi> no hurt, and she looked upon the Serpent and set her minde amusing after it, in manner as a woman <hi>with childe</hi> doth amuse her selfe and strangely or monstrously forme her selfe [in her minde] and bringeth such a <hi>figure</hi> upon the childe, even so did <hi>Eve</hi> amuse her selfe upon the wit, and craft of the Serpent, and also upon its nimble Agility, and Art, whereupon she longed <hi>to eat of the tree</hi>; for the Serpent perswaded her by the Devills voice, and speech, and pretended that it had its craft, and Art from the Tree.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. <hi>Eves</hi> Essence was heavenly, but already somewhat poysoned and <hi>infected</hi> by <hi>Adams</hi> Imagination; now <hi>Eves</hi> good desire of the good Essence in her, entred into the <hi>Serpents</hi> great power and inward vertue, which it had from the heavenly Essence, <hi>viz.</hi> from the good part of the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Earth; and the infected property of <hi>Eve,</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> had insinuated, and let in by Imagination, entred into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Craft, viz.</hi> into the Centre of the darke world, into Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and on the other side the <hi>Devills</hi> strong desire, and Imagination, entred through the Essence of the Serpent, into <hi>Eves</hi> Essence; both by the sound and voice in their <hi>intercourse</hi> of speech, and also by the Conjunction of both desires.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. And heere <hi>Eves</hi> desire, and the Devills desire, were espoused [or united] in this <hi>conjunction</hi>; for the Devills desire made <hi>Eves</hi> lust wholly monstrous, and did so egg or force her on in the lust, till he <hi>overcame</hi> her; and she gave full consent thereto in her desire; she would faine also eat of the Tree of understanding, and vvise <hi>subtlety</hi>; and desired likewise to be, or be made so wise, prudent, and crafty, as the Serpent.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. For the Devill said: the fruit would not hurt, but the <hi>eyes</hi> of her sharp understanding <hi>would be opened</hi>; and <hi>they should be as God</hi>; this <hi>Eve</hi> did like of very well; that she should be a Goddesse, and wholly consented thereunto; and in this full consent she <hi>fell</hi> from the divine Harmony, from the Resignation in God, and from the divine desire, and entred with her owne desire into the Craft, <hi>distemper,</hi> and vanity of the Serpent, and the Devill.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. Heere in this juncture [or point of time] the Devills desire, tooke full <hi>possession</hi> of <hi>Eves</hi> will, and introduced it into a Serpentine
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29914:50"/>
Substance; and even heere <hi>Eve</hi> became monstrous in her owne Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, according to the Essence of the Serpent; and heere the Devill built up his <hi>Fort</hi> Rampant, and strong hold, in the Humane Essence; and heere <note n="r" place="margin">Or was.</note> is the <hi>Death</hi> of the Heavenly Essence, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beeing; Heere the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God departed from <hi>Eve</hi> her Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: thus in this point [of time] the heavenly part of man, <hi>viz.</hi> the heavenly <hi>limus,</hi> in the flesh, did disappeare; and this is it, which God said, <hi>in that day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt dye the Death,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="27">27. When <hi>Eve</hi> had turned her will from the obedience of God, and introduced it into the Serpents craft, then the power of the heavenly <hi>meeknesse and humility</hi> in the heavenly <hi>Limbus,</hi> did disappeare; not that she fully received the darke worlds Essence into her Essence; but as God said to her; <hi>thou shalt dye</hi>; that is dye or disappeare <note n="s" place="margin">Or as to.</note>, in the Kingdome of heaven; for the Kingdome of heaven receiveth no true Death; onely when the light of the divine Principle <hi>extinguisheth,</hi> then that Essence wherein it did burne, and from whence it shoane, is dumb, and as 'twere dead, without feeling, and understanding, as a Nothing; like as a candle burning in a darke place maketh the whole Roome light, but if it goeth out, there is <hi>not</hi> the print or impression of it, to be seen, its power entreth into the Nothing, in manner as God made all things of Nothing.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. Not that we are to understand that mans Heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> became a Nothing; it remained in man; but it was as 'twere a nothing to man in <hi>its</hi> life; for it stood hidden in God; and was un-apprehensible without life, <hi>to man</hi>; Nothing dieth in God; but the holy <hi>Ens</hi> in the humane life, did disappeare.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. And as <hi>Eve</hi> did now reach to the Tree, take the fruit, and pluck it off; the same she had already done by the earthly <hi>limus</hi>; and by the will of the Soule, which desired the suttlety from the Centre of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which suttlety [or discretion] she already perceived in her, in the <hi>Centre,</hi> and yet was not manifest in the divine Power, and in the Resigned Humility: In this essay the devills desire, reacheth along in her monstrous Image, to the <hi>fruit</hi>; and when she tooke the fruit into the mouth, and did eat thereof, that her bodies Essence, received in, this Essence, the humane Essence took the Essence in the Tree.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. And beeing she did not forthwith <hi>fall down</hi> and dye, she thought it would <hi>not</hi> hurt her, for the Anger-source yet rested <hi>still</hi> in her, and she perswaded <hi>Adam,</hi> that he also did eat thereof, being he <hi>saw</hi> that it hurt not <hi>Eve.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="31">31. But now when they <hi>had eaten,</hi> the wrath of Gods Anger did awake in the monstrous Image, <hi>viz.</hi> the properties of the darke world, <hi>viz.</hi> the Devills introduced desire, which now had its <hi>Seat</hi> in the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Image in the Serpents Essence: in this instant, all the formes of suttlety and craftiness did <hi>awake</hi> in the Humane <note n="t" place="margin">Or hidden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> Mystery; for so long as man stood resigned in God, in the Equall Accord, in the divine Harmony, the heavenly part, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of the heavenly <hi>limus,</hi> pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the earthly <hi>limus</hi>; and the properties could not be manifest; for they were all in equall measure and weight; as the time is in God and God in the time.</p>
                           <p n="32">32. But when mans owne will began effectually, and actually to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29914:50"/>
worke, then also the properties of the universall <hi>Magicall Astrum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan also to worke in him each [<hi>Astrum</hi> or Star] in its selfehood; for the universall Magicall <hi>Astrum</hi> lay in man, for he was created on the sixt day in the sixt manifestation of the divine Mystery, as a <hi>limus</hi> of all beeings; a <hi>limus,</hi> or externe [or extracted] birth, whence all the creatures were created; an <hi>Astrum</hi> of the universall <hi>Astrum</hi>; for he should rule above all creatures of this world, and be Lord over all creatures, and yet not be ruled or lorded over by any.</p>
                           <p n="33">33. For he stood in Equall Essence; but now every <hi>Astrum</hi> of every Essence of all the creatures doe depart from their mutuall accord, and each steps into its selfehood; whence the strife, contrariety, and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> arose in the Essence, that one property doth oppose it selfe against the other: thus likewise the outward Spirit of the outward <hi>Astrum,</hi> and foure Elements did presently domineere in them, and heat, and cold were also manifest in their body; moreover the property of all evill and good <hi>Beasts:</hi> all which properties before did lye hidden.</p>
                           <p n="34">34. Heere the craft, and suttlety of the Serpent was manifest, and the pretious Image was corrupted, and became according to the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, a <hi>Beast</hi> of all beasts; whereupon there are now so many and various properties in man; as one a Fox, Wolfe, Beare, Lion, Dogg, Bull, Cat, Horse, Cock, Toad, Serpent; and in briefe as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kindes of creatures as are upon the earth, so many and <hi>various</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties likewise there are in the earthly man; each of one or other; all according to the predominant Stars which make such a property in the <hi>Seed,</hi> in the time of the Seeding, by reason of their predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or [potent influence,] that <hi>Astrum</hi> which is most predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the <hi>Constellation,</hi> that hath its desire in the Seed, and if it be sown, such a property is hatched forth in the earthly part of man.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. Not that the whole man is such a [very brute beast in outward shape] but there is such a <hi>figure</hi> of the desire in the earthly Essence; and the man must beare <hi>such</hi> a Beast in the body, which stirs him up and drives him to the beastiall property; <hi>not</hi> that he hath this forme according to the outward [person]; but <hi>really</hi> in the earthly Essence: according to the outward [personall shape] he remaines in the first <hi>formation</hi> [or platforme.]</p>
                           <p n="36">36. Yet this Beast doth somewhat put forth its <hi>Signature</hi> externally in every one; if one doe but heed and well minde the same, he may finde it: Hence Christ called the Pharisees <hi>a generation of Vipers, and the Seed of Serpents</hi>; also others he called <hi>wolves, ravening wolves, foxes, doggs</hi> and the like; for they were such in the earthly Essence: and He taught us; <hi>that we must be borne anew</hi>; and forsake this beastiall property; <hi>and become as children or we should not possesse the Kingdome of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="37">37. For as the Essence is in the body, even so the Spirit doth figure, and <hi>forme</hi> it selfe internally, and the poore soule stands in this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, bound, and married to such a beast, unlesse that a man be borne anew: for which ground [and end] God ordained the <hi>Circumcision</hi> in the old Testament; and in the new the <hi>Baptisme</hi> in the Spirit of Christ.</p>
                           <p n="38">38. Heere we are highly to consider, what horrour lamentation
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29914:51"/>
and misery; Anguish, feare, and distress, did arise and <hi>awake</hi> in man; and was manifest as a false life and will in man; of which we have a type in the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ, when <hi>he destroyed the Death</hi> in our Humane awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned property, <hi>upon the Crosse</hi>; and overcame [it] with the great Love in his heavenly bloud, which he introduced thereinto; that even then the <hi>earth, viz.</hi> the <hi>limus</hi> of the earth, whence <hi>Adams</hi> outward Essence was extracted <hi>did tremble</hi> and shake at it; now when the great Love forced into the humane earth wherein the anger of God was living and effectually working, in the <hi>Curse,</hi> [I say] when it now was to dye, and to be changed into another Source, it did <hi>tremble</hi> before this great Love-fire; like as the Love-fire in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did tremble in the awakening of the <hi>anger</hi> in them; whereby they were astonished, and <hi>creap behinde the trees in the Garden; and were afraid,</hi> for the dread and horror of Gods anger was awakened in their Essence, and they knew their beastiall properties.</p>

                           <p>WHen <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were become monstrous; the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the part of the heavenly <hi>limbus,</hi> departed; for the part of the Heavenly property disappeared in the Soule, in which [part] the divine light <hi>shoane</hi>; and in which the Divine power of the holy <hi>Tincture</hi> dwelt.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Understand, the <hi>power</hi> of the light <note n="u" place="margin">Or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.</note> departed from him into the Centre, in manner as a shining light which flameth forth from a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, extinguisheth, and the fire-<hi>Source</hi> onely, of the light, remaineth; even so likewise the Magicall fire-source onely of the <hi>soules</hi> property remained, <hi>viz.</hi> the Centre of the Eternall nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fire-world, and the darknesse.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And on the outward part of the soul, the Air-Spirit with its <hi>Astrum,</hi> remained, wherein the light of the <hi>outward</hi> nature shoane, which now, the fire-soule must make use of; for the <hi>Fiat</hi> was enraged in the wrath of God, <hi>viz.</hi> in the fiery property of the soul, and also of the body, and in a fiery <hi>hunger,</hi> in the awakened Flagrat of Gods anger, had entred into, and taken possession, of the <hi>Essence</hi> in soul and body, and with hard <hi>Attraction</hi> did impresse it selfe in the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the <note n="x" place="margin">Or matter outward Essence</note> substance, in the <note n="y" place="margin">Or <hi>limus.</hi>

                              <hi>limbus</hi> of the body, whereupon the flesh became grosse hard thick and corruptible.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. For in the Flagrat of the wrath, all the properties of each <hi>Astrum</hi> according to the property of all the creatures, did awake in the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, whence the enmity antipathy, and <hi>contrariety,</hi> did arise in the Essence of the body and soul, so that one property is against another, one taste <note n="z" place="margin">Or a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse to another.</note> against anothers: for all departed out of the <hi>Temperament,</hi> paine, tormenting malady and sickness <note n="a" place="margin">Or arose in them.</note> hapned unto them.</p>

                              <pb n="95" facs="tcp:29914:51"/>5. For if an <hi>opposite</hi> Essence entreth into another, it makes an enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and an hatefull overmastring, and destroying each the other: one property annoyes weakens, and destroyes another, whence the death, and <hi>dissolution</hi> of the body is arisen.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. For whatsoever stands not in the Temperature cannot <hi>subsist eternally</hi>; but whatsoever standeth in the Temperature, that hath no destroyer; for all properties doe [there] mutually love one another: and in the Love is the growth, and <hi>preservation</hi> of the life.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. And we are heere fundamentally to understand, how the grosse properties in the wrath of the <hi>Fiat</hi> in the Essence of the body have obscured and wholly shut up the heavenly essentiality in the Sulphur, so that the heavenly man was no longer <hi>known</hi>; as Lead doth hold the Golds spirit <note n="b" place="margin">Or blended.</note> avalled in it selfe, that it is not knowne [or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned.]</p>
                           <p n="8">8. For the <hi>desire viz.</hi> the first forme of nature, which is the <hi>Fiat,</hi> hath swallowed, <note n="c" place="margin">Or with,</note> in the grosseness, the heavenly part both in man and Metalls: like as all the soverain power, of [or from] the <hi>holy worlds</hi> Essence, which is in all hearbs, and all other fruits, lieth shut up in the wrath and Curse of God, in the darke worlds property in the Earth; and springeth forth by the strength of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the light of the outward nature, in the Essence, through the Curse, and wrath; which budding or pullutation giveth a Soverain power, and <hi>healing</hi> vertue for the malignant Essence in the living bodies, whence the <hi>Physitian</hi> is arisen, who seeketh and learneth to know the vertue [and temperature thereof,] that he may resist and remedie the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Essence in the body; which notwithstanding is onely a luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme, and faint <hi>Sparckle</hi> thereof, if he be not able and skilfull, first to Separate the gross ravv wildness, (which is from the darke worlds property) from his <hi>Cure.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="9">9. For if the captivated Essence of the heavenly worlds property, may be <hi>redeemed</hi> from the Curse and wrath of nature, then it standeth in the Temperature; and if it then so commeth into a living body, it doth awaken also the shut up [or imprisoned] life of the heavenly worlds-<hi>Ens,</hi> if that likewise be in the body, and expelleth the wrath, whereby the <hi>Sicknesse</hi> is destroyed, and the Essence entreth into the Temperature.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. That this is certainly thus, we may see by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> when the wrath did awaken in their Essence, and the <hi>Fiat</hi> did Impress the beastiall properties, and formed (them) in the Essence, that when the soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the Image of God, did <hi>experimentally</hi> know this, it was ashamed of the beastiall deformity, and of its beeing in a beastiall vessell, <hi>viz.</hi> in another Principle.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. For the outward part of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the Aire with its <hi>Astrum,</hi> did arise, and obtaine the upperhand; as we may plainly see, that amongst the greatest part of men; the <hi>outward</hi> part of the Soule bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the sway and domination over the whole body, in that the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall man doth onely seek and labour after the pleasure of this world, <hi>viz.</hi> after externall honours, authority, and <hi>beauty,</hi> and also how to pamper, fill and gluttonize the Beast; and so to <hi>vapour</hi> and proudly pranck with the beast as with a God, and yet it is onely a Corruptible

                           <p n="12">12. Also this Gross Beast <hi>shall not possesse the Kingdome of God</hi>; and also <hi>it profiteth not at all</hi>; John 6. but the <hi>Hidden man,</hi> which lyeth shut up in this beast, as the Gold in the gross Oare, which [hidden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward] man the grosse beast scarce regardeth or gives any respect unto, save onely that it doth sometimes a little play the <hi>hypocrite</hi> with it, and comforteth it with <hi>devout</hi> words, but exalteth it selfe in its place as a proud Peacock; and bravely trimmeth adorneth and fatneth his <hi>beast,</hi> that the Devill may have an horse to ride upon, and thereby mock God: and he rideth thereupon in the <hi>vanity</hi> [of this world] in the Kingdome of Gods anger, as upon a false <hi>Whore</hi> which desireth to live in its own selfefull might and <hi>wit.</hi>

                           <p>THe Scripture saith <hi>God hath made all things by his word, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the same, nothing was made which is made,</hi> John 1. out of his Expressed Word (which was Essentiall in the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi>) all things came forth into formings: first into an <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>desire</hi> of a property, and out of the same propriety, into a compaction of Sulphur, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and Salt, as into a formed nature; and out of the same <hi>Ens</hi> in the formed nature the word becomes a creatarall life; and brings it selfe forth out of the Cumpaction of Sulphur Mercury, and Salt <note n="d" place="margin">Or into a body.</note> out of the <hi>Body,</hi> that is, it manifests it selfe in a plaine <hi>visible beeing</hi>; to which end God hath created nature and creature.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Thus each creature hath a Centre to its re-expressing, or breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the formed word, <hi>in it selfe,</hi> both the Eternall, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall creatures, the unrationall, as well as man: for the first <hi>Ens</hi> was spoken forth out of <hi>Gods breath</hi> through the wisdome out of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the fire and light, and taken into the <hi>Fiat</hi> and brought into a Compaction.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. This same <hi>Ens</hi> is out of the <note n="e" place="margin">Or eternall beeing.</note> 
                              <hi>Eternity,</hi> but the compaction of the foure Elements are out of <hi>Time:</hi> thus an Eternall [<hi>Ens</hi>] lyeth hidden in every thing in the Time, in all things with life, or without life, in Elements and creatures, in vegetative and un-vegetative; The first <hi>Ens</hi> is in every thing, whence the forme of Compaction, (which is arisen from the time,) was <hi>Spoken forth</hi> out of the spirituall worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as an Eternall <hi>Ens</hi> out of the Eternall-Speaking Word, through the wisdome into a time, <hi>viz.</hi> into a formed Essence according to the Spirituall <hi>Ens</hi>; which <hi>Ens</hi> cannot be destroyed by any Element or thing whatsoever.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And although the Elementall Compaction, <hi>viz.</hi> the body, (which the <hi>Ens</hi> hath attracted to it selfe, that is, breathed it forth from it selfe, as an externall Degree) doth <hi>vanish</hi> and come to nothing; (for it hath a temporall beginning); yet the first <hi>Ens</hi> cannot perish: As we also see,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:29914:53"/>
that all things enter againe into their mother from whence they are arisen and come forth, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>foure Elements.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. Now, in this Consideration, we finde the true ground of <hi>Sins.</hi> Originall: Seeing that the living powerfull understanding <hi>Speaking</hi> Word, was breathed forth out of all the three Principles into the <hi>Ens</hi> of Mans Image, for his <note n="f" place="margin">Intellectuall faculty.</note> understanding, that he should and could rule the properties of the compaction of Sulphur Mercury and Salt, but he hath now introduced this <hi>understanding, viz.</hi> the Speaking powerfull Word againe, into the Compaction of time, <hi>viz.</hi> into the earthly <hi>limus</hi>: where also the <hi>Fiat</hi> of time is Awakened in the body, and hath taken the understanding, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>inspired</hi> 
                              <note n="g" place="margin">Sound or harmony.</note> breath captive in it selfe, and placed it self master over the understanding.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. So that we doe now see by wofull <note n="h" place="margin">With great lamentation.</note> 
                              <hi>experience,</hi> how it is now with us; that when we would speak (albeit the understanding Word doth [Idea or] conceive it selfe in the inward <hi>Ens,</hi> and desires to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the truth) yet the awakened vanity in the earthly <hi>limus</hi> of the body, doth soone forthwith catch it, and [cunningly blendes] and works it forth, into its own property, [or Serpentine suttlety]; so that the <hi>word</hi> of the humane <hi>understanding,</hi> doth breath forth <hi>Lies,</hi> ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, malice, falsehood, and such cunning <hi>vanity,</hi> and foppery, in which voice the Devills desire doth mix it selfe, and makes it to a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> which the Kingdome of Gods <hi>Anger</hi> doth receive.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. For in what property every word doth forme and manifest it selfe in <hi>Mans Speech,</hi> when he speaks it forth, let it be either in Gods Love, <hi>viz.</hi> in the holy <hi>Ens,</hi> or in the <hi>Ens</hi> of Gods anger, of the same it is againe received, when it is <hi>Spoken,</hi> the false word proceeding from the false <hi>Ens</hi> being infected by the Devill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Sealed to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is also taken into the Mystery of the <hi>wrath, viz.</hi> into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the <hi>darke</hi> world: Every thing entreth with its <hi>Ens</hi> into that, whence it takes its originall.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Seeing then the <hi>Speaking</hi> Word is a divine manifestation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Eternall word of God hath manifested it selfe, and that this same Speaking Word is <hi>inspired</hi> into man, we are therefore heere to consider what Man doth manifest with this Speaking Word: under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it thus: if the humane <hi>Lubet</hi> and desire (which is the <hi>Fiat</hi> or the creating of the humane word) doth conceive the forme of the word, in the holy <hi>Ens, viz.</hi> in the heavenly part of the humanity, then the word <note n="i" place="margin">Or speaketh.</note> soundeth from an holy Povver, and the mouth speaketh <hi>Truth.</hi>

                           <p n="9">9. But if it be from the vanity, from the Serpents craft, which <hi>Eve</hi> imprinted into her selfe, and thereby awakened its <hi>Suttlety,</hi> then the word sounds from the <hi>Ens</hi> of the darke world, <hi>viz.</hi> it proceeds from the Centre to the fire-word; and thereinto also it entreth (in its <note n="k" place="margin">

But if it proceeds forth empty and bare onely, into the false Imagination, then it ascends into the will of the <hi>Minde,</hi> and conceives it selfe in the Minde into a Substance, for a <hi>Seat</hi> of the Devills desire, even for his murthering Fort which he hath in Man.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. But if the false word be uttered against an holy man, in revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reproaching him, and the holy man will not let it <hi>take place</hi> in him, and not stirre or move himselfe in the evill part of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the <hi>like</hi> evill word, then the wrath of God receives it from without the man, and is thereby mightily Enkindled; and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the inward <hi>Ens</hi> of Gods anger according to the Spirituall darke worlds property is thereby enraged, but also the outward <hi>Ens</hi> of the wrath <hi>in Turba magna</hi> is inflamed, and hangs over the wicked mans <hi>Head,</hi> and doth even encompasse him, and he is therewith taken, and possest as if he sate in the Hellish [flames of] fire.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. Of which Christ said, <hi>that when the wicked did curse us we should blesse him,</hi> that is, Eccho forth the word of <hi>Love</hi> against his fiery word, and not suffer his malicious word to enter into us for to take root, and then it goeth backe againe, and apprehends the wicked Reviler himselfe, for Christ said: <hi>we heap fiery coales upon his head.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="14">14. For <hi>Every word</hi> of man proceeds from an Eternall <hi>Ens</hi>; either from the <hi>Ens</hi> of Gods Love, or from the <hi>Ens</hi> of Gods Anger; and if now it be brought forth out of the <hi>Ens, viz.</hi> out of its owne place, or mother, it will have againe a place of its <hi>Rest,</hi> wherein it may work.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. Now if it cannot take rest and worke in its likenesse, without the wicked man, who hath awakened and brought it forth out of his <hi>Ens,</hi> and introduced it into a Sound, or <note n="o" place="margin">Vocall.</note> wordy Substance, then it catcheth or surrounds its Expresser [or <hi>author</hi>] who hath brought it into a Substance, and entreth againe with its root into its mother whence it did arise; that is, with the Enkindled <hi>Spirit,</hi> and with the Substance (of its contrived <hi>matter</hi>) it doth lay hold of and apprehend the <note n="p" place="margin">Or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors <hi>Speakers.</hi>
                              </note> 
                              <hi>Inventers</hi> Body; <hi>viz.</hi> the outward Essence of the outward <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</hi>

                           <p n="16">16. For every word when it is expressed, is <hi>outwardly</hi> made and formed; for in the expressing or pronouncing thereof the outward Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>outward part</hi> of the Soule receives it to its own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and afterward beeing enkinded in the wrath, and infected by the Devill in its comming forth, in its witty glancing suttlety of the Serpent, doth enter again into the Soul and Body of the <hi>monstrous</hi> Image; and worketh according to its property Enkindled and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Devill, and continually bringeth forth such evill fruits, and <hi>words,</hi>; as wee plainly see, that out of many a wicked mouth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>vanity</hi> proceeds.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. Moreover we have a very great and weighty point here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of, concerning the Serpents craft; that if the Devill hath infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the <hi>word</hi> (when it is borne in the <hi>Heart</hi> and formed in its <hi>Ens,</hi> and have taken possession of the will, and made it substantiall) this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents craft doth then hold and entertaine the fame in the <hi>Devills</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Fort, as a fine adorned pleasant <note n="q" place="margin">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29914:54"/>
by its friendly intercouse, catch her in the desire: even so likewise the false, crafty, conceived Serpents word, which proceedeth from the false heart doth hold forth it selfe as a very lovely <hi>Eloquent</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive <hi>Syrene,</hi> and calls it selfe <hi>holy,</hi> till it can discover mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire set open for it, there it layes open its very heart, and entreth in to the desire [of him], and maketh it selfe a place to worke, and re-procreate [its like.]</p>
                           <p n="18">18. Hence now doe come the false <hi>close</hi> backbiters tale-bearers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters and wrong interpreters of other mens sayings, secret lyars who are very faire before and behinde are a Serpent, Revilers and foule mouthed slanderers who take away a mans good Name from him; and in this false smooth and well-coloured and adorned Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents property, the Devill hath his Counsell <hi>Chamber,</hi> his schoole, where he <hi>learneth</hi> the children of <hi>Eve</hi> his Art, <hi>viz.</hi> jugling delusions, foppery, pride, Covetousness, Envy, Anger, and <hi>all vices</hi> and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations proceeding from the Abysse of the darke worlds property.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. Thus the Devill ruleth man in Body and Soule by the crafty Essence of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and worketh abomination with abomination, <hi>iniquity with iniquity,</hi> Sin with Sin; and this is even the first <hi>Originall</hi> of Actuall <hi>Sin,</hi> that <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> did introduce the Serpents crafty Essence which the Devill had infected, into their [will and] de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; and so made themselves forthwith Monstrous in the Serpent, where upon the <hi>darke</hi> worlds Essence did awake in them, that so soon as this was brought to passe, the will did imagine into this monstrous property, and formed it selfe into a Substantiall <hi>word.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="20">20. Even thus the word was now also manifest in man in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Gods Anger, <hi>viz.</hi> in the darke worlds <hi>Ens</hi>; and thus man doth <hi>now</hi> speake lies and truth; for there is a <hi>twofold Ens</hi> in him, <hi>viz.</hi> one from the darke world awakened and stirred up by the desire of the Serpent, and Devill; and one from the Heavenly <hi>limus</hi> which is <hi>now</hi> stirring in man, wherein the free will taketh the word that is, whence it doth generate a fruit out of the divine Expressed, and formed word, which is againe received of the <hi>likenesse,</hi> either in heaven or hell, that is in the darkness or light.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. For the two worlds are in each other as one, the <hi>wicked</hi> form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and maketh [for] God a <hi>good</hi> word in his wrath unto Death, <hi>viz.</hi> unto the sting of Death, and Hell; and the <hi>holy</hi> man formeth and maketh [to] God, out of his good <hi>Ens,</hi> a <hi>good</hi> word unto the holy <hi>life,</hi> and Operation, as the Scripture speaketh very clearely: <hi>the holy is to God a sweet savour unto life, and the wicked a sweet savour unto death, viz.</hi> to the darke world.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. Now every man is a creatour [or framer] of his <hi>words powers, and Doings</hi>; that which he maketh and frameth out of his free will, the same is received as a worke of the manifested word, into each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties likeness.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. For <hi>Gods word</hi> is <hi>also manifest</hi> in the darke world; but onely according to its property, as the Scripture saith, <hi>such as the people is, such a God they also have:</hi> Gods word is manifest in all things, in each thing according to its <hi>Ens,</hi> whence the free will proceedeth; the <hi>free will</hi> is the creatour or maker, whereby the creature maketh [formeth and worketh] in the <note n="r" place="margin">Or revealed.</note> manifested Word.</p>
                           <p n="24">

There is no hearb or thing whatsoever that can be named, wherein there lieth not an <hi>Ens</hi> from the <hi>manifested Word</hi> of God, an <hi>Ens</hi> both according to Gods Love, and Anger, according to the dark and light world: for this visible world was breathed forth out of this same <hi>Word</hi>; now each <hi>Ens</hi> of the forth-breathed Word hath a <hi>free</hi> will againe to breath forth out of its <hi>Ens</hi> a <note n="s" place="margin">Its owne likenesse.</note> likenesse according to it selfe.</p>
                           <p n="25">25.

Therefore Christ saith, <hi>unlesse that ye be converted, and become as children, ye cannot see the Kingdome of God:</hi> the free will must wholly goe out from the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Serpent, and enter againe, in the Spirit of Christ, into its heavenly <hi>Ens,</hi> which did disappeare in <hi>Adam,</hi> and againe awaken and stir up this <hi>Ens</hi> in the hunger of its desire, that it also may be againe awakened and borne unto a living <hi>Ens,</hi> in the new Regenerated <hi>Word</hi> in the humanity of Christ, and which did araise, and powerfully quicken it selfe, in the great Love-property in the <hi>mans</hi> property, in the <hi>person</hi> of Christ: where also, the free will becomes a new innocent childe, and neither willeth nor letteth in the Serpents Craft, otherwise the free will <hi>cannot</hi> forme, and manifest Gods holy Word in it selfe, the free will must draw onely out of the good <hi>Ens,</hi> if it will worke and <hi>live</hi> in the holy Word.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. Now understand aright our writing concerning the Serpents Craft, and its Adorned Art, and false vertue; (I say) understand our very profound and high meaning, opened out of the <hi>Counsell of God,</hi> thus: The Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> and Originall was a virgin of heavenly pomp, a Queen of Heaven, and Princess of the Beeings of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and formed in the <hi>Fiat</hi> of the divine desire, through the fire in the light: in like manner as Hierarch <hi>Lucifer</hi> was so, and Prince
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:29914:55"/>
                              <hi>Lucifer</hi> sate in heavenly pompe in the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> who had infected the <hi>Ens</hi> out of which the Serpent was created, and therein awakened the darke worlds property, <hi>viz.</hi> the Centre of the Eternall nature, whence evill, and good doe take their <hi>Originall,</hi> but when the Good did in the Fire, sever it selfe into the light, and the Evill into the darkness, the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> which vvas good, was then infected, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and possessed, with the darknesse; and from hence cometh its <hi>Craft.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="30">30. For even such a craft the Devill desired, which also tooke him in the <hi>Eternall-Speaking</hi> word, in such a property, and confirmed him therein to<note n="y" place="margin">For ever.</note> Eternity; for it is also a <hi>Wonder</hi> in God, how an Evill could come to be, out of a Good, that the good might be known, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, and the creature might learne to <hi>feare before God,</hi> and hold <note n="z" place="margin">Willingly submit to.</note> still to the Spirit of God; that he onely might act, and worke in the Eternall-Speaking Word, and make, and doe what he please with and by the creature.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. And to <hi>this End Lucifer</hi> was swallowed up in the wrath, seeing his free will went forth from the Resignation and departed from Gods Spirit, into the <hi>Centre,</hi> to be its owne selfe-full maker and creatour; that the Angells now have an <note n="a" place="margin">Warning, <hi>Text,</hi> Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glasse.</note> example in this revolted fallen Prince and Puissant <hi>Hierarch</hi>; for the Kingdome of God, which is [peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly] called Gods Kingdome, stands in the deepest Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and love, and not at all in the wrathfull fires-might, but in the lights Ardent might, <hi>viz. in Power.</hi>

                           <p n="32">32. But the Devills Kingdome, after which he longed, and laboured, stood in the <hi>wrathfull</hi> fires-might, but the same was <note n="b" place="margin">In the bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Essence or Substance.</note> 
                              <hi>Essentially</hi> taken from him in his place, and he was spevved out into the eternall hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the darkness.</p>
                           <p n="33">33. And that he had infected and possessed the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Serpent which was so crafty, may be seen in its Body, which is onely a dry, hungry <hi>Skin,</hi> and fills it selfe with poyson in the <hi>Taile,</hi> in which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty the great craft ariseth, and <hi>therefore</hi> the Serpent carrieth the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Taile, which may soone be pulled off, in that the same in the beginning was introduced into its virgin-like <hi>Ens.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="34">34. For the Serpent is therefore called a Virgine according to the Right of Eternity, because it hath <hi>both</hi> Tinctures; which is in <hi>no</hi> kinde of earthly creatures besides; but it is now in the curse of God, yet if the <hi>Artist</hi> knew what its pearle was, he would rejoyce at it: yet by reason of the worlds false desire, which seeketh onely the <hi>false magick,</hi> it remaines Hidden, also [it is not manifest] that the wicked may beare his <hi>Rebuke.</hi>

                           <p n="34">34. For the Pearle of the whole world is <hi>trodden</hi> under foot; and there is nothing more common then the same, yet it is hidden; so that the holy <hi>Ens</hi> might not be introduced into an <hi>ungodly one</hi> which is not worthy of it; and so Gods power and Word in the Virgin-like Essence be thereby brought into a Serpentine [<hi>Ens</hi>] as it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in the Serpent: <hi>enough</hi> for our schoole-fellowes.</p>
                           <p n="36">36. Thus we doe fundamentally understand the Originall of <hi>Sins</hi> birth; how Sin was borne, and opened in the <hi>Humane</hi> Word; and how God is provoked to anger in his Expressed Word by the Humane

Re-expressing: for man beareth the Word which created Heaven and Earth in his <hi>Ens,</hi> for the same word is brought to Substance.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. Now God hath inspired into mans <hi>Ens, viz.</hi> into the formed Compacted Word, <hi>the living Soule, viz.</hi> the <note n="c" place="margin">Or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</note> Originall out of all the three Principles, as a Spirit of the formed Word; this understanding hath now power and might to re-conceive, and to Generate againe a formall <hi>Voice</hi> in the <hi>Ens, viz.</hi> in the Formed Compacted Word.</p>
                           <p n="38">38. But being the Serpents craft, <hi>viz.</hi> the Devills introduced desire, became manifest in the <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve, viz.</hi> in their Compacted, and formed Word: thereupon the free will doth now draw forth from this Serpents Essence, meere <hi>Adders</hi> poyson, and death, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its word therein, unless the holy <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Seed of the woman</hi> be again awakened in the new-borne Love of God in Christ; then the free will may conceive in this same holy <hi>Ens,</hi> and <hi>bruise the head of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> and Devills <hi>Ens</hi> in the Anger of God; that is, reject and abhorre the evill will, which desireth to <hi>Idea,</hi> and imprint it selfe, from the Serpents, <hi>Ens</hi> in the formation of the words, and bruise it in the will of the <hi>Thoughts,</hi> with the <hi>Ens</hi> of the woman, <hi>viz.</hi> of Christ, and esteeme it as the Devills Mire, and Dirt, which in the children of God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Combate and strife between the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Serpent in the flesh, and betvveene the Regenerate <hi>Ens</hi> of the heavenly part.</p>
                           <p n="39">39. Also know this: Every Thought which is formed in the <hi>Will,</hi> so that a man consenteth unto lies, or any thing else which is false, or if his will hath <hi>conceived</hi> [and contrived] any thing that is uniust, and he bringeth that contrivance into the desire, that he would very willingly doe it, or express it in the <hi>false Evill</hi> formed word, if he could or knew how, and yet must let it alone, either for feare, or shame sake; this same is all <hi>Sin</hi>; for the will hath formed it selfe in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="40">40. But understand it well; if a good will doth <note n="d" place="margin">Or forme it selfe.</note> conceive in a good <hi>Ens,</hi> and yet the <hi>evill</hi> desire doth adhere to it, and willeth to poyson the good; if then [I say] the good conceived will overcometh the evill, and casts it out, that the evill cannot also be formed or received into the Compaction or Substance; it is <hi>no</hi> Sin; and though the evill desire which adhereth to the good be <hi>Sin,</hi> yet if the good will doth not close with it and bring it into <hi>Substance,</hi> but rejects it out of the good will, as an Evill, then the sinfull desire cannot come into <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> and the good will hath not hereby wrought any Evill, if it hath not consented to the Craft of the Serpent.</p>
                           <p n="41">41. Every <hi>Sin</hi> is borne of the strange <hi>Ens</hi>; if the free vvill departs from the <hi>Ens,</hi> vvherein God hath created it; then the Sin which is conceived in the will in false desire, and brought to Essence in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the will (so that man <hi>would</hi> faine doe <hi>wickedly</hi> or <hi>unjustly</hi> if he could but bring his intent to pass) is also great in the sight of God; but if it proceeds so far as to hurt, and injure any one, by word or deed, then the Sin is <hi>double</hi>; for it is formed in its owne <hi>Ens,</hi> and formeth it selfe also in that whereinto it introduceth the false word, so far as the false word in its Speaking findes a <hi>place</hi> of Rest to work [and bring forth its evill fruit.]</p>
                           <p n="42">42. And therefore the <hi>holy word</hi> shall judge the False; as also at the

end of this time the holy word shall cast out from it selfe all <hi>false</hi>

                           <p n="43">43. All those that take, or conceive the word in them, in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish, and Serpentine <hi>Ens,</hi> and <hi>use</hi> it against Gods children, in whom the holy <hi>Ens</hi> is manifest, and doe stir up also an <hi>offence</hi> [or occasion of stumbling] in the children of God, that the free will in <hi>them</hi> doth also conceive it selfe in the Serpents <hi>Ens, viz.</hi> in Anger, and averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, where alwayes the holy <hi>Ens</hi> doth likewise forme it selfe, and the Spirit of zeale ariseth: these false authors beginners and Causers, doe all <hi>sin against the holy Ghost.</hi>

                           <p n="44">44. For they doe extreamely despight, and defye him, that <hi>he</hi> must even proceed forth, through the anger of the children of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is stirred up, and oftentimes shewes himselfe in the <hi>Turba</hi> of the children of God, and falles upon the neck of the wicked; as may bee seen by <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and also by <hi>Elisha,</hi> who cursed the Boyes, <hi>that the Beares came out and tore them to pieces</hi>; for thus the sword of God comes forth, through the mouth of the <hi>Saints</hi>; if the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be extreamly displeased, and set into a fiery zeale: then he awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>Turba magna,</hi> which draweth the Sword against a wicked people, and devoureth them.</p>
                           <p n="45">45. Thus understand it in its full scope, and meaning; Man hath Gods Word <hi>in him,</hi> which created him; understand; the word hath imprinted, and formed it selfe with the Creating; both in its <hi>Holiness,</hi> and also in the <hi>Anger</hi>; and that also <note n="f" place="margin">Or out of.</note> in the outward world; for the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, or the Earth it selfe was amassed and compacted, through the word; so that the formed <hi>Word</hi> which tooke its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the divine desire, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> is an exhalation forth-breathed from the Spirit of God out of Love and Anger: therefore it is evill and good, but the Evill was <hi>hidden,</hi> and as it were wholly swallowed up in the light, as the night in the day.</p>
                           <p n="46">46. But the sinfull desire in <hi>Lucifer</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> hath awakened the Anger, so that it is become <hi>essentially</hi> manifest: now the Gates of the formed Word both in Love, and Anger, doe <hi>stand open</hi> in the earth, and also in the <hi>limus</hi> of the earth, <hi>viz.</hi> in man, and also in the free will of man, whatsoever he doth now forme and amasse in his <hi>free will,</hi> that he hath made, be it either evill or good.</p>
                           <p n="47">47. But now the Evill shall in the judgement of God be separated from the Good; and in what part [either of the evill or good] the humane <hi>understanding, viz.</hi> the soule shall be found, thereinto it must enter, with all whatsoever it hath done, as into its owne made habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and therefore Christ saith; <hi>their workes shall follow them, and be purged</hi> (or proved) <hi>by the fire</hi>:<note place="margin">

                              <hi>bethinke</hi> and ponder with himselfe, before he intendeth [or conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the will] to doe any thing; and by no meanes <hi>consent</hi> unto any false backbitings or approve by a yea, neither privately nor openly.</p>

For all forged tales, and sharp taunts, proceed from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens</hi>; all Cursings, and swearings, and stinging girds, proceed from the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi>; yea though they be but in <hi>Jest,</hi> yet the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens</hi> hath stuck it selfe with them to the good, and compacted them with the word: therefore Christ saith, <hi>sweare not at all: let your speech be yea yea, nay, nay; for whatsoever is more then these cometh of evill</hi>;<note place="margin">

                           <p n="50">50. All Cursers, and swearers, have introduced their free will, <hi>viz.</hi> the poore soul, into the vanity of the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> and forme their Curses, and Oaths, vvith all their lewd wanton talke, which is wrought, in the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> and sow into Gods anger: and on the contrary all Gods children, who are in right earnest, doe forme their words in the holy <hi>ens,</hi> especially the <hi>Prayer,</hi> when the free will of the soul, doth amasse or conceive it selfe in the holy <hi>Ens</hi> (which is opened by Christs humanity) then it <hi>formeth</hi> the true essentiall word of God in it selfe, so as it comes to <hi>Substance.</hi>

                           <p n="51">51. Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>the Spirit of God doth mightily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for us in the sight of God as it pleaseth him</hi>; for the Spirit of God is formed in the desire of the holy word; he is taken (or apprehended) and this taking or receiving is that, which Christ said, <hi>he would give us his flesh for food, and his bloud for drink.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="52">52. The soules will taketh Christs <hi>Ens,</hi> and in Christs <hi>Ens,</hi> the word of Christ became man, which the soules desire, or <hi>Fiat</hi> doth receive or impresse into its holy <hi>Ens</hi> disappeared in <hi>Adam</hi>; and here <hi>Adam</hi> ariseth in Christ, and becomes Christ [the second <hi>Adam</hi> or the Anointed one] according to the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> and divine word, and from this <hi>Ens</hi> of Christ, proceeds forth, divine knowledge, out of <hi>the word of God.</hi>

                           <p n="53">53. Thus the children of God are <hi>the Temple of the holy Ghost which dwelleth in them,</hi> and so they speake Gods Word; and without this there is no true knowing or willing, but meere fable, and Babel, a Confusion of the crafty Serpent.</p>
                           <p n="54">54. Therefore Christ called the Pharisees, <hi>a Seed of Serpents, and a generation of Vipers,</hi> and although they were the High Priests, yet he knew them to be so in their essence, for they had formed their will in the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi>; they carried the words of <hi>Moses</hi> in their mouth, and therein they mixed the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi>; as many still doe to this day; where the incarnate Devill carrieth <hi>Gods word</hi> upon his tongue; and yet doth onely hide the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> thereby, and introduceth the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall <hi>Ens</hi> into the <hi>litterall</hi> word, whence <hi>Babell</hi> the mother of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall whoredome is borne, a meere verball contention, and wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about Words, where the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Devill and the Serpent, doth oppose the divine <hi>Ens</hi> in the Formed Divine Word.</p>
                           <p n="55">55. But so it must be, that the formed and Conceived Word in Gods children may be <hi>stirred up,</hi> whetted and exercised, and the truth come forth to light; Deare brethren: this is the <hi>Inheritance</hi> which we have received from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>; and that is the cause that the Body must

Dye, and wholly putrifie, and entet againe into its first <hi>Ens</hi>; for the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> must be wholly done away, <hi>it cannot inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi>

                           <p n="56">56. The first <hi>Ens</hi> in the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth which was coagulated in in the <hi>Verbum Fiat,</hi> must be wholly <hi>renewed</hi> in the Spirit of Christ, if it will possesse the Kingdome of God, but if it remaineth captivated in the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> it shall never be any more manifest, understand the holy <hi>Ens</hi> which disappeared in <hi>Adam,</hi> and was captivated in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens,</hi> whereby Death came into the flesh.</p>
                           <p n="57">57. Therefore a man must <hi>consider</hi> what he speaketh, thinketh, and doth, least he conceive his Thoughts in the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> and frame a will in the Minde, in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Serpent; for else the Devill doth set himselfe therein, and hatcheth a Basilisk, <hi>viz.</hi> an hellish forme in the word.</p>
                           <p n="58">58. For all wrath which is conceived in man for Revenge, doth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily arise in its <hi>Centre</hi> out of the nature and property of the darke world, <hi>viz.</hi> in Gods anger, and formes it selfe further in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens</hi> to <hi>Substance</hi>; let it be what zeale it will, if it brings it selfe into a wrath to its <hi>owne Revenge,</hi> it is formed in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Serpent, and is devillish.</p>
                           <p n="59">59. And though the same were a Prophet, and an Apostle, and yet would bring himselfe in the wrath to his <hi>owne Revenge,</hi> then this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is formed from the Anger of God in the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> and goeth into the wrath of God; and the <hi>Anger</hi> of God is therein zealous, which oftentimes doth so stir up and forme it selfe in the <hi>holy</hi> children of God, that <note n="*" place="margin">The Saints.</note> they must against their purposed will, bring down the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> upon the house of the wicked, also upon his Body and Soule, as may be seene by <hi>Moses,</hi> upon <hi>Chorah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> whom the Earth swallovved up; so also by <hi>Elias</hi> in the Fire, concerning the two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines over fiftie, whom the fire devoured, also by <hi>Elisha,</hi> and many other Prophets.</p>
                           <p n="60">60. And there are many remarkable examples to be found concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this in in the holy Histories, how oftentimes the children of God have been <hi>forced</hi> to carry the Sword of the <hi>Turba</hi> in them: a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample whereof we see in <hi>Sampson,</hi> and also in <hi>Joshua</hi> with his warres, and likevvise in <hi>Abraham</hi>; how the zeale of God did enkindle it selfe in them; that they in their spirit of zeale have oftentimes awakened the <hi>Turba magna</hi> in the Anger of God, and raised great Rebukes judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and plagues, upon whole Countries; as <hi>Moses</hi> in Egpit did with the plagues upon the Egyptians.</p>

But we must heere distinguish, if the zeale of <hi>God</hi> should awaken it selfe in an holy man without his purposed will, and give him the Sword of Gods anger) such a one differs much from those who in their <hi>owne Thoughts</hi> contrive and plot in the wrath, and introduce the Conceived or purposed will into the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> and make it to Substance, for that is <hi>Sin,</hi> yea though the <note n="g" place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Saint.</note> most holy man should doe it.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. Therefore Christ so emphatically and punctually teacheth us in the new birth, <hi>Love Humility</hi> and <hi>Meeknesse</hi>; and would that a Christian, should not at all Revenge,<note place="margin">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29914:57"/>
is angry with his brother is guilty of the judgement</hi>; for the Anger is a conception in the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> which must be cut off, by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, from the Good Being: <hi>and whosoever shall say unto his brother Racha, shall be in danger of the Counsell:</hi> for the desire of <note n="*" place="margin">Or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</note> 
                              <hi>Racha</hi> ariseth in the Centre of the darke fiery wheele of the Eternall nature; therefore in the fire-soule there is a forme of the fire-<hi>word</hi> [in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner] of a wheele like a madnesse; and the soules fiery-forme stands in the <hi>Racha</hi> as a mad furious wheele, which confounds the Essence in the Body, and destroyes or shatters in peeces the understanding: for every <hi>Racha</hi> desireth to destroy Gods Image: thus the soule hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the wheele of the Eternall nature, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Centre of the horrible Anxious birth; as is before mentioned concerning the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the birth of nature.</p>
                           <p n="63">63. Moreover Christ saith; <hi>Whosoever saith to his brother thou foole shall be in danger of hellfire</hi>: this is thus wrought, when the Conceived will hath formed it selfe in the furious wrath of Gods anger, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced it into the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> then it standeth in the furious wheele as mad, and if it doth now <hi>purposely</hi> goe on, and so forme the word, and casts or speaks it forth against its brother, and enkindles in him also an hatefull enmity in the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> the same <hi>burneth</hi> in his Expressed Word in the fire of Gods anger, and he is guilty of it, for he hath enkindled it in his <hi>Racha.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="64">64. Therefore said Christ, <hi>if thou wilt offer thy Gift, goe first, and be reconciled to thy offended brother</hi> or neighbour, for otherwise he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>his wrath</hi> into thy offering, and withholdeth thee in thy desire towards God, that thou <hi>canst not</hi> reach the holy <hi>Ens</hi> which else wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away the <hi>Turba</hi> in thy Enkindled vanity.</p>
                           <p n="65">65. For, the Word <hi>foole,</hi> is in it selfe in the Essence, nothing else but an enkindled wrathfull fiery wheele, an outragious madness; and he that so calleth his neighbour <hi>without a cause,</hi> he hath brought forth a word in the fire-wheele in <hi>Gods wrath,</hi> and is guilty of it; for the forth-produced word is arisen out of the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Soule and Body.</p>
                           <p n="66">66. Every word vvhen it is formed; doth first awaken its owne <hi>Ens,</hi> whence it taketh its originall, then it leads it selfe forth through the Counsell of the five Senses against its brother: now whosoever <hi>useth</hi> such a wrathfull devouring fire-word against his brother, he soweth into the Anger of God and is in danger to <hi>reape the fruit</hi> which he hath so sown, when it springeth up, and groweth.</p>
                           <p n="67">67. Therefore take heed and beware O Man what thou thinkest speakest, or <hi>desirest</hi> to doe, looke vvell alwayes in what zeale thou standest, whether it be divine, or onely of thy own poysonfull nature! thou Father, thou mother, thou brother, and Sister, which proceed and come from one <hi>bloud,</hi> from one <hi>Ens,</hi> and mutually Assimulate each with other as a tree in its branches: thinke and consider what kinde of Sound [or tune] thou introducest into the vitall <hi>Ens</hi> of thy fellow-twiggs and branches, whether it be Gods Love-word, or his Word of Anger, if yee doe not destroy the introduced Evill againe with Love, and introduce againe the Love-<hi>Ens</hi> into the Anger [to overcome and reconcile it] then the <hi>Substance</hi> must come <note n="*" place="margin">Or before.</note> into the

                           <p n="68">68. And therefore God hath introduced his <hi>holy Word</hi> out of his deepest Love <hi>againe</hi> into the humane <hi>Ens,</hi> being the same was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the Anger, that man <hi>might</hi> conceive [or forme his will and doings] againe in the introduced Love of God in Christ Jesus, and in him destroy the wrathfull anger: and therefore Christ teacheth us that <hi>he is the Gate which leads us into God,</hi> that <hi>he is the way and the light,</hi> whereupon vve may enter in to God, and in him Regenerate [or quicken again to life] the holy <hi>Ens.</hi>

                           <p n="69">69. And therefore Christ <hi>forbids us to be angry</hi>; and conceive our will and word in the <hi>Revenge</hi>: but <hi>if any one did curse us we ought to blesse him; and if any did strike us, him we should not resist</hi>; least our <hi>Turba</hi> should be stirred up in the new-borne Holy <hi>Ens</hi> of Christ, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Serpents craft, iniquity, and <hi>Ens,</hi> thereinto.</p>
                           <p n="70">70. But <hi>we should be as children in Love,</hi> who understand nothing of the Serpents craft; therefore we declare in divine Knowledge, as a dear and pretious truth, that all contention, covetousnesse, Envy, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, War, false desire, or whatsoever may be of the like name [and <hi>nature</hi>] doth take its originall out of the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <note n="h" place="margin">Or devoure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing property or wolvish gulfe.</note> Revenge of the wrath of God, out of the darke world, and is brought in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens</hi> to a Substance, wherein the false Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> will behold and contemplate it selfe, in Pride.</p>

                           <p n="75">75.

                           <p n="76">76.

                           <p n="77">77.

                           <p n="78">78. <hi>For we come naked into this world, and carry away scarce our shirt with us,</hi> which is the covering of our shame, the Rest we possesse either by <hi>necessity</hi> of Office, or else out of <hi>covetousnesse,</hi> out of the Serpents false desire: Every man should seeke the profit and <hi>preservation</hi> of his neighbour, how he might serve and be helpfull to him; as one branch of a tree giveth its power Essence and vertue to the other, and they grow and bear fruit in <hi>one</hi> desire; even so we are all one Tree in <hi>Adam.</hi>

                              <note n="o" place="margin">Or whorish property.</note> [<hi>matrix</hi>] thereinto, infected with the Devills will and desire.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. Now this holy Virgin-like <hi>matrix</hi> in <hi>Eve</hi> was captivated by the monstrous property, and the Image of the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> did disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in her, and in this heavenly <hi>Ens,</hi> understand in the Right vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-like Seed of chastity, Sanctity, and Purity, which was captived in <hi>Eve</hi> by the monstrous Serpent, and beastiall <hi>Whores</hi>-desire, the word of God did <note n="p" place="margin">Inspire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse or recall or apply it selfe as a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same, that is, put or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise it selfe.</note> inhest it selfe with the deare pretious and holy Name <hi>Jesus</hi>; that it would againe introduce [a] living heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> into this captived disappeared <hi>Ens</hi> and bruise the head of the Serpents <hi>Ens, viz.</hi> the Whores Monster, and mortifie its desire, and cast away the Whores-Image [or Bastard] and over-povver and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the Enkindled anger of God in this virgin-like <hi>matrix</hi> with the deepest Love of God, and wholly kill and <note n="q" place="margin">Or doe away.</note> null the Monster [of the Serpent in flesh and bloud], and this is that which God said, <hi>the Seed of the woman shall bruise the Serpents head.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="38">38. Understand it aright, the virgin-like <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Eve</hi> in the word of God, should doe it in the Name and sweet power of Jesus: the Seed included in the Covenant of God, whereout the Virgin-child is borne as the <hi>dew out of the morning,</hi> that (I say) should, and must doe it.</p>
                           <p n="39">39. For the childe which is from the bloud of the man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>shall not inherit the Kingdome of Heaven</hi>; but that which is [borne] of the virgin-like <hi>Ens,</hi> in the Ayme of the Covenant, out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Word of God; the childe of the man and woman is a <hi>Monstrum,</hi> and must dye, and putrifie, and rot in the earth; but the virgin-like <hi>Ens</hi> which lyeth <hi>hidden</hi> in this <hi>Monstrum,</hi> is the true <hi>Seed,</hi> of which the children of Christ are borne, yea even in this life time, for the life of this childe, is the true <hi>Faith</hi> and great divine desire.</p>
                           <p n="40">40. This virgin-like childe doth live in Christs children in the Spirit and flesh of Christ, in a spirituall body outwardly covered with the <hi>Monstrum</hi> in the childe of the whore and Serpent; there is no man, which doth not outwardly carry on him the <hi>Serpents childe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="41">41. But the virgins-childe, borne of the divine virgin-like <hi>Ens,</hi> of Jesus, doth <hi>not</hi> live in <hi>all:</hi> there is indeed in many an one a glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incentive thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Weak Faith,</hi> and <note n="r" place="margin">Or godly.</note> divine desire; but the true holy, and pretious life of the virginity is not borne, it standeth <hi>captivated</hi> in the judgement of God.</p>
                           <p n="42">42. Yet <hi>well</hi> for those, who have but an incentive in them; to those we give this direction; that their Soules desire should in the Spirit of Christ <note n="s" place="margin">dip, plunge or baptize.</note> dive it selfe into the divine <hi>Incentive</hi>; and with the fire-desire enkindle that Incentive, and also forsake and hate the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents Monster, and bastard, and introduce their great hunger and thirst into the virgin-like <hi>Ens,</hi> into the Word of Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> and

into the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the Covenant <hi>viz.</hi> into the humanity of Christ, and ever mortifie, and trample under foot the Whores Monster in the will of the desire, as a <hi>venemous</hi> stinging evill Serpent, a false bastard, that <hi>cannot inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> and is onely an hinderance to the Virgins childe.</p>
                           <p n="43">43. For <hi>the word of the promise</hi> in the Covenant would not incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate it selfe into the mans Tincture, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Souls-fire-<hi>Ens,</hi> but into the womans, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Lights Tincture; into the virgin-like Centre, which should have brought forth <hi>magically</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>; even into the heavenly <hi>Matrix</hi> of the holy pregnatresse; in which lights Tincture the fiery Soules <hi>Ens</hi> was weaker, then in the Mans Fire-<hi>Ens.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="44">44. In this Lights <hi>Ens</hi> God would araise the Fire-<hi>Ens, viz.</hi> the true Soule, and as it were beget it anew, as may be seen in the person of Christ, according to the humanity, who in this virgin-like <hi>Ens</hi> did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume a manly fire-soul from the womans property, from the female virgin-like Seed, wholly <hi>contrary</hi> to natures proper and peculiar Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for the Image of God is a Man-like virgin, neither woman nor man.</p>
                           <p n="45">45. And if a man will rightly consider both properties according to the divine property, then let him ascribe the <hi>male</hi> to God the Father, <hi>viz.</hi> to the first Principle, where Gods word doth manifest it selfe with the fireworld, which is the first Centre of the <hi>Creature</hi>; and the <hi>Female</hi> let him ascribe to God the Son, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Second Principle, where the divine eternall word doth manifest it selfe in the light of Love, and openeth another Centre in the Love-desire, and cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fires-Centre; in manner, as the <hi>fire</hi> produceth a <hi>light</hi>; and the light [is] a great meeknesse of an oyly, watry, and aëry property, which property the fire draweth in again, whence it receiveth its shining <hi>Lustre,</hi> and also its life to burne, else it would smother and suffocate.</p>
                           <p n="46">46. And as these three, <hi>viz.</hi> the fire, light, and aire, have one onely Originall, yet they give a very evident <hi>distinction</hi> in their property; the like also we are here to minde: into this property in the life of mans Soul, the most sweet <hi>name JESVS</hi> hath incorporated it selfe in the word of promise; as into the likenesse, which stood in the lights Centre of the heavenly <hi>matrix, viz.</hi> in the Right virgin-like <hi>Ens,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired out of the lights property into <hi>Adam</hi>; and hath awaked [it selfe] in the same <hi>limus,</hi> as a true Centre of the Second Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Angelicall world, a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="47">47. Into this property the word of God did <hi>betroth</hi> and espouse it selfe in the Covenant; for it was opened out of the holy Word in <hi>Adam</hi>; God would <hi>not</hi> forsake his holy Manifested Word, which had introduced it selfe with the Creating of <hi>Adam</hi> into an <hi>Ens,</hi> which the Devill obscured and darkned in the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> from the Anger, but would againe open the same, and thereby bruise the head of the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29914:63"/>
Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> and beget the humane Soule out of this divine <hi>Ens,</hi> to a manlike virgin, <hi>viz.</hi> to an Angell, Servant, and childe of God.</p>
                           <p n="48">48. We doe not meane, that this holy <hi>Ens</hi> did receive the Serpents desire into it selfe, when <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> became monstrous, no; but it <hi>disappeared</hi>; yet the soul according to the first Principle, took it into the fires property, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Fiat,</hi> and introduced the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens</hi> with the desire of the <hi>Fiat</hi> into the Earthly <hi>Limus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon out of the <hi>One</hi> onely Element <hi>foure</hi> Elements were manifest in man.</p>
                           <p n="49">49. Therefore the virgin-like <hi>Ens</hi> of the <hi>One</hi> onely Element must now bruise the head of the introduced Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> in the <hi>foure</hi> Elements; and the man of the <hi>foure</hi> Elements must dye and putrifie, and the first [man] must returne at the last Day cloathed with the Virgin-like <hi>Ens</hi> in the <hi>One</hi> onely Element wherein all things lye in equall weight, [or perfect harmony.]</p>
                           <p n="50">50. For this virgin-like <hi>Ens,</hi> new-born in the Spirit of Christ, dyeth not any more, although the foure Elements man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Image of this world dyeth, but it liveth in Gods Kingdome; and shall in the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the dead embrace and put on the <hi>limus</hi> of the earth,<note place="margin">Note what shall rise againe at the last Day.</note> 
                              <hi>vix.</hi> the third Principle, as a Garment of the wonder-deeds of God, but the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> remaineth in the Earth; and shall be burnt away at the last Day through the fire, from the pure <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth; where the dark world shall devoure it with all its <hi>Workes.</hi>

                           <p n="51">51. Thus we herein understand very clearly; how God out of great Love, hath <hi>promised the Serpent-bruiser</hi> to the fallen man, and espoused, and betrothed it unto the virgin-like, and disappeared Centre, and given in it selfe, therewith, for an <hi>help,</hi> and companion; for when they were fallen from God, and had made themselves mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, then the Image out of the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, became whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brutall, and lived in opposition, in distemper, in sicknesse, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in heat, and cold, as all other <hi>Beasts.</hi>

                           <p n="52">52. Now therefore God told them what their labour work and employment should be in this world, <hi>viz. that they should bring forth children in Sorrow</hi> with painfull smart, in trouble, and distress, <hi>and eat the hearb of the field,</hi> and now cloath their beastiall Image in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moile, and cumbring care in toile and labour, untill the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments man in the beastiall Serpents Image should againe be broken and dissolved, <hi>and returne unto the earth, from whence it was taken,</hi> and extracted as a <hi>limus.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Curse</hi> is nothing else, but the Holy Element hiding of it selfe, <hi>viz.</hi> the holy <hi>Ens,</hi> which budded forth through the Earth, and bare fruit, and held the property of the foure Elements as 'twere captive in it self; [did withdraw or closely conceale it selfe]; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the earth <hi>hid it selfe</hi> from the Earth; the holy Tincture, from the awakened vanity, <hi>viz.</hi> the heavenly Part, which was from the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> (did keep Secret) from the Part in the Curse, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the darke world.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Thus the heavenly part was a mystery unto man, and so <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained</hi> in the Curse between time and Eternity, half dead as to the heavenly part, yet anew embraced with the <hi>promise</hi> in the Ayme of the Covenant, and as to the earthly [part] strongly bound, to the band of the Stars, and foure Elements, infected with the <hi>distemper</hi> of the Serpent and the Devill, very hard tyed vvith three strong chaines from which he cannot get free till the <hi>totall</hi> dissolution of his earthly Body; for the Curse of the Earth and the Serpent forced also into the earthly man, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. For God said, <hi>thou art Earth and unto Earth thou shalt returne</hi>;<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Verse</hi> 19.</note> for when the desire of the <hi>limus</hi> of the Extract of the Earth, (<hi>viz.</hi> of the outward man) did enter againe into the Earth, and Imagine after the <hi>earthly</hi> fruit, then the Devill infected this desire by the property of the Serpent, and in each desire is the <hi>Fiat,</hi> which doth <note n="t" place="margin">Or amasse it into fashion forme and figure.</note> Impresse and make the desire essentiall; thus the earthly hunger became at this instant wholly earthly; <hi>therefore</hi> God said now unto him: <hi>thou must turne againe to Earth from whence thou wast taken</hi>; for the heavenly, disappeared in the earthly, as the Gold is disappeared in Lead.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Thus an Earthly body is now <hi>Sowne</hi> into the Earth, and the Earth receives it as its owne propriety: but the <hi>Ens</hi> which is from the Eternity (which cannot be destroyed) lyeth <hi>in</hi> this earthly <note n="u" place="margin">Or enterred.</note> sowne body; nothing is broken or dissolved but the grosse beast, <hi>viz.</hi> the being [or Substance] of time; As a <hi>fixt</hi> metall is not destroyed [or corrupted] in the Earth; even so also the <hi>fixt</hi> part of the humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and as the <hi>Artist</hi> brings forth an excellent Gold out of the Earth, so likewise the humane Gold lyeth <hi>buried</hi> in the earth, and <hi>waiteth</hi> onely for the Artist to raise it up.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. And as there is a <hi>various,</hi> and manifold diversity of metalline property in the Earth; so likewise of the <hi>Ens</hi> of humane property; therefore all things shall be proved through the Fire; what kinde of <hi>property</hi> every one hath in this Time assumed to himselfe, and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on his Body, (<hi>viz.</hi> with the desire of the <hi>Fiat) that shall be tryed in the fire,</hi> whether or no he hath impressed a <hi>fixt</hi> stedfast property from the divine <hi>Ens</hi> into himselfe, or an hellish <hi>beastiall</hi> one; all this shall be tryed and proved in the Fire of God, and as the <hi>Ens</hi> is, in each

                           <p n="8">8. Now if a man hath in this life time impressed into himselfe [a] divine <hi>Ens</hi> by earnest <hi>Faith</hi> and divine desire; understand by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul, introduced into the mortall part of the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, then it lyeth shut up in the mortall part, yet as a glimmering <hi>incentive</hi> which longeth and laboureth to burne and shine, or as the pretious Gold lyeth shut up in a grosse drossy Oar, or in Lead, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely for the <hi>Artist</hi> to come and release it, even so likewise shall the delivery, and releasment of mans body be, out of the Earth.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Now also we doe herein understand <hi>the body of sicknesse,</hi> and the <hi>Physitian</hi> [or Curer thereof], for when the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> did disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and was captivated with the earthly, as the Gold in the Lead; then the outward <hi>Astrum</hi> awakened in the Body; and now as the outward <hi>Astrum</hi> doth mutually destroy and ruine one anothers <hi>Ens,</hi> and change it into another <hi>Ens</hi> according to the greatest and most predominant power; so likewise the humane Minde (which is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall <hi>Astrum</hi>) is hereby governed and ruled, and the Body also; and is thereby brought into Strange desire and lust; whereby man doth <hi>weaken</hi> plague, and perplex himselfe; and one introduced <hi>Ens</hi> doth marter weaken and annoy another both through Meat, and thoughts, or cumbring molesting care.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. As we plainly see, that man for the most part doth rack and plague himselfe in the <hi>Astrall</hi> minde, with the desire about that which cannot be his own, which stands not open in his <hi>Astrum</hi>; and his <hi>Astrum</hi> cannot apprehend take or receive it, about this the false introduced desire from the strange <hi>Astrum</hi> doth plague perplex and spend it selfe day and night, whence the great Covetousnesse doth arise, that man doth desire and introduce that into his <hi>Astrum,</hi> which is an hurtfull <hi>poyson,</hi> and plague unto him: and yet with such [in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foisted] strange matter, cannot make any fixt stedfast [thing or being] in him, which may <hi>subsist</hi> in Eternity.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. All whatsoever the own peculiar <hi>Astrum (viz.</hi> the lifes right <hi>Astrum</hi>) doth impresse [or foist] in to it selfe from [or of] a strange <hi>Astrum,</hi> is false, and an adverse will; whence enmity (<hi>viz.</hi> the great <hi>Envy</hi> in nature) doth arise, that the humane Minde willeth to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere over the strange <hi>Ens</hi>; and if he cannot get it, yet that strange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foisted introduced <hi>Ens</hi> burneth in him in a spirituall manner as a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonfull hungry <hi>fire</hi> of Envy; that doth not freely beteeme that to any, that it willeth to possesse it self.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. And though it comes about, that it may through the Serpents Craft, draw it, to it selfe, or possesse it, yet it hath no fundamentall Seat [or true root] in its <hi>Right lifes-Astrum</hi>; for it is not capable of it, but the desire doth advance, and set it up as a King, and vaunt it selfe therewith, as an absolute <hi>peculiar God,</hi> which hath taken upon it selfe, Might over others, and sets it selfe upon <hi>Strange</hi> Authority, and <hi>domination</hi>; whence the Pride of Riches, and Self-assumed Honours, and Domination doth arise, and yet in its ground and originall it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:29914:64"/>
hath taken its rise from the <hi>Devill,</hi> (through the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi>), who also departed with the free will from his owne peculiar <hi>Ens</hi> into strange desire, whereby he hath introduced and awakened in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe (by reason of his strange in-foisted <hi>Ens</hi>) the hellish torment paine and <hi>Sicknesse,</hi> so that his lifes <hi>Astrum,</hi> is wholly departed from its mutuall accord and harmony, and entred into an <hi>Inchanting Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cering</hi> property; and so likewise it goeth with the fallen man.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. But now, Man hath his <hi>Cure,</hi> and the Devill hath <hi>not</hi>; for when the divine providence knew that he would not stand, he caused all manner of <hi>Medicine</hi> [for hunger and health] to grow out of the Earth, to resist and withstand the strange introduced property, both from the <hi>Astrum</hi> and Elements; and for the Cure of the <hi>Minde</hi> God hath given his <hi>holy word</hi>; that the minde should Immerse it selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word, and through the <hi>Power</hi> of the word, continually cast away the introduced Strange Abomination.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. And if it doth not this, but continueth in the strange intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>Ens</hi> (which the Devill continually introduceth through the Serpents Image) then the strange <hi>Ens</hi> becomes Substantiall, and Surrounds the Hidden <hi>Ens</hi> of the heavenly worlds Beeing; and even then that <hi>Ens</hi> which is from and of the divine property, remaineth disappeared in <hi>Death,</hi> and cannot attaine the Place of God; and hence cometh the <hi>eternall death,</hi> as is to be seen in <hi>Lucifer,</hi> in whom also his divine <hi>Ens,</hi> is included or shut up into the <hi>nothing, viz.</hi> into the greatest <hi>Hiddennesse,</hi> [or privation] that he in his Magicall <hi>Astrum</hi> in the creaturall property cannot reach or obtaine the place of God.</p>
                           <p n="15">15.

                           <p n="27">27.

                           <p>WHen God had cursed the Serpent, and the Earth, then the <hi>Beast-Man</hi> was no longer profitable in Paradise, for he could not any more enjoy the fruits of Paradise; therefore he laid upon him the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29914:66"/>
and toil of the world; and <hi>drove him out of the Garden of Eden,</hi> and placed the Cherub with the fire sword of judgement before it, that if the new born virgin-child of the seed of the woman, would again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and enter into Paradise, this <hi>Angel</hi> with the fire-sword should <hi>cut away</hi> the Serpents-beast from it, and not any more suffer <note n="l" place="margin">Understand the beast.</note> it to come into Paradise.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Angel with the fire-sword is the right destroying Angel, who carrieth death and life in his <hi>Sword</hi>; he hath therein Gods Love, and Anger, and when man <hi>Dyeth</hi> in this world, then he cometh before the Gates of Paradise, before this Angel: and even there the poor Soul must <hi>passe</hi> through this [Garden] judgement.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Now if it be captivated in the Anger of God, then it <hi>cannot</hi> passe <hi>through</hi> this judgement, but if it be a virgin child, born of the Seed of the woman, then it may passe <hi>quite</hi> through this Sword, and then the Angel cutteth off the <hi>Beast</hi> begotten of the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> and even then the <hi>Soul</hi> is an Angell of God, and serveth him in his Temple, in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, and expecteth the Day of judgement, <hi>viz.</hi> the Resurrection of the <hi>outward body,</hi> when this Angell with the fiery Sword shall Sever the Earth from the Curse, then the right humane <hi>body</hi> returnes again, for it must <hi>also</hi> passe through this Sword, and the Sword will cut off its Beast, that he may be onely a Man and no more a Beast.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The Speech of <hi>Moses</hi> concerning this Mystery, is wholly hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Earthly Man: for <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh of an <hi>Angel, and Sword</hi>; and albeit the Outward figure was even just so (for so was <hi>Adam</hi> driven out) yet it hath far another A. B. C. <hi>internally,</hi> the naturall man without Gods light understands nothing thereof.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. This Sword is <hi>in</hi> man, when man converteth and entreth into sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his committed Sins, and casteth away the <hi>vanity,</hi> and steppeth into the Infants Shirt, then the morning-<hi>Star</hi> ariseth in the spirit of Christ, in the virgin-like <note n="m" place="margin">Or shut up <hi>Ens.</hi>
                              </note> occluse <hi>Ens,</hi> in the true womans seed.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. And in this Anxious Sorrowfull Gate of true <hi>Repentance,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel standeth with the fire-flaming sword, and the virgin-Bud forceth quite through this fire-sword into Paradise, viz. into the light, into <hi>the life of Christ,</hi> and groweth forth through this sword.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. And now the virgin-child standeth with its faire Rose in the New Plant in Paradise, and the poore <hi>Soul</hi> which begetteth this child, standeth the whole time of this life, under the reach and Swinge of this <hi>fire-sword,</hi> and is fast bound with a band, to the grosse beast in the outward world, where the virgin-child is sufficiently thrust at, and <hi>wounded</hi> with this fire-sword; for the fire-soul, which in the fire-Sword of Gods Anger, is bound to the Serpents Monster, doth daily <hi>amuse</hi> it selfe upon the Serpent-Monster, and <hi>Sinneth</hi>; and even then this fire-sword doth cut away the Sins, and devoures them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods Anger, where they are <hi>examined</hi> and judged.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Therefore the poore virgin-child which is borne out of the Soul must stand under <hi>Christs crosse,</hi> in Christs death; and the pierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sword of Tribulation and grief passeth quite through it; it must suffer it selfe to be <hi>drawn</hi> quite through this flaming Sword; and the fire burneth away the <hi>Abomination</hi> which the soul continually brings into it selfe from the Serpents <note n="n" place="margin">Or false Image.</note> Monster; and even then it is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29914:67"/>
in a Sore <hi>strait,</hi> when that is cut off from the fire-soul, which it <hi>faine</hi> would have from its Monster.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Then must the virgin-child Supplicate the fire-soule and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it the Love, that it should <hi>onely forsake</hi> the Monster of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; heere then ariseth <hi>strife</hi> and opposition; for the part of the fire-soul hath introduced the Serpents Monster into it, and desireth also to have its <hi>joy</hi> therein, and loveth the Evill Beast.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Then <hi>Sophia, viz.</hi> the Second Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Part of the light world doth speak against it, and hence cometh up the <hi>Strife</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>the Seed of the woman and the Seed of the Serpent,</hi> and then man goeth up and down in Sorrow and Sadnesse, trouble and perplexty, sometimes the virgin-child prevailes, and sometimes the Serpent-childe.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. And then the Devill stirs up, and <hi>incenseth all Monsters</hi> against the virgin-child, to strike it, to mock it, scorne it, revile, and laugh it to shame, and make it ridiculous; that it may by no meanes be known, least the <hi>Devills</hi> Kingdome should become manifest.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Thus the virgin-childe must be exercised by this, in the Spirit of Christ, and suffer it selfe to be whipped, persecuted, and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously reproved, and often called, <hi>one possessed by the Devill</hi>; be cursed, and continually <hi>accounted an off-scouring of the world,</hi> untill the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Beast hath finished its Course in its Constellation; and then the Cherub cutteth off the grosse beast, and lets it fall even <hi>unto the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of God, and then the part of the fire-soule must forthwith force through the judgement of this <hi>Sword.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="13">13. Now if the fire-soul hath <note n="o" place="margin">Impressed.</note> taken in much vanity into it self, <hi>viz.</hi> much of the Serpents craft, and lust; then the part of the fire-soule must stand <note n="p" place="margin">Or in.</note> 
                              <hi>under</hi> this Sword, untill the fire of Gods Anger consumes this introduced <hi>vanity,</hi> which to many a one is <note n="q" place="margin">Refining fire.</note> 
                              <hi>Purgatory</hi> enough; which this present too too wise world will not beleeve, and will be onely an Adopted child from without, and so have an <hi>externall</hi> wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of Sins in Grace; but it hath another A.

                           <p n="28">28.

                           <p n="29">29. Now if God should have <note n="a" place="margin">Nulled abolished or taken away.</note> quelled the first Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> the fire-Source, in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Earth, out of which it was created; whence should the light have its might? doth not the Father <hi>viz.</hi> the fire-world, beget the Son <hi>viz.</hi> the light-world; but now being the word in the fire-world was vehemently enkindled by Gods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Creation, as we may see by the <hi>Coagulation</hi> of the Stones; if we were not blocks, and had onely calvish understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; wherewith then should this Fire but especially the enkindled <hi>Ens</hi> in the Coagulation be <hi>reduced</hi> and brought againe into the light into the Equall Temperature and harmony; Gods Love must then onely doe it.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. Now; how will [or <hi>can</hi>] a creature, <hi>viz.</hi> a fire-soule or Angel, come into a creaturall being or formation, if the fire-Source were not moved and <hi>stirred</hi> in an especiall manner: Like would onely then remaine in Like; and if it be onely a meere <hi>Likenesse,</hi> then it hath its Sport with and in it selfe, as it was from [and in] Eternity; and <hi>therefore</hi> the unchangeable God hath moved himselfe according to the fire and light, and stirred up the fires property that he may make him a play, and <hi>melody, viz.</hi> a formed Word out of himselfe; that there might be a play before and in the <hi>un-formable</hi> Word.</p>
                           <p n="31">31.

                           <p n="32">32. Now no fire-Soure can be generated out of the perfect like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, unlesse the likenesse doth move it selfe: yet the Eternall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <hi>viz.

But being that might <hi>not</hi> be, he created the Earth, and out of the Earth, Man, out of the first motion, and <hi>breathed into man</hi> the Light-and fire-soule out of that breath of his manifested and moved word, <hi>viz</hi>: out of the first motion, for out of the first moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word, <hi>another</hi> Prince should come into the princely created Throne of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and take in, and possesse the <hi>first</hi> motion.</p>
                           <p n="34">34. And God appointed the Judgement to the <hi>first</hi> motion; and tooke away <hi>Lucifers</hi> Domineering Fire-Sword, and gave it unto <hi>Adam</hi>; and afterward introduced the deepest Love of God in Christ, into <hi>Adam,</hi> and brought the <hi>Moved Word</hi> againe into the likenesse, <hi>viz.</hi> into an Eternall Confirmation, and gave <hi>Adam</hi> in Christ the Fire-Sword over the fallen Prince <hi>Lucifer.</hi>

                           <p n="35">35. For <hi>Adam, viz.</hi> the corrupted <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, should, in Christ its first enjoyed Prince, judge with this flaming Sword; as Christ hath told us, that <hi>the Saints shall judge the world</hi>; understand, the Enkindled <hi>Ens</hi> of man and of the Earth, should judge the false Prince of Lies, who had perversely changed the Truth in the holy <hi>Ens</hi> into Lies, and corrupted it with such [false desire.]</p>
                           <p n="36">36. But beeing the <hi>Ens</hi> of man was corrupted, and could <hi>not,</hi> God out of his deepest Hiddennesse introduced the most holy <hi>Ens</hi> into the Corrupt <hi>Ens</hi> of man, <hi>viz.</hi> into the heavenly part, and brought the <hi>outward</hi> [part] also through the Sword of the fire and death into the <hi>inward,</hi> into an Eternall likenesse [or temperature:] And thus there is heere a Looking-glasse for Reason; if it be <hi>illuminated</hi> of God, It will then understand us heere; but if it be not, then there is <hi>not</hi> any <hi>possibility</hi> to understand this.</p>
                           <p n="37">37.

                           <p n="2">2. Seeing that men have onely sought in Reason; and have not been able through true <hi>Repentance</hi> to force through the fire-Sword and see with divine Eyes; thereupon the fire-Sword of Gods Anger, and Severe purpose and Decree of judgement hath <hi>remained</hi> onely in the eyes of [their] Reason; and further they have not seen, therefore they have made <hi>dreadfull</hi> and dangerous conclusions without funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and plaine understanding.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. But Christendome is hereby faithfully and truly <hi>admonished,</hi> once throughly to awake, and shake off the conclusions of Reason, and to see Gods clear <hi>countenance,</hi> which desireth no evill nor can desire it; but hath also set himselfe to be judge against all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and will destroy <hi>all such Conclusions</hi> in the Sword of his anger, and doe away the Cherub.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Now it doth heere offer it selfe to our consideration, <hi>how</hi> it came to passe, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> at <hi>first</hi> brought forth an evill child and a murderer: to this, Reason saith, that it was from Gods <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi> who hath made to himselfe an <hi>Election,</hi> and chose one company of men to damnation, and the other unto his love.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Forsooth! dear Reason; whence art thou borne, and from whence dost thou speake under the covert of <hi>the Scripture?</hi> Dost thou not speak from the <hi>Ens,</hi> and words of the Serpent? who brought the false <hi>Ens</hi> into <hi>Eve</hi> her <hi>Matrix,</hi> vvherein <hi>Cain</hi> was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended? did not the Devill doe it through the Serpent, and make the <hi>matrix</hi> of <hi>Eve</hi> monstrous?</p>

Dost thou not understand how <hi>the word of promise</hi> did forthwith incorporate it selfe in to the <hi>matrix</hi> of <hi>Eve</hi> in her Seed, and that the contest betwixt Gods anger and Gods Love did presently begin; for Gods Love had incorporated it selfe [and betrothed it selfe] <hi>to bruise the head of the Serpents</hi> Monster in the anger of God; and thereinto the fire-soul, which lay captivated in Gods anger, should give its free-will.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. For the fire-soul is a root proceeded from the divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and therefore it hath <hi>free-will,</hi> and nothing can deprive it thereof; it may conceive either in the fire or light.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. But if thou askest, why the Serpent-bruiser did not <hi>forthwith</hi> bruise the head of the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> in the first seed; and not suffer the Serpents, murtherous, poysonfull will, to get the upper hand in the Souls <hi>Ens?</hi> It is just as if I should ask; wherefore did not God when he saw that <hi>Adam</hi> became evill, <hi>wholly</hi> reject him, or make him to <hi>nothing,</hi> and create a new <hi>Adam</hi>? thus likewise will Reason judge of the Devills, saying, that it hath pleased God that there should be <hi>Devills</hi> that it might be knowne what an <hi>Angell</hi> is.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Hearken Reason!

                           <p n="10">10. The Love onely is called God, the Anger is called his <hi>Strength,</hi> and might; Now what the free-will would desire, therein it should be <hi>confirmed</hi> either in the Love or anger.</p>

For the free-will was borne or sprung forth from the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Anger, viz,</hi> from the fire-and light-world: and so likewise it might chuse it selfe a place for its working Life; If Gods Love should have <hi>drowned</hi> the free-will in the <hi>Ens</hi> in <hi>Eve's</hi> seed in the Love, in which [seed] <note n="b" place="margin">The free will.</note> it was enkindled in the Anger, then the fiery motion in the <hi>matrix</hi> must have <hi>ceased</hi>; now out of the light's <hi>Ens</hi> onely and alone, no soul may be brought forth.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Also the corrupt <hi>Ens</hi> of the earthly <hi>limus,</hi> must have then been <hi>presently</hi> judged through the fire, which could not be, for the motion of the new Regeneration, and the opening or full explication of the divine <hi>Sweetnesse</hi> and the overcoming of the fire, <hi>viz.</hi> of the anger of God, did belong onely to the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jesus.</hi>

                           <p n="13">13. The word which had incorporated it selfe, had from without, the fire-sword, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cherub,</hi> and from within, the <hi>Jesus</hi> who should overcome the fire-sword with Love: thus the <hi>Name JESV</hi> stood hid in the fire-sword and was not manifest untill the <hi>Time</hi> that God would move himselfe therein, and manifest the same.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. Thus the insinuated <hi>Ens</hi> of the Serpent, that <hi>Eve</hi> had introduced through <hi>Imagination</hi> into lust, must be <hi>wholly</hi> cast away; for in <hi>Cain</hi> the murthering <note n="c" place="margin">Or the evill corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</note> Image of the Serpent was manifest, which <hi>cannot

inherit the Kingdome of God</hi>; but on the contrary the Marke of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the promised word was <hi>in</hi> the free-will and in the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disappeared <hi>Ens</hi> of the Soul, into which [covenant of the promised Grace] the Soul should enter.</p>
                           <p n="15">15, And although the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> should have been rejected, as it must be, in all the children of <hi>Eve,</hi> yet the part of the heavenly worlds being, lay <hi>hid</hi> in the Covenant of the Word in the disappeared <hi>Ens,</hi> as a <hi>possibility</hi> to the new Regeneration; therefore God said to <hi>Cain,</hi> when the murthering Spirit perswaded him, <hi>Rule over the Sin.</hi>

If thou saist, wherewith? he could not: but wherefore could he not? the Serpents <hi>desire</hi> held him, and brought him to <hi>kill</hi> his brother: wherefore? the free-Will had given it selfe up into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens</hi> which held him captive.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. Now saith Reason; God would have it so, else he had turned away his will. No: indeed Gods Anger-will in the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> which had captivated the free-will, would have it; but yet Gods Love-will said in him <hi>Rule over Sin,</hi> that is over the wrath and Anger of the Serpent, and let it not have its power and prevalency.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. And here we are rightly to know, how Gods Love and Anger are in <hi>continuall</hi> contest, understand, in the manifested Word in the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, and in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the humane property out of the Earth; for the Anger-<hi>Ens</hi> is stirred up and driven by the Devill, and desireth continually to devoure the Love-<hi>Ens,</hi> and possesse this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the Anger-<hi>Ens.</hi>

                           <p n="19">19. The Anger-<hi>Ens</hi> desireth to have man; for it hath its King in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi>; and the Love-<hi>Ens</hi> desireth also to have him; for it hath its King in <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore Christ must bring the humane Love-<hi>Ens</hi> through death and the Anger-<hi>Ens,</hi> and open another Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> another Kingdome, and leave Prince <hi>Lucifer</hi> in his own Anger, for his free-will had chose it him.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. Thus also the free-will in <hi>Cain did chuse</hi> the false, <hi>viz.</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills-will: but thou saist; was then the murthering-will wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; it did <note n="d" place="margin">Reprobate or abandon. <hi>NOIE.</hi>

                              <hi>reject it selfe</hi>; but if the free-will had againe conceived in the Love <hi>Ens</hi> it would have been againe borne anew, yea even after the murther, which we leave unto the judgement of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were so or no, seeing the Text in <hi>Moses</hi> doth give him so bare a name in despaire; for the <hi>word</hi> out of which the <hi>Name Jesus</hi> was made manifest, was given, <hi>to call, poor lost Sinners to Repentance, and not the righteous ones,</hi> who were apprehended in the Love; as Christ said.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. <hi>Cain</hi> was a type of the first corrupt <hi>Adam</hi> in Sin, and <hi>Abell</hi> was a type of Christ the second <hi>Adam, viz.</hi> of the virgin-childe; for the Tree of evill and good <hi>began</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>; and so likewise the fruit did forthwith appeare, <hi>viz.</hi> Christs children, and the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and the Serpent.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. Now reason saith: was <hi>Cain</hi> then wholly conceived of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens</hi> in the Anger of God and <hi>predestinated to damnation?</hi> Answer: no; He was (conceived) of the <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> soule and body; and so also of the Seed and <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Eve</hi> her body; but the Monster in the <hi>matrix</hi> of <hi>Eve</hi> did <hi>environ</hi> the sown Seed, and it was <hi>that</hi> which did seduce and beguile him; but the marke [and <hi>Aym</hi>] of the Covenant
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:29914:71"/>
lay hidden in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Soul and body; for the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Seed of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> was out of the heavenly disappeared [<hi>limbus</hi>] and then also out of the earthly awakened <hi>limus,</hi> but the <hi>will</hi> of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and of the Devill took <hi>possession</hi> of the house; as the like was in the Devill, who was an Angell but the will of the darke world took possession of the house in him, and got the <hi>upperhand,</hi> so also it was here in <hi>Cain.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="23">23. But thou askest, how this came so to be? hear, and see thou fair child in the will of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> what their desire was before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall, they onely desired the <hi>Earthly</hi> Kingdome; as we see that <hi>Eve</hi> was so wholly and onely minded, for when she brought forth <hi>Cain</hi>; she said,<note place="margin">

                              <hi>I have gotten a man</hi> [who is to be] <hi>a Lord</hi>; she <hi>thought</hi> him to be <hi>the bruiser</hi> and breaker of the Serpent, he should take in and possesse the earthly Kingdome, and <hi>expell</hi> the Devill; she did not consider that she should Dye to her false earthly fleshly will and be borne anew <note n="e" place="margin">Or with.</note> in an <hi>holy</hi> will; and such a will she also brought into her Seed, and the like did <hi>Adam</hi> also.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. And hence now the will in the Souls essence did arise; the tree brought forth a twig out of (or like) it selfe; for it was <hi>Cains</hi> desire onely that he might be <hi>Lord upon the Earth</hi>; and being he saw that <hi>Abell</hi> was more acceptable in Gods Sight then himselfe, his free-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall will in him did elevate it selfe to <hi>slay Abel,</hi> for <hi>Cains</hi> Ayme and endeavour was onely about the <hi>outward world,</hi> to domineer and be Lord and master therein; but <hi>Abel Sought</hi> Gods Love.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. Thus there are yet <hi>Two</hi> such Churches upon the Earth; <hi>One</hi> which onely seeketh <hi>worldly</hi> pleasure might honour and the outward God <hi>Mammon</hi> and <hi>Mausim,</hi> and therein it lodgeth the Serpents child, the other which seeketh the virgin-child, and Gods Kingdome, and must suffer it selfe to be persecuted, reviled, reproached, and <hi>killed</hi> by the Cainicall Church, as <hi>Cain</hi> did to <hi>Abel.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="26">26. For the Devill will yet be continually <hi>a Prince of this world</hi> in the Serpents child; and if the virgins child which bruiseth the head of the Serpent be not manifest in the Serpents child, then the Devill is and <hi>remaineth</hi> Prince and Host in the house of the Soul, as hapned to <hi>Cain.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="27">27. And doe but understand the ground aright: in the birth of this world <hi>two</hi> Kingdomes lie manifest; <hi>viz.</hi> Gods <hi>Love:</hi> Kingdome in Christ, and the Kingdome of Gods <hi>Anger</hi> in <hi>Lucifer:</hi> these two Kingdomes are in Contest and strife in all creatures; for the Originall of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is in the Contest, and in the Combate of the fire the light is made manifest: the fire is a cause of the light, Gods <hi>anger</hi> is a cause that God did yet once move himselfe in his deepest <hi>Love</hi> in the <hi>Name Jesus</hi> and thereby vanquish the Anger.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. Now what can the <hi>Love</hi> doe, if the free-will espouseth it selfe to the Anger? or vvhat can the <hi>Anger</hi> doe against it, if the free-will conceiveth in the Love and destroyeth the Anger? must it not hold still and <hi>suffer</hi> it to be done; and though it doth oppose and rage against it, yet the Love pierceth quite through it, and changeth it into <hi>Joy</hi>; the Anger is the root of Love as the fire is the root of the light; but in the <hi>Free-will</hi> is the understanding, which maketh it selfe to what it pleaseth.</p>

Dost thou not see this in the Earth, that the free-will in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the word hath made it selfe stones, metalls, and Earth: the stones and Earth are <hi>not</hi> the free-will; but the free-will hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced it selfe into such an <hi>Ens,</hi> and by its <hi>Lubet,</hi> and motion intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>Ens</hi> into a Compaction or coagulation; there was no other maker there but the free-vvill in the formed and manifested word: thou mayest indeed see <hi>wonders</hi> enough.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. Behold the unreasonable Creatures, as wormes, toads, Spiders, and other wilde venemous and horrible Beasts, and thou shalt <hi>see</hi> somewhat in very deed, if thou beest not dead; but thou saist, God hath created it so: yea, Right! his desire in <hi>Love and anger</hi> hath amas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Ens</hi> with the motion, and compacted each <hi>Ens</hi> according to the free-will into a forme; there was no other maker there, but the <hi>free-will in the word.</hi>

The desire in the word was the <hi>Fiat,</hi> which introduced the free-will into an <hi>Ens</hi>; thus the same Manifested Word is yet in all things, and hath the <hi>Fiat, viz.</hi> the desire in it selfe; As the free-will in every thing introduceth it selfe into a <hi>Spirit,</hi> even so the <hi>Fiat</hi> formeth, and <hi>Signeth</hi> each thing; every Root bringeth forth from it selfe a branch of its own <hi>likenesse</hi>; but when the branch or sprout is to be borne, and receive its beginning in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the root, the <hi>Ens</hi> doth then forme it selfe to such a twig, as the root at that time is apprehended in its power and free will both by the Superiour and inferior <hi>constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>

The like is also to be understood in man; as the will is in the <hi>Seed,</hi> that is, as the desire of the father and mother, together with other Influences from the Stars and Elements, yea oftentimes from the Devills assaults and insinuations, are at that time, Even <hi>such a Spirit</hi> is formed in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Seed, sometimes an Angel if the Parents be in <hi>Holy Desire</hi> [or in the true faith of the engrafted Word] Sometimes also a beast, a Serpent, and Image of the Devill, both according to the <hi>Ens</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>outward flesh.</hi>

                           <p n="42">42. The Devills desire and the beastiall <hi>Ens</hi> of the Serpent had got the upper hand in the <hi>matrix</hi> of <hi>Eve,</hi> and apprehended the first Seed in the desire: now the Kingdome of God did yet belong to the first man, but being he did lose it by his negligence, the first <hi>Adam</hi> must be <hi>offered to the Earth,</hi> and also its first <hi>Seed</hi> to the Anger.</p>
                           <p n="43">43. And after this first Seed, <hi>Abel</hi> came forth in the holy Covenant, and offered his sweet <hi>bloud</hi> for the sinfull Seed, to the Anger, that the anger might let its flame fall, and suffer the first birth to press <note n="i" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Viz.</hi> through death and the anger into life.</note> through in the bloud of the Second.</p>
                           <p n="44">44. The first birth was a <hi>murtherer,</hi> which signifieth the Devill in man; the Second was the <hi>offering</hi> of [or for] the first, that the Anger-Devill in the first <hi>Adam</hi> might be appeased in the offering of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                           <p n="45">45. Not that we would exalt or take in the wicked, into the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Christ, so long as he is wicked; the Devill devoureth <hi>most of the wicked crew:</hi> onely the wicked Sinner hath an <hi>open Gate</hi> made for him in the offering of the Second [<hi>Adam</hi>] if he did <hi>convert,</hi> and turne himselfe (from his wickedness.)</p>
                           <p n="46">46. But that some write, there was a twofold Seed which did Sever it self in <hi>Eve, viz.</hi> one wholly devillish from the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Serpent, and the other from the <hi>Ens</hi> of Christ [or the promised Seed of the woman] in the Covenant, is nothing so; these have not at all learned the A. B.

                                 <hi>Note.</hi>
                              </note> they speak onely the Serpents words, which desired to have it so: observe it thus:</p>
                           <p n="47">47. <hi>Adam</hi> had onely one <hi>limbus</hi> to his Seed, and <hi>Eve</hi> onely one <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> for her Seed, but they both stood in three Principles: the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were in <hi>Contest,</hi> as still they are at this day: the Second Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdome of God, or Angelicall world, did disappear in the Souls <hi>Seed,</hi> and God espoused his onely most holy <hi>word</hi> again therein unto the <hi>new-birth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="48">48. And this espousall or betrothment stood aswell in <hi>Cains Ens,</hi>
                              <pb n="138" facs="tcp:29914:73"/>
as in <hi>Abels Ens,</hi> but <hi>Cains Ens</hi> was apprehended in the <hi>Contest</hi> of the three Principles in the Anger, and covered with the Serpents Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; <hi>not</hi> so, to an <hi>impossibility,</hi> as if he were borne to <hi>condemnation</hi>; but even to a <hi>possibility</hi> of the Free-Will, whether he would lay down the selfefull assumed and selfe appropriated Right in <hi>Adam,</hi> and live in Gods will, or whether he would live unto himselfe; upon this was the <hi>Election</hi> set.</p>
                           <p n="49">49. Now God knoweth whereinto the free-will is entred: if it be entred into <hi>iniquity,</hi> and selfe-hood; then Gods Anger establisheth or confirmes it in its choise to <hi>condemnation</hi>; but if it be entred into the <hi>word</hi> of the Covenant, then God confirmes it to be a <hi>childe</hi> of Heaven, and here that saying hath its proper signification and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: <hi>I have mercy on whom I will and whom I will I harden:</hi> God knoweth his children even in the <hi>Ens</hi> in the <hi>mothers wombe</hi>; to what end should he give his Pearle to him, whom he yet knoweth would turne himself away from him; the <hi>Pearl's ground</hi> lieth indeed <hi>in</hi> him but hidden, and shut up, if he brought his will into the Pearl it would open it self <hi>in</hi> him.</p>
                           <p n="50">50. All men proceed from <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>Seed</hi>; but in one the holy fire glimmereth and in another it lyeth as 'twere shut up, and cannot, by reason of the <hi>Mire</hi> of the Serpent.</p>
                           <p n="51">51. Thou sayst then: is the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> more mighty then Gods Love: I have already answered thee: that Love and Anger are in Contest; whereinto the <hi>Ens</hi> doth espouse it selfe, of that it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and confirmed, yet so, that the will is <hi>free</hi> to goe from the Evill into the Good, and from the Good into the Evill; and <hi>that while it liveth upon the Earth,</hi> both doores stand open <hi>unto it:</hi> for the free will is not bound: but if it were <hi>bound</hi> then <hi>no</hi> judgement could with righteousness passe upon it: it hath <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>instructions,</hi> which are given it, not unto death but unto life, but if it transgresseth these, and <hi>continueth</hi> in the transgression; now the judgement passeth upon it; for every judgement [or sentence of Condemnation] ariseth from the transgression of the <hi>Command.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="52">52. Thou sayst he cannot keep them; he is drawn [to transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on], yea very right; doth not the <hi>Truth</hi> rebuke him even to the face, that he is a <hi>faithlesse</hi> wretch, that suffers himselfe to be drawn to Evill: the Law to doe Right is <hi>in</hi> his <hi>vitall</hi> light as a <hi>continuall</hi> Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glasse: he seeth and knoweth it very well, that he is a <hi>lyar,</hi> and walketh upon the way of the Devill: it sheweth him the way of truth but the free-will <hi>rejecteth</hi> it, at present he is <hi>predestinated</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, yet so that the will is free, so long as he is in this Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; but the heavy band of Gods anger in the drawing of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills desire, drawes many an one to the <hi>damnation</hi> of death.</p>
                           <p n="53">53. Reason saith: if a man hath free-will, then God is not omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent over him, to doe what he please with him: The free-will is not from any beginning, also not amassed or taken out of any ground, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any thing, or formed by any thing; it is its <hi>own</hi> peculiar <hi>Originall</hi> out of the word of the divine Power out of Gods Love, and Anger; it formeth, it selfe in its own will, a <hi>Centre</hi> to its Seat; it begetteth it selfe in the first Principle to the fire and light; its right and genuine

Originall is in the Nothing, where the <hi>Nothing, viz.</hi> the <note place="margin">

                              <note place="margin">A. O. V.</note> and the will into a <hi>desire,</hi> and the desire into a <hi>Substance.</hi>

                           <p n="54">54. Now the Eternall Originall, <hi>viz.</hi> God, is a <hi>Judge</hi> over the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; if the Lubet (which is departed from him) hath introduced it selfe into an <hi>Evill</hi> being; then he judgeth that being or substance in its <hi>Principle</hi>; in what Source and property soever, or in what <hi>Ens</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Lubet, proceeding from the departed <note place="margin">
                                 <figure/>
                              </note>, hath introduced it selfe into a Principle; therein the universall Eternall free-will which is the Abysse, and <hi>Cause</hi> of all Bysse, doth confirme and settle it.</p>
                           <p n="55">55. The Abyssall judgeth That which doth intoduce it selfe into Bysse, and severs the good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which hath introduced it selfe into a good <hi>Ens</hi>) into the good, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>divine Love</hi>; and the Evill (which hath brought it selfe into an Evill <hi>Ens,</hi> and set, and formed it selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Centre to an evill Spirit, and will) into <hi>his wrath</hi> and Anger.</p>
                           <p n="56">56. For how can he judge a thing whose own it is <hi>not?</hi> how would God judge the will of the creature if it were not <hi>sprung</hi> [or arisen] from <hi>him?</hi> or rather how can a Judgement passe upon a thing, which is <hi>bound,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> free in its willing and working?</p>
                           <p n="57">57. The humane and Angelicall will is arisen with the motion of the <hi>Abysse</hi> (when the Diety once moved it selfe in its Contemplation and Sensation, and with the motion introduced it selfe into a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spirits) [the will of Men and Angells did spring forth] out of this <hi>beginning</hi>; now every beginning goeth into its End; and the End is that which was <hi>before</hi> the beginning, and there is the <hi>tryall</hi> of the beginning; [which shewes] whereinto the beginning hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it selfe.</p>
                           <p n="58">58. Now God is before and without all beginnings, and from him every beginning proceedeth, also he is the End of all beginnings; now the <hi>middle</hi> of all inchoated things standeth between the <hi>beginning</hi> and the <hi>End</hi>; for it must with its beginning enter again through the End into that whence it did arise.</p>
                           <p n="59">59. Seeing then that <hi>God is a jealous God and a consuming fire,</hi> and also <hi>a loving mercifull God</hi>: Every free will with its introduced Centre hath its own judge <hi>borne in its selfe</hi>; either divine Love, or divine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for when a thing beginneth; it goeth into a time; but when this time is apprehended of the End, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Eternity</hi>; then it is in its own Eternall [beginning, and End] whence it hath introduced it selfe into a <hi>Compaction,</hi> so confirmed to Eternity.</p>
                           <p n="60">60. Therefore the free will hath its own <hi>Judgement</hi> either for the good or evill in it selfe: It hath its <hi>own</hi> judgement in it self: it hath Gods Love and anger in it, what it amasseth, and defireth, that it formeth in it selfe; and doth onely so forme its owne self in its owne Lubet into a <hi>Centre.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="61">61. For thus the world hath likewise its Originall: namely in the Free-will of the <hi>two Eternall</hi> Principles, both from the darke fire-lubet and also from the divine lightfull fire-lubet; The free-will introduced
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29914:74"/>
it selfe in the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> into distinct and severall Entities; and that even according to the <hi>Possibility</hi> of the Eternall Pregnatresse; as the Will in the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> conceived it selfe in each place in the Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natresse, even such an <hi>Ens</hi> was brought forth, and out of the <hi>Ens</hi> arose its Spirit according to the <hi>Ens, viz.</hi> from Gods <note n="k" place="margin">Breathing or stirring up.</note> Spiration or <hi>motion</hi> in the Principles.</p>
                           <p n="62">62. But being the Principles were together as one; no thing was ever amassed or formed in the free-will but the same hath a good and an evill in it; according to the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the Eternall Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natresse to light, and darkness.</p>
                           <p n="63">63. But now every Spirit ariseth with its free-will first out of the <hi>Compaction</hi> of its Centre, and is, after its effected birth, <hi>free,</hi> and may draw into it selfe either out of Gods Love, or Anger, and introduce its will as it pleaseth: but <hi>this</hi> is the maine thing; as the mother (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Ens</hi>) is, whereof the Spirit is borne, even <hi>such</hi> a Lubet ariseth also in the Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="64">64. Now the Spirit hath <hi>understanding,</hi> and the <hi>Ens</hi> hath none; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <note n="l" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Viz.</hi> the Spirit.</note> it hath a Law, for it knoweth what is evill and good, what is right, and wrong, also God hath given it lawes, that it should break the lust [to evill] and with the understanding of the light, <hi>rule over the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet of the darknesse.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="65">65. Now if it doth not, but departeth with the Lubet out of the understanding into a <hi>Selfe-Lubet,</hi> then the Lubet or lust doth amasse it selfe into a <hi>Substance,</hi> whereof a new false will is againe borne, and this same is a <hi>bastard</hi> before God and the Eternall nature; for it ariseth not out of the <hi>Law and Right</hi> of the Eternall nature but out of Selfe; and upon this the <hi>judgement</hi> of the Eternall nature doth passe; and at its end (when the Centre of the Spirit shall step again into the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) it will be <hi>spewed</hi> out from the free-will of Eternity.</p>
                           <p n="66">66. Understand Us but aright: The <hi>first free-will,</hi> which was breathed into <hi>Adam,</hi> was good, indeed it was both from Gods Love and anger, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Centre of the Eternall Pregnatresse, of the Eternall Spirituall nature; but it had the <hi>understanding in it</hi> to rule and governe it selfe, so as it <hi>might stand</hi> and subsist Eternally.</p>
                           <p n="67">67. But the crafty distemper or infection introduced by the Devill was in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Earth <note n="m" place="margin">Or whereof.</note> whence <hi>Adams outward</hi> body was formed: into this earthly <hi>Ens</hi> the Devill brought his desire by the Serpent, <hi>viz</hi> by the Serpents crafty <hi>Ens,</hi> so that the Lubet arose in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the body, whereinto the first free-will of the <hi>inspired</hi> Soul entered, and assumed the Lubet of the body, and introduced this Lubet into a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> to Substance.</p>
                           <p n="68">68. And out of this <hi>Substance</hi> another new Selfefull will did now arise, <hi>viz.</hi> a bastard, a false <hi>Serpent-childe</hi>; and this bastard, <hi>Adam</hi> did Originally propagate to his <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to her Son <hi>Cain,</hi> and so <hi>one man to another:</hi> thus we have now in this Earthly flesh this same false will proceeded from the Serpents Substance, whereinto the <hi>Devill</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth his desire, and <hi>tempteth us,</hi> and continually makes us lust and long after the devillish property [<hi>viz. pride, covetousnesse, envy, and anger,</hi>] that so his desire which he insinuareth into the false bastard in us, might become substantiall and essentiall; out of which such an
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29914:74"/>
whorish and devillish Serpentine Seed is continually <hi>begotten</hi>; and out of the same false <hi>Ens</hi> [or Seed] a Devills will.</p>
                           <p n="69">69. Thus the Devill rideth in and upon man, in and upon body and Soul: but now the <hi>first</hi> introduced free-will, which God breathed into <hi>Adam, lyeth yet in all men,</hi> for it is the true reall Soul, the Centre of the fire and light, a spark of the <hi>Divine</hi> Power and <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> but wholly hem'd in and <hi>captivated</hi> in this wicked introduced Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard.</p>
                           <p n="70">70.

                           </p>
                           <p n="71">71. Now saith Reason: God giveth this holy new <hi>Ens</hi> of Christ to <hi>whom he will,</hi> and suffereth <hi>whom he please</hi> to <hi>harden,</hi> and remaine cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the Serpents <hi>Ens:</hi> yes very right: He giveth <hi>none</hi> this holy <hi>Ens</hi> into the Selfe-will of his Serpents-child; there belongeth far an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other earnestnesse thereto; for selfehood <hi>cannot</hi> now any more take any thing of God.</p>
                           <p n="72">72. But this is the processe which the free-will must goe, if it will receive the holy <hi>Ens:</hi> it must winde it selfe <hi>out</hi> of the Serpents desire, (<hi>out</hi> of its selfish selfe and somethingnesse) and winde it selfe <hi>into Gods mercy</hi>; and become a deadly mortifying Enemy to the <hi>fleshly desire</hi> in it selfe, it must wholly <hi>forsake</hi> and depart from the selfe-full desire of the flesh; and bring its hunger wholly and onely into the <hi>mortification</hi> of its selfish somethingnesse, desiring and endeavouring continually and willingly to <hi>dye</hi> to its <hi>iniquity</hi> and false desire which sticketh in the flesh, in the Serpents childe, and in Christs <hi>Ens</hi> arise with a new will.</p>
                           <p n="73">73. This desire, which departeth from the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> and <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greth</hi> after Gods mercy, receiveth Christs <hi>Ens</hi> into it selfe, whence a new will is <hi>borne,</hi> which bruiseth the head of the Serpent in the flesh, for it is the <hi>new-birth</hi> out of God in Christ <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="74">74. But if thou wilt say, thou <hi>canst</hi> not desire any good, that is <hi>not</hi> true; onely thou sufferest the Serpents will in thy right Eternall Souls will, to hold thee; and with the Soules will, dost play the whore with the Serpents will, in the flesh; from <hi>whence</hi> ariseth Gods <hi>Election.</hi>

HEere againe, the vaile lyeth before the face of <hi>Moses,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Offerings</hi> of both these brothers; wherefore <hi>God</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to have them offer, whereas the Reconciliation, and Attonement consists only in the <hi>earnest will</hi> toward Gods mercy, in prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to God, that a man <hi>depart</hi> and turn away from his evill will, and repent, and introduce his <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> into Gods mercy.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. They must verily <hi>needs know,</hi> wherefore they offered Incense; what pleasure and delight God took therein; which <hi>Moses</hi> hath <hi>not once</hi> so much as mentioned, and that from Gods purpose; and yet it hath <hi>not been hidden</hi> to the children of the Saints, and also not to <hi>Moses,</hi> but he hath a <hi>vaile</hi> hanging before his <hi>Eyes.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="3">3. Israel (being for the most part they were evill children, and also Idolatrous, as soon appeared by making them a <hi>Golden Calfe</hi>) might <hi>not</hi> know it by reason of the false Magick; and we also shall write on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to those that are <hi>of our Tribe,</hi> and yet plaine and easie enough to be understood: Observe and marke it, thus.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. The Soules <hi>free-will,</hi> is as <note n="*" place="margin">Or subtile.</note> thin as a nothing, and though it be, in its body indeed, encompassed with the Something; yet its Amassed or conceived Something is in a false <hi>distempered</hi> Essence, by reason of the Originall of <hi>Sin.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="5">5. Now if the free-will would approach to God with the desire, then it must depart out of its <hi>false</hi> Something, and if it now <hi>doth</hi> so depart, then it is bare, and impotent, for it is again in the <hi>first</hi> Nothing: for if it will come to God, then it must <hi>dye</hi> to its <hi>false selfehood,</hi> and forsake it, and if it forsakes the same, then it is barely and meerely as a <hi>nothing,</hi> and so it <hi>cannot</hi> go, work, or move: if it will shew its might, then it must be in <hi>Something,</hi> wherein it doth Imaginate and forme it selfe.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. An example hereof we have in <hi>Faith:</hi> if Faith would effectually worke, then it must immasse [or <hi>Imaginate</hi>] it selfe into <hi>Something</hi> wherein it may worke; Gods free-will hath conceived [or immassed it selfe with the <hi>inward</hi> Spirituall <hi>world</hi> and worketh through the same;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29914:75"/>
and the inward worlds free-will hath conceived it selfe in the <hi>outward world</hi> and worketh through the same: even so, the Soules free-will, which also hath its Originall out of the Abysse immasseth it selfe in <hi>Something,</hi> that it might be manifest, and thereby be able to move and act in Gods Sight.</p>
                              <p n="7">7. Seeing then <hi>Adams Body</hi> was out of the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth and also out of the <hi>limus</hi> of the holy heaven, which <hi>limus</hi> of heaven in <hi>Adam</hi> was now disappeared, wherein the free-will had power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse, [or conceive] it selfe into an <hi>holy forme,</hi> and act, worke, pray and Supplicate before God; therefore they made <hi>burnt-offerings</hi> of the fruits of the Earth; as <hi>Cain, he brought of the fruit of the ground,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Genesis</hi> IIII. <hi>verses</hi> 3, 4.</note> 
                                 <hi>and Abel</hi> also <hi>brought of the firstlings of his flock,</hi> and these they <hi>enkindled with fire.</hi>

                              <p n="8">8. But understand a <hi>magicall fire</hi> (as that of <hi>Moses</hi>) for <hi>Moses</hi> declareth so also; <hi>God looked graciously upon the offering of Abell and not upon Cains</hi>: that is, they brought offerings before God, and the free-will of the soul should earnestly presse with its <hi>prayer,</hi> in to God; therefore it would have a <note n="o" place="margin">Subject or meanes.</note> 
                                 <hi>Substance,</hi> when it would goe out of the humane house of corruption into God, that it might work in <hi>Something,</hi> therefore the Imagination of the will did Immasse [or Imaginate] it selfe, through the offering, and <hi>God</hi> enkindled the offering of <hi>Abell</hi> with the <hi>holy fire</hi> in the Aym of the Covenant, which in the fulnesse of time should <hi>again</hi> enkindle it self <hi>in the Soules fire.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="9">9. In this, the will of <hi>Abels</hi> Soul did <note n="p" place="margin">Fashion or Idea.</note> enforme it selfe into an <hi>holy</hi> Substance, and pressed with the desire of the Enformed free soules will, before and into Gods free-will, and this the will of the Devill and the Serpent could not brook; and even this the will of the Serpent and Devill in <hi>Cain did well</hi> understand; that the Aym of the Covenant did open it self in the <hi>Holy</hi> Fire in <hi>Abels desire</hi> and prayer.</p>
                              <p n="10">10. And therefore he would kill the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Abell</hi> according to his earthly <hi>limus</hi>; least <hi>such children</hi> should be begotten of him, and so he might <hi>loose</hi> his Kingdome in man; But God would <hi>not</hi> enkindle the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of <hi>Cain,</hi> now <hi>Moses</hi> maketh a vaile here before it, and saith, <hi>God would not look</hi>

                              <p n="11">11. The Enkindling of the <hi>externall offering</hi> was a figure of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Spirit:</hi> for the soules Spirit in the free-will (as to the Centre of the light) was enkindled with Gods Love-fire, and the <hi>Imagination</hi> of the Body also [understand of the heavenly part] was inkindled in offering with the fire of the <hi>holy</hi> part of the Earth which lyeth <hi>hidden</hi> in the Curse; and therein the free-will of the Soul, and the free-will in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the heavenly part of the body, did Immasse it selfe into a <hi>Substance</hi>; and therewith did presse in before the <hi>holinesse</hi> of God.</p>
                              <p n="12">12. And heere the Serpents head was <hi>first</hi> bruised; for it was a <hi>figure</hi> of the nevv birth out of Christ; not that <hi>Abel</hi> had at this time put on Christ in the <hi>flesh</hi>; but indeed the Spirit of <hi>Jehova,</hi> in the Ayme of the Covenant; in which, the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jesus</hi> stood hidden in God as a Regeneratour, which would move, and manifest it selfe in the fulnesse of time, in this Ayme [of the Covenant] and introduce an heavenly <hi>holy Ens</hi> into the disappeared <hi>Ens</hi> of the heavenly part, and quicken it to life againe in the <hi>opened</hi> power of <hi>Jesus.</hi>

                                 <pb n="144" facs="tcp:29914:76"/>13. If a man would rightly and fundamentally understand the <note n="r" place="margin">Sacrifices.</note> 
                                 <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> he must consider that, whereof the Offering consisted, and what severed it selfe with the Enkindling in the fire, out of the fire, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the <hi>Enkindled</hi> offering; for in the Enkindling, nothing is seen or perceived, but 1. the <hi>wood</hi> to the fire. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> The <hi>matter</hi> of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>.

The <hi>Smoak</hi> of the fire, which ariseth from the burning wood and matter of the offering; all this without the faith and divine desire is as an <hi>abomination,</hi> and indeed <hi>Nothing</hi> in Gods sight and attaineth not the Gate of God:</p>
                              <p n="14">14. But if Man brings his faiths-desire thereinto, then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeth the <hi>free-will</hi> thereinto, and vvill thereby as by a <hi>meanes</hi> (in which fire the free-Will of the introduced <hi>Sinfull</hi> abomination doth burne and consume away) presse in to Gods Eternall free-will: and now <hi>how</hi> this is effected and comes to passe, understand as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                              <p n="15">15. Gods Imagination or Lubet <hi>meeteth</hi> the Free-inspired-will of the humanity, and the humane free-will <hi>meeteth</hi> the deity, heere is now the <hi>Conjunction.</hi>

                              <p n="16">16. But now Mans free-will is become <hi>Sinfull,</hi> and Gods free-will (from whence the humane free will did <hi>first</hi> take its rise in its in-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) is <hi>holy,</hi> and pure: as yet the humane free-will <hi>cannot</hi> presse into Gods will, unlesse it also become <hi>pure</hi> before God.</p>
                              <p n="17">17. But being God will out of <hi>free-grace</hi> receive it into him for the delight and harmony of his praise: there is <hi>no other way</hi> or remedy, but that God <hi>move</hi> himselfe in the Centre of the Eternall nature ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fire of the <hi>Second Principle, viz.</hi> according to the <hi>holy</hi> fire, and devoure that enkindled Anger and vanity of mans free-will; and annihilate it in the <hi>mortification</hi> of death, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Anger-fire of God, that the humane vvill <hi>might</hi> become pure before Gods will, and so <hi>might</hi> enter into Gods <hi>Love-will:</hi> and therefore Gods Love-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire did <hi>it selfe</hi> enkindle the offering of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> that so the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-and Love-fire <hi>might</hi> devoure and swallow up the <hi>Turba</hi> in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane free-Soules-will, in the Anger-fire of the Eternall nature, in the Fathers property.</p>
                              <p n="18">18. But, that there must be an <hi>Earthly</hi> offering thereunto, is thus to be understood: the <hi>Body</hi> of man as to one part is a <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, and as to the other part a <hi>limus</hi> of heaven; and into this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the free-will was inspired, and body and soul is onely one man.</p>
                              <p n="19">19. But being in the fall, the <hi>earthlinesse</hi> and false suttlety of the Serpent (by the insinuation of the Devills desire) was awakened in the <hi>flesh</hi> of man, and so the earthly beastiall property got the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in his <hi>Ens,</hi> and devoured the right humane will in the beastiall property, that is, took it captive; thereupon the <hi>earthly will</hi> which was from the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth must also be <hi>offered</hi> up in the fire.</p>
                              <p n="20">20. For the <hi>limus of the Earth</hi> shall <hi>arise</hi> againe out of earth; but for to make it an offering it must also be offered in an <hi>earthly Elementall fire</hi> of its likenesse; so that an heavenly fire, and an earthly Elementall fire might be in one another, and each will in the offring might <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively</hi> finde a place for its own comprehension and <hi>capacity: viz.</hi> the will proceeded from the earthly <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

                              <p n="21">21. For the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the promise touching the Serpent-Stroyer did manifest it selfe by the <hi>holy</hi> fire, which holy fire enkindled the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall fire, for the <hi>holy fire shall</hi> awaken and <hi>raise</hi> up <hi>from death the Elementall man</hi> out of the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, and in the holy fire Man (who hath taken his Originall from Time) shall be <hi>purged</hi> and tryed in the <hi>Resurrection</hi>; who verily <hi>must first goe through the fire</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but the power and might of the holy fire shall bring him through the Anger-fire, and cleanse and <hi>purge</hi> away his introduced abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin (in the Serpents and Devills <hi>Ens</hi> [in him]) from the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, that the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth may be no more earthly but as a fine purified <hi>Gold</hi> which subsists in the fire.</p>
                              <p n="22">22. Even thus the Earthly man shall be purified in the <hi>Resurrection</hi> through the fire, of which the Offrings were a type, and yet they did really subsist in their power, as to the Spirit: but <hi>the Body must dye,</hi> and the true corporality, and Regeneration, must come forth [or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to spring afresh] in the <hi>opened body</hi> of Christ, who with his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into, and manifestation in the humaniry, did again open the heavenly disappeared <hi>limus</hi> in the humane <hi>Ens,</hi> which did disappeare [or fade] in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="23">23. Thus understand us aright: <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> offered <hi>the fatt of beasts,</hi> and enkindled that with the <hi>holy fire,</hi> which fire was <hi>first</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled by God; for the beastiall property became manifest in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward earthly man of the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth; the humane <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth was turned to a <hi>Beast,</hi> and was moreover <hi>sinfull</hi> and evill, full of the Serpents poyson, and Cunning Suttlety.</p>
                              <p n="24">24. The free-will did immasse it selfe in the Serpents craft and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills</hi> desire; and formed to it selfe such a <hi>figure</hi> in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the flesh as the desire was, whereupon the <hi>Body</hi> was <hi>more vaine</hi> in Gods sight then a beast.</p>
                              <p n="25">25. But being the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> lay hidden and <hi>shut up</hi> in the earthly property, God would not <hi>utterly</hi> forsake the whole Image; which <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> did understand, <hi>in the Spirit of God,</hi> by their offerings; and <hi>therefore</hi> they offered the Fat <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>oyle</hi> of the beasts and other earthly good fruits, that so the desire of the true man, created out of the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, who shall arise from death, <hi>might</hi> in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling of the offring in the fire, have a <hi>Substance</hi> whereinto it might <hi>give</hi> it selfe, and Imaginate it selfe; and so in the property of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fire it <hi>might be able</hi> to enter with its will into the Ayme of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which stood before God in the figure, untill [the promise] of <hi>the womans Seed was fulfilled</hi> and accomplished.</p>
                              <p n="26">26. In which Seed the dear and pretious Name of <hi>Jesus</hi> did open it selfe out of <hi>Jehovah</hi> and did again <hi>awaken</hi> the heavenly life in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared <hi>Ens</hi> in the humanity, and offered up this whole Image in the Person of Christ, to the Anger fire of the Father, and with the holy Love fire Regenerated and <hi>enkindled</hi> in the humane life, did bring it quite through the Anger, <hi>viz.</hi> through the fire of the Eternall nature
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29914:77"/>
of the Fathers Manifestation, and <hi>changed</hi> the anger-fire into a love-fire, and this was just thus prefigured in the <hi>Offring</hi>; for the Love-fire enkindled the offring, and in the offring was yet the <hi>Curse</hi> of the Earth aswell as in the humane free will, and when the offring was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, it was a <hi>Sin-offering</hi> whereby the free-will of mans Soule was <note n="t" place="margin">Reconciled with God.</note> propitiated before God.</p>
                              <p n="27">27. Now if <hi>Sin</hi> shall be reconciled and appeased, then it must be brought into the Anger, <hi>viz.</hi> into the judgement of God, into the sword of the <hi>Cherub,</hi> that it may cut off the same, which (Cherub) is the <hi>Sword</hi> of Gods anger: and if then the humane will be <hi>wholly</hi> Sinfull and altogether capable of the fire of Anger then God Enkindleth the <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> in which the Anger-fire lay hidden in the Curse, with the holy fire that the humane will which was apprehended in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-fire <hi>might</hi> be atonened in the Love-fire.</p>
                              <p n="28">28. For the Love-fire of God tinctureth the soules desire in the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring,</hi> as a tincture tingeth brasse and Iron and changeth them into Gold: even thus the humane Soules free-will, vvhich was inspired wholly pure and spotlesse into man, was tinctured and <hi>again purified</hi> before God, that so it might enter into Gods mercy: for the mercy was <hi>hidden</hi> in the Love-fire, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Aym of the Covenant, in the Name of <hi>Jesus</hi> in God, in which Covenant, and Name, the Anger of God was <hi>Reconciled</hi> and Atonened in the offring, and laid down its Anger-burning flames, and suffered the soules free-will to passe quite through it.</p>
                              <p n="29">29. But as touching the offring in it selfe, with the Wood, Fire, Light, and Smoak; understand it thus: <hi>Abel offered of his flock,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, sheep, or oxen, as <hi>Moses</hi> did the like; namely, <hi>the fat of them,</hi> now the offring (<hi>viz.</hi> the wood and Smoak) on the outward part as to the mater, was earthly; and so was Man as to the <hi>outward</hi> Body, earthly, and in the earthlinesse lay the <hi>Curse,</hi> both in Man and in the Offring.</p>
                              <p n="30">30. But vvhen the Offring was <hi>Enkindled,</hi> it was Spirituall, for from the wood proceeded the fire, which tooke the Offring and consumed it, and out of the consumptivenesse, vvent forth, first from the fire the smoak, and afterward the light; this was the <hi>Figure,</hi> whereinto Mans and also Gods Imagination entered, as a Compaction or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="31">31. In the Enkindled Consuming fire vvas the desire of the <hi>Angry Father, viz.</hi> a Conjunction of the eternall natures-fire with the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall fire; the Eternall is <hi>Magicall,</hi> and the temporall is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and <hi>matter</hi> of the magicall, <hi>viz.</hi> its <note n="u" place="margin">Or Amasse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Reception and in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled Light was the holy love-fire, which is <hi>also magicall,</hi> as subtile as a will, which did also <hi>immasse</hi> it selfe in the enkindled light and in the forth-proceeding smoak, which is an Elementall Sulphur and Mercury, <hi>viz.</hi> a life of the quality; the <hi>smell</hi> or <hi>taste</hi> went forth also, which signifieth the humane power of the Body, and the outward spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of nature.</p>
                              <p n="32">32. In this <hi>power</hi> which proceeded forth from the offring, out of the fire and light, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God which proceedeth forth from the Father and Son did Amass it selfe in the Amassement of the humane

                              <p n="33">33. For this Lamb of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ, should compleat, perfect, and make this introduced offring fully acceptable, upon the <hi>Great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> of the Angelicall world; that it might be to God an Eternall <hi>Sweet Savour</hi> of his deepest Love, which he represented in Man, in his intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced offring in the Lamb of God Christ, and <hi>Mankinde,</hi> in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative offring.</p>
                              <p n="34">34. The humane offring was the <hi>Sojourner</hi> of the true Lamb and offering of God in Christ, and now where the offring is, there is also the spirit of man, for mans spirit is gone forth, and departed from God into Time, and in the Time it hath <hi>defiled</hi> it selfe, therefore it must forsake the <hi>Pollution,</hi> and enter in again through this Offring to God.</p>
                              <p n="35">35. But if it will enter, then it must doe it in manner and forme as it went out; for it brought it selfe into false desire, and <hi>lust:</hi> even so likewise it must introduce it selfe againe by a Returning into a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and <hi>conversion,</hi> and in the Sorrow or Repentance again, into a <hi>divine desire</hi> which is called <hi>Faith.</hi>

                                 </note> it did bring the faith or the beleeving desire <hi>into an offring,</hi> and so amassed or formed the beleeving desire in the offring, into a Substance or Essence, that the <hi>Faith</hi> also <hi>might</hi> become essentiall, and this essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallity of faith received the holy fire of God, which would in the fulnesse of time open it selfe in the essentiality of faith, and bring the humane <hi>Substance</hi> thereinto, and also bring it forth in it selfe through Gods Anger, and change it in it selfe into a Love-fire, for all the words of <hi>prayer</hi> in the offring were also received into the Substance of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="37">37. For as <hi>all things</hi> were formed Amassed and introduced by the vvord of God into a <hi>Substance</hi>; so likewise the words of the prayer of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> in the offring were formed and amassed to substance <hi>viz.</hi> unto an <hi>Incorruptible</hi> Essence, in which Essence, Christ, Gods Son, in the fulnesse of time brake forth out of the Covenant, and <hi>tooke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him</hi> this same Essence together vvith the humane Essence, and as a potent <hi>Champion</hi> and mighty Conquerour <hi>destroyed the Kingdome of death and the Devill.</hi>

                              <p n="38">38. And to this faiths Essence in the Spirit of Christ in all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and members, was given the <hi>Judgement over the world,</hi> yea <hi>over</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>the Devill and</hi> of <hi>death</hi>; thereby to destroy and bring to nought their works, and Possess the Royall Throne.</p>
                              <p n="39">39. This was the reall offring of <hi>Abel</hi>; for the Spirit of the holy love-fire, in the Aym of the Covenant, had opened it selfe in him, so that <hi>he understood it</hi>; and therefore he offered, that so his beleeving desire <hi>might</hi> be accepted before God and be brought into a substance to the new <hi>Regeneration</hi>; for he looked upon the promise of the Serpent-Stroyer, and introduced the desire of his faith, into him, and desired that his faith, spirit, and life, might be <hi>confirmed</hi> in the Serpent-Stroyer,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29914:78"/>
who was promised; he would fain be therein accepted before God; as it was granted him, so that the fire of God <hi>did enkindle his offring,</hi> and received his prayer in the Love-fire; and in the Sweet Savour of the offring, it was brought by the Spirit of God in the power of the light, into an <hi>holy</hi> Substance, and it is rightly said: <hi>his offring was acceptable before God.</hi>

                              <p n="40">40. The offring alone could not have been able to have done it, onely the <hi>Faith</hi> which did Idea, or lay hold on the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> in the offring, which apprehended the Covenant, and the true very pretious and deare <hi>Offring</hi>; the same did effect it; the offring was onely a <hi>figure</hi> of that which vvas therein accomplished and performed, as the <hi>outward</hi> world is onely a <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>inward</hi> Spirituall world, whereby the Spirituall world doth introduce it selfe into a figure and Essence, and beholds it selfe therein as in a Looking-<hi>glasse.</hi>

                                 </gap>ottry, the <hi>Type</hi> and Image of whom is <hi>Cain</hi>; and as <hi>Cain</hi> in his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring sought onely the outward world, might, and pleasure, and would be an <hi>outwardly adopted</hi> and received childe; God should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his evill Beast to be Accepted, and offered up; he desired to be Gods acceptable childe with the selfehood in the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> and falsehood: he vvas an <hi>Impenitent</hi> proud man, who thought to be a Lord of the world, and to <hi>domineer</hi> over <hi>Abel</hi> and his posterity; and just thus is the <hi>Antichristian Church</hi> upon the Earth, it <hi>buildeth</hi> also <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Altars, preacheth, singeth,</hi> and <hi>tincketh,</hi> and doth likewise <hi>offer</hi> in the bequeathed Covenant and Testament of Christ, and so <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth</hi> it selfe with the offring of Christ, and will be an outwardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and adopted Son, notwithstanding that, its offring is <hi>not</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the Covenant and Testament of Christ, nor brought to Substance.</p>
                              <p n="42">42. The cause and ground of it is this: men depend and relye onely <hi>barely</hi> and nakedly upon the <hi>offring,</hi> and teach, that the offrings take away Sin, Christs testaments doe absolve Sin: but as <hi>little</hi> as the offring of <hi>Cain</hi> was acceptable before God, and tooke away his Sin, and as <hi>little</hi> as <hi>Cains desire</hi> was introduced into the divine Substance, so as to have the divine fire to enkindle in his offring, and receive his Faiths desire into it, even <hi>so little also</hi> doth the verball (lip-laboring) Christendome <hi>enjoy</hi> the offring of Christ in his humanity: it must be an <hi>Abel</hi> onely, that doth enjoy it, the Titular Mouth-Christian attaines onely the <hi>Smoake</hi> of the true offring; It must be onely a right hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry thirsty converted soul, which desireth <hi>wholly</hi> and fully to <hi>depart</hi> from the Serpents <hi>Ens</hi> and <hi>all vanity of this world,</hi> and striveth to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, the Serpent and all vaine will, in the Death of Christ, and desireth to arise in a new vvill totally Resigned in all <hi>Submission</hi> in God.</p>
                              <p n="43">43. This true hungry will <hi>offereth rightly</hi> with <hi>Abel,</hi> and its offring, is received into the holy fire of Christ, and formed [or amassed] in Christs humanity into a <hi>Substance:</hi> there must be earnestnesse and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29914:78"/>
                                 <hi>Power,</hi> which earnestnesse stirreth the Love-fire of Christ in his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, so that it <hi>doth</hi> enkindle it selfe in the desire; and then the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> becomes a <hi>true</hi> right <hi>Faith,</hi> for there is no right Faith without divine <note n="x" place="margin">Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension Amassement or formation.</note> Taking.</p>
                              <p n="44">44. When Mans <hi>Desire</hi> introduceth its hunger with earnest Sighing and prayer of introversion, Resignation, and departing from vanity into the offring of Christ, even then the Soules desire, <hi>doth forme</hi> it selfe, in the heavenly Essentiality, in the humanity of Christ, upon the High Altar of God, into a <hi>Substance</hi>; the hungry desire, becomes in the word of God, in Christs Testaments, <hi>flesh,</hi> an heavenly superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall flesh, and this <hi>flesh</hi> is the true Offring of God, which God taketh to his habitation, and not the beastiall mortall Man.</p>
                              <p n="45">45. In this <hi>holy</hi> Substance onely, is the true Faith of <hi>Abel,</hi> without this, there is only an <hi>hystoricall painted</hi> and <hi>feigned</hi> faith, a <hi>Cains</hi> offring which doth not take away Sin: for Sin must alwayes be brought into the <hi>judgement</hi> of God, wherein it was borne; and the holy Love-fire of God must <hi>drown</hi> and wash it away, else there is <hi>no forgivenesse</hi>; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offring nor Covenant doth availe any thing without it; also no going to Church, neither Singing nor devout shewing doth attaine it, nothing else at all doth it but onely the <hi>hungry desiring</hi> Faith through the <hi>Alone</hi> Offring in the bloud and Death of Christ, where the <hi>Desire</hi> doth <hi>wholly</hi> dye in the death of Christ to its Selfehood, and arise in Christs Resurrection with a true Faith and christianity, not in a <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious shew</hi> of holinesse but in the inward Essence in words and works.</p>
                              <p n="46">46. For He is yet <hi>far</hi> from a Christian, who calls himselfe a Christian, or is so tearmed onely, but he is <hi>one,</hi> who is <hi>borne</hi> in the offring of his humanity in him: neither Covenant nor Lawes availe any thing before God, but <hi>a new creature:</hi> no <hi>Cathedrall Stone-Church meeting-house</hi> or <hi>hypocrycie,</hi> or whatsoever it be called, can inherit Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but onely and alone the true <hi>living</hi> Offring of the new rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration arising from the <hi>Covenant</hi> of promise in Paradise, through the quickning Word in the <hi>Offring</hi> of Christ.</p>
                              <p n="47">47. It is onely and alone the <hi>Temple</hi> of the holy Spirit, where <hi>Gods word</hi> is taught and taken, without that, is <hi>Cain</hi> with his glister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Stone-Church</hi> full of pride, and stinking Ambition, the Great building of Babylon, where the Language of Gods word, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>the written word</hi> is confounded and divided into manifold <hi>contentions,</hi> and Languages, where there is nothing but wrangling, jangling, and snarling about the <hi>Letters,</hi> and no true reall living effectuall and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull knowledge.</p>
                              <p n="48">48. Now where the <hi>living knowledge</hi> of Christ is, there is the <hi>Altar</hi> of God in all places, where the hungry Soul may offer the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable holy offring, in prayer, there it may introduce the prayer in the Word, in its hunger, into a <hi>Substantiall</hi> Faith.</p>
                              <p n="49">49. <hi>Not</hi> that we would hereby wholly abolish and race down the Stone-Churches, but we teach the <hi>Temple of Christ,</hi> which ought to be brought along [in the <hi>heart</hi>] into the Stone-Church, or else the whole business of the Stone-Church is onely an hypocriticall <hi>antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> whoredome, a <hi>Cains</hi> offring, both of the <hi>Preacher</hi> and <hi>hearer:</hi> so
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29914:79"/>
that one is not a whit better then another, unlesse he enter through the true <hi>doore</hi> Christ in Spirit and <hi>power</hi> in the Temple of Christ into the Stone-Church, or at <hi>least</hi> resolve to fix betake and fasten himselfe there, into such an earnest desire, [that he will take and hold fast that which is good onely for the <hi>amendment</hi> of his life] else <hi>Cain</hi> goeth to Church to offer, and cometh out againe a <hi>Killer</hi> of his brother.</p>
                              <p n="50">50. As it often appeares; that when men in the Stone-Churches have <hi>taken</hi> and amassed io their Mindes a deale of revilings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and Censures; [that have fallen from the false smoaky <hi>Cain</hi>-like fury and <hi>pretended zeale</hi> of the Preachers] then they forthwith come with all and murther <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Christs members,</hi> as this Spirit hath many hundred times found by experience, and that onely for the sake of the Temple of Christ.</p>
                              <p n="51">51. Now if we would rightly consider of the offring of <hi>Cain</hi>; then we must looke him into the very <hi>Essnce</hi> of his will and desire, for he <hi>also</hi> would offer and be acceptable to God, but he loved onely his <hi>ownhood,</hi> and selfe-full selfe; his ayme and endeavour was not, to be or become a new creature, but God should so take away his Sins in the <hi>offring</hi> from him, but he would still remaine the old <hi>Cain,</hi> and so offer to God, that he might be so accepted with him: the <hi>Devill</hi> came in the forme of an <hi>Angel</hi> before God.</p>
                              <p n="52">52. <hi>Cain</hi> 
                                 <note n="y" place="margin">Or did not acknowledge.</note> knew <hi>not</hi> his evill Serpentine property, the poore Soul was captivated therewith and had set it selfe up in the Serpents wit and pride, it would needs be an <hi>outwardly adopted</hi> childe and heir of God, the offring must make reconciliation for him; as <hi>Babell</hi> doth, which taketh also the <hi>Mantle</hi> of Christ upon her, and saith, Christ hath undertaken and <hi>suffered</hi> for all my <hi>Sins</hi> upon the Crosse, I cannot purchase or doe any thing for my selfe, my <hi>works</hi> availe nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, I need <hi>onely beleeve</hi> that Christ hath done it, and comfort my selfe therewith, and then I am already <hi>justified</hi> and acquitted from all my Transgressions.</p>
                              <p n="53">53. Thus she cometh before God, and thanketh God that he hath <hi>payed</hi> the reckoning and score, in his Son, and offreth with <hi>Cain</hi> and the <hi>Pharisee</hi> in the Temple, and remaineth in her selfe a brother-slayer with <hi>Cain:</hi> and this is the babylonicall fruit; like as <hi>Cain</hi> would take the offring upon him for a <hi>cloake</hi> and Covering; so also his <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> Church taketh on it the offring of Christ for a cloake, and Covert of its Sins, and false murther; and covereth its murtherous Spirit, so that men must call it <hi>an holy</hi> devout Christian.</p>
                              <p n="54">54. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> must serve their turne thereto, when he saith; <hi>I doe that I would not, now if I doe it, it is not I but Sin that dwelleth in my flesh,</hi> but that he saith; <hi>now then with my Minde I serve God, but with the flesh the law of Sin:</hi> the same, <hi>Cain</hi> will not understand, how the <hi>Minde</hi> must without intermission <hi>rule</hi> and reigne <hi>over the Sinfull</hi> will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the flesh, and <hi>mortifie the lust.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="55">55. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the heavenly <hi>Abel</hi>-like desire, how Sin must be mortified in the flesh, and not rule over the Minde, as it did in <hi>Cain,</hi> when he saw his brother was accepted before God, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was not; then the <hi>murthering</hi> Spirit <hi>arose</hi> in his Minde, which should
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29914:79"/>
have been mortified in the offring by true <hi>Repentance</hi> and conversion.</p>
                              <p n="56">56. Thus also goeth <hi>Babel</hi> under the Mantle of Christ, which offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth also to God, and thanketh him for the offering of Christ, but it selfe <hi>remaineth</hi> in the Minde of the Cainicall brother-slayer, in pride, covetousnesse, Envy and Anger, in <hi>Persecution,</hi> in warre, and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it fighteth about the <hi>Offring,</hi> and about the <hi>Outward</hi> Covering, least it should be stripped thereof; and doth in the meane time fatten it selfe under it, with the beastiall offrings of <hi>the fatnesse of the Earth,</hi> and still remaines the Cainicall Beast, and doth also continually murther <hi>Abel</hi> in <hi>Christs Members,</hi> and comforteth it selfe with the death of Christ, the same must be a Covert for the false murthering Spirit.</p>
                              <p n="57">57. The heart and minde is <hi>far</hi> from the new creature: it is onely the old Cainicall brother-slayer, which bemantles it selfe with Christs offring, and offers with <hi>Cain</hi>; such, and nothing better remaines now of <note n="z" place="margin">Or Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> Christianity among all <hi>Sects,</hi> except the children of Christ, who are heere and there <hi>hidden</hi> with <hi>Abel.</hi>

And now as God had <hi>incorporated,</hi> and promised the Serpent-bruiser of this false property, (who should bruise the head of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens</hi> and will or desire) unto the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> of man, which disappeared, in and to Paradise, which word of promise was a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a very <hi>Secret</hi> hiddennesse to the earthly Man; even so also the false Cainicall Church of hypocricie and <hi>seeming holinesse,</hi> whose heart and desire is onely [of] the outward world, hath gotten aloft this <hi>whole</hi> time, and hath the <hi>outward</hi> dominion and Name as if it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God: but the true <hi>reall Christian</hi> Church is hidden under it, as a very secret Mystery, and is not known of the <hi>Cainicall</hi> Church.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Cains</hi> Church sets forth it selfe very devoutly, and glysters on all sides with specious <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and pompous <hi>ostentation</hi>; giving forth, that it is <hi>holy</hi> righteous and good; that it also offers in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Christ, but its <hi>heart</hi> is onely a glozing soothing bravely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired <hi>Harlot,</hi> full of Cainicall murther, reviling and blasphemy, full of censure and selfe-speculation, in pride, in covetousnesse, and high mindednesse; but <hi>Abels</hi> Church is hidden under it in great plainnesse and with no Respect and Reputation, and is accounted but <hi>foo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="4">4. Now saith Reason; what, had God any pleasure herein, that he suffered <hi>Cain</hi> to <hi>kill Abel</hi>; and why is it still to this day that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, are <hi>slaine,</hi> dispised, contemned reproached mocked scorned and cryed down for false, by <hi>Cain, viz.</hi> by his <hi>posterity</hi>; one cause hereof is this.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Prince <hi>Lucifer</hi> was an Hierarch in the Kingdome or place of this world, (as Christ even calleth him a <hi>Prince of this world, viz.</hi> in the Kingdome of darkness in the Anger of God) and was <hi>cast</hi> for his pride sake <hi>out</hi> of the light into the darkness.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. But being God then created another Prince, <hi>viz. Adam</hi> in and for <hi>this place,</hi> with whom he bound himselfe even with his deepest Love <hi>before the foundation of the world</hi> in the deare and pretious <hi>Name JESVS,</hi>
                              <pb n="153" facs="tcp:29914:80"/>
that he would break down and destroy, the throne and Kingdome of proud Prince <hi>Lucifer</hi> in the humane property, and overcome and be predominant with Love; thence forthwith arose his Envy, and wrath against man.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Secondly, the <hi>Cause</hi> is this; In the <hi>fall</hi> of man, the wrath of the Eternall and also of the Temporall and inchoative nature, obtained the Superiour Sway and <hi>dominion</hi> in the humane property; for the Kingdome of Heaven did extinguish in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> when as they became Earthly; and in the roome and stead thereof the Kingdome of the Devill did awake, in the Serpents wit and pride, in them: for the <note n="a" place="margin">Mans will.</note> 
                              <hi>humane will</hi> had broken it selfe off from God, and was entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to selfehood, and no longer understood any thing of the <hi>Mystery</hi> of Gods Kingdome.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. But seeing that the Kingdome of God did againe bud, and break forth in the <hi>ATM</hi> of the Covenant in <hi>Abel</hi> and the children of God; the Devills Kingdome and will in the Serpent-Monster could <hi>not brooke</hi> it; Also the Love-Kingdome, is a great Enmity against the wrath of the Eternall nature according to the darke property, for the humane Essence was become according to the darke worlds property, as to the Soule an <hi>halfe Devill,</hi> and as to the outward worlds vanity an <hi>halfe Beast,</hi> in which Beast the false suttle crafty wicked lustfull proud covetous envious and angry Serpents worme, did sit, infected with the Devills will.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. This wrathfull vile malicious monstrous beast would <hi>live</hi> in its owne selfe property; therefore the Angelicall virgin-childe which should destroy and possesse the Kingdome of this Evill Beast, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <hi>against him</hi> in <hi>Abell</hi>; This was now a Great Enmity, for the Anger of God had captivated Man, and would worke and rule in him; <hi>therefore</hi> Gods Love brake forth out of the Anger, as a <hi>light</hi> out of the fire, and would <hi>kill</hi> the Anger, and change it into Love, and <hi>help againe</hi> poore mans Image, and redeeme it from the Eternall Anger and death.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. But being the Anger had got the upper hand and sway in man; and yet the virgin-childe of the Angelicall worlds Essence <hi>should spring forth</hi> and grow out of the Covenant of God, out of the disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>Ens,</hi> through the Anger, as a clear delightfull light, shines forth out of the Candle, through the wrathfull fire, which depriveth the darknesse of its power and prevalency; therefore the <hi>outward</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in [<hi>Abel,</hi> and] the children of God must suffer it selfe to be <hi>slaine,</hi> and persecuted by the wrath of God; for <note n="b" place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Body.</note> it was a <hi>strange</hi> figure on the virgin childe.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. For <hi>Abel</hi> in his outward flesh had the Awakened <hi>vanity</hi> lying in him as well as <hi>Cain</hi>; he was also <hi>Sinfull</hi> as to the outward man, but <hi>internally</hi> the Angelicall word and Image of Paradise did spring and bud forth againe in the Covenant; this was now a great <hi>enmity</hi> against each other; the inward man <hi>bruised</hi> the Serpent-Monster upon the head of its false desire, and the Serpent-Monster <hi>stung</hi> him on the heel of his Angelicall will, and openly mocked the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Image; as it is <hi>so</hi> still to this day; so soon as the virgin-childe is borne in the Spirit of Christ, the outward earthly body together
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29914:81"/>
with the virgin-<hi>childe,</hi> is by the children of <hi>Cain</hi> persecuted, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, reviled, and accounted as a strange childe of the world.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. For the Serpents-Monster is as a <hi>foole</hi> before God, and being the noble and pretious virgin-childe must beare such a Monster on it in the outward flesh, to which the <hi>Devill</hi> hath yet <hi>continuall accesse,</hi> therefore this body is strongly assaulted and struck at by the Devill in the Anger of God, and its children; they <hi>would</hi> continually slay it; for the virgin-childe worketh through the outward man, as a light through the fire, and <hi>manifesteth</hi> it selfe: it teacheth and <hi>reproveth</hi> the wicked Sort: and this the Devill cannot endure, for it is against his Kingdome, as the offring of <hi>Abell</hi> was against <hi>Cains.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="13">13. For <hi>Cain</hi> offered in the proud Serpents desire as an hypocrite, and would be an honest demure devout and Godly childe in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents desire; but <hi>Abel humbled</hi> himselfe before God, and set his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire into Gods <hi>mercy</hi>: Gods Love-fire tooke his offering, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated through the earthly offring and fire; and the like also is to be understood in the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Abel</hi>; as the Incorruptible [being] shall swallow up the corruptible, so also the heavenly tooke the earthly captive in it selfe.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. But that <hi>Cain</hi> slew the outward body of <hi>Abel</hi> hath this <note n="c" place="margin">Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> type and figure; that the outward body shall be <note n="d" place="margin">Or morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> 
                              <hi>slaine</hi> in the Anger of God; the Anger must devoure and mortifie the outward Image which is grown up in the Anger; and out of Death <hi>springeth</hi> forth the Eternall life.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. <hi>Abel</hi> was a figure of Christ; the children of Gods Anger must execute the <hi>Right</hi> of Gods Anger upon the outward earthly, and also beastiall Image of the children of the <hi>holy</hi> One; even as the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> (who before God were onely false Serpent-children as Christ called them) must persecute, and kill the <hi>humanity</hi> of Christ; so likewise was <hi>Cain</hi> a type of these Serpentine wolvish Pharisees, and also of the <hi>verball</hi> Titular Christendome.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. As the false Serpents-child is a monster and <hi>fool</hi> before the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall world, so likewise the children of darknesse doe account and esteeme the children of the light for <hi>fooles</hi>; for there must be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that the one might be manifest in the other; if the Anger had <hi>not</hi> taken hold of the <hi>humanity,</hi> and devoured it into it selfe, then the deepest Love of God would <hi>not</hi> have been <hi>manifest</hi> in Man.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. But thus the Love taketh Cause by the Anger to overpower and prevaile over the same with its motion and manifestation; as the same may be <hi>known</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi>: the true Son of God gave himselfe into our Image which was awaked in the Anger, that so he might be made manifest with his Love in the Anger, and <hi>change</hi> the same into joy.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. Christ gave <hi>our humane Image</hi> to the Anger of his father to be devoured in death, and brought his life into death, and yet manifested his Love in the <hi>life</hi> which death had devoured, and brought forth the life in Love through the death; as a <hi>Grain</hi> of corn which is sown into the earth, the same <hi>must dye in the earth,</hi> but out of that mortifyed grain growes a fair new body; even so the corrupt body of <hi>Adam</hi> shall and must be <hi>offered</hi> to <hi>death,</hi> and the Anger; and out of the Death and Anger the body of the divine Love shall be manifest.</p>
                           <p n="19">

                              <hi>visard</hi> before the outward world; for there was another <hi>Spirit</hi> hidden therein, which was not of the outward worlds Essence and property, therefore because he was <hi>not wholly</hi> a right childe of the earthly world, it would not suffer him (being as a strange childe) in it; for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill was Prince in the wrathfull Essence in this world, who would <hi>not</hi> that a <hi>childe</hi> of the <hi>light</hi> should spring forth through the wrathfull Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence [and be in his Garden.]</p>
                           <p n="20">20. Thus the Image or person of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> is a true figure of the false, and then also of the holy and true children of God; of the <hi>outward Sinfull</hi> corrupt and mortall Man, and of the <hi>inward now</hi> regenerate <hi>holy</hi> man, when Christ with his Love-Kingdome ariseth from death out of the disappeared <hi>Ens,</hi> then <hi>Adams</hi> earthly Image must <hi>dye</hi> in Christs death; and if it now be, that the outward body must yet live, it is onely a scorne and foole before the <hi>Heavens</hi> Image, and so also before the <hi>naturall</hi>

                           <p n="21">21.

                           <p n="36">36. There is a continuall, and constant <hi>Combate</hi> in them, of the flesh in the earthly desire against the divine desire, and of the divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire against the lust of the earthly flesh, for the <hi>divine desire</hi> doth <note n="*" place="margin">Betake.</note> amasse it selfe into Gods Grace and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and brings it selfe into a Centre of a working life, and penetrates through the earthly false lustfull life, and striketh the false lust and Imagination down; and then the <hi>false</hi> Imagination falls into great <hi>Sadnesse,</hi> when as it contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates and beholds the voluptuous pompous stately brave glistering <hi>Course</hi> of this world, and findes it selfe so mean and foolish, that it must forsake and <hi>forgoe</hi> that, wherein it might have its chief joy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and delight.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. Also the <hi>Devill</hi> he cometh forthwith with his temptation, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29914:83"/>
bringeth <hi>his</hi> desire into the false Imagination; and shewes him the fair Kingdome of the <hi>world,</hi> and rebuketh his Intent as a <hi>false Phancy</hi> and meere conjecture; stirreth up the crew of the wicked against him, who scorne jeere reproach and contemn him; and then sometimes the Sprackling glimps, and <hi>divine desire,</hi> doth even lose it selfe, for <hi>Christ, viz.</hi> the virgins-childe in the Spirit of Christ, is lead into the <hi>wildernesse,</hi> and is tempted of the Devill and of the Anger of God, and also of the Carnall worlds spirit, and oftentimes the Spirit of Christ doth <hi>hide</hi> it selfe, as if the virgins-childe were quite gone and past Hopes, also the Devill makes his addresse thereto, and brings him into <hi>Doubt</hi> as if the virgins childe were not borne.</p>
                           <p n="38">38. For the virgins childe is hidden in the <hi>Desart,</hi> and then the poore captivated Soule is in great Sorrow and lamentation, sigheth, and cryeth to God, also it cannot love, or away with, the beastiall Image, but it doth stir up it selfe as a great assaulting <hi>Storme</hi> in the Body, and seeketh the Gates of the deep in its Originall; and forceth with might [or holy violence] into that <hi>word</hi> which hath formed it to be a creature, and diveth it selfe thereinto as an Impotent, will-lesse childe, and desireth its first mother, whence the first Soule was born, for its <hi>Nurse,</hi> and makes it selfe wholly will-lesse in this mother, and lyeth onely at her <hi>Breasts,</hi> and sucketh her Love and grace into it, the mother may doe with it, what she please: this is the true meaning, and the right manner of <hi>dying</hi> to selfehood and selfefull Imagination and lust in ones selfe, and becoming as to the will of the Soule as a childe in ones selfe; as Christ saith, <hi>unlesse yee be converted and become as children, yee can in no wise see the Kingdome of God</hi>; selfe, and selfefull Reason in the lust of the flesh, can neither taste or see it.</p>
                           <p n="39">39. From this mortification, of the Selfefull will, and earnest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation into Gods mercy, the virgins-childe doth again <hi>Spring</hi> forth out of the Desart with its faire and glorious Pearl-blooming Tree with very excellent and <hi>new</hi> fruit, for so it must be tryed in the fire of Gods Anger, that the Abomination of the introduced earthly will, may <hi>dye</hi> in it.</p>
                           <p n="40">40. For the fire-soule, <hi>viz.</hi> the first Principle, hangeth upon the <hi>Band</hi> of the outward world, and continually and eagerly introduceth Something of <hi>vanity</hi> into it, whereby the virgin-childe of the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call worlds Essence, <hi>viz.</hi> of Christs essentiality, is defiled, obscured, and darkned, therefore it must be so refined purified and <hi>purged</hi> again; and many a cold piercing rautish wind of tribulation <hi>Anguish</hi> and great perplexity, bloweth upon this child; it must be continually as an <hi>off-scouring</hi> of the world, for its Kingdome is not of this world; as Christ said, <hi>my Kingdome is not of this world.</hi>

                           <p n="43">43. <hi>These,</hi> the holy Ghost doth rebuke and reprove by the Virgins child in Christs Spirit, and calls them <hi>hypocrites and wolves in sheeps cloathing, and crafty Foxes</hi> borne of the Serpents <hi>Ens,</hi> in whom there is the very property of Toads, Dogs, and wilde Beasts; and shewes them, that <hi>they draw neer to God with their lips, but their Heart is full of murther,</hi> gall, and Serpent-desire, and hath no true upright Love-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in it; also it shewes them, that they are but meer flatterers and dissemblers in their <hi>Office,</hi> who onely seeke <hi>pleasure</hi> and Temporall Honour and <hi>Respect thereby,</hi> that so they might be able to domineer and Lord it over mens bodies and Soules Goods and Estates, and thus they serve God onely <hi>from without</hi> with hypocriticall mouthes, but their heart hangeth to the whoredome of <hi>Babylon,</hi> full of devillish murther and poyson against him, that doth but <hi>touch</hi> their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>

                           <p n="50">50.

                           <p n="69">69. The like also is to be understood in the various <hi>diversity</hi> and Severalty of <hi>Men</hi> touching evill and good; The Evill must be a Cause, that the good be made manifest to it selfe; and the Good must be a cause to manifest the Evill in its <hi>wicked</hi> malicious Suttlety and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that all things may come into their <hi>contemplation,</hi> [and visible ken,] and every thing might manifest its <hi>judgement</hi> in it selfe unto the <hi>Great</hi> Separation-<hi>Day of the LORD</hi> of all beings, where every thing shall give in it selfe into its <hi>Barne</hi> for its usefulnesse and profit, that, in the Eternity, the Great God may be <hi>known,</hi> in a creaturall and formall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, according to light, and darknesse.</p>
                           <p n="70">70.

                                 <pb n="165" facs="tcp:29914:86"/>5. For it is the Divine <note n="e" place="margin">Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                                 <hi>Vision</hi> of the formed wisdome; its <hi>Centre</hi> is the formed Will, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word forth-Speaking out of all Powers, and its <hi>life</hi> is the Spirit which proceedeth in the Speaking or breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which <hi>distinguisheth</hi> and formeth the Lubet of the wisdome, so that the formed wisdome playeth before the life of the <hi>Deity,</hi> as little children play before their parents who have begotten them, out of their Essence, for their joy, and in them the parents take their delight, and Pastime.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. Thus likewise we are to understand the Beeing of Eternity; which <hi>Being,</hi> the Eternall free-will, hath in the forth-breathing word intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a <hi>Desire, viz.</hi> to an <hi>externall</hi> comprehensivenesse, in which comprehensibility the beginning of the <hi>Corporeall</hi> Being is arisen, <hi>viz.</hi> the Centre of the Formed Nature, wherein the desire hath Amassed <hi>formed</hi> and introduced it selfe into properties, <hi>viz.</hi> into darknesse and light, into Paine and Source, into joy and Sorrow; and yet we must <hi>not</hi> understand any <hi>Sorrow</hi> to be in the Pregnatresse; but so the free-will doth forme and conceive it selfe in the desire to the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and manifestation of the <hi>wonders</hi>; that so the properties might be peculiarly manifested and revealed in each other.</p>
                              <p n="7">7. For if there were no <hi>Contra-will</hi> then there would be no <hi>motion</hi> in the properties; but being the free-will hath introduced it selfe into Love, and Anger, <hi>viz.</hi> into Evill and Good; a <hi>twofold</hi> will is arisen in these properties <hi>viz.</hi> a wrathfull [will] according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fire, and of the <hi>darknesse,</hi> and a good Love-will according to the nature and quality of the <hi>light</hi>; so that one might dwell in, and manifest the other.</p>
                              <p n="8">8. Not that <hi>this</hi> Birth hath received onely a temporall beginning: it <note n="f" place="margin">Or hath been.</note> is <hi>Eternall,</hi> and is the manifestation of the <hi>Divine</hi> vision, Sensation, and perception: onely in the Creating of the Creation this Birth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced it selfe into a <hi>Compaction</hi> or Externall comprehensivenesse that it might have a <hi>Distinct</hi> Dominion to worke in for its owne Sport and play.</p>
                              <p n="9">9. Also we are not to conceive that in the Creation, the Evill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the darknesse and fiery property was <hi>Separated</hi> from the Good, and placed in a Peculiar <hi>Sundry</hi> working Dominion, but the one is in the other: yet <hi>the light shoane through the darknesse, and the darknesse could not comprehend it:</hi> Every life in the Creation proceeded forth from the <hi>fiery</hi> property and the Spirit of the rationall understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did arise from the <hi>lights</hi> property; In the Creation Every fiery life was brought forth in its beginning <note n="g" place="margin">In or for.</note> to the light.</p>
                              <p n="10">10. Moreover the Creatour of all Beings hath given the Creatures, of the <hi>outward</hi> world (which hath a Temporall beginning out of the Eternall word) An <hi>Vniversall light</hi> for visible contemplation; also eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life in the Creation hath received the light of nature out of the <hi>Centre</hi> in it selfe, out of which the understanding ariseth, so that the Creature can rule and governe it selfe.</p>
                              <p n="11">11. And nothing was created <hi>Evill</hi> or to the Dominion of iniquity; for though on one part it hath an <hi>Ens</hi> of the wrath in it selfe for its life, yet on the other part it hath also an <hi>Ens</hi> of the light and good vertue in it selfe; and <hi>it is set</hi> in the free-will to conceive [or worke] in Evill
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29914:87"/>
or Good; for there is nothing so Evill but it hath a Good in it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may rule and be <hi>predominant</hi> over the Evill.</p>
                              <p n="12">12. But man was in Equall Accord in his properties, no property was manifest <hi>above</hi> the other; for he was <hi>Gods Image</hi>; like as there is no Evill manifest in God, unlesse he would <hi>himselfe</hi> manifest the wrath of the Eternall Nature in a thing; Even so also the divine free-will was given to man.</p>
                              <p n="13">13. And with all, the Command, that he in his free-will <hi>should not lust after Evill and Good, viz.</hi> after the divided properties, he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue stedfast in the equall harmony of the properties, and <hi>rule</hi> with the light over the Darknesse, and <hi>then</hi> the properties of the wrath had stood in meer Joy delight and <hi>melody</hi> in him, and he had been a <hi>mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> and forme of the divine wisdome, which had seen and beheld it selfe in him according to the Kingdome of Joy.</p>
                              <p n="14">14. But being that he did contemplate with the free-will in the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simility,</hi> how evill and good were each of them in its own peculiar selfefull property, and brought his Lust and longing thereinto, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to taste thereof in the <hi>Essence</hi>; whereupon this same property did also take him in his lust, and <hi>prevailed</hi> in his will, and also in the <hi>Ens</hi> whence the will did arise, to its own Contemplation, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and thus the first man, who was good in the beginning, became a Stock or <hi>Tree</hi> of the <hi>Taste</hi> of the Knowledge of Evill and good, <hi>viz.</hi> a Contending Dominion, in which both wills <hi>viz.</hi> the Good, and the Evill ruled in one another.</p>
                              <p n="15">15. But being the fiery wrathfull will so overcame the good, which was from the lights Essence, that the lights <hi>Ens</hi> was taken captive in the wrathfull <hi>Ens,</hi> this Image <hi>fell</hi> under the power and Command of the <hi>outward</hi> Dominion, which was Evill and good; and also under the <hi>wrath</hi> of the inward nature, <hi>viz.</hi> of the fiery darknesse; upon which Image, God had <hi>compassion,</hi> and did re-<note n="*" place="margin">In-promise.</note> inhest the Covenant of Grace into the Captivated, disappeared and (as to the divine wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) blind <hi>Ens</hi> of the holy worlds being, and did Incorporate the same as a Covenant of a new <hi>Regeneration</hi> of a new Holy Will, and life.</p>
                              <p n="16">16. Thus now we are to consider aright of the Stock of the <hi>humane Tree,</hi> how it hath spread forth and displayed it selfe in the properties, and introduced it selfe as a Tree (evill and Good) into boughes and branches; and from whence his <hi>Temporall Government</hi> of distinct, and Sundry Offices, and <hi>Callings</hi> is arisen, which He did awaken in him, when he lusted after evill and good, and thereby brought himselfe in <hi>Subjection</hi> to nature, being he fell under its Dominion.</p>
                              <p n="17">17. And we see very clearly, that <hi>Moses</hi> hath described and set down in his <note n="*" place="margin">

                                 <hi>lines</hi> of Propagation.</p>
                              <p n="18">18. For first he setteth <hi>Cain,</hi> whereby is understood in the <hi>Language of nature,</hi> a Source out of the Centre of the fiery desire, a selfefull will
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:29914:87"/>
of the fiery might of the Soule, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sprout or Twig out of the <hi>first Principle,</hi> in which branch or Sprig the first Principle, did in an especiall manner <hi>prevaile</hi> and would Sever it selfe into a selfe-fulnesse, and breake it selfe off from the Love-<hi>Ens</hi>; yet not as a Darke Source, but as a Source of <hi>selfefull Lust,</hi> and also [of] fiery Strength and might.</p>
                              <p n="19">19. For out of the <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Cain</hi> (as the same was in the Centre of the Begetting nature in the wrestling wheele of life) arose <hi>his will</hi>; and out of the will, the <hi>desire</hi>; and out of the desire, the <hi>Substance,</hi> in which Substance the <hi>false minde</hi> is understood; wherein the dominion of the outward, did forme, and fasten it selfe; whereinto the <hi>Devill</hi> also in the wrath of nature <hi>croap in</hi> with his desire, and desired the Lordship and domination of this world in Selfehood; as the <hi>fallen</hi> Devill doth alwayes desire domination in the <hi>Place</hi> of this world in the inward Eternall, and outward Temporall nature.</p>
                              <p n="20">20. But being the word of divine Power, and <hi>Holinesse,</hi> had <note n="i" place="margin">Or espoused it selfe.</note> incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated it selfe with a Covenant of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> into the womans Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> into the disappeared <hi>Ens</hi> of the Spirituall worlds Essence, that it would deprive the fiery wrathfull will, proceeding from the Centre of the darke world, of its fiery might of Selfehood; thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after <hi>Cain,</hi> there Sprung forth out of the humane Tree a <hi>Sprout</hi> out of <hi>the Aym of the Covenant, viz.

                              <p n="22">22. <hi>Adam</hi> was the Stock of the universall humane tree, but when <hi>Eve</hi> was made out of him, then the tree was <hi>divided</hi> according to two Principles, not wholly in the Essence, but according to the nature and <hi>quality</hi> of the Centres of fire and light; for the Centre of the light, <hi>viz.</hi> the ground of the Love-desire did stand in <hi>Eves Matrix</hi>; but it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared as to the Creature in <hi>her fall</hi>; therefore the Divine Word did <note n="k" place="margin">Espouse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</note> re-inhest it selfe therein to a Centre of <hi>Regeneration.</hi>

Now if a man would understand vvhat <hi>Lamech</hi> saith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Revenge; then he must looke upon the Centre, for the life of all creatures consists in <hi>Seven</hi> Degrees or properties, as it is above clearely mentioned; now <hi>Adam</hi> was the Stock; for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> are one Tree; from the parting and division of which, Evill and Good did arise; and <hi>Cain</hi> was the first twigg vvhich sprung forth from this tree, vvherein the <hi>Seven</hi> properties of life did put themselves forth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:29914:90"/>
out of the right divine order and harmony in the life, and <hi>destroyed</hi> the Image of God; which was long of the Devill, who egged him on also in the divided properties to the brother-slaughter, so that he slew <hi>Abel</hi>; now God said: <hi>Cain shall be avenged Seven-fold if any one slay him; and he set a marke on Cain that none should kill him.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="53">53. The Devill had folded up himselfe in the vvrath of God, and cunningly insinuated himselfe into the <hi>Seven</hi> properties of Life, being they were departed from their mutuall Harmonious <hi>Accord,</hi> and he vvould be Lord in the place of the Spirit of God in the life of man, and would vvholly murther and slay the life as to the Kingdome of God, <hi>therefore</hi> God set a <hi>marke</hi> vvith the <hi>Promise</hi> of the Covenant therein, so that none <hi>could</hi> slay it.</p>
                              <p n="54">54. For <hi>Cain</hi> did not cry out onely for feare of the <hi>outward</hi> life, but he feared that his right <hi>Eternall</hi> life might be slaine, that his life should be wholly blotted out from the Face of God; for he cryed also and said, <hi>Lo! thou drivest me out this day from off the Earth; and I must hide my selfe from thy face; and I must be a fugitive, and a vagabond in the Earth, and it will now come to passe, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.</hi> He cryed out for feare of being killed, and was sore afraid, and yet there vvas <hi>no man</hi> besides him upon the Earth, <hi>save onely</hi> his Father <hi>Adam,</hi> and without doubt his <hi>sister</hi> vvhom he tooke to wife.</p>
                              <p n="55">55. <hi>Cain</hi> feared the <hi>Spirits,</hi> vvho had moved him to slay his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>they</hi> would also kill him; for he saith, <hi>I must be hid from thy face</hi>: now this was not in any externall manner, but in an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, for God dwelleth not in the view of the <hi>outward</hi> eyes but in the inward Spirituall [<hi>vision</hi>]; therefore God said; <hi>whosoever killeth Cains internall life, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold</hi>; and he set the marke of the Covenant on his life so that no spirit in the wrath <hi>could</hi> murther it; for he was a twigg out of the Tree of life.</p>
                              <p n="56">56. Although the <hi>Seven</hi> properties of nature in him were departed from their mutuall accord in each other; yet he was not the <hi>sole</hi> cause of it, for he had so received his life from Father and Mother in the divided property, and therefore the <hi>Grace</hi> passed as vvell upon <hi>him</hi> as upon <hi>Abel</hi>; except onely that <hi>Abel</hi> proceeded out of the <hi>other</hi> line; but the Centre of the Soule was <hi>alike</hi> to them both; but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Seed was <hi>unlike</hi>; for they were the two types of the world; <hi>viz. Cain</hi> the type of the Selfehood in the wrath and <hi>Abel</hi> the type of the resignation of life; where, from the Resignation, another world springeth forth through <hi>Death</hi> out of the Centre.</p>
                              <p n="57">57. Not that <hi>Cain</hi> was borne to destruction, but that evill awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned property in the dissimility, <hi>viz.</hi> the Soule of the outward world, brake forth <hi>forcibly</hi> in the Seed; and tooke the Centre of life into its Power, and <hi>therein</hi> God set a marke, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Covenant,</hi> that the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers should not slay the Souls life.</p>
                              <p n="58">58. But if it should so come to passe, that the owne peculiar will would give it selfe to the murtherers, then the life of <hi>Cain</hi> should be avenged <hi>Seven-fold,</hi> that is, through all the <hi>Seven</hi> properties: and the free-will which did slay the life of God which was in the Word (<hi>John</hi> 1.) should be rebuked and punished <hi>seven-fold</hi> through all the <hi>Seven</hi> formes of nature, both temporally, and eternally; and this is the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:29914:91"/>
meaning: <hi>whosoever killeth the life,</hi> [that is] what free-will soever murthereth its life, vengeance shall be taken on it Eternally in the <hi>Seaven</hi> properties of the dark vvorld.</p>
                              <p n="59">59. And in this place we are further to consider aright of the great mysteries; for the <hi>Seaven</hi> properties of the humane Tree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and manifesting the life of the Wonders of God, had now Spread forth themselves even unto <hi>Lamech</hi>; the Dominion of the world was novv wholly brought forth with <hi>Lamech</hi> in nature; for <hi>Lamech</hi> was the <hi>Seventh</hi> man in the Root of the Wonders arising from the <hi>first</hi> Stock: that is; <hi>Adam</hi> was the first; <hi>Abel</hi> belongeth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Line of the Wonders, but unto the Regeneration: <hi>Cain</hi> was the Second in the Line of the Wonders: <hi>Hanoch</hi> the third: <hi>Irad</hi> the fourth, <hi>Mahujael</hi> the fift, <hi>Methusael</hi> the Sixt, and <hi>Lamech</hi> the Seventh.</p>
                              <p n="60">60. Now <hi>Lamech</hi> did spring forth from <hi>Cains Root</hi> out of this Line of the Wonders of God; and he was an <hi>honest</hi> upright man, but was <note n="a" place="margin">Taken or beset.</note> environed with the Spirit of the Wonders, and he Looked back upon the <hi>Wound,</hi> and also upon the <note n="b" place="margin">Or Seale.</note> 
                                 <hi>Signe</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> in the Covenant, and knew for certaine that even now the Spirit of the Wonders should be fully brought forth, and manifested in the humane life; whereby <hi>all Arts</hi> of the vvorld should be found out.</p>
                              <p n="61">61. And he saw also forwards, how it would fall out in these <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of the world; hovv his children would introduce his life which they should receive from him by propagation into a <hi>Babylon</hi> of folly, and Corrupt the same; and hereby also he looked especially upon the <hi>word</hi> whence the humane life was Sprung; and how the life in the Spirit of the <hi>Wonders</hi> of the world would introduce it selfe into a <hi>seaven and seventy</hi>-fold word of Languages, and Nations, as came to passe at <hi>Babel</hi>; and how the free-will of Nature would goe astray from the <hi>Onely</hi> God, and be corrupt, and that it should be avenged <hi>seven-and-seventy-fold</hi>; that is; every tongue and speech should be Avenged in the Anger of God: and therefore, because they would Corrupt <hi>Lamechs</hi> life which they received of him by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this the Wrath of God would Avenge in the free-will of his children; divided into severall Speeches.</p>
                              <p n="62">62 For the Spirit saw forwards hovv the free-will vvould give up and addict it selfe to Selfehood, and Apostatize from the <hi>Onely</hi> God, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                              <p n="63">63.

over all kindes of creatures that the property of the wrath in the <hi>Curse</hi> of the Anger doth <hi>rule</hi> and domineere in the formed expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Word: it grieveth the <hi>Love-Ens</hi> of the word, that the Devill and wrath domineereth in it, and corrupteth, and <hi>destroyeth</hi> many.</p>

the <hi>Turba</hi> in all flesh shall perish or be thrown down; for this Sorrow was nothing else, but that the Word in the Covenant did <hi>grieve</hi> at the misery and vanity of man, and would <hi>comfort</hi> mankinde by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant through <hi>Noah,</hi> which comfort did first open it selfe in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, viz.</hi> in <hi>Enos</hi> his manifestation.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. For the comfort went forth in the Love of the <hi>Covenant</hi> and opened it selfe with its branch at its right Limit or juncture of time; for God hath <hi>confined</hi> all things into a <hi>certain</hi> limit, when every thing shall come to passe; and from the comfort of the <hi>Moving</hi> Word in the Covenant, proceeded forth the <hi>judgement</hi> that the old Adamicall man, with all his desires concupiscences and <hi>lusts</hi> should in the Covenant (when the same should open it selfe in the flesh) be <hi>drowned</hi> and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the same <hi>New</hi> humanity of <hi>Christ</hi>; and out of the comfort of the Covenant, a new humane Spirit, and will, should arise, which should live in righteousnesse, and purity; of which the <hi>Deluge</hi> was a type.</p>

                           <p n="26">26.

                           <p n="29">29. For <hi>without</hi> Gods repenting there is no true Sorrow or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the vanity, for the naturall spirit desireth <hi>not to Repent,</hi> yea if it could be <hi>more</hi> wrathfull malicious Evill and vaine, it would please Love and delight it selfe therein; for it is Nature's spirits <hi>Strength,</hi> and Might: but the Word of God which in the creation did Impresse and give it selfe into the humane <hi>Ens</hi> for a Soverain pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull [and holy] life, the same [incorporated <hi>engrafted Word</hi> of life] if it be stirred and moved, doth repent, and <hi>grieve,</hi> that it hath such an Evill Beast in Nature on it; that saith; it repenteth me that I have created <hi>the evill beast</hi> in nature.</p>

                           <p n="34">34. For the <hi>Devill</hi> was an insinuating predominant Prince in the wraths property, which had incited and stirred up the <hi>Centre</hi> of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nature in the fires <hi>Matrix,</hi> and had not onely corrupted the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life of man, but also the <hi>creatures</hi>; for he Moved and Acted Man in Gods Anger, who <hi>used</hi> the creatures for their <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>food,</hi> so that the Curse, and the Vanity was also manifest in <hi>Every</hi> life; and man in his Conversation stood in the <hi>Curse</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> and so came in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Curse even into the <hi>Abysse,</hi> viz. into the <hi>End</hi> of this world, therefore said the Spirit; <hi>the End of all flesh</hi> in its perversnesse and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence <hi>is come before me:</hi> Every life had through the vanity of man brought it selfe unto the End of the <hi>outward</hi> nature; and the <hi>Throat</hi> of wrath was <hi>Open</hi> in Nature, and would devour and swallow up all things in the wrath.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. For the Kingdome of Gods <hi>Anger,</hi> viz. the dark world, had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the upper hand in its property, and brought the <hi>Good</hi> part of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture even unto the <hi>End,</hi> therefore the formed expressed word did Move, or <hi>Repent</hi> through Every life of this vanity, that it should bear the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination on it; and said, that it would destroy the womb or pregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse of <hi>Vanity</hi> proceeding from the fires mother, with-<hi>water,</hi> and break its power and force.</p>
                           <p n="36">36. For before the Flood the fires-root was more strong and potent then the waters root, and that, from the Originall of the fiery Motion, that is, the <hi>Fiat</hi> stood in the fiery property, and compacted <hi>the Earth and Stones,</hi> so that there was then a great wrath powred forth in nature, and that by reason of the Casting out, or Ejection of the Hierarch <hi>Lucifer</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the darknesse.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. And Here by the flood or <hi>Deluge</hi> the force and <hi>violence</hi> was taken from the wrathfull fire-root, in the Centre of Nature; for the <hi>Repenting</hi> or the Grieving of the formed Word was Nothing else, but a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> where the Eternall living Divine word in the humane property, did repent and grieve in the formed Creaturall word, at our <hi>Sins,</hi> and Vanity, and <note n="*" place="margin">Dyed from the vanity.</note> mortified the same vanity in his Death in the creature; and <hi>drowned</hi> the formed creaturall word in the humane property with the divine <hi>water</hi> of love and meeknesse in the holy heavenly Bloud.</p>
                           <p n="38">38. So also in this place, the formed Word <hi>grieved</hi> at the vanity of the Creatures, in that they were laden therewith, and brought the life of all the Creatures into <hi>death</hi>; and in its Sorrow moved the meeknesse of the water-Source in Nature, <hi>so that all the fountains of the deep did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen themselves,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> saith, and devoured the fire-source in the water: this signifieth unto man the <hi>Baptisme</hi> of Christ, where the fire-source of the Soul in Gods Anger was in the word of Christs Covenant baptized with the Regenerated water of the Spirit, understand the <hi>Spirituall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which shall quench the fire of Gods Anger: As it was above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned concerning the <hi>Seaven</hi> times, that Each time of the Seaven degrees
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29914:100"/>
of nature, hath brought it selfe unto its <hi>End,</hi> and in the End there was a sorrow for the Abomination, and in the Repentance and Sorrow the <hi>Turba</hi> was broken and <hi>destroyed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="39">39. Now behold here aright, by <hi>Noah</hi> with the Flood the <hi>Second</hi> Time, viz. <hi>Seths</hi> time was at the <hi>End</hi>; and with <hi>Adam</hi> in the fall, when he lusted to Eat of the vanity, the <hi>First</hi> time was at the <hi>End.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="40">40. In <hi>Adam</hi> the Word repented, and gave it selfe with a Covenant into the life, to help comfort and restore the life; and by <hi>Noah</hi> the word repented and moved all the fountains of the deep in nature, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the wrath, and opened the Covenant of <hi>Grace.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="41">41. And when the time of <hi>Enos</hi> was at the <hi>End</hi> in the dayes of the children of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the word grieved at the vanity of Man, that they would not know God, and drowned the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> of the one Onely Tongue, and divided it, and gave <note n="*" place="margin">Or, out of.</note> by its Repentance the <hi>certain</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in the Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="42">42. And when the time of <hi>Cainan</hi> was at the <hi>End,</hi> that the children of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant were compelled in the Vanity of Servitude: the Word grieved at the Vanity, and destroyed <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and afterwards <hi>all</hi> the men of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wildernesse, save <hi>Joshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> and gave them, out of its Sorrow and Repentance, the <hi>Law</hi> of his Covenant, a True <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> who should drown the Abomination in his Bloud.</p>
                           <p n="43">43. Thus also when <hi>Mahalaleels</hi> Time was come to the <hi>End,</hi> the Word grieved in the deepest Repentance, and brought the life of God in <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> into the formed Creaturall Word in the humane <hi>Ens,</hi> and drowned the <hi>Turba</hi> in the humane <hi>Ens,</hi> with Gods Love and Mercy, and gave them the spirit of comfort, and the <hi>Gospell.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="44">44. Thus Even Now also; where the Time of <hi>Jared</hi> is at the <hi>End,</hi> which hath been covered with <hi>Babel:</hi> Even now at this present, the Word doth Repent and grieve at Our great Vanity, and will destroy the Abomination with the devouring <hi>jawes of wrath:</hi> with <hi>Sword, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, fire,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and Giveth, out of its Sorrow, grief, and Repentance, a <hi>Lilly</hi> out of <hi>Enochs</hi> mouth in Gods <hi>sweetnesse.</hi>

                           <p n="45">45. And when <hi>Enochs</hi> line shall be at the <hi>End,</hi> that the vanity doth again grow in the <hi>Turba:</hi> then cometh the greatest grief and sorrow of all, upon the Nature of the wonders; that <hi>it</hi> is at the End, and there is no more any <hi>Remedy</hi> for it; Even then cometh the <hi>Last</hi> Motion <note n="*" place="margin">Or, of.</note> with the <hi>Turba</hi> in the first Principle of the Eternall Nature, and swalloweth up the outward Nature in the <hi>fire</hi>: Even then the formed Word shall be <hi>wholly freed</hi> from vanity, and giveth <note n="*" place="margin">From, or out of.</note> by its <hi>last REPENTANCE the Holy Spirituall World.

                           <p n="1">1. GOd said to <hi>Noah, I will establish a Covenant with thee, and thou shalt go into the Ark with thy Sons,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Gen.</hi> VI.18.</note> 
                              <hi>and thy Sons wives with thee.</hi> A Great pregnant and remarkable <hi>Example</hi> we have here in <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: the Covenant was made with <hi>Noah</hi>; for his spirit was a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very or beaming forth of the formed word in him, in the Beginning and End of Time: and the beginning and End was the <hi>Eternall word,</hi> which had espoused it selfe in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in which Covenant the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> viz. the formed word of the Eternall Nature, found <hi>Grace,</hi> and obtained the Confirmation of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. As his <hi>Name</hi> doth properly and peculiarly signifie in the language of Nature, a Beholding of the Beginning and End. In this same Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and End, viz. in the Eternall <hi>Speaking</hi> Word of the Father, which would manifest and open it selfe again in the humane life, <hi>Grace</hi> was opened and presented to <hi>Noah,</hi> so that God did establish and Confirme the Covenant with him.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And here we have a very Excellent, and an Emphaticall example, which is exceedingly worth the mentioning, in the <hi>Three</hi> Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> which in their Properties were sprung forth from the Stock of <hi>Adam</hi> in a threefold <hi>Line</hi>; for we see that three Nations [Severall Sorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple] did arise from them, and that God did include them all <hi>Three</hi> with their <hi>wives</hi> in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and commanded them also to goe into the Ark, into the Second Monarchy, and did <hi>not</hi> exclude the flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ham.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. This is first highly to be considered, that a <hi>Gate</hi> of Grace standeth open to <hi>all</hi> men, and that God hath <hi>not</hi> Set any Election or Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in nature</hi>; but the Election or choyce doth arise out of the <hi>free-will,</hi> when it <hi>turneth</hi> it selfe from the Good into the Evill.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Secondly it is a <hi>Type</hi> of the Three Principles, viz. <hi>Sem</hi> is a type of the Spirituall light-world in the Covenant; and <hi>Japhet</hi> of the fire-world, which should be a Sojourner of the light-world, and a <hi>Mirror</hi> of the great Joy in the light-world; and <hi>Ham</hi> is a figure of the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth, to which the Curse and the Anger of God doth hang; all these Three, God took into the Covenant with <hi>Noah,</hi> and brought them into the <hi>Arke.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">6. For Every man hath these three worlds upon him, and <hi>in</hi> him; and the Covenant in the word was therefore given, that the <hi>whole</hi> man should be Redeemed.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. For <hi>Japhet</hi> Signifieth the fire-Soule; and <hi>Sem</hi> the Image of God out of the light-world, viz. the spirit out of the Holy word; and <hi>Ham</hi> betokeneth the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth with the outward Dominion or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Air, and of the magicall Etheriall Constellations, together with the Body, which shall be <hi>freed</hi> by the Covenant from the <hi>Curse,</hi> and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29914:101"/>
arise again out of the Earth. The three Brothers were a type of these three Principles.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Not that One did wholly arise out of <hi>one</hi> Principle alone; <hi>No! Sem</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> had likewise <hi>Hams</hi> property in them, as did plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it selfe afterwards in the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who became so wicked and vile a people: Onely we speak here of the Superiour Dominion or <hi>predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> property, of which Principle the Creature hath had in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life in its figure.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. <hi>Ham</hi> had the outward earthly Elementall Kingdome in the figure, which stood in the <hi>Curse</hi>; therefore his Image [or person] was also Cursed of his father, in the spirit; for the <hi>earthly</hi> Image <hi>shall not inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> but he also had a <hi>Soul</hi> from <hi>Adam,</hi> which stood in the <hi>Covenant</hi>; but the free-will doth very Seldome work any Good thing in <hi>such</hi> a Lodging, and very easily attains the <hi>Curse</hi> upon the soul, as we see that the Curse did afterwards come upon this <hi>Generation</hi>; that <hi>Israel</hi> must destroy them by their <hi>Entrance</hi> into the Land of Promise; albeit they did not wholly destroy them all, yet the <hi>Curse</hi> was come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. There is a very great Mystery in the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> which the Lord commanded him to build after that manner, and shewed him how High, How Long, and how Broad, it should be, and directed also that it should have <hi>Three</hi> Severall <hi>stories</hi>; also concerning the Creatures which he commanded him to bring thereinto; which is such a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the wicked malicious man is not worthy to know it: and we also shall not mention it in the ground [or depth of its meaning] for it hath its <hi>Time</hi> wherein it <hi>shall</hi> be opened, viz. in the <hi>Lilly-time,</hi> when <hi>Babel</hi> hath its <hi>End</hi>; but yet to set downe somewhat for a furtherance and direction to our fellow-Branches, to whom in its due time it shall break forth and grow out of Our <hi>Ens</hi> of this <hi>Lilly</hi> (which also shall be a <hi>Rose</hi> in the lilly-time) we will set it downe in an hidden Exposition.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. The Mystery of the holy <hi>Trinity</hi>; also the <hi>Three Principles:</hi> also the <hi>Three Sons</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> also the <hi>Three men</hi> that appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Plain of <hi>Mamre</hi>; also the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Great Temple</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>; and the <hi>whole Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> belongeth unto this figure; also the <hi>Temple of Jerusalem.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="12">12. Set before thee, the figure of the <hi>Arke</hi> with its <hi>Three Stories,</hi> with its height, length, and breadth, and place it in the <hi>Three Principles</hi>; and in the three Principles open the Mysteries of the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, Hierarchies.</note> Hierarchy of Christ in the <hi>Three distinctions</hi> of <hi>Heavens,</hi> which yet are onely <hi>One</hi>; but in three properties; as Fire, Light, and Air, are Three; and yet but One: Place in these distinctions [or Severall differences] the <hi>Three Sons</hi> of <hi>Noah</hi>; and go out of their properties into their <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the world, which continueth to the <hi>End of dayes:</hi> also set before thee the formed Word according to all the <hi>Three Principles</hi>; and so you will finde the Ground of all: especially Set before thee, <hi>Moses, Elias,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> in their appearance, and Transfiguration upon the Mount: the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noah</hi> is the first <hi>Type</hi> of all these figures; and the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of them <hi>at the End of dayes</hi>: enough to ours.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. <hi>And the Lord said, come thou and thy whole house into the Ark,</hi>

                              <hi>time:</hi> The Scripture saith else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:29914:102"/>
                              <hi>Before thee none living is righteous if thou wilt impute sin:</hi> but here God saith, <hi>I have Seen thee righteous before me at this time:</hi> the Creature was not the Righteous One, without Evill; but <hi>HE,</hi> who at this time did in <hi>Noah</hi> open and manifest himselfe out of the Covenant, who grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the evill of this time, and introduced his Sorrow into Gods <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and so brought the Righteousnesse of the mercy into the Sorrow, and manifested the Grieving mournfull Spirit in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> in the creature; thus <hi>Noah</hi> was righteous before God at this time, when the <hi>Covenant</hi> did <hi>move</hi> it selfe <hi>in</hi> him.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. This time is (or signifieth) the <hi>motion</hi> of the Covenant, which made <hi>Noah</hi> righteous, for this was the time. When <hi>Noah</hi> received Life in the womb, the spirit looked with his first glimps of life out of the Divine <hi>Ens</hi> of the formed word into the <hi>Beginning</hi> whence the life was come, and into the <hi>End</hi> which was the Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi>: in this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> [or Divine glimps] the life of <hi>Noah</hi> receives the Righteousnesse in the <hi>Mark</hi> of the Covenant at this time, for that was the time <hi>in</hi> him wherein he was found Righteous.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. God brought <hi>Eight</hi> persons into the <hi>Arke,</hi> and of the clean Beasts <note n="*" place="margin">Or, Seven paire.</note> 
                              <hi>Seven and Seven,</hi> the male and its female. The <hi>Seven</hi> persons point at the <hi>seven</hi> properties of the naturall life, that God will have children out of <hi>all</hi> the properties into his <hi>Eternall</hi> Ark; the <hi>Eighth</hi> person was <hi>Noah,</hi> and in <hi>Noah</hi> was the Righteous <hi>One,</hi> that was the Covenant, out of which the Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> should come, therein stood the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi>; but the Ark hath three Stories, which are the three Principles in <hi>one</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divine manifestation, for each property of the three hath its own peculiar Heaven and Certain Quite in it selfe.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. The <hi>Seven pair</hi> of <hi>clean Beasts,</hi> are Even the very same Mystery, for the Centre hath <hi>Seven</hi> properties, and yet they are but <hi>one</hi> in the Divine Power: but according to the Eternall nature there are <hi>Seven</hi> of them as to the Divine manifestation: which signifieth unto us, that the Creatures were brought forth into life out of this <hi>Seven-fold Ens,</hi> where each degree hath again <hi>Seven</hi> in it, to its manifestation, whence the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitnesse, viz. the form of Gods wisdome, doth appear, and shine forth, and that in the formed wisdome, whose Image and <hi>figure</hi> shall <hi>not</hi> vanish or perish, although their life, and the creature, which hath a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall begining, <hi>doth passe away,</hi> but the <note n="*" place="margin">The Forme shall remain in the Figure.</note> form shall remain in the Divine wisdome, viz. in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the formed Word in the <hi>Figure,</hi> to the <hi>Praise</hi> of Gods <hi>wondrous</hi> deeds; indeed <hi>not</hi> to a restauration of their <hi>Creature,</hi> but for a <hi>visible mirror</hi> or Looking-glasse in the formed wisedome of God.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. But of the <hi>unclean Beasts</hi> God commanded <hi>Noah</hi> to take onely <hi>one Pair</hi> of each kinde with him into the <hi>Ark:</hi> understand it thus, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Beasts have on one part, their Originall out of the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth according to the <hi>Grossnesse,</hi> viz. according to the dark worlds property; although their spirit taketh its rise out of Nature, yet we are to consider the difference in nature in respect of that which came forth, in the <hi>Verbum Fiat</hi> out of the Source of the dark worlds property, into a Compaction, whence such an <hi>Ens</hi> doth adhere unto many an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean creature,</hi> and it signifieth unto us in the Right Understanding, that the dark world, viz. the <hi>unclean world</hi> shall <hi>appear before</hi> the <hi>wisdome</hi> of

                           <p>ANd <hi>Moses</hi> saith: <hi>Then God spake with Noah,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Gen. VIII.16, &amp;c. to the end.</note> 
                              <hi>and commanded him to goe forth with Every living thing, Each with its Kinde: but Noah build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean Beast, ond of every clean Fowle, and offered burnt-Offrings upon the Altar, and the Lord Smelled a sweet Savour, and said in his heart, I will not henceforth curse the Earth any more for mans Sake; for the Imagination of mans heart is evill even from his youth, and I will not any more smite every living thing as I have done, while the earth remaineth, Seed-time, and Harvest, cold, and heat, Summer, and winter, Day and night shall not cease. Moses</hi> saith that God <hi>smelled</hi> a Sweet Savour, and Said <hi>in his Heart,</hi> he would not again curse the Earth, or smite every living creature any more, for mans sake. This is a figure or mysticall <hi>Type,</hi> as is before mentioned in the <hi>Offring</hi> of <hi>Abel.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. For his Heart is the word <hi>in</hi> the Covenant, which took the Prayer and will-spirit of <hi>Noah</hi> through the holy fire in the Offring, and brought it in the word to <hi>Substance</hi>; and withall <hi>smelled</hi> in the Divine Power, the humanity of Christ, who was to <hi>Resigne</hi> himselfe in the Covenant into the Word of Power; that is, it desired to have the humanity in his Power and vertue as a pleasant <hi>Savour</hi>; and from this Smell [or sweet savour of holy Rest in the Paradisicall property] the Spirit of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he would not again destroy Man and the Creatures any more; so long as the <hi>Earth</hi> should endure, these Creatures should also <hi>continue.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. For <hi>Noah</hi> offred all manner of clean beasts, and fowle; and the Spirit saith, that <hi>he Smelled herein a sweet savour of rest:</hi> now [he doth <hi>not</hi> mean] that he took pleasure in the Smell or Savour of the offring, for all Beasts are in his Power and are continually before him; but he spake it in reference to the <hi>hidden</hi> offring in the Covenant, which the <hi>inward world</hi> in the creatures <hi>did smell,</hi> which hereafter would <hi>deliver them</hi> by its own peculiar <note n="*" place="margin">That is, the inward cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall fire, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> shall purge the floor, and cristalize the Earth into transparent Gold.</note> Offring from the abomination of vanity, and set <hi>their figure</hi> into the holy wisdome, <hi>viz.</hi> into the spirituall world.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. When <hi>Noah</hi> offered, then the Lord (that is, God manifested in the Offring by the unmanifest holy <hi>Name JEHOVAH</hi> through <hi>JESVS</hi>) did Smell the holy <hi>disappeared</hi> humanity in <hi>Adam</hi>; that is, he did tast in the Lubet or good pleasure of his wisdome, how the same should be again manifest in the holy <hi>Name Jesus.</hi> And then he blessed <hi>Noah</hi> and his Children, and said, <hi>Be fruitfull, and multiply, and replenish the earth; and the fear and dread of you be upon every Beast of the Earth,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Gen. IX.1, 2, 3.</note> 
                              <hi>and upon every Fowle of the air; Even upon all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that creepeth upon the Earth; and upon all the Fishes of the Sea; into your hands they are all delivered; Every living thing shall be meat for you; Even as the green Hearb I have given you all things, but the flesh</hi>

the same; and at the hand of every man, will I require the life of man, being that he is his brother; and whosoever sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for God created man in his owne image: And you, be yee fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and multiply, and be industrious upon the earth, that you may increase abundantly.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. When God blessed <hi>Noah</hi> through the Offring proceeding from the Covenant, and bad them be fruitfull, he gave them <hi>againe</hi> the <hi>whole world,</hi> withall its Hosts in possession; <hi>all</hi> whatsoever liveth and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, should be Subservient to them, and be their owne; and he gave it them all in <hi>common,</hi> he made there no difference between <hi>Noah</hi> and his children, no <note n="*" place="margin">Master.</note> Lord nor servant, but he made them <hi>all alike,</hi> none noble or ignoble; but like as many branches and twiggs grow out of one Tree, and yet all together are but <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>Tree</hi>; so also he established the humane Tree upon the Earth, and gave them all beasts, fishes, and fowles in <hi>common,</hi> with no distinction, restriction, or prohibition, save onely <hi>that they should not eat their life in the blood,</hi> least they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come monstrous in their life <note n="*" place="margin">Or with the Eating the life of the B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="6">6. God Commanded them to <hi>rule over all the Beasts, and Creatures,</hi> but in this place he gave them no peculiar Domination, or ruling Power over one another: for all Domination, Lordly rule, and <hi>authority,</hi> whereby one man ruleth over another, doth arise out of <hi>Ararat,</hi> that is, from or through the Order of nature, according to its properties, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Constellations,</hi> and outward Dominion of the Princes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Constellations, or <hi>Astrum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. The true Image of God hath no other Dominion in its members, then the Body hath in <hi>its</hi> members, or the Tree in <hi>its</hi> branches, but the beastiall Image from the Stars, and four Elements, maketh it selfe a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government, according to <hi>its mother,</hi> whence it taketh its rise, and wherein it liveth.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Also <hi>all Lawes,</hi> and <hi>externall Ordinances</hi> which God hath appointed man, doe all belong unto the Order of nature, <hi>viz.</hi> unto the <hi>expressed</hi> formed Word, the same, God hath given man for a propriety, that he should rule therein with the inward spirituall man of <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> according to the wisedome of God, and make himselfe [Lawes and] Order according to the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>wisdome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="9">9. Over which Orders and Ordinances of men, which they make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselves, <hi>HE [viz.</hi> the Lord] hath set himselfe as <hi>Judge,</hi> and thereupon hath appointed the <hi>Last Judgement,</hi> to separate wrong from right, and whatsoever proceedeth not from Truth, Righteousnesse, and Love, and tendeth to the same, <hi>against</hi> that the judgement of God is set; for it is generated or hatched through the false spirits of darknesse <hi>in Turba Magna,</hi> and introduced into the humane property as a false Lust and <hi>Suttlety</hi>; and is a stranger or <hi>Bastard</hi> wisdome, which <hi>shall not inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="10">10. All Royall, and Princely Highnesse and Excellency, together with all Governments, and Dominions, doe arise from the <hi>Order</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the Image of God there is <hi>no compulsion</hi> [no force violence or oppression] but a meer free willing desirous Love-Service, as one member in the body, or as one branch of the Tree doth <hi>freely</hi> and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serve each other, and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in each other.</p>
                           <p n="11">
                              <pb n="205" facs="tcp:29914:106"/>11. But being that man hath introduced himselfe into the <hi>outward</hi> formed Word Evill and Good, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Kingdome of nature; the Kingdome of nature hath <hi>deprived him</hi> of the holy Dominion; and hath placed it selfe with its power over the humane property; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he will have the same againe, he must be <hi>borne anew</hi> of God, and then he may rule with the new regenerated life in the Spirit of God, <hi>over</hi> the Kingdome of nature.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Indeed there are <hi>Orders</hi> of Princely Angells or Hierarchies, in the <hi>Spirituall</hi> world; but all without compulsion in one Harmonious delightfull Love-Service and will; as one member in the body doth readily serve another.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. <hi>All</hi> whatsoever man in the Kingdome of nature doth draw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his power, and <hi>abuseth</hi> it to <hi>Superfluity,</hi> and excesse; and thereby withdravveth from his fellow-members, whereby they are <hi>put</hi> to want, poverty, and distresse, and their freely given, right, and due, is wholly <hi>withheld</hi> from them; the same is imprinted [or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended] <hi>in Turba magna,</hi> as an abomination of nature, and put into the <hi>judgement</hi> of God, to the day of Separation.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. Nature requireth onely Order, and giveth distinction of places and Offices; but the <hi>Turba</hi> bringeth its abomination from the darke worlds desire, <hi>thereinto; viz.</hi> Pride Covetousnesse Envy Anger and falsehood.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. These five vices or iniquities, are the Whores <hi>Bratts</hi> in the Kingdome of nature, and shall not inherit the Kingdome of God; God holdeth the Kingdome of nature, for <hi>his</hi> Order, and hath given the same into the power of man, that he [as Gods instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this vvorld] should sever the Evill from the Good, and <hi>chuse</hi> himselfe a Judge to passe righteous judgement upon the iniquity and malice of the false desire and <hi>lust</hi> [of man], for he saith; <hi>whosoever sheddeth mans bloud, by man shall his bloud be shed; viz.</hi> by the <hi>Order</hi> and institution of nature; not that any should revenge himselfe upon others by his own selfish power or force of <hi>Armes</hi>; but through the Order of nature, through <hi>Gods Law,</hi> and appointment; the same is the true Avengeresse; for God said, <hi>I will avenge your lifes bloud, and will avenge it upon every beast</hi>; here he meaneth, by the Order of his <hi>Law</hi> and its Officers who officiate in the right and due execution of the same.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. Not that a Prince or Lord hath Power to shed bloud <hi>without the Law of God</hi>; if he doth so; then the Law of God condemneth him also to Death. Here there is no peculiar Selfefull Power given, over mans bloud; let him be King or Prince; for they are onely <hi>Officers</hi> over the Order of the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> and they ought not to goe further then the Command of God gives <hi>leave</hi>: indeed they have the <hi>Law of nature</hi> committed to their <hi>charge</hi> as Servants of the same, but they must deal <hi>therein</hi> onely according to righteousnesse, and truth, and <hi>not</hi> doe <hi>any thing</hi> through Selvish [covetous proud and envious] desire, for God hath created man in his own Image; now the Kingdome of nature in its Offices hath no power over this <hi>divine Image</hi> to kill the same, but the office or Commission in <hi>Gods Order</hi> 
                              <note n="*" place="margin">Or hath power over.</note> passeth onely upon the <hi>outward</hi> Image of nature.</p>
                           <p n="17">
                              <pb n="206" facs="tcp:29914:107"/>17. Therefore if an Officer of nature [<hi>viz.</hi> any <hi>Magistrate</hi>] take away the life of a righteous man; him, <hi>nature</hi> appointeth unto the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God to the Day of Separation, wherein God will judge all the <hi>unrighteous Acts</hi> of man: what will then become of the Tyrants who turne the truth into Lies, and shamefully abuse, and condemne the Children of God for their <hi>divine knowledge</hi> and profession sake, and stirre up warre and Contention, to desolate and destroy country and people: all these belong unto <hi>Turba Magna</hi> to the judgement of God; for they manage the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Turba</hi> in selfefull Lust and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; <hi>unlesse</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God command them, and then must doe it for their <hi>Office</hi> and charge sake [and execute the just judgement of God upon those who have filled up the measure of their iniquity] as <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was commanded to doe among the <hi>Heathen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="18">18. Whosoever sheddeth bloud out of his <hi>own</hi> pleasure to advance his authority, without urgent absolute <hi>necessity or Gods command,</hi> he is moved, Acted, and driven, by the wrathfull fire of Gods Anger, and falleth at last to be a <hi>captive</hi> in the same Kingdome.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. Every warriour [or <hi>Souldier</hi>] is a <hi>Rodd</hi> of Gods Anger; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he doth through his wrath and Indignation, rebuke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure the iniquity and malice of man: and it doth not belong at all unto the <hi>Order</hi> [or ordinance] of nature, but unto the wrathfull desire, unto <hi>Turba Magna,</hi> unto the order of the eager fierce-devouring wrath, whereby Gods Anger doth overturne and lay waste Countries and Kingdomes.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. Understand, it is the Order of the <hi>darke worlds</hi> property, which by Gods permission advanceth its mighty force in the Time of mans wickednesse, and then it goes as the wrath will have it, untill the same be well <hi>satiated</hi> in the bloud of man.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. For this is even the <hi>Revenge</hi> of Gods Anger, of which he saith, <hi>that, he would take vengeance for</hi> [or require] <hi>the bloud of man</hi>; therefore he often taketh one man and by <hi>him</hi> in Anger slayeth another that hath <hi>deserved</hi> Death.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. When the Great and potent Rulers shed <hi>innocent</hi> bloud; then cometh the Anger of God with its Officers and sheddeth their peoples bloud, and bringeth the Sword of the <hi>Turba</hi> upon them, whence <hi>Warre</hi> ariseth; but this is <hi>not</hi> from the divine Order of the Good Nature in which God Governeth with his wisdome.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. The wisdome of God desireth <hi>no war,</hi> but the Anger of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the darke worlds nature, doth eagerly desire it, and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same in the vanity and iniquity of man.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. If we lived as the children of God one among another, we <hi>need</hi> not have any warring and fighting; but that we wage war, we doe thereby testifie, and declare, that we are onely <hi>children of this world</hi> and fight for a strange Inheritance, which yet we must <hi>forgoe,</hi> and thereby we serve the God of Anger as obedient Servants; for no warriour or <hi>Souldier</hi> shall inherit the Kingdome of God, <hi>while he is such a one</hi>; but [he that is] a child new-borne of the Spirit of God, which <hi>forsaketh</hi> this world.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. <hi>And God said further to Noah, and to his Sons with him: saying, Lo I,</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. By this figure the spirit of <hi>Noah</hi> prophecied or declared from the very Stock or root of the formed word of the humane property, what the <hi>Second</hi> Monarchy should be: <hi>Noah</hi> was drunke, and lay naked
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:29914:109"/>
with his shame, at which his Son <hi>Ham</hi> mocked and also declared it to his brethren, that they also should doe the like: here the Spirit intimateth and pointeth out, whence the <hi>Curse</hi> arose upon <hi>Ham, viz.</hi> from the <hi>shame</hi> of his father.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. For this was even the Abomination before Gods Holinesse; out of which root <hi>Ham</hi> and his generation <hi>viz.</hi> the man of <hi>vanity</hi> doth arise, for in the Image of God the shame is an abomination.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Therefore</hi> God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to be <hi>circumcised</hi> on this member, to shew that this member was <hi>not</hi> given to <hi>Adam</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that it should be againe cut off from the Image of God, and <hi>not inherit</hi> the Kingdome of God; upon which Cause and reason also, the Soules spirit is ashamed to <hi>uncover</hi> it.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. But being that <hi>Adam</hi> did not stand in the Image of God when his <hi>Eve</hi> was made out of him, it was hung upon him for to propagate in a beastiall nature and kinde; thereupon also this beastiall Tree <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>fleshly</hi> spirit of vanity, came to be propagated all along from this property, and adheres to man, the figure of this was <hi>Ham,</hi> and therefore he mocked his own property in his father.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The Spirit of this property mocked its <hi>Ens</hi> which it had from the Centre of nature: it beheld it selfe in his fathers <hi>shame</hi> from whence it had its rise, as in a looking-glasse of its selfehood: and thus this spirit [of fleshly <hi>Ham</hi>] forthwith brake forth as a <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>vanity</hi> and manifested what it selfe was; <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>scorne</hi> [disdain or mock-god] of heaven.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Which the Spirit of Gods Image in the formed word of the good <hi>Ens</hi> in <hi>Noah</hi> did well know, and did awaken in him the fire-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the Soule in the wrath, and cursed this <hi>spirit</hi> of vanity; that it should not <hi>co-inherit</hi> in the Kingdome of heaven: the <hi>Scoff-Spirit</hi> shall not possess the Kingdome of God, but be cut off from the Image of God, that is from the <hi>outward</hi> Image of the formed creature.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. For the same property from whence the shame ariseth, is Good in it selfe; but in <hi>Adams</hi> Imagination after the beastiall property it became Monstrous Beastiall and Strange in the Image of God; and therefore this <hi>strange</hi> forme and shape shall <hi>not remaine</hi> for ever.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. From this strange false <hi>shape</hi> the Scorner or Scoff-Spirit did arise; the Devill insinuated into the Figure of <hi>Hams</hi> strange spirit, and mocked at the Heavenly Generatresse, that it was now even become a <hi>Monster</hi> in the Image of God; and therefore the spirit of <hi>Noah</hi> cursed the false scoff-spirit [in <hi>Ham</hi> and all his generation.]</p>
                           <p n="10">10. <hi>Not</hi> that we are to understand that <hi>Ham</hi> was accursed in his Soul, and Soules-spirit, but according to the figure [He and all his were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed] in the property of the reviling mocking Spirit, which brake forth and manifested it selfe out of the monster; but He (that is the earthly Image of the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth) should be hidden with its own selfe-will in the Image of God and be only as a <hi>Servant,</hi> or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the divine Image proceeding from the holy <hi>Ens,</hi> the Earthly Spirit should <hi>not</hi> rule, but the heavenly, <hi>viz.</hi> the Soul with its spirit; the Monster, that is, this vile reviling spirit must not be manifest: but being the free-will did awaken and stir up the Monstrous spirit, which was onely a <hi>scorner</hi> of the Mystery and hiddennesse in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29914:109"/>
                              <hi>Noah</hi> cursed <note n="*" place="margin">Or it.</note> him, and said, <hi>he shauld be a Servant of his brethren.</hi>

                           <p n="11">11. For he said <hi>blessed be the God of Sem, and let Canaan be his Servant; God enlarge Japhet and let him dwell in the tents of Sem:</hi> The God of <hi>Sem</hi> was he who had espoused or incorporated himselfe with the Covenant in the <hi>Seed of the woman</hi>; the figure and type of this (in the Spirit) was <hi>Sem</hi>; and <hi>Japhet</hi> was the figure of the poore Soul captivated in the monster; God should let this Japheticall (or Soules) property, <hi>dwell in the tents of Sem</hi> and enlarge it in <hi>Sems</hi> figure.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. But <hi>Hams</hi> figure according to the monstrous spirit should not have any dominion or <hi>Reign</hi> in the life of the new-birth, but be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a servant or as an instrument without selfe-will or any peculiar life of Selfeness, must serve and administer to the use of the Spirituall Kingdome; in manner as the night is hidden in the day, and yet 'tis really there, and yet so as if it were not; and it is the <hi>Handmaid</hi> to the dayes operation and power.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. Thus in like manner the Spirit did expresse how the three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the humanity, <hi>viz.</hi> the womans Seed, and the creaturall Souls Seed, and the Earthly Seed in <hi>Hams</hi> figure, should stand in their place order and rule in the <hi>Regeneration</hi> in the Spirituall Kingdome; and thereby it did declare and point at the Kingdomes of the world, intimating that this same figure would all along put forth it selfe in the Kingdome and Dominion of the <note n="*" place="margin">Or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</note> humanity <hi>upon the Earth,</hi> and thus keep its <hi>figure externally</hi> so long as mankinde should live in the dominion of the four Elements; as it hath thus fallen out.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. For <hi>Sems</hi> figure passed in the Covenant upon <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> among whom the word of the Covenant was manifested and spoken forth; and <hi>Japhets</hi> figure went along in nature; <hi>viz.</hi> through the <hi>wisdome</hi> of nature in the Kingdome of nature; whence the <hi>Gentiles</hi> arose, who looked upon the light of nature and <hi>Sems</hi> linage looked upon the light in the Covenant; thus <hi>Japhet,</hi> that is the poor captive Soul which is of the Eternall nature <hi>dwelt in Sems tent, viz.</hi> under the Covenant: for the light of nature <hi>dwelleth</hi> in the light of Grace and is a tenant or inhabitant of the light of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> of Gods light, it is even as a forme or framed Substance of the unformed un-compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Light of God.</p>
                           <p n="15">15.

                           <p n="16">16.

                           <p n="17">17. For the <hi>Animal</hi> Soul shall not inherit the Kingdome of light;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:29914:110"/>
although it shall and will <hi>be</hi> therein; yet it hath no dominion or predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant vertue of its <hi>Selfenesse</hi>; as an Instrument is a dead sencelesse thing in reference to the master, and yet it is the masters <hi>Toole</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he maketh what he pleaseth; the same in like manner we are to understand concerning the Animal Soul in the <hi>Regeneration.</hi>

                           <p n="31">31. For <hi>Noah</hi> saith; <hi>blessed be the God of Sem and let Japhet dwell in Sems tents</hi>; by the God of <hi>Sem</hi> he meaneth the holy word in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, intimating how the same would manifest it selfe; and then the <hi>Japhites</hi> or Gentiles, which lived in the light of nature should come to the light of Grace manifested from the Generation of <hi>Sem</hi>; and enter into <hi>Sems</hi> Tents and dwell therein; this did point at the Gentiles who before knew onely of the Light of nature, but when the word did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it selfe in the Person of <hi>Christ</hi> with the gratious light of the <hi>Gospel; they</hi> came into the Light of grace.</p>
                           <p n="32">32.

                           <p n="33">33.

The other would look upon the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and would endeavour to fathome and search out the hidden light, by the strength of reason, and that they would therefore contend <hi>dispute</hi> wrangle and jangle, and bring forth many wonderfull strange monsters and Conceits out of the light of nature, and set them up for Gods or <hi>Gods light,</hi> as it hath so come to passe among the Christians and Gentiles.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. The Third Sort would be of <hi>Hams</hi> nature and Generation; and know <hi>neither</hi> the light of nature or grace; but walk as the Beast, and be onely Titular <hi>verball praters</hi> and litterall children, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over mockers scoffers, and fleering Apes, who would also be <hi>called</hi> the children of God; but their knowledge would be onely of the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> Stone-Church; a meere custome, and verball round of a <note n="*" place="margin">Or Divine Service as they call it,</note> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, where the mouth would use indeed the Name of God; but the heart would onely bring forth a beastiall spirit to earthly <hi>pride lust</hi> and <hi>pleasure.</hi>

                           <p n="36">36. Thus the spirit of <hi>Sem Ham and Japhet</hi> would dwell together in one Congregation: <hi>Sems</hi> generation in faith hidden among the

                              <hi>Japhites</hi> as a poor disesteemed contemned abject people; but the tribe of <hi>Japhet</hi> would set forth themselves with great plausible words, with great and huge ostentation of Gods Service; but yet it would be but as an <hi>hypocricy</hi> and seeming holinesse proceeding from the light of nature; but <hi>Hams</hi> linage would be full of <hi>gluttony</hi> and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennesse scoffing and <hi>reviling,</hi> and they would <hi>mock</hi> at both, <hi>viz.</hi> the children of the Caine-like seeming holinesse, and also at the children of the true light; and would live as the wilde brute beast; and yet in their Swinish life would be children of Grace by an <hi>outward appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation</hi> or Adoption.</p>
                           <p n="37">37.

Our Learned ones doe terme themselves Doctors, and Masters, and yet <hi>none of them</hi> understands his <hi>Mother Tongue</hi>; they understand no more of the <hi>Spririt,</hi> then the Country man doth of his <hi>Toole</hi> to the tillage of his ground; they use onely the <hi>bare</hi> contrived forme of the grosse compounded words, and understand not what the word is in its <hi>Sense</hi>; hence ariseth the contention and strife wherewith men contend and jangle about God and his will; men will teach what God is, and yet understand not the <hi>Least</hi> of God.</p>

This <hi>Towre,</hi> on which the <hi>Tongues</hi> were <hi>divided,</hi> and where the Great City Babel stood, is a <hi>figure</hi> of the fallen earthly man who is entered into Selfehood, and hath made the formed word of God <hi>in</hi> him, unto an <hi>Idoll</hi>; for the nature of the <hi>Towre</hi> was even this; <hi>viz.</hi> that it should there stand as a great <hi>wonder,</hi> which <hi>men</hi> had made in their own contriving Phancy, whereupon they would <hi>ascend up to God</hi>; and signifies, that man hath <hi>lost</hi> the right understanding of God and his habitation and essence.</p>
                              <p n="5">5.

The <hi>City Babel</hi> is the <hi>Ham</hi>-like man, who buildeth this City upon the earth; the <hi>Towre</hi> is his Self-chosen God, and <hi>Divine worship:</hi> all Reason-taught, from the school of this world, are the <hi>Master-builders</hi> of this Towre; all those who have <hi>set up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> to be Teachers, and are <hi>chosen thereunto by man without Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> they are the <hi>Master-worke-men</hi> at this Towre, and the <hi>Idoll</hi> of the <hi>world, None</hi> excepted; <hi>they</hi> carve and frame altogether onely <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>wood</hi> for this Towre.</p>
                              <p n="9">9. For the Name <hi>NIMROD</hi> sheweth us very clearly also in its owne sense of the formed word, that it is a self contrived formed amassed and compacted <hi>lust,</hi> which did advance it selfe on high as a selfly God; the Type whereof was the <hi>Towre</hi>; God suffered them in their confounded understanding to set forth the <hi>figure</hi> of their property, as a type what Man would be in the presence of God.</p>
                              <p n="10">10. Now saith Reason, wherefore did God <hi>suffer</hi> it to come to pass? Answer: Thus it must be; that the wonders of the wisdome in the unformed Word of the <hi>five</hi> vowells might introduce themselves through the formed word of the three Principles, into a form or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall contemplation, as a <hi>counter-plat-form,</hi> draught, pourtracture, or formation; for the dark world of Gods Anger, was become manifest in man, whence the grosse earthly property was generated, which also had wholly <hi>captivated</hi> man, and the same did <hi>here</hi> likewise represent its image as a selfly God.</p>
                              <p n="11">11. Now then, the <hi>Towre</hi> was a type of the darke world, where man would behold God in the darke selfehood; and denotes the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, who standeth in Gods sight as this Towre, and is an Image and resemblance of <note n="*" place="margin">Or Gods contempla-</note> divine Contemplation according to evill and good, as a <hi>Painted</hi> life; for the true humane life was the formed life; which became, in own desire to Selfehood, such an Image, before God, as this <hi>Towre.</hi>

And then, when people of other Countries have seen what that hath built, then they have contemned it, and said, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>their countries materiall</hi> hath been better for the erecting the Towre; and have begun to <hi>reject</hi> it, and to build the Towre for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and praised that also, which likewise hath again been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised of <hi>others,</hi> who have accounted <hi>their countries</hi> materiall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so long till they have <hi>fallen</hi> quite <hi>out,</hi> in Pride and Contention, and have <hi>left off</hi> from the Towre, and have fallen upon one another, and <hi>persecuted slaine and murdered</hi> one another about the Knowledge of the Towre of <hi>Babel,</hi> and that party which hath then got the <hi>victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that hath again built the Towre out of its <hi>own</hi> property, till <hi>other</hi> people have also risen up and accounted <hi>their</hi> own matter and <hi>stuffe</hi> for the Best.</p>
                              <p n="14">14. For the <hi>Speeches</hi> of the understanding were confounded and divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore the people neither <hi>knew</hi> nor understood one anothers property; and each <hi>people</hi> or Nation, hath supposed and looked upon the other, to be <hi>strange</hi> in the power of the understanding in the formed word; from whence the <hi>Contempt of Religion, viz.</hi> of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and confession of the word, hath arisen; for the Sensuall <hi>[in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible] tongue</hi> was compacted according to the <hi>multiplicity</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
                              <p n="15">15. And thus the wrath of the eternall nature (and also the <hi>Prince</hi> who dwells therein, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Devill</hi> in his Legions) doth satiate, and recreate it selfe in the strife and contention of man in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted word of the tongues; and thus the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> who is the <hi>Towre of Babel viz.</hi> the Selfe-will of the <hi>Ham</hi>-like man, domineereth <hi>in the Temple of God,</hi> and there hath <hi>set himselfe up</hi> in the place of the Holy spirit.</p>
                              <p n="16">16. For, <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> is the formed word of the humane Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and tongues in mans understanding; as it is written, <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <p n="17">17. In this formed word of divine understanding, the <hi>Antichrist,

viz.</hi> the will of Self out of the properties of nature, hath set up and established himselfe, and pranketh and set forth himselfe, with <hi>his property</hi> of nature, <hi>as if he were God,</hi> and yet he is the condemned <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed</hi> Son chosen to death, <hi>which cannot inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> for he was not made a creature out of <hi>Gods</hi> will, but out of the will of <hi>Selfe</hi>; as the Devill, who was an Angel, yet became a Devill, from the will of the <hi>dark world</hi> which advanced it self <hi>in</hi> him.</p>
                              <p n="18">18.

                              <p n="19">19.

                              <p n="20">20. Thus understand us now what the Antichrist or the babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Whore with the Dragon Beast is, as may be seen in the <hi>Revelation</hi>: Every man which is <hi>not</hi> born again of God, <hi>hath the marke of the Beast and the</hi> false <hi>whore in him.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="21">21. The <hi>Beast</hi> is the Animall [naturall] earthly <hi>Ham</hi>-like man, who is from the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth, according to the Earths grossenesse and malignant Malice, which ariseth out of the dark world, and standeth in the <hi>Curse</hi> of God. This beast did arise in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> when they did Imagine after evill and good; and came into its selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, away from the divine power and will; and is <hi>before</hi> God onely as a beast: This beast, the Devill hath <hi>infected,</hi> with his desire, and made it wholly monstrous, and insinuated his desire thereinto, so that it onely lusteth after <hi>vanity</hi> as a Cow doth after Grasse.</p>
                              <p n="22">22. But the <hi>whore</hi> of the Beast is the poor Soule captivated in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; which soule, had its rise in the formed word of the three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which was <hi>Gods Image,</hi> but now by the Lust of the beast, it hath begotten to it selfe, an own selfe-will, which is <hi>departed</hi> from God into selfehood, as a self-willed self-born creature; which doth what it pleaseth, and not what Gods Spirit willeth: this <hi>selfe-will</hi> revoult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and apostatized from God, is the <hi>whore</hi> of the beast, which whoreth with its self in the <hi>Pride</hi> of selfehood.</p>
                              <p n="23">23. But now the poore captive soule lyeth in this Grosse beast, and is captivated in its owne selfe-borne will, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>whore,</hi> and longeth after God, from whom it proceeded and was inspired into the created Image; and <hi>looketh about</hi> on all sides, where its true native Home of Rest should be, and it findeth that it is cloathed and covered with this whore; and then it bringeth its <hi>desire</hi> into this whores will: and seeketh the <hi>place</hi> of God for Rest, and then the whores will taketh the poore captivated soules desire into it selfe, and thereby doth exalt <hi>and set up</hi> it selfe; it perswades it selfe, that it, in the soules desire, is the fair <hi>child</hi> of God which shall possesse Heaven,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:29914:122"/>
and gives out, that it is holy, and sets forth it selfe, as a God, which men must honour and <hi>adore.</hi>

                              <p n="24">24. And being this Bastard, <hi>viz.</hi> the false will of selfehood, <hi>cannot see</hi> or behold the place of God, either what or where God is; then the false will goeth on in the <hi>way</hi> of its property, and betakes it selfe unto, and appropriates to it selfe, the manifested <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Letter, viz.</hi> the formed voice of Gods children, who spake from the <hi>Living word,</hi> and setteth its contrived forme of its owne conceived <hi>Ens</hi> into the <hi>Literall</hi> word, and cloathes it selfe externally with the literall word, standeth forth with boldnesse and selfe-achieved confidence, and saith, <hi>here is the place of God; here is heaven; here is God manifest</hi>; but it is onely a Bastard and is <hi>predestinated to Condemnation</hi>; for God hath not created it;<note place="margin">

                              <p n="26">26. This <hi>whore</hi> hath taken its power and <hi>understanding</hi> out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the Compaction of Evill and Good, that is, out of the dark and outward world, and hath swallowed up [or avalled] the pretious <hi>Image of God</hi> in it selfe, which after God, was created out of the heavenly <hi>Ens.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="27">27.

                              <p n="28">28. Thus we understand what the Antichristian babilonicall <hi>whore</hi> in man, is, which hath arisen out of the <hi>divided</hi> properties, <hi>viz.</hi> out of <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom the properties departed out of their mutuall and Equall Accord, each into its <hi>owne</hi> desire and lust to Selfenesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Adam</hi> became earthly and mortall; out of whom afterwards the Tree of the <hi>multiplicity</hi> of tongues and speeches did arise out of <hi>one</hi> onely tongue.</p>
                              <p n="29">29. Now know this; that the multitudes or variety of <hi>Faiths</hi> are generated out of the <hi>divided</hi> Tongues; so that almost every Nation hath brought it selfe into sundry severall and peculiar <hi>Opinions,</hi> of Gods being, and Essence, and therein consists the <hi>Confusion, viz. the Mystery of the great Babylon</hi>; concerning which the Spirit of God did prophecie and declare out of the propheticall root (both out of the <hi>Line</hi> of Christ, how Christ should come to <hi>restore</hi> and remedy the poore captive soule, and <hi>regenerate</hi> its right true life: and also out of the <hi>Turba magna</hi>) how this <hi>Beast</hi> together with the <hi>whore</hi> should be cast from the face of God <hi>into the fiery furnace.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="30">30. With this whore of Selfe, all the false <hi>Spirituall</hi>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29914:123"/>
of the mystery of Gods Kingdome, without Gods Spirit: they have <hi>externally</hi> covered themselves with the propheticall and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall <hi>word,</hi> and pleaded the Testimony of the <hi>Bible,</hi> but they have introduced <hi>their own sense</hi> out of the Whores <hi>Ens</hi> thereinto, and have hung, in their heart, to the babilonicall fleshly whore, and have <hi>not</hi> understood the Propheticall and Apostolicall Tongue in its <hi>Sence.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="31">31. They have spoken from the sence of their <hi>owne</hi> beastiall selfe-hood, through the propheticall, and Apostolicall word, and have brought and used <hi>Christs words</hi> to their <hi>own</hi> selvish babilonicall Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lottry, and committed whoredome; and likewise have Adorned and trimmed up their Bastard under Christs purpur-mantle with Silver, Gold, and pretious stones, and also with worldly <hi>dignities</hi> Honours favour and riches.</p>
                              <p n="32">32. After these, men have run, and have even adored and esteemed them as <hi>Gods,</hi> falling deeply in love with their Bastard; although their <hi>hearts</hi> have never agreed, or stood upon the onely true ground, but have been at <hi>variance</hi> with each other: and this is that of which the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh, saying, <note n="*" place="margin">
                                    <hi>Daniel</hi> 11.</note>

                                 <hi>Maozim</hi> they will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Land for inheritance; this whole chapter doth belong hereunto.</p>
                              <p n="33">33. Now, when we consider aright what this babilonicall <hi>Towre</hi> is at <hi>present</hi> in <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdome upon the Earth, and what it was under <hi>Moses,</hi> and among the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; then we finde very clearly, that among all Three it is of one property; and so also among the <hi>Turks</hi> and present <hi>Jewes</hi>; every Nation builds it, out of its own materialls for in the Right universall Sensuall tongue, (if it be manifest in one) we are altogether but <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>people</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> even from <hi>Adam.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="34">34. But the very cause that we are divided, and brought into <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> is, by reason of our <hi>Master-builders</hi> and founders <hi>viz.</hi> of the high schooles, <hi>Priests, Popes, Bishops, Doctors</hi>; also the <hi>Rabbies</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi> of all nations; who are set as work-men to the building of the Towre; all these have judged from their <hi>owne</hi> Language, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall understanding, <hi>viz.</hi> from their <hi>conceived</hi> and formed sensuall tongue, from the <hi>outward letter</hi>; and have indeed neither known God or the Light of nature; but have been blinde and dumb as to both; both the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and also the Selfe-made Teachers of the <hi>Christians.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="35">35. Whosoever have <hi>run,</hi> devoid of Gods spirit without divine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, either among <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Christians</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi>; they have built onely this Towre, in their own essence, and the same is even a <hi>Towre</hi> of the great wonders of God, of divine Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both according to light and darknesse, life and death, joy and sorrow.</p>
                              <p n="36">36. <hi>Not</hi> that we are to understand that this Towre is not at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable before God; it is even <hi>the great Mystery</hi> of Gods manifestation according to Love, and Anger; as God hath created out of the great mystery all manner, kindes, and sorts, of Beasts Birds Wormes Trees and Hearbs, evill and Good; and that all, to the manifestation of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:29914:123"/>
Great wonders; thus likewise the humane Tree hath brought forth <hi>such</hi> wonders out of its Sensuall tongue, out of the <hi>multiplicity</hi> of the properties, and introduced them into a <hi>Substance,</hi> for its Growth and glory, <hi>viz to the great Harvest of God</hi>; where each property of Love and Anger, Light and darknesse, shall reap in, its own fruit, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing shall possesse its heaven in it Selfe in its own formed and conceived <hi>Ens,</hi> out of the onely word of God which hath given forth it selfe to <hi>every</hi> life, (even unto every life and Being according to its own proper quality and vertue, according to, and out of, its Principle) as an <hi>universall</hi> word, to the glorious manifestation of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                              <p n="37">37. Now, when we further consider of this <hi>Beast,</hi> with the <hi>Whore</hi>; what it is in it selfe, within, and without, then we finde, that it is the formed compacted word of the spirits of the Letters; for men are <hi>all</hi> of <hi>one</hi> onely property as to their <hi>life</hi>; all are begotten out of one flesh and Soul; and have all but one onely kinde of life; as a Tree in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boughes and branches, where the boughes and twiggs doe not perfectly and wholly <hi>seeme</hi> alike, or the same, in forme, but all have <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>Sapp</hi> and <hi>vertue:</hi> so likewise the creature of mankinde, among Jewes, Christians, Turks, and Heathens.</p>
                              <p n="38">38. And the onely <hi>difference</hi> is this; the spirits of the Letters in the formed word, do <hi>sever</hi> us in the understanding; else we live all alike in the <hi>four Elements,</hi> and eat of the fruits of one Mother, and remaine in her, when we dye to this outward life.</p>
                              <p n="39">39. The compacted Sensuall tongue, which is divided in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Letters, doth <hi>confound</hi> us, and make us to erre; so that we doe <hi>suppose</hi> we are strange <hi>one</hi> to another, and yet we are all but one onely Tree; which the Devill hath <hi>poysoned</hi> with his desire in <hi>Adam,</hi> so that the equall Temperature or Accord was brought into distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and <hi>discord,</hi> whereupon the spirits of the Letters were [variously] made manifest, so that we speak from <hi>many</hi> speeches; that is; we have introduced the powerfull word of God into the multiplicity of the <hi>divided</hi> properties; and have made, in each tongues property, a Selfehood, or a Self-ish desire, to arrogation, self-apprehension and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
                              <p n="40">40. Hence arise the contrarieties, differences, and <note n="*" place="margin">
                                    <hi>Text</hi> Images.</note> 
                                 <hi>Opinions</hi>; in that we have introduced the unformed word into the forme of our owne selfe-made Image; now we contend and strive about these <hi>Images</hi> and conceits; and every one supposeth his <hi>own</hi> to be best; and when we bring all these Images and severall Semblances again into one Language and Speech, and <hi>mortifie them</hi>; then the Onely <hi>Quickning Word of God,</hi> which giveth power and life to all things, is again mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; and strife ceaseth, and <hi>God is all in all.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="41">41. Therefore we say as we have found it in the <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>One</hi>; that all mens Imaginations opinions and Knowings of God, his being, and will, <hi>without</hi> the divine light, [or <note n="*" place="margin">The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the holy Ghost</note> illumination of the Spirit] are this same whores <hi>Beast,</hi> which is flown forth and arisen from the compacted spirits of the Letters; whereby men contend about the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the Letters.</p>

Now there is no better way or remedy to bring us into <hi>union,</hi> that so we may become <hi>ONE</hi> again with one another; <hi>One</hi> people, <hi>One</hi> Tree, <hi>One</hi> man in Soul and body; then to destroy and kill all the Images or formes of the Letters <hi>in us</hi>; and suffer none of them at all to have its owne selfe-life: not <hi>desiring</hi> to know or will any more of God save onely and alone what <hi>God</hi> willeth to know in us and through us; and also that we doe immerse or resigne the Soules hunger and desire meerely onely and nakedly without any other knowing or willing, into the <hi>five vowells</hi>; and therein the great holy Name of <hi>JEOVA</hi> or <hi>JESVS (viz.</hi> the living word) is manifest, which giveth life unto all things, and not according to the property of <hi>nature,</hi> desire and will the different variety of many things, but give up our selves into the <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>Love-Sun,</hi> therein He is manifest.</p>
                              <p n="44">44. As the outward Sun giveth life and power to the whole world; so likewise this onely Name, in its Power, giveth life and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to <hi>all</hi> the Letters; and understand us aright what we meane by the <hi>whoredome</hi> of the Letter.</p>
                              <p n="45">45. The letters, <hi>viz.</hi> the properties of the Sensuall tongue, have introduced themselves into an <hi>externall</hi> forme, or selfe-full will and understanding, and brought themselves with the vowells into a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paction</hi> [selfe-comprehension or particular formation] and when this was done, then <hi>JESVS viz.</hi> the holy Name <hi>JEOVA,</hi> died [or disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared] in the Sensuall tongue in the <hi>Letters</hi> with the five vowells of the one onely holy mentall tongue; that is; the <hi>spirituall Man,</hi> which was resigned in [and to] God, dyed to the <hi>divine</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and will.</p>
                              <p n="46">46. Now there is a selfe-willed <hi>Beast</hi> of Selfishnesse and own-hood brought forth out of the spirit of the other letters, which doth onely kill,<note place="margin">Christ in <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</note> and bring forth dead fruit: for Christ saith; <hi>the letter killeth, but the spirit maketh alive</hi>; understand this thus.</p>
                              <p n="47">47. The divided Sensuall tongue <hi>killeth</hi> us, sets us at ods and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, leads us into <hi>Babel</hi>; but the spirit of the <hi>vowells; viz.</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Name</hi> of God, doth againe revive and <hi>quicken us</hi> in him; therefore the holy word of the <hi>five vowells</hi> did again (when as the spirits of the letters were divided and brought into the Selfehood of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God) espouse and incorporate it selfe <hi>forthwith</hi> in <hi>Paradise</hi> with the precious <hi>covenant,</hi> into the <hi>Letter viz.</hi> into the Naturall man; for to manifest it selfe again with a motion in the Compacted Tongue, and to introduce the <hi>holy Sence</hi> again into the Sensuall tongue.</p>
                              <p n="48">48. Thus understand us aright; the literall forme in the Sensuall tongue, is now the Evill Beast, which will domineere in its <hi>own power:</hi> now into this evill Beast the spirit of the five vowells <hi>viz.</hi> the Name <hi>JEHOVAH</hi> (which with the <hi>H,</hi> hath breathed the <hi>JESVS</hi> thereinto) hath given in it selfe, and <hi>killed</hi> the evill Beast <hi>viz.</hi> the Selfe-will, and hath againe Tinctured the spirits of the Letter, <hi>viz.</hi> the right natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, with the Tincture of the holy Name of the vowells or

                                 <hi>JEHSVS</hi>; and with the Love hath <hi>slaine the death</hi> or deaths in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and destroyed their Selfe-will; so that the spirits of the letters, cannot any more introduce themselves into a selfefull Compaction of the Sensuall tongue; for they are <hi>dead</hi> in their <hi>owne</hi> will; and the Spirit <hi>JEHOVAH</hi> in <hi>JESVS</hi> is become their life;<note place="margin">

                                 <hi>so that they live no longer to their Selfehood; viz.</hi> to the nature of the wrath, <hi>but in that they live, they live to God.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="49">49. Thus now the Beast of the whore is in us outwardly, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>mortall man</hi>; and inwardly is Christ in the <hi>immortall man, who is passed through the death</hi> of the letters and hath turned the death into life.<note place="margin">

                              <p n="50">50. Now it behooveth man, and his main happinesse depends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he also <hi>dye</hi> unto the Images of the letters in him; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime or depart from all <hi>Reasons</hi> schollarship, or knowledge of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all babylonicall Master-builders however they be called; and enter into the one onely <hi>life JEHSVS</hi>; and not at all dispute about the <hi>way,</hi> where it is; but onely <note n="d" place="margin">Or consider.</note> think that it is <hi>in him</hi>; that he must <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi> all, whatever he hath, either Art wit or skill &amp;c. and become <hi>one</hi> barely and nakedly in himselfe, bring himselfe into the <hi>ONE, viz.</hi> into Gods will, and be freely willing with whatsoever it will worke or doe with him: he must give up himselfe will-lesse; and leave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <hi>wholly</hi> in Gods <hi>Mercy</hi>; and bring all his learnings into this one onely <hi>Thing</hi>; that he in his teachings and learnings will not doe or speak any thing but what God willeth through him: and thus all Images [opinions and conceits] <hi>doe dye</hi> in him; and the Soules life falleth into the onely <hi>living word,</hi> which hath manifested it selfe again in the humanity.</p>
                              <p n="51">51. For this is the great <hi>Beast</hi> of the Babilonicall whore in us, that we bring our selves into the Images and <hi>formes</hi> of the Letters; and make <hi>Opinions</hi> to our selves: that <hi>Opinion,</hi> is a Beast.</p>
                              <p n="52">52. Also we must not desire to know and will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our selves; but dye continually with our own selfe-will; <hi>and in all things give God the honour</hi>; and give him againe that which he giveth us; <hi>viz.</hi> whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver understanding wisdome and skill we have; and acknowledge that it is <hi>not</hi> our owne, but that the divine Sun shineth out of, and through, us, and worketh in us as it pleaseth.</p>
                              <p n="53">53. Thus likewise we must diffuse and give out againe our power and vertue, which the divine Sun worketh in us, universally to <hi>all,</hi> without any gaine, advantage, or <hi>hire,</hi> from any; whosoever shall help to maintaine and nourish our life, unto him we must be <hi>thankfull,</hi> and not <hi>flatter</hi> any for his authority's sake; or receive his false glance shew or lustre, into this <hi>Sun-light</hi>; but <hi>all must be in</hi> Generall or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> as the Sun-shine doth give it selfe universally, and gives no strong Great or Potent thing, any more but its purity and brightnesse, it Tinctureth the Earth and its children with <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>power</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> and giveth life, and strength to all things.</p>
                              <p n="54">54. Herein now we shall <hi>know,</hi> whether one be <hi>a Teacher sent of God</hi>; or whether he hath his rise and originall onely out of the spirit of the <hi>Letter</hi>; if he be born <hi>universally</hi> out of the Love, then he hath the light of <hi>divine</hi> knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sensuall divine understanding, a Tongue,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:29914:125"/>
Tinctured from the divine <hi>Ens</hi> of the <hi>five vowells,</hi> and speaketh from the <hi>Spirit of God</hi>; rebuketh and teacheth powerfully without <hi>respect</hi> of any mans person; and hath no Image [or mentall <hi>Idoll</hi>] in him; for he teacheth from the Spirit of God, even <hi>what</hi> the same [spirit] teacheth in him.</p>
                              <p n="55">55. But if he be a <hi>Master-builder</hi> of the Towre of Babel, born of the spirit of the letters, <hi>viz.</hi> of the disharmony [or <hi>diversities</hi>] then he is a hypocrite, and flatterer, a glozing fawner, that will say <hi>any thing</hi> to please those that are gainfull and advantagious to him; a soother of those that doe help to honour his <hi>Maozim,</hi> and adorne his <hi>Letter-God</hi> in the divided tongues; a scorner, evill speaker, and <hi>bold censurer</hi> of those that doe not honour him in his forme, and <hi>Sect</hi> of religion; a selfe-applauder, ambitious, proud, and under a glistering <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and seeming holinesse, a covetous, malicious envious one; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth himselfe with ostentation; that so he may be <hi>knowne</hi> and honoured; he will be applauded and set by, of man; attributes to himselfe understanding and wisdome; and boasteth of wisdome and a <hi>rectified</hi> judgement and understanding, and yet hath <hi>none</hi> of them; but he is onely a builder on the Tower of Babel; <hi>viz.</hi> of an <hi>externall</hi> figure and forme; a <hi>painted</hi> Christian; he will <hi>undertake</hi> to teach others, and yet he himselfe was <hi>never</hi> taught of God; he teacheth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the forme of the compacted spirits of the letter, which have compacted themselves in evill and good, he taketh these into his <hi>owne power</hi> and ability; and compacts, and sets the words together into an <hi>Opinion.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="56">56. And that opinion, is the Towre of Babel, and they which run after him, and associate gather and binde themselves with him in the opinion, are the <hi>City Babel, viz.</hi> the <hi>children of Nimrod; who will climbe, and ascend up to heaven</hi> upon this Towre, and are continually a climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, their whole life, yet come <hi>not</hi> to heaven in the opinion, but when the time of the outward <hi>literall constellation</hi> is out, then this built Towre <hi>falleth</hi> down; <hi>viz.</hi> the outward man, together with his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all shatters and breaks to pieces, even to the <hi>onely</hi> soul, which then standeth naked and bare before God.</p>
                              <p n="57">57. Here is now <hi>no remedy,</hi> unlesse that it hath the one onely spirit of the Sounding Letter, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>enformed word of God in it,</hi> so that it is able in its desire to attract and draw the same to it selfe, and cloath it selfe therewith, that the same doth cleave and break in pieces all the formed contrived compacted tongues and <hi>Images</hi> of the letters, and introduce them into <hi>one</hi> onely tongue and will, which is <hi>God all in all</hi>; all things must enter againe into the <hi>ONE, viz.</hi> into the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall; in the multiplicity there is nothing but <hi>strife,</hi> and disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but in the Onenesse there is an eternall <hi>Rest,</hi> and no enmity or contrary will.</p>
                              <p n="58">58. Now when we doe truly consider <hi>againe</hi> what the Towre and the <hi>City Babel</hi> is in its formed Image upon the Earth, and what and where it is, then we find it clearly pourtrayed before our eyes, that it is the great <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>the Churches, Cloysters, Fortresses,</hi> and also <hi>the strong walls,</hi> and <hi>Towres of</hi> the <hi>Citties</hi> upon the earth, wherein men <hi>hide</hi> themselves from force and power, and in the Opinions play the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> before
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:29914:125"/>
God in the Churches Cloysters, and strong holds; and cry unto him that he should receive and accept of them in their contrived framed, and received <hi>opinion</hi> of the letter.</p>
                              <p n="59">59. What is all this? an <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>hypocricy</hi>; An <hi>Antichrist</hi> with shew and glistering glory; what doe men bring into this glozing hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall Babilon; nothing but <hi>Images</hi> mentall Idolls and selfe-contrived opinions forged out of the forme of the letter; what doe men carry home with them from this hypocriticall <hi>specious house?</hi> onely the Images of the letters; into these Images, and conceits the poore captive soule doth wrap it selfe, which notwithstanding is <hi>full of fear doubting and trembling,</hi> by reason of the conceived, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Image or opinion; and is continually in feare least another people might break in upon its received framed Images and destroy and <hi>overthrow</hi> these its received Images, and therefore men have made <hi>Fortresses Bulwarks</hi> and <hi>Towres and strong walls</hi> about their <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi>; that so they might defend themselves least the <hi>Towre</hi> upon which they would ascend up into heaven should be destroyed.</p>
                              <p n="60">60. Now saith reason; these are indeed <hi>houses</hi> of <hi>meeting,</hi> where men doe teach and <hi>instruct</hi> the simple and ignorant, where men <hi>sing</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> &amp;c. lo! <hi>externally,</hi> in, and among, the literall men, they are onely the Towre and City <hi>Babel</hi>; but <hi>internally</hi> among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, <hi>in</hi> whom the <hi>Temple of God</hi> is, where the Images and mentall Idolls are destroyed, <hi>there is Christ:</hi> that is, in those who have pulled down and broken all Images, and <hi>opinions</hi> in them, and are entred through the conversion from Images and conceits onely and alone into the onely meere naked <hi>Grace Mercy</hi> and <hi>Free</hi> compassion of God, and esteeme themselves as wholly <hi>unworthy</hi> empty Nothings, and become as 'twere dead in themselves, willing, or desiring nothing else save onely the meere <hi>purity</hi> of God in his Love-will, and account themselves too unworthy of attributing or taking any thing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and freely fall in deepest <hi>humilty</hi> into Gods tender mercy, as if they were <hi>not:</hi> and wholly cast their desires and wills into Gods compassion; so that, what he wills and doth in them, that they also will, and <hi>nothing else; in these</hi> I say it is a house of teaching and an house of hearing, a Temple of God; where the Spirit of God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth heareth, singeth and prayseth <hi>in the Soule</hi>; for they are dead to all selfehood, and selvish willing and weening, and doe melodize with unity and onenesse of Spirit in the praise of God, in the knowledge of the holy Ghost; <hi>these are the Church of Christ.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="61">61. But the rest have onely the Towre at <hi>Babel</hi> in the opinion, in their conceits and Images; these <hi>Idolls</hi> they carry with them into the Houses of stone, and glory in them, <hi>worship them,</hi> and carry them again home with them; and <hi>fight for them,</hi> as if they had the living God in them; and <hi>wage</hi> great <hi>warres for these</hi> Images; laying Countrey and people waste and desolate; and yet they are more foolish then the Birds in the air, which doe all praise and honour God in <hi>one</hi> tongue, and understanding; for they are all <hi>without any</hi> Images; whatsoever the great God doth with them therewith they are content.</p>
                              <p n="62">62. The humane Tree is onely <hi>one Tree</hi>; if they continued in the one onely God who hath created them; and did not make unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:29914:126"/>
Images, <hi>who</hi> would set them at odds and variance about God? they indeed <note n="*" place="margin">
                                    <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28.</note> are and live in the one onely God, and <hi>yet</hi> they <hi>contend</hi> and jangle about God.</p>
                              <p n="63">63. Wherefore doe they contend? for the <hi>Idolls</hi> of their heart, for the Stone-houses of the <hi>Churches</hi> and for the pride of the Images, [and forged <hi>opinions</hi>] every one will honour his Image, and set it up aloft as an high Towre; that so he might have great <hi>respect</hi> in the City Babel; and therefore they build themselves strong holds, and make great <hi>bulwarks,</hi> and walls to defend and keep the Image, and flatter themselves in hypocricy, and understand and meane by the contrived and painted Image, the God <hi>Maozim, viz.</hi> the <hi>fat-belly God,</hi> and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the beast, <hi>viz.</hi> of this <hi>whores</hi> Image; they set the Image upon the Towre for the shew of their holinesse, and therewith they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>devout</hi> in glistering appearances before God; as with a peculiar Selfe-born God; but they immure the Beast within their Stone-houses that it may be secure, and there fat it selfe.</p>
                              <p n="64">64. What is now this beast with the whore; it is halfe-devill, which hath its Kingdome upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> and it is half beast, this evill Beast hath devoured man, <hi>viz. the Image of God.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="65">65. And for <hi>this</hi> cause God became man, that he might destroy, slay, and nullifie <hi>the works</hi> of the Devill; and we must put on this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine humanity, and destroy the Devills Kingdome <hi>in</hi> us, and <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> all Images, otherwise we cannot see God; the living word must mortifie the literall Image.</p>
                              <p n="66">66. The living word is therefore <hi>become man,</hi> that the literall Image might <hi>dye,</hi> and the first man, which was formed out of the living word, in Gods Image, might be <hi>regenerated</hi> anew in Christs Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> in the living word; and if now he be borne, then <hi>all</hi> the Image-teachers are more <hi>prejudicall</hi> then beneficiall to him; for they intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>their Images</hi> onely into the Temple of Christ, and <hi>destroy</hi> the Image of God.</p>
                              <p n="67">67. And let this here be declared concerning the children of <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> and the <hi>Towre of Babel</hi>; as the Spirit hath so given us to know; and we doe admonish the Reader, in Love, to prove and examine himselfe; he shall finde <hi>where</hi> he is: this is <hi>not</hi> written to reproach any; but thus the Spirit speaketh with open mouth, and sheweth, what all things <hi>are,</hi> from whence they <hi>come,</hi> and into what <hi>End</hi> they shall <hi>goe.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="68">68. But the reason why so much is written of the Beast and the Whore of Babel, is, because it is at its <hi>End,</hi> and shall <hi>soone</hi> be broken in pieces; therefore it must be revealed, that men may see and know it; for <hi>Babel falleth not</hi> unlesse that all whatsoever hath made the Images doth likewise fall: all Images [<hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>] toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>whore</hi> must fall; else there is no Cure, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                              <p n="69">69. Men have for a long time been a <hi>patching</hi> and pieceing of it; and have verily thought, to have made a <hi>virgin</hi> of the <hi>whore,</hi> but her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath thereby been onely adorned, trimmed up, and made the <hi>greater</hi>: if this whore shall fall; then all <hi>Sects,</hi> which are onely the Images of the whore, must fall down and come to naught, together with

                                 <hi>Beast</hi> upon whom she rideth: every man must break down and destroy the Images and Idols <hi>in himselfe,</hi> and where they will not doe it, there <hi>the zeale of the Lord doth it.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="70">70. How very finely doth the <hi>whore</hi> at present <hi>perck</hi> up its head, and being it heareth that the spirit doth intimate [great and glorious things] of <hi>Zion, viz.</hi> of the Adorned holy <hi>bride</hi> of Christ; then it thinks that <hi>it</hi> is the faire childe, which God will bring into <hi>a golden Temple,</hi> wherein there shall be a brave <hi>Golden Time,</hi> and meere joy pleasure and delight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it looketh about, to see from whence this faire Temple of God should come, into which it should enter, and <hi>become</hi> a virgin; it hearkneth continually from whence <hi>these holy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should come,</hi> who as it supposeth should make a <hi>Golden</hi> world.</p>

                           <p n="7">7.

For the possibility and Ability to the divine manifestation, did not stand in mans <hi>Ens</hi> but in Gods; but mans <hi>Ens</hi> must come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; that so <hi>Adams</hi> heavenly disappeared <hi>Ens,</hi> might be quickned in Christs living <hi>Ens,</hi> and in Christ, arise from death, therefore God said to <hi>Abraham; get thee into a Land, that I will shew thee</hi>; here the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit signifieth; that he should not see God in his fathers Countrey; that is in the earthly man, but in the Land which the Lord would shew him, in his Seed, which was another Seed out of the divine <hi>Ens,</hi> in this strange Seed he would <hi>blesse</hi> his own seed, that is, tincture it with the divine tincture of the <hi>ninth</hi> number in the Sacred Ternary, even with the Tincture of the holy spirituall world.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. For thus said the Lord to <hi>Abraham:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Gen.</hi> XII.1, 2.</note> 
                              <hi>Get thee out of thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and from thy Kindred, and from thy fathers house, into a Land that I will shew thee, and I will make of thee a great Nation, and I will blesse thee; and make thy Name great, Thou shalt be a blessing. I will blesse them that blesse thee and curse them that curse thee.</hi> The <hi>Great Name</hi> which he would make him in his seed, that was not to be understood onely as to the Kingdome of this world, for <hi>Abraham</hi> was onely a stranger upon the Earth, and must wander up and downe from one place to another, and possessed <hi>no</hi> Princedome or Kingdome, as the great Names of the Gentiles out of the Sensuall compacted tongues; for he was to be a stranger and <hi>Pilgrim</hi> upon the Earth in the <hi>promised Seed, and blessing,</hi> for Christ said also, <hi>his Kingdome was not of this world.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="24">24. But the great Name which should be a blessing, wherein God would blesse all Nations, was the <hi>hierarchy of Christ,</hi> in the Covenant, which would open it self in <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed: This was an Eternall great Name of a <hi>Royall</hi> Hierarchy of an <hi>Enthroned</hi> Prince in divine Power and Omnipotence, which should rule over the Curse; for God said, <hi>he would curse them that cursed him, viz.</hi> the apostate revolted Devills, and all wicked men, who would curse this holy Seed and blessing, upon <hi>their Head</hi> this Seed should tread.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. And here, under <hi>Abrahams</hi> great Name and blessing, the person of Christ is <hi>wholly</hi> to be understood; for he said, <hi>in thee all Nations shall be blessed, and thou shalt be a Blessing.</hi> Now all the families of the Earth could not be blessed in the <hi>outward</hi> mortall man of <hi>Abraham</hi>; for <hi>Abraham dyed</hi> and his children and grand-children were a long time strangers, Servants, and bond-men in strange Countries; as in <hi>Egypt for three hundred years and upwards,</hi> and had no Scepter till under <hi>Moses</hi>; who also was no King, but a Prince of God [which Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome] continued unto <hi>King Saul</hi>; where they would indeed have a King against Gods command and will; whom notwithstanding God did afterward reject, and set up <hi>David</hi> to be King (out of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall spirit in the compacted Mentall Tongue) under Christs person, who should bring forth and manifest the geat Name, and Eternall Blessing.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. But here now we are rightly to understand what the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ should be under this Name and Blessing; not wholly a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger [or another person] which should not be out of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and <hi>Adams</hi> Seed; as some doe erre concerning it, and install or set Christ
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:29914:130"/>
onely in the <hi>promised Seed viz.</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> promised Seed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the poore captive Soul would be little benefited; also hereby the <note n="*" place="margin">The Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Earthly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> 
                              <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the dead out of these our <hi>present</hi> bodies would be wholly nullifyed.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. For if Christ were wholy another, then also another [or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a strange person] must be borne in us out of Christs seed and flesh, which would not be I or my selfe, but wholly another man, as some doe <hi>Erre</hi>; that we are so borne of Christ, <hi>as the dew is out of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which indeed is true, but my I-hood [or personality] which was created in <hi>Adam</hi> out of the <hi>divine Ens, (viz.</hi> out of the good part of the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Earth, which came forth also out of the heavenly worlds being, as to the good <hi>Ens</hi> into a Coagulation) must also be therewith <hi>joyned,</hi> as the like is also to be understood in <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="28">28. For God said, <hi>in thee all Nations shall be blessed</hi>; he said not, alone in me, but he said, I will blesse <hi>thee</hi> and make of <hi>thee</hi> a great Nation, and make <hi>thy</hi> Name Great; and <hi>thou</hi> shalt be a blessing, thou thy Self shalt be it, that is, <hi>Christ</hi> should become <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham Christ.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="29">29. For the Seed which disappeared in <hi>Adam</hi> and dyed to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, into which God engrafted or incorporated the <hi>Limit</hi> or <hi>Aym</hi> of his Covenant, with the quickning Word; the same is that, into which God would introduce his <hi>Blessing, viz.</hi> the living divine hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Ens,</hi> and would blesse <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> and their children in this re-quickned <hi>Ens</hi> or disappeared Seed, and make them truely alive; the <hi>living Ens</hi> of the word in the Covenant and the Adamicall disappeared <hi>Ens</hi> in <hi>Abraham,</hi> should become one person and body; for the same are one <hi>kinde</hi> of <hi>Ens.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="30">30. But the <hi>poysonfull</hi> malignant <hi>Sensuall</hi> desire which the Devill had made monstrous, had shut up this holy <hi>Ens</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> in death, and covered it with the grosse earthly property; like unto a fair piece of <hi>Gold</hi> which were changed into <hi>Lead,</hi> so that one would say, the Gold is dead and gone, and t'were truely so indeed, if the <hi>Artist</hi> did not again redeeme it.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. Thus likewise the heavenly Artist would not <hi>reject Adams</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared Gold, and make, clean another new thing, but he tooke his own <hi>Tincture</hi> and of his own Gold, out of which he had made <hi>Adams</hi> Gold, and tinctured <hi>Adams</hi> Gold with his <hi>own</hi> Gold; even with his Tincture, that is, with the <hi>word (viz.</hi> with the power) of <hi>God,</hi> and with the Essence of the word, <hi>viz.</hi> with the heavenly corporallity.</p>
                           <p n="32">32. So that <hi>Christ</hi> became a God-man, and <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham in</hi> Christ a man-God; God and man <hi>One</hi> person undivided, according to, and out of, all the three Principles of Eternity and Time, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and out of, <hi>Body and Soule</hi>; with every property of man, and every divine property: <hi>Except</hi> the Serpents property which <hi>Adam</hi> lusted after, took in, and imprinted on himselfe; the same he did <hi>not</hi> assume; but the <hi>Ens,</hi> understand the <hi>humane Ens,</hi> whereinto the <hi>Devill</hi> had sown his seed, that he must assume, and therein <hi>bruise the head of the</hi> Devill, and of the insown <hi>Serpents Ens, and destroy</hi> the prison of <hi>death,</hi> which held the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> shut up; and spring forth afresh, <hi>as the dry Rod of Aaron which budded and bare green Almonds</hi> was a lively

                           <p n="33">33. <hi>Abraham</hi> in the spirit of Christ should be a blessing; for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams Ens,</hi> and Christs <hi>Ens</hi> hath blessed all Nations; understand the <hi>line</hi> of the Covenant, in which the <hi>promised word</hi> stood in the Aym or limit of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the five vowells, the Great Name <hi>JEOVA,</hi> which God, by the motion of the Covenant in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, made to [be] <hi>JEHOVA,</hi> or <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> as an <hi>inspired</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathed God, who should blesse the whole Alphabet of the <note n="*" place="margin">Or Tongue that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the sence of all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in One.</note> Sence-all Tongue, understand, the formed compacted word, <hi>viz.</hi> all Nations, Tongues, and speeches: a blessing of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

                           <p n="34">34. For he said, all Nations shall be blessed in thee, no nation or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple excepted, but <hi>all,</hi> even <hi>All,</hi> not onely the line of the Covenant, but <hi>Adam</hi> in his children; the line of the Covenant should blesse the line of <hi>Japhet</hi> and <hi>Ham</hi>; for <hi>Japhet should dwell in Sems Tent,</hi> that is, in Christ, <hi>viz. Japhet</hi> should be received into <hi>Sems</hi> line.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. But the grosse earthly <hi>Ham</hi> (understand the <hi>grosse</hi> flesh) is <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed</hi> in <hi>Ham</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> and shall not inherit Gods Kingdome, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. not <hi>Ham</hi> in Soul and body is cursed, but the <hi>Serpents man,</hi> whose figure according to the <hi>outward, Cain</hi> and <hi>Ham</hi> must represent, so that all properties might be manifest in an <hi>externall</hi> figure.</p>
                           <p n="36">36. Therefore we admonish the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that they learn to know their <hi>Messiah,</hi> for the time of their visitation is at hand, wherein they shall be redeemed from the Captivity of their misery, and be made <hi>free</hi> againe.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. Also we admonish those that are <hi>ours,</hi> that they grant <hi>Mary</hi> to be the daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Christs</hi> mother as to the Soul and <hi>Adams</hi> created Image, and <hi>not</hi> according to the deity, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Ens</hi> in the word of life which came from heaven, for that was <hi>not her</hi> propriety, indeed it stood <hi>in her,</hi> but [it was] in the word of the promise in the Eye-mark of the Covenant, (which was accomplished or) at the limit, [<hi>in her.</hi>]</p>
                           <p n="38">38. But she is <hi>not</hi> the mother, which hath brought forth, or born, God, as the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> doe say that we so teach; but <hi>God</hi> hath brought forth and blessed the same <hi>in her Seed</hi>; she in her Seed receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>power</hi> of the holy Ghost in the word, and brought forth the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> which was God and man.</p>
                           <p n="39">39. And <hi>not</hi> the property of the deity, which hath neither begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor End, also doth not possesse either time or place, but is through all, and in all from Eternity to Eternity, and hath onely <hi>manifested</hi> it selfe in the humanity, as the fire doth through-heat an Iron, and changeth it wholly into fire; and yet the Iron remaineth Iron still; so also the man or the <hi>humanity</hi> which <hi>Mary</hi> brought forth out of her Essence and out of Gods Essence in one onely Essence, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
                           <p n="40">40. <hi>She</hi> brought forth the humanity, and <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> hath from Eternity brought forth the word which did <hi>manifest</hi> it self in the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and filled the humanity, as the fire doth through-heat an Iron, and the Sun illustrate or through-shine the Water or Glasse.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. She indeed hath brought forth the <hi>heavenly</hi> body, but not from
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:29914:131"/>
the power of her <hi>Ens</hi> or seed, but from the power and ability of that <hi>Ens</hi> which did manifest it selfe <hi>in her seed</hi>; as the Essence or being of Eternity manifested it selfe through time, and yet the time was not able or capable to receive the Essence of Eternity into its own might; but the Essence of Eternity <hi>assumed</hi> or tooke on it the Essence of time; as the inward heaven and world, hath brought forth and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the outward heaven and world: so likewise the Eternity as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the Essence, that <hi>it breathed into Adam,</hi> which dyed or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, in the Seed of <hi>Mary,</hi> understand in her owne humane Seed.</p>
                           <p n="42">42. And this is the great Name of <hi>Abraham</hi> in Christ, and the <hi>Blessing</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherewith God blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not a strange person, as some erroneously conceive, who understand <hi>not</hi> the Three Principles.</p>
                           <p n="43">43. The <hi>Person</hi> was strange but it is become an indweller in us; the heaven tooke on it the world, and made the world in it to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet <hi>each</hi> remained dwelling in it selfe; <hi>viz.</hi> the formed word of the body, a <hi>creature,</hi> in it selfe; and the unformed word in it selfe, <hi>God over all, and in all, and through all</hi>; thus also we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand and consider of the heavenly living Essence, which gave it selfe into <hi>Adams,</hi> and <hi>Abrahams Ens,</hi> as filling All in the person for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively, and without the person at once through all, and with the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> as an habitation or mansion of the power also through all or every where, but not to be comprehended of any thing; as the Suns Power and influence, and the Air, doe penetrate through all things, and give life to every being; the like is here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
                           <p n="44">44. We must by no meanes abolish the <hi>Creature</hi> in Christs person, for that which he assumed both from the Soul and body of man, the same, is creature; but that which he introduced out of the <hi>deity</hi> into the humanity, that is, neither nature, nor creature, yet in our huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity formatively, but immense, uncircumscribed, not particular; like as the air, and Sun-shine is whole or <hi>entire,</hi> so likewise it is here; and we are in like manner to understand it, as if the Sun-shine did introduce it selfe in Something, into a forme, and yet were wholly <hi>One</hi> thing with the shine or light without the forme: thus likewise <hi>Christs</hi> heavenly divine <hi>Ens</hi> which he introduced into our humanity, is to be understood.</p>
                           <p n="45">45. <hi>God</hi> did often <hi>appear</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>spake</hi> with him as one man speaks with another; therefore reason saith; how was it done? did God assume the <hi>form</hi> of a body? God appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the <hi>Ens</hi> and Essence, wherewith, he would manifest himselfe, in his seed <hi>viz.</hi> in Christs person, and spake from the word of the Covenant in the Limit, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, even unto the <hi>Mentall Tongue of Abraham,</hi> which moved it selfe in the Covenant, and this the <hi>Sensall Spirit</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi> did understand.</p>
                           <p n="46">46. For <hi>otherwise Abraham</hi> was <hi>not able</hi> to see God; but in the formed <hi>Ens</hi> of the heavenly Essence, <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>able</hi> to see in the spirit of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>same Spirit,</hi> which would manifest the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented type, and Essence, in the humane Essence.</p>
                           <p n="47">
                              <pb n="255" facs="tcp:29914:131"/>47. For it is written in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. that <hi>God appeared to Abraham</hi> in the forme of <hi>Three men, and told him of a Son which should proceed forth out of his Loines, whom Sarah should bear unto him,</hi> upon whom the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant passed; now what did the Appearance of these <hi>Three</hi> men typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie? nothing else but the <hi>Trinity</hi> of the deity, and the manifestation of the divine formed word through the <hi>Three Principles:</hi> therefore the divine Image was represented in <hi>Three men</hi>; for it is a <hi>Threefold Ens,</hi> but <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>Essence; viz. Three</hi> worlds, and yet in one another as <hi>one,</hi> but differenced in <hi>three</hi> Principles; <hi>viz.</hi> with the dark wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>fire</hi>-world, and with the holy <hi>light</hi>-and-Love-fire-world, and with the outward <hi>visible</hi> world.</p>
                           <p n="48">48. Out of these three worlds man was created, even into an Image of the divine manifestation; therefore God shewed himselfe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the same <hi>Ens</hi> and Essence, as in the <hi>forme</hi> of the Angelicall <hi>Message,</hi> and yet spake of himselfe.</p>
                           <p n="49">49. For the <hi>represented Ens</hi> through which God spake, was Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and humane, it would become humane, for Christ as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the creature should be a Prince or an Angelicall <hi>Hierarchy</hi>; so likewise God appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> in this <hi>Entall Essence</hi> and property with his own in dwelling voice.</p>
                           <p n="50">50. Very exceeding wonderfull is the hystory concerning <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> for the Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> is therein wholly represented, not onely the Kingdome upon the Earth in the time of the <hi>foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which also is pourtrayed and set forth under it, but yet onely as a <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> which should not be the right Kingdome, for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> must continually wander up and down, and also his posterity, and yet God promised him the <hi>Countrey</hi> wherein he was a Pilgrim for his propriety, that he and his children should <hi>eternally</hi> possesse the same.</p>
                           <p n="51">51. For so God said to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Gen</hi> XIII. <hi>Verse</hi> 14.</note> 
                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. <hi>Lift up thine eyes and looke from the place where thou art, Northward, Southward, Eastward, and West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for all the Land which thou feest, to thee will I give it, and to thy Seed for ever:</hi> but now they obtained possession of this Land a long time <hi>after</hi>; and were first brought in by <hi>Joshua</hi>; and <hi>Abraham</hi> and his grand-children lived <hi>not</hi> to obtaine it, and they were very often dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out from thence; and yet God said he would give it <hi>Abraham</hi> and his children for an <hi>eternall</hi> possession.</p>
                           <p n="52">52. But we see at present that they have it not in possession; for the <hi>Turks</hi> have now possession of it; and <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi> have at present neither Land nor Princedome, but are almost in all places onely as captives, but now the purpose of God must stand, his word must be <hi>true: Abraham</hi> in his seed shall <hi>eternally</hi> possesse it, for Eternall is not Temporall only.</p>
                           <p n="53">53. Therefore also God spake of the <hi>Place,</hi> and sheweth the same to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might see it with his eyes: and even here lyeth the Great Mystery; for Paradise was in the world, and <hi>Adam</hi> lost Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; but in <hi>Abrahams seed viz.</hi> in Christ, Paradise was again restored, <hi>not</hi> according to the mortall man, but according to the <hi>heavenly.</hi>

                           <p n="54">54. Now we see at present that <hi>Christendome</hi> hath not these Lands or Countries in Possession; and so likewise the <hi>Jewes</hi> have them not:
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:29914:132"/>
and now being that <hi>Abraham</hi> shall eternally possesse them in his seed, <hi>viz.</hi> in the holy Seed; thereupon we are to consider of the place of the <hi>holy Paradise</hi> aright; as the Propheticall Spirit in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and others of them doe signifie and declare; but especially <hi>Saint John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>

                           <p n="56">56.

                           <p n="57">57. Paradise is in the world, yet not in the third Principle, but in the Second: the one doth not confound the other: when <hi>Abrahams children</hi> in Christ doe part from the earthly Body, then they take <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi> of this promised Land according to the spirituall man, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the same <hi>Eternally.</hi>

                           <p n="58">58. And this is that which <hi>God</hi> so often said to <hi>Abraham, That he would give him the Land to an Eternall possession,</hi> for when he promised it him, then he commanded him to goe away from <hi>that place,</hi> to signifie, that he did not meane the Externall Kingdome, but the <hi>Eternall</hi>; and set him forth a figure in the <hi>Stars of heaven,</hi> saying, that even <hi>so his Seed should be multiplyed and encreased</hi>; and as the Stars have a pure cleare body in comparison to the earthly bodies, so likewise the seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> should be an heavenly Eternall One.</p>

                                 <hi>Gen.</hi> XIV.</note> what the Imaginations purposes intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and undertakings of men have been, even from their youth upward; how they have brought themselves <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>Image of God</hi> into halfe beastiall and halfe devillish properties, <hi>viz.</hi> into Pride Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and selfefull domination, in like manner as the <hi>Devill</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the same, and <hi>therefore was cast out</hi> from his Kingdome.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. For here the Gentiles, and the children of <hi>Ham</hi> at <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> and in the whole Region thereabouts, did now begin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise their domineering Power, among whom <hi>Abraham</hi> was onely a stranger, and dwelt in the Plaine of <hi>Mamre</hi> as in a wildernesse, where he kept Cattle, but the Gentiles did tear and rend for the Kingdome of this world, and for the <hi>externall</hi> might and power, striving how one people might <hi>rule</hi> over another, whose will and Dominion hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued even to <hi>this</hi> day, and hath received its beginning from the <hi>heathens,</hi> and the children of <hi>Ham; viz.</hi> from <hi>Babel,</hi> from the divided tongues.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. When the Powers of the formed word, <hi>viz.</hi> the properties of Nature did divide themselves, and each introduced it selfe into a Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishnesse, then <hi>Strife,</hi> and enmity did arise among them for the Centre of the nature of the darke world, hath obtained his Dominion in the <hi>fallen</hi> property of man; for men were as dead, to the Kingdome of God, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Love and humility, and lived at present to the <hi>outward Stars</hi> and the <hi>four Elements.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. Also the Devill had built his strong hold in the <hi>Serpents Ens</hi> in man; therefore they sought onely after that which made them <hi>Great and Potent</hi> in the world, and yet we may see, how the Devill did onely foole and Ape them in the wrath of God, so that they <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ew</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and esteemed <hi>Temporall pleasure</hi> higher then their life, which is the greatest folly under the Sun, that man should bring his life into deaths danger, for a poor silly pride sake, whereas yet he knowes <hi>not</hi> whether he shall hold and possesse that, for which he murthereth killeth, and slayes.</p>
                           <p n="5">
                              <pb n="258" facs="tcp:29914:133"/>5. And we see how <hi>soone</hi> the Devill in his envy and pride ruled in them; for though they had the whole Earth before them to possesse, and many Countries, and Islands were un-inhabited, yet they <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take warre,</hi> that so they might but domineere over one another, and <hi>rob,</hi> and <hi>plunder</hi> one another; thus the Devill as mans Enemy, brought them into his pride that they might serve him.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Tis not in vaine that Christ calls him a <hi>Prince of this world,</hi> he is a Prince according to the property of the wrath of the darke world; in and according to the same property he ruleth <hi>man</hi> in body and Soul, in will, and minde.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. For all <hi>war</hi> and contention doth arise out of the nature, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the dark world; <hi>viz.</hi> from the four Elements of the Anger of God, which produceth in the creatue, Pride, Coveteousnesse Envy, and Anger, <hi>these</hi> are the four Elements of the darke world, wherein the Devills, and all evill creatures live: and from <hi>these four Elements</hi> ariseth warre.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. For although <hi>God</hi> bad the people of Israel drive out the heathen, and wage <hi>warre,</hi> yet the Command was wholly from the <hi>Angry</hi> zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, <hi>viz.</hi> from the fires property; for the heathen had stirred up the wrath and indignation which would devoure them; but God, so far as he is called God, desireth <hi>no warre,</hi> yea he cannot desire any thing that is evill or destructive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he is according to the Second Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple onely <hi>Good,</hi> and giving, and giveth himselfe to all things.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. But according to the darke worlds nature he is <hi>an Angry zealous God, and a consuming fire,</hi> if his wrath be awakened; according to this property he desireth to consume all that moveth and enkindleth it selfe therein; and from <hi>this</hi> property, God bad Israel fight, and Smite the heathen; for his Anger was set on fire in them; and they were as wood cast into the fire, which the fire desireth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. <hi>Therefore</hi> the wrath of God bad one Nation slay another, that it might even out of his wrath be taken away; otherwise the fire of <hi>his Anger</hi> would have Enkindled it selfe, as hapned to the <hi>five</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi>; thus the wrath of God did satiate it selfe in the life of the wicked, which it devoured into it selfe, in that they slew one another.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. As it yet now adayes so comes to passe, that oftentimes men cry unto God, for to give them <hi>Successe,</hi> and <hi>Victory,</hi> against their Enemies, that they might murther them, but God giveth them <hi>not</hi> victory therein, but the Sword of his Anger, which they awaken with their prayers fierce desires and will: were they <hi>true</hi> men, and children of God, they would <hi>need</hi> no war, for the holy Spirit doth not wage war, but he onely loveth and giveth, but according to the property of the Anger he consumeth all un-godlinesse and wicked doings, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more blown and stirred up in indignation.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. For the <hi>more</hi> a man addeth wood to the fire, and stirs it, the more it doth elevate and enflame it selfe untill it devoureth whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it can reach; the like also is to be understood concerning the <hi>zeale</hi> of God: this Enkindled Anger-zeale of God was set on <hi>fire</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>; and it did devoure his Image of the holy world, and passed <hi>from Adam upon all men.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="13">
                              <pb n="259" facs="tcp:29914:133"/>13. For they which were in the line of the Covenant had the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled zeale,</hi> according to the first Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the Soul and body, also in them; the one not better then the other; the <hi>Serpents Ens</hi> lay as well in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his children according to the Enkindled Soule; and according to the grosse beastiall property of the mortall, as in the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; except the <hi>Line</hi> of Christ in them, which was not the Sinfull mans Selfehood, but it stood in <hi>Gods</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as the heaven standeth in the world, and yet the one is not the other; and as the <hi>heaven stands in hell,</hi> and hell in heaven, and yet the one doth neither confound or comprehend the other; or as the <hi>night is in the day</hi> and the day in the night; or as the light of nature dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and shineth in the darkness.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. Thus we are to understand, how the children of the Saints have waged war against the crew of wicked men, and drove them out; <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Angers</hi> property, which managed its Sword by them, to destroy the heathen and the Generation of <hi>Ham</hi>;<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Gen</hi> XIIII. <hi>Verse</hi> 14.</note> for <hi>Abraham went out with his whole house and people, against the Heathen who had carried away Lot his brothers Son captive, and he smote the heathen, and delivered his brother.</hi> This was done in the zeale of God; which thus delivered his children through the might of his Anger; for what conduceth to the wicked for <hi>destruction</hi> the same conduceth to the holy men for life and <hi>deliverance.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="15">15. But that those who will be called Christians (who ought in and with Christ to be dead to the Anger and wrath of God in Christs death) doe <hi>wage war</hi>; they doe it <hi>not</hi> as <hi>Christians,</hi> but as <hi>heathens</hi>; No Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian warreth; for if he be a Christian then he is <hi>dead</hi> in and with Christs death to the foure Elements of Gods Anger in Selfe; and born a new man in Christs spirit of Love; who liveth in Righteousnesse, in Love, and patience, and liveth not to himselfe, but to God in Christ.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. For a true Christian <hi>leadeth his conversation</hi> and will <hi>in heaven,</hi> in the life and Spirit of Christ; as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                              <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>our conversation is in heaven</hi>; but when the Christians doe wage war they doe it from the <hi>heathenish</hi> property, and not from Christs property; for a Christian is not of this world; his Kingdome is in heaven; and he is dead in Christ to the world, according to the new spirituall man in him: the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then-man, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>halfe-devillish</hi> man (who hath his Kingdome in this world, who never hath roome enough upon the Earth, but liveth in the foure Elements of Gods Anger, <hi>viz.</hi> in Pride Coveteousnesse Envy and Wrath) the same desireth in the Christians, to <hi>warre</hi> fight and slay.</p>

                              <pb n="260" facs="tcp:29914:134"/>18. When <hi>Abraham</hi> had smote the heathen; <hi>he desired nothing of the goods which he tooke, but restored to the King of Sodom what the Heathen had taken from him,</hi> and was onely zealous in the <hi>Lord</hi>; he did not fight for Countrey, and Kingdome; but to <hi>deliver</hi> his brother <hi>Loth</hi>; this was a true zeale, which the Lord drove in him; he did not stand up, and fight for Countrey, or City, and albeit he obtained it, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it not, but went again unto his own place.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. And here the Spirit in <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh very wonderfully and saith, that <hi>when Abraham returned from the Slaughter, that the King of Sodome met him; and Melchisedech King of Salem brought forth bread, and wine; who was a Priest of the most High God, possessour of Heaven and of Earth, and blessed Abraham, and Abraham gave him Tithes:</hi> And though we finde almost nothing elsewhere in the holy Scripture of <hi>this Priesthood,</hi> yet the same was really in the figure of Christ; for the Spirit saith in another place, of Christ; that <hi>he was an High Priest in the order of Melchisedech.</hi>

                           <p n="20">20.

                           <p n="21">21. For <hi>Abraham</hi> had managed the <hi>Sword</hi> of Gods <hi>Anger</hi> against the Heathen, now came <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> and blessed <hi>Abraham</hi> againe, least the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Turba</hi> should lay hold on him; and he gave him forth bread and wine, that is, the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi>; which he would introduce into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, and change it into flesh and bloud; and here he <hi>appeased</hi> the Fathers Anger in the Covenant as in the Type.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. For this Priest with <hi>Abraham</hi> is really to be understood in a <hi>spirituall</hi> manner; for although <hi>Abraham</hi> might have externally a Priest after the same manner with him, under the figure of Christ; yet <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>he was a Priest of God; and said to Abraham: blessed art thou Abraham unto the most High, who possesseth heaven and earth</hi>; who hath shut up thine Enemies into thy hands; here is none other to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood but <hi>Christ,</hi> who very often appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the figure, and blessed him alwayes; for the Spirit in <hi>Moses</hi> calleth him also a <hi>King of Salem</hi>; which is nothing else, but a King of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. <hi>And Abraham gave him Tithes:</hi> indeed he might have such a Priestly Order with him, to whom he gave Tithes: but this King and Priest was he of whom he preached; to whom <hi>Abraham</hi> gave tithes; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Tenth Property</hi> of the humane properties of the fiery tongue of the Soule, and the Priest gave his <hi>bread and wine,</hi> and his <hi>blessing</hi> thereinto; <hi>viz.</hi> the Love-fire, the Tincture of the light, together with the heavenly <hi>Substantiality</hi>; that so <hi>Abraham</hi> might receive the lights Tincture into the Soules fiery Tincture and become again a compleat <hi>Image</hi> of God; which was separated in <hi>Adam</hi> with the woman: therefore Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>womans</hi> Tincture, gave him againe the lights

                           <p>MOses saith, <hi>After these things it came</hi> to passe, that <hi>the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision; and said,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Gen. XV. Vers. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> 
                              <hi>feare not Abram I am thy Shield, and exceeding great reward; but Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me seeing I goe childlesse; and the steward of my house hath a Son; this Eliezer of Damascus; and Abraham said further: To me thou hast given no Seed; and lo! this son of my servant will be mine heir; and behold the Lord said unto him he shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowells shall be thine heir; and he commanded him to goe forth and said, looke towards the Heaven, and number the Stars, canst thou number them? and he said unto him even so shall thy Seed be; Abraham beleeved God, and that was counted to him for Righteousnesse.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. In this portion of Scripture lieth the Root of the Christian <hi>Faith,</hi> for God said to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he was his Shield and <hi>Reward,</hi> that he would give him the seed <hi>out of his loins:</hi> God would be <hi>Abrahams</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and give him a Son of his own, whose Seed should be as the Stars in heaven, which are innumerable; and his Stewards son should <hi>not</hi> be <hi>heir; viz.</hi> the Animall humane Seed full of the <hi>Serpents Ens</hi> shall not inherit: but Gods <hi>Reward,</hi> Gods <hi>Ens:</hi> He would give in his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:29914:135"/>
Reward into his Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Power</hi> of his loines, which should be a Seed like unto the <hi>Stars</hi> of Heaven; he looked upon the Seed in the <hi>Covenant, viz.</hi> upon the Eternall Kingdome, which should be as the <hi>Stars</hi> in Heaven, so pure, bright, clear, and innumerable; and this <hi>Abraham beleeved</hi> and it <hi>was imputed to him for Righteousnesse.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Beleeving</hi> here is this much; <hi>viz.</hi> he received and laid hold of the word; he tooke it into his <hi>desire viz.</hi> into the humane <hi>Ens</hi>; the Aym in the Covenant in the <hi>formed</hi> Compounded word, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> nature and property, Received the <hi>Speaking</hi> word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Promise</hi>; and both these were formed into <hi>One,</hi> and in this <hi>One Abrahams</hi> faith was <hi>Right</hi>; for God counted the word, which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> received into his faiths desire, unto him for <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> for propriety and for <hi>Justification.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. For thus received or in-taken word, justified the creaturall word, <hi>viz.</hi> the expressed, created word, understand, that word which had formed it selfe in the <hi>humane</hi> property, and brought it selfe into a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and put it selfe forth out of the Three Principles into an <hi>Image</hi>; in which Image the Selfe-will had, through desire, and lust, <hi>elevated</hi> it selfe with the darke worlds property <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>fire</hi> of Gods Anger, and introduced it selfe into an Earthly <hi>grossenesse</hi>; into which Grosse Image the Devill also had introduced, by the Serpent, his <hi>Ens,</hi> will and desire.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Now the living Eternall-Speaking holy word, came forth out of the Light's and divine Love's property, to <hi>help</hi> this <hi>Ens,</hi> this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted Word, and created Image; and became its <hi>Reward</hi>; this same, <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall word, and power, received into it selfe; and this same Word of God, intaken, and fixed in the desire, <hi>justified Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams Corrupted</hi> word; it was his <hi>Righteousnesse</hi>; the same destroyed the Anger, and ruinated the Devills desire and will; understand <hi>in</hi> mans <hi>Ens, viz.</hi> in the formed word, this was effected.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. For there is no <hi>Faith</hi> without Gods word and power; therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> did now take Gods power, and promise, into his <hi>Ens in him,</hi> and formed or conceived the same into a <hi>Substance</hi> of his Spirit; this was the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Justification</hi>; that Gods word and the humane will and desire came into <hi>one</hi> spirituall <hi>Substance:</hi> Thus God <hi>accounted</hi> the Received or in-spoken Apprehended Word, unto <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteousnesse; <hi>viz.</hi> for propriety; and this is the ground and root of faith; that he tooke in or imprinted Gods promise into his desire, as his very <hi>own</hi>; and let not the same passe from him in Doubt; as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> did, who tooke the word of promise into him, and said; <hi>I will not let thee goe untill thou dost blesse me, and wrestled the whole night</hi> with the word of Power, <hi>untill he obtained victory</hi>; so that the promised word gave in it selfe to him, for propriety; <hi>viz.</hi> to a <hi>blessing,</hi> or a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as here in <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. Thus understand us very accurately; the Incorporated word of the Covenant in Paradise, which God promised to <hi>Adam</hi> concerning the bruiser of the Serpents head, did here at present <hi>wrestle</hi> through <hi>Jacobs</hi> formed word of the humane property, with the new promised word, <hi>viz.</hi> with the living word (which did at present move it selfe in him) and would, that the corrupt humane <hi>Ens</hi> might be blessed
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:29914:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with Gods Love, that the wound might be <hi>healed</hi>; and it did long and pant after the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the Covenant; that God would be pleased forthwith to introduce the holy <hi>Ens</hi> of his heavenly essentiality into mans Essence, that Christ might be born out of Gods and mans Essence; therefore Let Christendome know, that <hi>Faith</hi> is not onely an hystory or knowledge [but a reall <hi>Substance.</hi>]</p>
                           <p n="8">8. <hi>Faith</hi> is nothing else, but the uniting of ones will to God, and the receiving of Gods word and power into the will, that so both these, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods will and mans will become both one Substance and Essence; that the humane will be even Gods will; and even then <hi>Christ in his Suffering, death and Resurrection</hi> is accounted unto his own humanity for Righteousnesse; so that man becomes <note n="e" place="margin">

                              <hi>Christus,</hi> or the Anointed; understand according to the <hi>spirituall</hi> man: and thus we <hi>put on Christ</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and are twiggs, shoots, and branches in his vine, <hi>and the Temple of God</hi>; he that teacheth and beleeveth otherwise, is yet in the compacted un-contrite or un-cloven Tongue of <hi>unbeleefe,</hi> in the whoredome of <hi>Babylon.</hi>

                           <p n="9">9. This is the true reall ground of our Christian faith; that as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> put on Christ in the faith, so <hi>we</hi> also at <hi>present</hi> doe receive, and in our heavenly part of the humanity put on Christ in his humanity, according to the heavenly worlds Essence, in the same flesh and bloud which <hi>Melchisedech</hi> represented and brought to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bread, and wine, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Type thereof, yea wholly receive it into our <hi>Ens</hi> of the heavenly worlds Essence, which dyed in <hi>Adam,</hi> and become alive therein and <hi>arise</hi> from death in Christ, and dwell very essentially with our spirituall man, in him; and even <hi>then he is our own Righteousnesse, we in him, and he in us,</hi> Onely <hi>One Christ, One God, One Faith, One Tree</hi> in the Paradise of God, in the Stem which is God, and in the Power and vertue thereof which is Christ, and in the branches of the tree which are we Christians, <hi>wholly One Tree,</hi> not two; we understand <hi>not</hi> herein the grosse beastiall man full of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <hi>Ens which shall not inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> John 6. but the true man, which God created in his Image.</p>

                           <p n="14">14. God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> the Signe how it should goe with his Seed; in that <hi>Abraham</hi> said, Lord God! <hi>whereby shall I know that I shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the same?</hi> then God set the <hi>figure</hi> of the Seed, before him (for he had comprehended it in his Faith, which was made his righteousnesse) and shewed it him in a figure: for the <hi>Offring,</hi> signifies the Offring of Christ; the three sorts of Beasts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Heifer, Shee-Goat,</hi> and <hi>Ram</hi> each three yeares old, betoken the part of the outward humanity of the time, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth.</p>

                           <p n="17">17.

                           <p n="22">22. This holy <hi>Ens</hi> in the word of faith must enter into the great <hi>horrour</hi> of Gods Anger; for the Soule stood therein essentially in its property; it is out of the fathers fire-property, (out of his Strength and <hi>omnipotence) viz.</hi> out of the first Principle; and here the Second Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Love-fire came to <hi>help</hi> it; therefore it must enter againe into its owne <hi>Root</hi> from whence it came to be a creature; and be Tinctured in the power of the Love-fire, in the divine light, and be changed into an excellent pure <hi>divine Gold</hi>; of which this Offring was a <hi>Type.</hi>

                           <p n="24">24. The Offring of Christ, (<hi>viz.</hi> the humanity of Christ) did indeed give it selfe wholly as an offering or <hi>Sacrifice</hi> into the Fathers Anger, into his fires Essence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Love-Spirit of God <hi>hindred</hi> the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Essence of the fire, so that the fire <hi>could not</hi> devoure the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Christ; it took onely the Selfe-will of the humanity, and brought it againe into the first <hi>universall</hi> Entire will; out of which mans will

It is far otherwise, God looketh not upon one Sort or Generation of mankinde; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Stem</hi> or <hi>Root</hi> of the Tree.</p>
                           <p n="2">2.

Nature; as first there must be a <hi>fire,</hi> ere there be a <hi>light</hi>; the fire beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the light; and the light maketh the fire manifest in it selfe; it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the nature into it selfe, and dwelleth in the fire.</p>
                           <p n="4">4.

                           <p n="5">5. But being mans will had subjected it selfe to the Kingdome of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the kingdome of nature did now also <hi>represent</hi> its property in mans Image, to the Highest God, especially in this wonderfull Man <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whom the Spirit and Word of God moved it selfe; now the <hi>figures</hi> of the Eternall Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> of both wills were represented out of one man to the word of God, which had brought forth and formed all es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences: <hi>viz.</hi> the revolted disobedient (will) in <hi>Ismael,</hi> and the holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which sprung forth from the Power of the received <hi>word of faith,</hi> in <hi>Isaack.</hi>

                           <p n="6">6. Two types were here set forth; <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Ismael</hi> the poor sick distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered evill corrupted <hi>Adam,</hi> fallen from the will of God; and in <hi>Isaac</hi> the Image of Christ was represented, which was come <hi>to help</hi> the poor corrupt <hi>Adam,</hi> and to introduce his Apostate will into death and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and purifie the same again in the fire of God; and regenerate it anew in the Love-fire, and in the first Onely eternall will of God, where the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> are one onely will and essence, in the wrathfull Anger-fire, and in the Love-light-fire.</p>

                           <p n="8">8. For if there were but one onely will, then all essences would do but one thing, but in the <hi>Counter-will</hi> each exalteth it selfe in it selfe to its victory and exaltation; and all life and vegetation stands in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and thereby the divine <hi>wisdome</hi> is made manifest, and comes into form to Contemplation, and to the kingdom of joy; for in the <hi>Conquest</hi> is joy; but one onely will is not manifest to it selfe; for there is neither evill nor good in it, neither joy nor sorrow; and if there were, yet the <hi>One,</hi> viz. the onely will must first in it selfe bring it selfe into a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it <hi>might</hi> manifest it selfe.</p>
                           <p n="9">9.

                           <p n="10">10.

                           <p n="13">13. <hi>Isaack</hi> was conceived in the <hi>Ens</hi> of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> in the apprehended or formed word of <hi>Faith,</hi> of <hi>Abrahams Ens</hi> in the faith, and stood in the figure of Christ; he was <hi>not wholly</hi> and onely out of the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi>; but out of both together; out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Adamicall <hi>Ens,</hi> and out of the conceived or apprehended word of <hi>Faith</hi>; and <hi>Ismael</hi> was out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams Ens,</hi> of <hi>Abrahams</hi> own nature, according to the <hi>corrupt</hi> property, he was wholly out of the <hi>essence</hi> of <hi>Abrahams</hi> soul and spirit, but <hi>not</hi> out of the apprehended word of <hi>Faith</hi> which passed upon <hi>Isaac.</hi>

                           <p n="23">23. <hi>Adam</hi> was the Image of God, he was man and woman and yet neither of them, before his <hi>Eve,</hi> but a masculine virgine in peculiar Love, full of chastity and purity; The Tinctures, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of the fire and light according to the property of the Father and Son were both in each other as <hi>One,</hi> in an uncessant Conjunction of desire, wherein stood the peculiar <hi>fiery</hi> Love-desire.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. But being the <hi>Devill</hi> assailed the property of the fires-Tincture, and brought his false desire thereinto, so that the fires-Tincture was divided in the properties of the eternall nature, each property on the centre gave it selfe forth into its Selfehood, whence the <hi>selfly</hi> revolted will and the false <hi>lust</hi> did arise, which lust desired to prove the dark worlds essence, <hi>viz.</hi> the earthly essence out of the dark worlds desire, and to tast in it selfe, how the same would <hi>relish,</hi> if evill and good (each manifest in it selfe) were together, <hi>viz.</hi> in the dis-Temperature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the divine <hi>One</hi>; hereupon the false fiery desire shut up the property of the lights Tincture with the introduced <hi>vanity</hi> of the Devills desire, and with the earthly hunger after the vanity (proceeding from the dark worlds essence) in the earth, and in the Elements, so that the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly female</hi> or right virgin-ike life was extinct in the <hi>Ens</hi> of the light.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. For the Holy Spirit departed from the introduced vanity; and so the <hi>holy matrix,</hi> viz. the heavenly Generatress, disappeared, and the mother of the outward nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the outward naturall <hi>woman,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the property of the woman, got the upper dominion in the birth, so that <hi>Adam</hi> must now be divided and figured into a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

But being the <hi>fiery</hi> property of the Tincture, (which now hath the dominion in the man, and is called man by reason of the fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty) was the cause of the poysonfull infection; so that the Tincture of <hi>venus,</hi> viz. of the woman or the <hi>light,</hi> was mortified; and being he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in himselfe the abomination of <hi>lust</hi> into the womans property, (whereby afterward the woman, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Eve,</hi> did so eagerly lust after evill and good, and began the earthly <hi>Eating</hi>) Thereupon we are here to consider, that this same fires-soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>mans</hi> Tincture, must be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized again with the divine Love-fire, that so it might not introduce the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Devill, and Serpent, insinuated into the <hi>masculine Seed</hi>; so poysonfull, into the <hi>womans</hi> matrix; it must be tinctured, and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed again with the divine Love-tincture, <hi>viz.</hi> with the holy Love-<hi>Ens,</hi> which came to pass in the <hi>Ens</hi> of faith, in the <hi>promised</hi> incorporated Word, of the power of God.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. But the Woman, viz. <hi>Adams</hi> virginity, was now transformed or

formed out of <hi>Adams</hi> nature, and essence, into a woman or manness, and in her the holy virginity, disappeared as to God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tincture of the Love, and light, did still remain, but as it were <hi>dead</hi> or disappeared; for the <hi>outward mother,</hi> viz. the elementary mother lived now in its <hi>stead</hi> in her, and was the Generatress of nature, which must receive <hi>Adams,</hi> viz. the <hi>mans</hi> Seed, into it selfe.</p>
                           <p n="28">28.

                           <p n="29">29. Thus understand us here, very accurately; like as the Father generateth the Son; and as out of <hi>Adam,</hi> who betokens the Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, the woman; <hi>viz.</hi> his Love-Tincture, was taken; and as before, while the woman was <hi>in</hi> the Man, the fires Tincture penetrated into the lights Tincture, and loved it selfe, therein; and as man and woman are <hi>one Body,</hi> so likewise the <hi>fire</hi>-baptisme of the Circumcision went forth out of the <hi>mans fire</hi>-Tincture into his <hi>female</hi> Tincture in the woman; God baptized the fires Tincture in the Man, and out of the <hi>Mans</hi> Seed cometh both the male, and the Female Sex.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. Thus the mans Covenant and Baptisme entred into the woman, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>female</hi> property, for the Womans Tincture had in it (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) the holy <hi>Ens</hi> in the Covenant, that Gods word in the Covenant would become man, in her shut up [barren] <hi>Ens,</hi> and <hi>quicken</hi> again therein the disappeared virginity.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. <hi>Therefore</hi> the woman must not put on the Seal of Baptisme in her <hi>own</hi> peculiar <hi>will</hi> or desire but have it from the man, being shee was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the man, that so shee might become a <hi>right</hi> woman [or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness] in the mans Baptisme, that so the Image of God in her might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>fires</hi>-Baptisme and Tincture from the man.</p>

                              <hi>as I live, and lo! Sarah thy wife shall have a Son; and Sarah heard it as she stood behinde at the Tent-door. Now Abraham and Sarah were both old, and well stricken in Age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women, and therefore she laughed within her selfe, and said, now I am old, shall I have pleasure, my Lord being old also? And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, and say, Is it of a certain, that I shall bear a child which am old? is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will come unto thee again as I live, and Sarah shall have a Son; then Sarah denied it, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid; and he said nay, but thou didst laugh.</hi>

                           <p n="6">6. The great Love, and humility of God in Christs person, is fully represented in this figure, how God came in the deepest <hi>humility,</hi> and simplicity into the humanity, when the humanity was enflamed with highest heat of the <hi>wrathfull</hi> indignation of Gods Anger, as the figure here denotes.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. <hi>The three men came before Abrahams Tent, in the very heat of all the day</hi>; This signifieth, that God did <hi>first</hi> incorporate [or betroth] him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with his Love-Covenant, and also with the fullness of time touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant, when the <hi>humane day,</hi> understand the six properties of the dayes, were most of all inflamed and set on fire in the <hi>wrath</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in man; that is, in the fall.

And here we are to understand that God hath represented (or delineated) the whole process, how he would <hi>regenerate</hi> anew the true man which he created; and how the same should come to passe, and how he would <hi>burn</hi> the <hi>Serpents Ens</hi> in the Eternall fire, and how he would put the lye of the poor Soul to open shame, and <hi>death,</hi> on the <hi>Cross</hi>; for we see this here very excellently in the Type.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. After that God had set forth the process of the new birth; these three men went towards <hi>Sodom</hi>; and would burn <hi>Ham,</hi> viz. the evill <hi>Ham</hi>-like fleshly property, with fire from the Lord, as it also came to passe, so that we see it very emphatically, how the judgement of God <hi>begins</hi> at the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>; How Christ is set to be a Judge of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills <hi>Ens</hi> and will, who shall burn the Devills Essence, with fire; as this following figure signifieth.</p>

                              </note> out of the <hi>Above</hi> with that formed Hearing of these three men, in the <hi>Ens</hi> which God had formed to be Judge of the world, which was to become <hi>the Christ.</hi>

                           <p n="12">12. For this <hi>Ens</hi> was to be creaturall in the Person, therefore it was formative, in an Angelicall manner, in the conceived <hi>word of</hi> the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>; and therewith it came from above, that is, out of the <hi>Above,</hi> viz. out of God; out of the unchangeable God; and <hi>heard first</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi> into the <hi>Ens</hi> of the Covenant, into the Aym or limit of his Covenant with his <hi>Love</hi>; and with the <hi>Anger,</hi> viz. with the Hearing of the fire, he heard into the iniquity and vanity of man; and <hi>saw</hi> with the Anger what they did; that is, his wrath saw essentially into the vanity of man, in manner as an incentive fire should arise in any piece of wood or fuell, and would devour the wood; so likewise God looked with his <hi>Anger-Eye</hi> in the formed <hi>Ens</hi> (through the same <hi>judiciall</hi> word in Christs <hi>Ens,</hi> wherein he will judge the world) into the wicked infection and will of the children of <hi>Ham</hi> at <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>

                           <p n="13">13. For when God had set before him, in <hi>Abraham,</hi> the new birth of his holy children out of his <hi>Love-Ens</hi>; he also set before him, the <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in his <hi>Anger Ens,</hi> how he would through this Christ, prove the wicked in the fire.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. And the judgement upon <hi>Sodom</hi> is a figure of the Last Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; As the three men which came before <hi>Abraham</hi> were a figure of our new Angelicall humanity, <hi>where</hi> God dwelleth in man; so was also his Anger in the wicked; and we see here, that God will <hi>Judge</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills, and all wicked men, by the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi>; as he now did represent the figure of the Judiciall <hi>Office</hi> in an humanity of three, and destroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> from the world.</p>
                           <p n="15">
                              <pb n="301" facs="tcp:29914:154"/>15. Also God said to <hi>Abraham; How can I hide from Abraham the thing which I do?</hi> It was hidden unto the Earthly <hi>Abraham,</hi> but unto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly out of Gods <hi>Ens,</hi> God would not hide it; and here he set forth, the figure of his Love, and his Anger; <hi>viz.</hi> the humanity of Christ in the great humility and Love; and his truth, and Righteousnesse in the Two Angells.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. For thus saith the Text in <hi>Moses;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Chap. XVIII. <hi>from the</hi> 22. <hi>to the</hi> 25 <hi>verse.</hi>
                              </note> 
                              <hi>And Abraham stood yet before the Lord,</hi> viz. before these three men, which he here calleth onely one, and came near to him, and said; <hi>Wilt thou also destroy the Righteous with the wicked, peradventure there are fifty Righteous within the Citty, wilt thou also destroy them; and not spare the place for the fifty Righteous that are therein, that be far from thee to do so, to slay the Righteous with the wicked, and that the Righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee; that thou who art the Judge of the whole Earth,</hi> shouldst so judge.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. This is now the very excellent and pregnant figure; how <hi>Abraham</hi> (in the <hi>Ens</hi> of faith in Christs Person and Spirit) cometh before God, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Tri-une God, before the <hi>Severe</hi> Righteousness of God; and will reconcile and atone the Father; and prayeth for his children, which dwell <hi>among the Company</hi> of the wicked; that his Father would be pleased to spare that place (where yet <hi>righteous people</hi> dwell) from Rebuke, and draweth his Mercy into his Righteousness, and saith; <hi>Thou wilt not so judge who art the Judge of the whole world.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="18">18. This figure is nothing else but God in his Righteousness, and God in Christ with his Mercy: Here the two types stand both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; what should it else mean, that a <hi>man</hi> would withhold God from doing what he please?</p>
                           <p n="19">19. The <hi>Man</hi> Christ doth withhold Gods righteousness, and severe judgement from falling on the crew of wicked men, else they had been devoured at the <hi>first</hi> disobedience in Paradise; this is he which cometh before God, and into God, <hi>viz.</hi> into Gods Anger, for he is of God, and therefore he <hi>can</hi> come before God [draw neer to, or intercede with God.]</p>
                           <p n="20">20. That is, the <hi>formed word,</hi> viz. the creature, standeth before the judgement, and <hi>sits</hi> in judgement, and suffers <hi>not</hi> the Anger to judge, so long as there are righteous people; as is here to be seen; <hi>If there had been but ten righteous</hi> persons, <hi>God had spared them</hi>; indeed there were but <hi>Three</hi> persons onely which were righteous before God; viz. <hi>Loth,</hi> with his <hi>two</hi> daughters, <hi>his wife</hi> was also not fit [or capable of this mercy,] therefore although she went out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> yet she remained still, and <hi>was turned to a pillar of Salt,</hi> as shall afterward be cleared, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, the Spirit of Christ, entreateth so far with God, that God would spare all these places for <hi>ten persons sake</hi>; but they were all revolted, and gon astray, save his brothers Son, who was a stranger among this people, whom God <hi>first</hi> brought out, before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled the wrath.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. The Spirit here speaketh very covertly and hiddenly in <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Esdras,</hi> who wrote again <hi>these Acts</hi> in the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">

                              </note> after that they were <hi>lost</hi> among the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and we here see very fully and pregnantly, how exactly, and punctually the <hi>Spirit</hi> here aymeth at
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:29914:155"/>
the figure in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and pointeth out what thereby is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. For at the <hi>Appearance</hi> unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> he speaketh of <hi>three men</hi>; and here he speaketh of <hi>two Angels,</hi> which went towards <hi>Sodom,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the Cities, to signifie, that the person of Christ is the <hi>Third,</hi> which went <hi>not</hi> along, for here onely two went, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods <hi>Truth,</hi> and Gods <hi>Righteousness</hi>; viz. the judgement, and the truth; the judgement remained <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p n="24">24. And when <hi>both these [Angels] at Even</hi> (when their time was out, and their day passed) <hi>came to Sodom; Lot sat at the Gate, and when he saw them, he arose up to meet them, and he bowed himselfe with his face towards the ground, and he said, Behold now my Lords, turn in I pray into your servants house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your wayes, but they said nay, but we will abide in the street all night; and he earnestly entreated them; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house, and he made them a Feast, and baked them unleavened cakes and they did eat.</hi>

                           <p n="25">25. If we should declare, and explain this in its right understanding; then we would express it after this manner; the <hi>cry</hi> of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> was the Curse, which <hi>Noah</hi> laid upon <hi>Ham</hi> when he cursed him, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his <hi>unchast</hi> wanton beastial Eyes, and desire; this same cursed, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall, spirit, had propagated &amp; bred up it self in the malicious prophane wholly earthly and serpentine property, in the <hi>flesh and soul</hi> of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Ham,</hi> so that it had established it selfe in a Kingly Dominion, under which they lived more like to <hi>Beasts,</hi> then true <hi>Men.</hi>

Now in this finall Arbitration, or determination of the divine <hi>Justice,</hi> viz. in <hi>Abraham,</hi> there stood Christ in the judgement of <hi>Enos</hi> his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Repentance; and in <hi>Enos</hi> his threatnings of plagues, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the earnest and severe judgement of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Prince <hi>Lucifer,</hi> did there stand (in the judgement in the <hi>children</hi> of the curse in <hi>Ham</hi>) to execute the fame in the wrath of God as a servant of the house of darkness.</p>

                           <p n="20">20. And here <hi>two Angels</hi> were sent (that is, in the power and might of the judgement) in Christs <hi>stead,</hi> being Christ was <hi>not yet</hi> in the flesh, and in Office, for Christs <hi>Office</hi> continued in <hi>Abraham</hi> before the Lord, and prayed for the <hi>Rebellious</hi> men of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>

For <hi>these</hi> two Angels had stirred up or moved their properties, and set them in open view before the Lord, to see what was in them; and then they found, that they were onely beastiall, unchast, lewd mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers; which brought them into judgement; and now they must be judged according to their Essence.</p>
                           <p n="33">33.

                           <p n="34">34. But the truth did <hi>first refuse</hi> to go into his house with the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, <hi>viz.</hi> with the <hi>judgement,</hi> and <hi>would remain in the street,</hi> for it was because of <hi>Lotts</hi> wife, who, when she was proved, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment passed through her, was cast as to her <hi>Temporall</hi> life, for she conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the judgement, as a <note n="*" place="margin">Prima Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria.</note> first matter, [<hi>viz.</hi>] as a Sulphur, <hi>Mercurius,</hi> that is, an <note n="*" place="margin">

Yet <hi>not</hi> so soon before the execution of the judgement, but <hi>when Lot went with her out of Sodom,</hi> and the judgement began, she drew the judgement back again on her, as is to be seen in the judgement, which then laid hold on her, for it had taken her in the <hi>probation.</hi>

                           <p n="38">38. Thus understand the figure farther internally, <hi>Lot baked cakes of unleavened dough, and made them a feast, and they did eat.</hi> Now the Angells do <hi>not use</hi> any such food; but they were onely formed Angels in an Angelicall shape, for <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> also called them, Lord: it was Gods judgement, and truth.</p>
                           <p n="39">39. This Feast was eaten in manner as the Offrings of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> as is before-mentioned; for the wills-desire <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p n="41">41. For these Angels did eat of <hi>Lotts</hi> food as if they had eaten of his Body and Spirit, which was therein apprehended, in manner as it is to be understood in the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>

                           <p n="45">45. <hi>And Lot went out unto them at the door, and shutt the door after him; and said; ah!

                           <p n="47">47.

                           <p n="54">54. The inward figure in the spirit giving us to understand what <hi>Moses</hi> doth hereby typifie, is this: The judgement begins at the house of God, as here in <hi>Lot,</hi> the children of God must be first brought into judgement, and <hi>proved</hi>; if there be children of God in any place which may withhold the Anger, so that the punishment may be kept back, then the <hi>spirit</hi> taketh the children of God and <hi>proveth</hi> them in the same vice and sin of that City or Country, [to see] if they be capable of the same lewdness.</p>
                           <p n="55">55. <hi>Lot</hi> must set his two <hi>daughters</hi> with entreaties into judgement; he would give them to the unclean lascivious people to be tryed; for, that which he said, was so directed by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which had the two <hi>daughters</hi> of <hi>Lot</hi> in the <hi>judgement,</hi> and had brought the Proba or Tryall into <hi>their Essence,</hi> and hereby signified and layd open the sin and shame of the City, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were onely unclean <hi>Harlots</hi>-beasts.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. The internall figure stands thus: the Spirit in <hi>Moses</hi> setteth the figure so clearly, that a man may easily take it; for he saith; <hi>when the morning came,</hi> and the Sun was risen; <hi>they took him by the hand, and brought him and his wife, and his two daughters forth out of the Citie.</hi> And now as the figure was <hi>externally,</hi> in the arisen light of the day and the Sun; so it was also <hi>internally</hi> in Gods Truth and Judgement.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Namely, in the truth the figure was internally thus: In <hi>Lott,</hi> and his two daughters, the <hi>light</hi> of the understanding concerning the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> was arisen in Gods truth; which <hi>Lots daughters</hi> knew very well; that it [<hi>viz.</hi> the light of the Sun of righteousness] in Gods truth had moved it selfe in their father <hi>Lot</hi>; from which <hi>cause</hi> afterwards when they were gon out from <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the night approached, they made <hi>their father drink</hi> sweet <hi>wine</hi> to the full; and lay with him; that they might <hi>receive Seed,</hi> viz. the <hi>holy Seed</hi> from him; for the Spirit, both in <hi>Lot</hi> and his daughters did also signifie thus much, in their risen light, and shewed it to them.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And now as the <hi>Sun</hi> was externally <hi>risen,</hi> and it seemed to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lovely pleasant day; so also internally in Gods truth, the <hi>Sun</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>holy Sun-Day</hi> was risen according to the <hi>probation</hi> in their Essence, for they were now passed through the judgement: And likewise on the contrary, the <hi>Sun</hi> of the dark worlds property, <hi>viz.</hi> the working of Gods Anger, was risen now in the children of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and forced mightily into Gods Righteousness; therefore the Angels bad <hi>Lot</hi> make hast; for the Sun of Anger was already risen, and had appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the children of Iniquity.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Like as the <hi>holy</hi> Sun in Gods truth (which had apprehended <hi>Lot</hi> and his daughters in the Essence of <hi>Faith</hi>) took <hi>Lot</hi> and his daughters by the hand, and brought them forth from them; so likewise the <hi>Wrath</hi> had already taken the children of <hi>Sodom</hi> by the hand of their Essence; and brought them into the judgement of Execution. And we will sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and apply (O <hi>Babel</hi>) this figure unto the time of thy <hi>Seal</hi>; mark and observe it yee Daughters, children of <hi>Lot:</hi> it concerns you.</p>

                              <hi>exhorts</hi> them to Repentance, and declares unto them his Grace; soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he sends them the Angel of righteousness, who <hi>tryeth</hi> and sifteth them whether they be capable of the Grace that is tendred unto them; and sets <hi>judgement</hi> before them with threats of their ruin; denouncing great <hi>warre</hi> and Plagues upon them to blot and root them out if they will not return and repent; and sheweth them also by his <hi>Messengers,</hi> the light, and way of Righteousness; and suffers them to run on in the light that is tendered to them, till they be <hi>weary</hi> and glutted with it, and hold it onely for a common customary thing, and an history, and again become a <hi>Sodom.</hi>

                              <p n="16">16.

                              <p n="42">42. For the <hi>outward</hi> work is onely a shame in Gods sight, and also in the sight of all People, but the inward work in its figure, must be so; and it is the true figure, that the <hi>Man</hi> Christ, viz. <hi>Gods</hi> Son should be
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:29914:162"/>
born through a shame, which also was a shame before God; but so <hi>he took our shame,</hi> and reproach upon himselfe, and hung it as a curse upon the Tree of the Crosse, and offered it up unto the righteousness of God; so likewise both these lines must be <hi>covered</hi> with a Shame; that they both might be sanctified onely and alone under <hi>Christs shame</hi> on the Cross; and they should <hi>not dare</hi> to say, that they were pure before God, and nature; for the Scripture saith; <note n="*" place="margin">
                                    <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32.</note> 
                                 <hi>He hath shutt them up all under Sin, that he might have Mercy upon all.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="43">43. And that this was truly and certainly a work of God, appeares in this; that on the <hi>same day</hi> the mother was turned to a pillar of Salt, and <hi>Sodom</hi> destroyed doubtless with all their housholdstuffe and Goods, that yet they that <hi>same night</hi> they set about this work, whereas they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued all night in a Cave of the Mountain by <hi>Zoar</hi> [so that we may well thinke] <hi>no</hi> naturall <hi>fleshly</hi> instigation did provoke them thereunto.</p>
                              <p n="44">44. But it <hi>must be,</hi> that the father should be drunk, that the <hi>humane understanding</hi> might not do it; but that it might be Gods work; also that the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Lot</hi> might not be Turbated in the Tincture of the Seed with the <hi>shame</hi> of the daughters; it must be don therefore as it were in mans drunkenness, and misunderstanding, least the Nations should make a Right or <hi>Custome</hi> thereof; for the daughters of <hi>Lot</hi> were also as t'were drunk in the spirit, so that the spirit might do what he would, and they onely were an instrument.</p>
                              <p n="45">45. And that they did understand that the father was <hi>sanctified,</hi> and they willingly would conceive of the <hi>holy</hi> Seed, appeares, in that they said; <hi>There was not a man upon the earth who could come in unto them after the manner of mankinde; and therefore they would lye with their father, that they might preserve Seed:</hi> there were indeed many upon the earth, but <hi>none</hi> was capable of <hi>this</hi> Seed, but these his daughters, this the spirit in them gave them to understand.</p>
                              <p n="46">46. Therefore we ought narrowly to observe what it means, when the spirit in <hi>Moses</hi> draweth a <hi>vail</hi> before his face, that it doth not appeare wholly pure before God, and yet for the unavoidableness sake, it must be so.</p>
                              <p n="47">47. And we ought not also to judge in the deeds of God according to Reason; for Reason looketh onely upon the <hi>outward</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. And now that <hi>Abraham,</hi> viz. the Stock, and beginning of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Ens</hi> of faith, in which Christ was understood, must thus <hi>wander</hi> from one place to another, and could have no abiding place upon the earth, and moreover must stand in <hi>fear</hi> and Temptation; the same is the true Type of Christendome upon the earth; how the same should not be bound unto any <hi>certaine</hi> place; Not unto any People that God did choose thereto in a peculiar manner; but that Christ was given, with his <hi>Gospel</hi> of the Kingdome of God, to <hi>all</hi> Nations.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And how he would <hi>wander</hi> with his knowledge from one people to another; and have no where any <hi>constant</hi> abiding place with a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but be among the Nations with his children upon the earth, onely as a Sojourner or Stranger; and how they would continually try to destroy <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p n="4">4. And how the Christians should be continually tempted and <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised</hi> of the Nations, and plagued with Contention and <hi>warre:</hi> also how Christ would goe with his Gospel from one people to another, when they should be weary and glutted with the same, and hold it onely for a Custome and a common ordinary thing; and so they would grow <hi>wholly</hi> blind in it, and make onely a <note n="*" place="margin">

And then he would <hi>depart</hi> with the understanding and spirit from them, and come unto another People, which also would be onely <hi>flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and account, and look upon Christ externally as a <hi>meer</hi> Man; as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> and this King <hi>Abimilech</hi> looked upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his wife; and desired to have carnall knowledge of <hi>Sarah,</hi> by reason of her beauty; which did signifie and denote, that they would put on Christ in the flesh in an <hi>outward</hi> beastiall manner, but <hi>not</hi> in power, and spirit.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. As it is here to be seen in <hi>Abimilech,</hi> and also in <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that when they desired to know <hi>Sarah</hi> carnally, that the Lord came in among them with punishments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and plagues, and shewed them his Angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, shutt them up, and dismayed them, as if he bound them with the chains of his <hi>might</hi>; and made their women barren, and terrified them with <hi>visions</hi> and presages; as he did to this <hi>Abimilech</hi>; and <hi>threatned</hi> him
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:29914:163"/>
with Death in the Dream; and made known unto him, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a man of God; and how he was blessed of God.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Through which means God brought the Nations to the <hi>faith</hi>; [for] when he came unto a fleshly <hi>unbeleeving</hi> People, then he shewed himselfe in power and wonders; which the carnall Nations seing, did convert themselves, and turn unto God.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> must be a Type of Christs Kingdome upon the earth; and go up and down from one People to another, whereupon the people which he left, did yet boast themselves of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themselves after his Name, but were onely historicall children brought forth of <hi>strange</hi> women without <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and spirit.</p>

                           <p n="10">10. As it is as plain as the day, that now men go from the <hi>scorning</hi> and reproaching each other, to the <hi>Sword</hi> of murther; and will wholly slay and root out Christ [in his members] and set the Babylonicall Tower in Christs stead, whereby a man shall be able in <hi>selfe-will</hi> and power to climbe into heaven; so that a man <hi>need not</hi> enter in through the mortifying of the old evill man, but may be able to come in, after a fine hypocriticall way with the Selfehood of the <hi>evill</hi> man; or indeed as outwardly adopted children covered with Christs purple-mantle; where yet the will of Selfe is <hi>unmortified,</hi> and cannot truly come to God.</p>

                           <p n="19">19. For <hi>Christ in</hi> his children doth not belong to the humane own-hood, <hi>viz.</hi> to the selfewill; neither doth he <hi>appropriate</hi> or give in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

                              <p n="3">3. When God had manifested himselfe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and set forth the figure of Christ and his Kingdome, and also the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Judgement</hi>
                                 <pb n="321" facs="tcp:29914:164"/>
upon the whole earth, then God hid himselfe again from <hi>Abraham</hi>; and then <hi>Abraham</hi> went towards the <hi>South</hi> Countrey; that is, into his <hi>Reason</hi>; viz. into mans own understanding; and dwelt at <hi>Gerar,</hi> that is, in the corrupt nature; which manifests it selfe plainly, in his <hi>carriage</hi> towards <hi>Abimilech,</hi> where he in the fear of nature, in the Temptation, did deny his wife, and said, that she was not his wife, that so he might but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve himselfe by the <hi>suttlety</hi> of Reason; and we see here also, how that that very thing, by which he thought in Reason to keep himselfe from <hi>mischiefe,</hi> must reprove and teach him; as we see how <hi>Abimilech</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him in that he had denied his wife, with whom he had <hi>almost</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if the Lord had not warned him; and the exposition is this.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. If we see a man whom the Spirit of God <hi>driveth,</hi> and by whom he oftentimes speaketh, we must <hi>not</hi> so take it up, and thinke, that he is something more then other men; as <hi>Abraham</hi> was no more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in his own <hi>Reason</hi>; the selfe-reason in them is as wavering, dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and imperfect, <hi>as in other</hi> men, and That what they know, and teach of God, is <hi>not</hi> their own propriety; as we see here in <hi>Abraham,</hi> how he out of <hi>fear</hi> did not spare his <hi>Sarah,</hi> (but denied her out of a timerous conjecture; though <hi>Abimilech</hi> had taken her away from him to be his <hi>Concubine</hi>) that so he might but live, and it might be well with him for <hi>her</hi> sake.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. Thus God proveth his children, that they might <hi>see,</hi> that they in their own ability are <hi>no more</hi> then all other sinfull men; and that men should not so set by them and hold them for a God; thus oftentimes God <hi>permits</hi> them to go astray and erre, and yet then he rebukes them also by <hi>those</hi> whom they ought to teach, as we see here in <hi>Abimilech</hi>; how he must reprove <hi>Abraham,</hi> and make him <hi>ashamed,</hi> that he would not spare his wife for a small fears sake, but would <hi>deny</hi> her.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. And although it doth fall out that sometimes we see, such a man whom God driveth to <hi>erre,</hi> yet we ought not therefore presently whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>reject</hi> him, and set him at nought, and think that he is <hi>wholly</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, as the world doth; but think that God doth thus set his children <hi>under the Cross</hi> to prove them; that they should learn to know themselves; and then the <hi>Sun</hi> ariseth <hi>again</hi> upon them; as here it did upon <hi>Abraham</hi>; when God had suffered him to go unto <hi>Gerar</hi>; that is, into his naturall rationall life, wherein he committed a great offence before <hi>Abimilech.</hi> A <hi>twofold Sun</hi> did afterwards arise and shine on him; <hi>viz.</hi> one was, that <hi>Abimilech</hi> did acknowledge him, and <hi>learned</hi> to fear the Lord; and gave the Land for a possession unto <hi>Abraham</hi>; he gave him also <hi>Gifts</hi> for rebuke; as the Reproof of the Saints, is, that men should <hi>fear</hi> at Gods reproof; Thus the <hi>Sun</hi> of King Abimilechs <hi>favour</hi> arose upon him. And then the other Sun which shoan on him, was, that <hi>Sarah conceived</hi>; and a branch sprang forth unto him out of the <hi>line</hi> of the Covenant from the divine <hi>Suns</hi> Power, and <hi>Isaac</hi> was born unto him.</p>
                              <p n="7">7. And that we may understand the very truth; we see, how allwaies the <hi>Crosse</hi> stands by the children of God; and <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually sett by each other; as here <hi>Abimilech</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>; and <hi>Ismael</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi>; and also the man of right reason; and the corrupt nature against reason; which uncessantly sifts, and trys reason; as we may see
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:29914:165"/>
it here in <hi>Hagar,</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> which also were set one against another, that one did exercise the other; as <hi>Hagar</hi> in the property of <hi>corrupt</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                              <p n="8">8.

                              <p n="9">9. And when the resigned will hath wholly cast <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <p n="10">10. When <hi>Isaac,</hi> that is, Christ is born in the <hi>Convert,</hi> then the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all new-born will rejecteth its <hi>own</hi> evill nature; it contemneth it, and condemneth it to death; casteth it out also from it selfe, with its Son the <hi>mocker,</hi> viz the false interpreter [and perverter of the truth]; as if it would even burst the same in the <hi>Minde</hi>; so very an hatefull enemy the new-born spirituall will becomes to the naturall will in its Evill <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; viz. to <hi>Ismael</hi> the Son of the naturall will, who is onely a mocker, scoffer, pharisaicall censurer, lyar, backbiter and unrighteous.</p>
                              <p n="11">11. And when the new-born will hath thus cast out the evill nature with its <hi>wicked</hi> children from it selfe, then the poor <hi>forsaken nature</hi> stands in great distress, trembling, and desertion; for the internall <hi>holy Soul</hi> doth forsake it; and then it even gives up it selfe wholly to death; and wandreth in it selfe in the wilderness; and looketh upon it selfe as a <hi>foolish</hi> and simple one, who is every ones <hi>by-word,</hi> and laughing stocke.</p>
                              <p n="12">12.

                                 <hi>forlorn</hi>; so that the own desire begins to faint and quail within it selfe, then comes the Angel of God to the nature; and comforts it; and bids it not to despair; and gives it also <hi>water</hi> to drink; that is, some faithfull upright man, [or some inward ray and beam of light from the new-birth of Christ in the heart] which <hi>comforts</hi> it in its forsaken condition; and helps to nourish, and cherish it, and tells it, that it shall not dye, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>great</hi> Nation, but not in its innate and inbred heritage; <hi>viz.</hi> in the evill Selfe-will, but in <hi>Beer-sheba</hi>; that is, in the true <hi>Contrition</hi> in the wilderness, <hi>viz.</hi> in the valley of teares in the <hi>desertion</hi>; that is, the poor nature must work in this forsakenness, and in its present banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and exile [from the sensible and full enjoyment of Paradise] bring forth <hi>much fruit,</hi> which fruit the Angel brings again into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Tent to be a sojourner of Christ.</p>
                              <p n="13">13. That is (we must understand) when Christ is born in man, he rejecteth the <hi>vanity</hi> of nature, with the will which worketh and desireth vanity, and maketh the naturall will to be <hi>Servant,</hi> whereas before it was Lord and Master; but Nature standeth in the <hi>wilderness,</hi> in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of death, encompassed with <hi>Sin</hi>; and now it must work and bring forth fruit, and yet it looketh upon it selfe as <hi>wholly impotent</hi>; and as one wholly cast out from the inward spirituall will of Christ; and in it selfe it seems as one foolish, and <hi>contemned</hi> of the world; and every way bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off from its own will; and then it begins even to <hi>sinck</hi> and <hi>quail</hi> in it selfe; and to leave off from its own will; and all things are of small esteem with it: That which before did rejoyce it, that now is against it; and it stands <hi>allwaies</hi> as if it should <hi>dye</hi>; it hopeth, and doubteth; that is, it hopeth amendment, that it might yet once be delivered from the scornfull contempt, and be set again into the <hi>honour</hi> of its selfehood; but it dryeth up also its well of water; and Gods anger appears in its sight; that is, all its <hi>friends</hi> depart from it, with whom before in its Temporall goods and prosperity it had pleasure, respect, and honour; so that it looks upon it selfe as continually <hi>a dying.</hi>

                              <head>The inward pretious figure of this is thus.</head>
                              <p n="25">25. When a man is born again in Christs Spirit, as it was here with <hi>Abraham</hi>; then he thinks <hi>sometimes,</hi> that he is <hi>wholly new,</hi> and knows not himselfe yet aright, and that he hath the whorish Egyptian bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with her scoffing Son of <hi>vanity</hi> in his Armes; and now, when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that oftentimes the mocker, viz. <hi>Ismael</hi> the Son of the Bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth <hi>breake forth</hi> out of him, yea even wholly without his will and purpose; that <hi>Sarah,</hi> (that is, honest Mindes, to whom God doth make it known) do <hi>reprove</hi> him; nay and is oftentimes reproved of the <hi>evill,</hi> so that it is plainly declared to him that this mocker should be cast out; This <hi>Abraham,</hi> viz. the <hi>man</hi> will by no meanes brook; he will be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled, and yet he doth not know, that he in <hi>this</hi> time of his earthly <hi>life</hi> stands in the <hi>judgement</hi> of God; that his words, and workes must be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, and judged; he will often go in a way of <hi>justification,</hi> and maintain his own cause, and will be praised, and in the mean time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getts the Egyptian Bond-woman in his Armes and her scoffing Son, who sometimes <hi>peeps</hi> forth in his words with evill interpretations, <hi>wrong meanings,</hi> and evill surmises, and covers it selfe finely under a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing mantle of glistering hypocrisie; this now the free woman casts out, that is, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ casts it out, by other peoples mouth; and yet this <hi>seems</hi> to be unrighteous to the man; being the word is born of his body, and arisen out of his very Minde.</p>
                              <p n="26">26. But the Lord speaketh in the Spirit of the humility of Christ; let it not seem grievous in thy Sight, that <hi>people</hi> do finde fault with thy words, and reject thy labour; Hearken to <hi>Sarah,</hi> viz. to the <hi>divine voice</hi>; and do thou thy selfe cast out from thee whatsoever thou hast at any time spoken or meant evilly, wrongfully, or <hi>partially,</hi> for in <hi>Isaac,</hi> that is, in thy deepest <hi>humility,</hi> thy Seed shall be called, where, in thy words and workes the Spirit of God worketh in Love, and not in thy naturall selfeness and peculiar <hi>ownhood</hi> of reason, wherein the Son of the bond-woman speaketh and worketh.</p>
                              <p n="27">27. And the children of God ought well to consider this figure, and thinke, that whatsoever is spoken and don from favour, <hi>affection,</hi> and partiall siding, be it either towards honest or dishonest men, the same <hi>proceeds</hi> from the Son of the Bond-woman, which must go into <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be tryed; and must be judged of men; <hi>viz.</hi> of the evill and good; it must be cast forth among a company of evill, and good <hi>Tongues</hi>; where every one passeth his sentence and judgement thereupon: God judgeth upon the earth externally by men, both by the Evill and Good.</p>
                              <p n="28">28. This now must seem so very grievous and hainous to <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> to <hi>Man,</hi> when his words and workes are judged and proved, and think, that his <hi>divine Seed</hi> must be brought forth onely in the Love and humility, and that whatsoever he speaketh, judgeth, or doth from <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> or favour, doth belong again unto judgement, where it must be proved, and purged; As <hi>Hagar</hi> with her Son <hi>Ismael</hi> was, and then, when it is <hi>judged</hi>; that is, cast out by the people; then comes the Angel of God, and speaketh to the naturall man, that he should <hi>not despair</hi> in this
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:29914:167"/>
judgement; but take it in good part, and be content, that his words and workes are judged.</p>
                              <p n="29">29. Therefore we say as the Lord hath given us to know it, that whosoever will read and <hi>understand</hi> aright the history of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he must set before him two Types; <hi>viz.</hi> externally <hi>Adam,</hi> viz. the earthly man, and internally <hi>Christ,</hi> and change both these into <hi>One,</hi> and so he may understand <hi>all whatsoever Moses</hi> and the Prophets have spoken in the Spirit.</p>
                              <p n="30">30. He must not be so blind as to look upon it as the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Babel</hi> doe, who make onely of this History, Conclusions of reason in respect of the <hi>Election</hi> of God, as if God had thus onely chosen to himselfe a sundry and peculiar Nation or sort of people to be his children: the <hi>Election</hi> of God passeth upon the <hi>figure</hi> onely, shewing, what people should bear the figure of the <hi>inward</hi> kingdome of Christ in the <hi>outward,</hi> in which people God would set forth and manifest the kingdome of Christ externally: the <hi>Jewes</hi> have had onely a mirror and type hereof externally, and so likewise the <hi>Christians,</hi> who looked upon Christ in the flesh as a <hi>meer</hi> pure man.</p>
                              <p n="31">31. These figures have remained very speechless to the world, even to this last time, and that from the <hi>purpose</hi> of God, being man is such a piece of meer vanity, and <hi>flesh,</hi> and so soon weary of the <hi>Pearls,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards comes to trample them under-foot, <hi>Therefore</hi> God hath dealt with man in Types and <hi>Parables</hi>; as Christ also did when he came upon the earth; <hi>He spake all these mysteries in Parables</hi> for mans unworthiness sake.</p>
                              <p n="32">32. But <hi>now</hi> at present there is Great Cause (as all the Prophets have prophecied thereof) that the same should be made manifest; and the Cause is this, that in this <hi>Last Trumpets Sound the</hi>

                                 <hi>mystery of the kingdome of God shall be finished</hi>; and the bride of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the wise virgins shall be prepared, who shall meet the Lord in his <hi>Appearance</hi>; and it betokens the day of Christs Coming, when he will appear with the holy Citie the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> and bring home his <hi>Bride:</hi> Therefore the mystery of the Kingdome of God must first be unfolded and explained out of its Types, and become wholly manifest.</p>
                              <p n="33">33. And this will be the fall of the fleshly <hi>Sinfull</hi> man, in that <hi>the man of Sin</hi> must be made manifest, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> plainly prophecieth thereof, <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.3.</note> 
                                 <hi>that the child of perdition shalbe revealed</hi> to all Nations, speeches, tongues; and <hi>the Beast with the whore shall go into the bottomless pit</hi>; that is, when the Kingdome of Christ becomes wholly manifest; then the Beast, and the whore of flesh, <hi>viz.</hi> the false Bond-woman, with her scoffing Son, stands in great shame, and is <hi>Judged</hi> of Every one, as an whore in the Cage, that Every one scornes and scoffs at.</p>
                              <p n="34">34. As indeed hitherto men have reviled Christ in the outward Image of <hi>Simplicity</hi> in his children and members, in which, Reason hath seen and known no more, then <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> in their miserable ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; under which notwithstanding, the voice of the Angel hath been; which they have scorned and mocked in the foolish plain simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city under the vail, and have set up the <hi>mocker</hi> Ismael in Christs stead; which hath been onely an <hi>Antichrist:</hi> Now this mocker and <hi>Antichrist shall be revealed</hi> under this Trumpetts Sound; and be cast out <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>by.</hi>

                              <p n="35">35. We see all an excellent figure of this in <hi>Abimilech,</hi> that, when God will manifest himselfe to a people, how he <hi>terrifies</hi> them in the midst of their <hi>Sins,</hi> and appeareth to them in Anger; as to <hi>Abimilech</hi> in the vision; and to <hi>Moses</hi> in the bush of fire; and also to <hi>Israel</hi> upon the Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> also in the fire; and also to <hi>Elias</hi> in the fire and winde; where allwaies the rebuke of Gods wrath is fore-signified, how God doth bruise the hearts of men that they may <hi>feare</hi> and tremble before him, as here <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milech</hi> when the Lord appeared to him by night in a vision, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him by reason of <hi>Sarah,</hi> he was astonished, and told the same in the eares of his people, and the people were sore afraid, and <hi>Abimilech</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Abraham,</hi> and made a Covenant with him.</p>
                              <p n="36">36. This is an excellent figure, and pregnantly intimates, how God terrifieth the <hi>Enemies,</hi> and comforts poor dejected nature when it quails for fear; and turnes its fear into <hi>Joy</hi>; and how the miserable, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted if he be <hi>honest</hi> is at last drawn out of misery and affliction; and how at last his Enemies who before he thought to be his Enemies must <hi>serve</hi> him, and <hi>advance</hi> him; so wonderfully doth God lead his children, if they do but endure Temptation and continue under the Cross of Christ in humility, and not look upon <hi>Selfe-revenge,</hi> but put on <hi>Patience</hi> in hope and persevere stedfast in the faith; at last all a mans adversaries must see and acknowledge that <hi>God</hi> is with the man, and that the world hath dealt wrongfully and unrighteously with him.</p>
                              <p n="37">37. Also this is an excellent emphaticall figure how <hi>Abraham</hi> (when God would punish <hi>Abimilech</hi>) did <hi>pray</hi> unto God for <hi>Abimilech,</hi> and made reconciliation, that God did bless <hi>Abimilech</hi>; and this whole Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story stands in the <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and holds forth how <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ are together; how Christ is come into the Selfe-assumed <hi>Kingly</hi> own-hood or selfeness of man, and terrifieth <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and how the poor corrupt nature doth turn it selfe in the horror, and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, to God, as here <hi>Abimilech</hi> turned unto <hi>Abraham</hi>; and how it then giveth the kingdome of nature for a <hi>possession</hi> unto Christ; and the inward figure in the Spirit of <hi>Moses</hi> (who was the Type and figure of Christ, who yet pointeth, out of the Fathers property, upon the Son in the flesh, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>humanity</hi>) can be understood no otherwise, then even thus; It is the true <hi>Ground.</hi>

And Abimilech answered, I know not who hath don this thing: neither didst thou tell me; neither yet heard I of it, but to day. And Abraham took sheep, and Oxen, and gave them unto Abimilech, and both of them made a Covenant together; and Abraham sett seven Ew-lambes of the flock by themselves, and Abimilech said unto Abraham, what mean these Seven Ew-lambes which thou hast sett apart by themselves? And he answered; Seven Lambes thou shalt take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto mee that I have digged this Well: Whreupon he called that Place Beer-sheba, because they there sware both of them; and thus they made a Covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimilech rose up, and Pichol the chief Captain of his host; and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the Land of the Philistins; And Abraham planted trees in Beer-sheba, and preached there of the Name of the Lord the Eternall God; and was for a long time a Stranger in the Land of the Philistines.</hi> This figure seems outwardly, as if <hi>Abimilech</hi> was afraid of <hi>Abraham</hi>; being God had given him to understand in a vision, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Prince of God;
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:29914:169"/>
thereupon he desired a Covenant and Oath from <hi>Abraham,</hi> least he should root out him, and his Posterity.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. But the Spirit of Christ under the vail of <hi>Moses</hi> hath ciphered out before him far <hi>another figure,</hi> wherewith he alludes, and prophecieth; for under all the Acts of <hi>Abraham</hi> which the Spirit of <hi>Moses</hi> hath written down, we are to understand, a <hi>twofold figure,</hi> viz. externally an history relating something don; and under that same history, the Spirit of Christ in the Covenant, doth so aptly, and exactly sett its figure, as if he played therewith.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. For the place here mentioned, is even the same whither <hi>Hagar</hi> fled with <hi>Ismael</hi>; it is even the same <hi>Beer-sheba,</hi> and the same fountain of water signified, which the Angel shewed <hi>Hagar</hi>; which <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, Christ <hi>digged</hi>; where afterwards Christendome <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>called on.</hi>

                              <p n="5">5.

                              <p n="7">7.

                              <p n="8">8.

                                 <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>Sarah</hi> must be first <hi>old,</hi> before he begatt <hi>Isaac,</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that Christ should be manifested in the flesh in the <hi>Old Age</hi> of the world.</p>

                                 <hi>Keturah,</hi> then we understand, that <hi>KETVRAH</hi> is a formed <hi>matrix</hi> of nature; which signifieth to us, that <hi>Abraham</hi> after he had begotten the Type of Christ in the <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> should now begett his own likenesse as to <hi>Adams</hi> nature out of the <hi>Six properties</hi> of the naturall spirits life, and also set forth and represent his own naturall likeness; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must also have such a <hi>vessell</hi> thereunto.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. <hi>Sarah</hi> must bring forth but <hi>One</hi> Son, to signifie, that the kingdome of mankinde is given but to <hi>one</hi>; and that they <hi>all</hi> do belong to this one; and should in him become the same onely one as branches on one tree; which [<hi>one</hi>] should be <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>All.</hi>

                              <p n="5">5. And we have here a very excellent figure against the <hi>Reason</hi>-wise, who say, that whosoever is not born by nature in the <hi>Ens</hi> of faith [that is naturally as it were begotten of the Seed of the woman which workes onely by a <hi>particular</hi> election of God as they feign) the same is <hi>hardned,</hi> and cannot attain to the Adoption of God, he is <hi>not</hi> drawn by God, that he should come to the new-birth: this figure quite strikes down their <hi>fiction,</hi> and shewes the true ground; and first, it setts forth <hi>Isaac,</hi> viz. <hi>Christ</hi>; and declareth plainly that to <hi>him</hi> alone the kingdome of God is hereditary and <hi>peculiar,</hi> and that no man can have it any more for, or from the Right of <hi>nature</hi>; and how <hi>we</hi> are altogether <hi>cast out</hi> from thence with <hi>Adam,</hi> and have <hi>lost</hi> the same; as the children of <hi>Ketu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> were all cast out from the inheritance of <hi>Abrahams</hi> goods, and <hi>Isaac onely</hi> did inheritt them.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. And he setts down hereby, how <hi>Adams</hi> children were also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of <hi>Abraham, and how he gave them Gifts of his goods</hi>; betokening, how free gifts were given to <hi>Adams naturall children,</hi>

                              <p n="7">7. For <hi>Abraham</hi> did not cast out his naturall children from him <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gifts</hi>: so likewise God did not cast <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradise <hi>without</hi> his <note n="*" place="margin">Note, <hi>where the Free Grace of God was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</hi>
                                 </note> free Gift; he first gave him the <hi>bruiser of the Serpent</hi> in the word of the Covenant; and afterwards he cast <hi>Adam</hi> from the childlike inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the <hi>naturall</hi> Right; and yet he received him again in the <hi>free Donation</hi>; as <hi>Abraham</hi> also did not here reject his children and cast them out from the child-ship, but from the <hi>naturall Right</hi> of his goods; yet they were <hi>dear</hi> unto him in the child-ship; therefore he <hi>freely</hi> gave them gifts of his goods, and thereby he signifieth to us, that the Kingdome of heaven doth indeed belong onely unto <hi>Christ,</hi> viz. to the true <hi>Isaac:</hi> but as he freely of Grace gave the Covenant to <hi>Adam</hi>; and as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> gave Gifts out of <hi>Isaac's</hi> Right to the Sons of the Concubines; so God the Father doth still <hi>to this day,</hi> give <hi>Adams,</hi> and <hi>Abrahams</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall children, the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and heritage of Christ as a free Gift of Grace.</p>

                                 <pb n="362" facs="tcp:29914:185"/>8. And as Abrahams <hi>naturall</hi> children were not <hi>disinherited</hi> from the Covenant, but onely from his Goods; so likewise <hi>no man</hi> is disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Covenant of God, established in <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Abraham, Every</hi> man <hi>receiveth</hi> the free given Covenant in the <hi>wombe,</hi> in which his free-given Covenant, he hath <hi>power</hi> to turn in unto Christs goods.</p>
                              <p n="9">9. But he hath not the goods in the <hi>Right of nature,</hi> to take the same at or by his <hi>own</hi> will, but as a <hi>free</hi> Gift; he shall and must resigne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe up unto the Covenant as a Servant, wholly giving up his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall will in the Covenant, and <hi>forsake</hi> the will to the Right of nature, and become wholly the Covenants own; so that he doth not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger introduce his own <hi>naturall will</hi> into the Covenant and free Gift, but give up his will to the Covenant; and then the free gift standeth in the <hi>place</hi> of the own will; and the nature of <hi>Adam</hi> liveth in the free gift, and also enjoyeth the inheritance, but <hi>not</hi> in the selfe-will, but in the true Resignation, where the <hi>will of the Covenant</hi> becomes mans will.</p>
                              <p n="10">10. For the will of the Covenant inheriteth the Son-ship in the right of nature, but the will of the naturall Selfeness is cast out from it, the same must <hi>dye</hi> unto the assuming own-hood; and when it is brought so to passe, it ariseth in the Covenant in Christ, and possesseth the free gift in the <hi>Right of Grace</hi>; Christ hath manifested himselfe in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in <hi>Adams</hi> freely given gift in the humane nature, and is become the life, and will of the Covenant, and <hi>fullfilled</hi> the same.</p>
                              <p n="11">11. But now this free-given Covenant which God bestowed on <hi>Adam,</hi> lyeth <hi>in all</hi> men, for as <hi>Sin passed</hi> as a birth-right from one <hi>upon all,</hi> so also the Covenant and the free gift of grace passeth from one upon all; <hi>Every man hath Christ in him</hi>; but the own will doth not apprehend him, but it <hi>crucifieth</hi> him, and will not dye to its Selfness, that so it might enter into <hi>Christs death,</hi> and <hi>arise</hi> in the Covenant in the will of Christ.</p>
                              <p n="12">12. The Own will desireth onely to be an outwardly assumed or adopted Son of Grace, and yet it is cast out from the <hi>presence</hi> of God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> cast out his naturall children from his goods, and disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and gave the goods <hi>onely to Isaac</hi>; so likewise the kingdome of God <hi>belongs onely</hi> to the will of the Covenant.</p>
                              <p n="13">13. <hi>Which</hi> indeed <hi>lyeth in all men,</hi> but no man can receive or see the Kingdome of God, unless he become the <hi>child</hi> of the Covenant, so that he <hi>forsake</hi> the naturall forth-proceeded will, and put on the will of Christ in the Covenant; so that his will in the Covenant be <hi>born anew</hi> in Christ; and then he is <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <p n="14">14. But that <hi>Abraham did send the children of his</hi> Adamicall <hi>nature away out of his house with Gifts,</hi> and did not keep them with him as Sojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; betokens, that the externall man, <hi>will,</hi> while it is in this life, <hi>live</hi> in the will of Selfe upon the earth, and that it cannot wholly put off the same according to the <hi>earthly</hi> man; but this same earthly Selfe will is cast out of the holiness of God, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
                              <p n="15">15. And although the free gift of the Covenant lyeth <hi>hid</hi> in him,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:29914:185"/>
yet the <hi>outward</hi> earthly man is cast out from Paradise, and the Covenant of God, and <hi>shall not inherit the kingdome of heaven</hi> (Joh. 6.) but he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall inherit it who is born of the free gift of the Covenant, not <hi>Adam</hi> but Christ in his Members; not the <hi>Serpents Ens,</hi> and the selfish rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Ismalitish scoffing false will; but the will of the Covenant in <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels circumcision,</hi> where the mocker is cutt off from the Covenant; and <hi>Ismael</hi> then becomes <hi>Isaac's brother.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="16">16. The Own selfe-made gross earthly <hi>Adam,</hi> who by his own lust hath made himselfe a <hi>Beast,</hi> and received and taken in the Devills de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and will, into the selfly assumed Beast, the same cannot be or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> in the Image of Christ: he is cast out from thence, and walketh in the world of <hi>vanity,</hi> and his own <hi>lust,</hi> so that he is not capable of the free gift in the Covenant.</p>

                              <p n="21">21. As <hi>Abraham</hi> (in this figure) did not spare his owne children, but

cast them out; so likewise a Christian must <hi>not</hi> spare or <hi>forbeare</hi> his children; <hi>viz.</hi> his own lust and <hi>vaine desire</hi>; and all whatsoever doth hang or depend thereon; but dayly and hourely cast them out by the understanding, out of the true Temple of Christ; <hi>viz.</hi> out of Gods free gift, and <hi>crucifie</hi> the old <hi>Adam</hi>; else if it be not thus effected the old selfe-willed <hi>Adam</hi> crucifyeth Christ in him, and so Christ indeed must hang on the Cross; and be putt to death.</p>
                              <p n="22">22. And this figure also Concerning Abraham's casting out his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall children, doth signifie, that, when Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the true <hi>Isaac</hi> came into the flesh, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>humanity,</hi> Abrahams naturall children, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jewes,</hi> should, under the kingdome of Christ, be cast out from the naturall goods, <hi>viz.</hi> from all <hi>Dominion,</hi> from Countrey and Kingdome; and their Rule and Dominion should <hi>cease</hi>; for the Dominion belongs onely unto Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Christendom</hi>; for Christ brought an Eternall Kingdome with him: the goods were <hi>all</hi> his; as <hi>Abrahams</hi> goods belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>Isaac.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="23">23. And although it hath not dominion over all, as <hi>Isaac</hi> had posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and rule of <hi>that onely</hi> which his father left him; for the naturall children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> born of <hi>Kethura,</hi> became afterwards heathen, and ruled over the outward goods as children of the outward nature: yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, who were in the Covenant under <hi>Circumcision,</hi> must when Christ did manifest himselfe, be cast out, to signifie, that the earthly man also, <hi>viz.</hi> Selfe in the <hi>Serpents Ens</hi> which is on the children of the Covenant, must be cast away from God.</p>
                              <p n="24">24. Thus in <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Son <hi>Isaac</hi> the figure of the Kingdome of Christ was represented: but when Christ came into the flesh; God <hi>putt away</hi> the figure; and took from the <hi>externall</hi> children of <hi>Isaac</hi> the <hi>outward</hi> goods of the Land <hi>Canaan</hi>; to intimate, that now the holy Land of Canaan is become manifest, where <hi>Isaac's</hi> children shall take possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the true promised inheritance in Christ, and no longer have the <hi>figure onely,</hi> but the Essence of the figure, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>perfect substance,</hi> and now forsake the outward goods with the figure, and putt on Christ in the flesh.</p>
                              <p n="25">25. But that the <hi>Jewes,</hi> viz. <hi>Isaac's</hi> and <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, <hi>viz.</hi> the children in Christs figure, did not all turn unto Christ, when he did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest himselfe in the flesh, hath this meaning; God gave them <hi>the law of nature</hi>; where, in the law, the Government of nature was understood externally, and internally Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant, and the promised free gift of God in Paradise; so that the law of nature was to be Christs <hi>Sojourner,</hi> and the true man also was to live <hi>under the law</hi> of nature in a <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <p n="26">26. Understand, that the <hi>nature of man</hi> shall remain, for it is not so rejected of God, as if clean another new man should <hi>arise</hi> out of the old; but the (new man) shall arise out of <hi>Adam's</hi> nature, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and out of Gods, in Christs, nature and property; so that man is become an Adam-Christ, and Christ, a Christ-Adam; a Man-God, and a God-Man; and therefore the figure <hi>continued still</hi> among the Jewes;
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:29914:186"/>
and for this cause they were <hi>not all</hi> converted to Christ; that so nature might <hi>keep</hi> its figure, and due right; for it shall deliver up its children under the <hi>Law,</hi> viz. the <hi>figure</hi> of Christ, to God the Father, in Christ, but its figure shall be <hi>proved</hi> in the fire of God, so that it shall be known, who hath been the <hi>true</hi> child of the naturall <hi>Law</hi> in the figure of Christ, that hath been born in the <hi>spirit</hi> in the law out of the figure of Christ, and who hath <hi>not.</hi>

                              <p n="28">28. For it doth not onely depend on mans <hi>knowing,</hi> that Christ hath given himselfe into the law, and is become the fullfilling in the law, as the <hi>Titular Christian</hi> boasteth; but it depends on Gods <note n="*" place="margin">
                                    <hi>Ordinance.</hi>
                                 </note> Order, on the mercy of God; whosoever hath been a <hi>true</hi> Jew, and hath put on <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams faith</hi> in the law, he hath putt on the <hi>Ens</hi> of Christ, which <hi>Abraham</hi> conceived or apprehended, which <hi>Ens</hi> of faith, the humanity of Christ hath fullfilled; and it is <hi>hidden</hi> to him what it is, for he worketh in the office of nature in the <hi>law</hi> of God, which Christ hath taken into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and fullfilled; so that he serveth God in the office of nature, and the <hi>Office of nature</hi> serveth Christ, for it is become Christs own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</p>
                              <p n="29">29. For <hi>unto him all power is given both in heaven and on earth</hi> (Matth. 28.) under which power, the office of nature also is, in the law; for God, in the <hi>spirit</hi> of Christ, is Even the selfe same who <hi>gave</hi> the law and the office of nature to do <hi>Righteousness,</hi> together with the figure of the kingdome of Christ, with the Ens of faith, to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi>; and <hi>he</hi> is also the very same who fullfilled the Faith, and the law.</p>
                              <p n="30">30. Thus the Jew worketh in his faith in Christs office, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> wherewith Christ governeth in nature; and hath putt on Christ in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and in the Ens of faith in Christs figure, which Christ hath fullfied.</p>
                              <p n="31">31. For the Christian who confesseth Christ in the flesh, worketh in his <hi>Faith</hi> in the flesh of Christ, and hath the <hi>Law</hi> of nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods officer, to do uprightly, in his faith; for Christ ruleth in the Law of God, which he hath fullfilled and made a Servant, in his children, and <hi>killeth</hi> the law of <hi>Sin</hi> through the fullfilling of his Love in his <hi>bloud and death,</hi> both in them who live in the dominion of <hi>his Law,</hi> and also in them who live in the dominion of <hi>his Conquest,</hi> as the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do.</p>
                              <p n="32">32. For the faith which presseth or cometh in unto God in the law, in the figure, in the Covenant, the same cometh unto God in the <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, out of which, Christ was born; and he that cometh in unto God in the <hi>fullfilling</hi> of the same, doth come or press in to God in the <hi>humanity</hi> of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> in the whole process of his suffering, death, and resurrection.</p>
                              <p n="33">33. A Christian is Christ in the <hi>inward</hi> humanity, and a Jew is Christ in the <hi>figure,</hi> and in the office of his law, <hi>viz.</hi> according to nature: but

                                 <hi>There is no respect of persons before God; for as many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law, and they who have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the Law; for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified; for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the law are a law unto themselves, which shew that the work of the law is written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness to them, and their thoughts within themselves either accusing or excusing each other</hi>; That is, or signifieth, thus much.</p>
                              <p n="35">35. When the <hi>Gentiles</hi> do apprehend Christ, then they do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>Law</hi> of nature to do uprightly, for Christ is the beginning and the fullfilling of the law; but the <hi>Jewes</hi> have the <hi>law</hi>; now who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever transgresseth, and sinneth, either the Jew in the law of nature, or the Gentile who acknowledgeth Christ in the law of the fullfilling each shall be punished or judged in <hi>his law</hi>; viz. the Jew in the law of God the Father in Christ, and the Christian in the law of the <hi>Gospel, viz.</hi> in the law of the Accomplishment.</p>
                              <p n="36">36. For here is no respect of name, in that one saith, I am a Jew, the other I am a Christian, the <hi>name</hi> maketh <hi>no difference</hi> in the Adoption of God, but the spirit in the <hi>heart</hi> to do uprightly, to obey God; they all come in the <hi>Grace</hi> under the obedience of Christ unto God; both <hi>the Jew and Christian.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="37">37. For without Christ there is neither law nor Gospel, Christ is the Righteousness which availeth before God in the law, so that man, without Christ, hath no God; now let him run either in the Law or Gospel, if he runneth in the <hi>desire to obey God,</hi> then he runneth in the law of the Accomplishment; for Christ is the onely obedience which avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth before God, both in the law and Gospel; all men who give up themselves in obedience unto God, they are received in <hi>Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> viz. in the fullfilling of the obedience, the Jew and the Christian, and so likewise the <hi>heathen</hi> who hath neither the law nor Gospel.</p>
                              <p n="38">38. For if the Gentile <hi>desire</hi> to obey the onely God, and yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him not according to the essence of his manifestation; but presseth in to the obedience of God, then he is <hi>a law unto himselfe</hi>; and declareth indeed that <hi>God hath written his law in him,</hi> which he hath fullfilled in his Son, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith; for he who knoweth the law and Gospell, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same onely as a Gift of the Giver, who hath <hi>given</hi> him the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but he that doth not know it, and yet <hi>desireth</hi> the power of the law and Gospel, in him, God in Christ, knowes, what he pleaseth.</p>
                              <p n="39">39. For Grace doth not onely lye in <hi>knowing,</hi> that one knoweth the Grace in Christ, but it lyeth in the pressing into that Grace, and in the mercy of God. <hi>One</hi> presseth in to mercy in the law, the <hi>other</hi> in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and the <hi>third</hi> without the law, and without the knowledge of the Gospel; he that hath neither, but hangs on the Grace of God, the same is freely given <hi>without</hi> his knowledge of it.</p>

                              <p n="41">41.

                              <p n="48">48. Your judging one another is onely the hurt and <hi>wound</hi> of the world, wherewith yee make the ignorant to Erre, and bring them to <hi>blaspheam,</hi> yee teach them the art of censuring and condemning, and yee your selves have <hi>not</hi> the true knowledge in the <hi>spirit</hi> of God, yee do not teach your selves, and yet yee will be teaching, and judging others; and in this way and course yee are all, one with another, the disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted children of <hi>Kethura</hi>; yee contend, bite and devour one another about <hi>Abrahams,</hi> viz.

the <hi>figure</hi> of the life's form, shewing, how the humane nature and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath dwelt by the well-spring of the <hi>divine Ens</hi> in the Covenant, which <hi>Abraham</hi> layd hold of in faith; <hi>viz.</hi> the Soul of <hi>Isaac</hi> dwelt by the <hi>wellspring</hi> of the holy Trinity, in which the Soul received its light, and <hi>saw,</hi> and knew the will of God, out of which wellspring the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est love of the Deity did manifest it selfe to the Soul; and out of which fountain, afterwards, <hi>in the fullness of time</hi> the holy Name <hi>Jesus</hi> out of <hi>Jehova</hi> did manifest it selfe and espoused it selfe for a Bride unto the Soul.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The soul of <hi>Isaac</hi> dwelt by this fountain of the living and Seing, untill the same fountain <hi>afterwards</hi> did powre forth, and open it selfe in the <hi>humanity</hi> of Christ in the Soul; and then afterwards the Soul dwelt in the fountain, when it was <hi>exalted</hi> in Christs person to the right hand of God; and then the fountain of God did spring forth through the soul, where then it received the <hi>divine might</hi> as a Prince of God, or as an Image or express likeness of God, or as a formed word of the voice of God, through which voice God was made known and manifest.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. So likewise our Soul when it forsaketh the earthly will of its as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed Selfe, and apprehendeth the <hi>Ens</hi> of Christ in the Covenant, and <hi>turnes</hi> it selfe to God, then it dwelleth also by the fountain of the living and Seing, that is, by <hi>Gods Eye,</hi> which he hath again with Christ mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested and opened in the humanity: indeed our soul doth <hi>not</hi> in this time of the earthly cottage dwell in the wellspring of God, as if it did apprehend the well-spring <hi>in Selfe,</hi> but like as the Sun through-shineth the Glass, and yet the Glasse is not turned to be Sun, but it dwelleth by the Lustre, and vertue of the Sun, and suffereth the Sun to worke and shine through it; even so is the soul in this time.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And further yet, As the Sun doth give its Tincture into the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Ens,</hi> and the Metalline <hi>Ens</hi> giveth its desire into the Suns Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, so that out of them both the fair and pretious Gold is generated, so likewise it is to be understood concerning the Soul and the <hi>fountain</hi> of God; the Deity <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>dwelleth through the soul.</hi>
                              </note> inhabiteth the Soul, but the soul comprehends not the same as to its <hi>creaturall</hi> power; but the Eye or light of God with the holy Love-tincture from the lights lustre, giveth it selfe into the desire of the Soul.</p>

                              </note>5. For the desire of the Soul is the <hi>Fiat,</hi> which takes the power of the holy Love-tincture into it selfe, and makes it <hi>essentiall</hi>; so that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine tincture proceeding from the desire of the true Love-spring (<hi>viz.</hi> from the fountain of the living and Seing) and the soules beleeving de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, do become <hi>one</hi> Essence.</p>
                           <p n="6">6.

                           <p n="7">7. The Soul is not changed into the Deity, <hi>viz.</hi> into <hi>Lahai-roi,</hi> the fountain of the living and Seeing, for it is the Eternall and Temporall natures; but the Deity is not natures, but <hi>the will</hi> to nature, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth it selfe <hi>through</hi> the Soules nature, as the fire manifesteth it selfe
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:29914:189"/>
through the Iron, where then the Iron seems as if it were meer fire, and yet it keepeth its own nature, and the fire also its own, and the one doth onely <hi>dwell</hi> in the other, and one is the manifestation of the other. The Iron hath no power over the fire, onely the fire giveth it selfe to the Iron, and the Iron giveth its Ens to the fire, and so <hi>both</hi> are changed in to <hi>one,</hi> and yet remain two Essences, so likewise it is to be understood with the Soul and the Deity.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. And as the fiery property is different from the gross Iron, and hath another Source: so likewise the new <hi>spirituall</hi> humanity in the Ens of Christ in the divine Love-fire is far another essence then the <hi>earthly</hi> body, albeit the Soul is understood in the fire, and in the lights lustre the body of <hi>Sophia,</hi> for the power or vertue of the light is the tincture or the beginning to the new spirituall body; which power, the Soules beleeving desire, taketh, and formeth or bringeth it into an <hi>Essence:</hi> that is, it makes it essentiall: it becomes an essence or spirituall body from the desire, which spirituall essence is the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> of which the Scripture speaketh.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. But our <hi>Babylon</hi> will understand nothing hereof, but will be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blind therein; for shee will not know how Christ is born in the faith <hi>in us,</hi> and how faith comes to essence, but she will downright make the <hi>halfe-Serpent</hi> man to be an assumed and adopted child of Grace, and set it in Gods Temple: but it avails not; shall the Devill sit at the right hand of God in the fountain of the living and Seing, he hath been once cast away from thence, he shall not any more possesse the same: a Beast is not <hi>Sophia</hi>; the Scripture saith; <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <hi>Ye must be converted, and be born anew as children, else yee shall not see God.</hi>

                           <p n="10">10. The Soul cannot see God save onely in its new-born Image, onely through and in virgin <hi>Sophia</hi> in <hi>Jacobs</hi>-Star, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Name of <hi>Jesus</hi> it Seeth in <hi>Jehova</hi> in the wellspring of the life of God; it is not its selfe this very fountain, it giveth onely the fire to the manifestation of this fountain: but the fountain is understood in the light, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>meekness</hi> of the light.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. Now the soules <hi>magick fire</hi>-source could not so be enkindled that a shining lustre of a light might arise in the Soules fire, if the divine Love-desire, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Love-Ens,</hi> had <hi>not</hi> given it selfe into the Soules fire; the Ens of Christ out of the divine Love, giveth it selfe into the Soules fire-Source, which the soules fire <hi>eateth</hi> into its fiery Essence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the life of the wrathfullness <hi>dyeth,</hi> and the fair pretious light is thence generated; for here <hi>Christ ariseth</hi> out of the consuming fire of the Fathers property, according to his anger, <hi>from death,</hi> out of the fire of another life: here the magicall Soules fire becomes the pretious <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia's Bridegroom,</hi> and here are man and wife; <hi>viz.</hi> both Tinctures of the fire and of the light become one person, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>Angel</hi> of God.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Here Lucifer looseth his throne, and the Serpent his viprous Seed, and <hi>Christ sitteth at the right hand of God</hi> in man; and man then dwelleth truly by the fountain of the living and seing; and this is that which the spirit of <hi>Moses</hi> setts forth by this figure concerning <hi>Isaacs</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, if we would but once become Seing, and forsake the meer husk, and know our <hi>selves</hi> aright, not according to the earthly Beast, but according to the inward spirituall heavenly Man.</p>

                              <p n="9">9.

                              <p n="22">22. <hi>Abraham</hi> was the <hi>field,</hi> into which God sowed his <hi>Corn, Ismael</hi> was the <hi>Root,</hi> viz. the first birth: <hi>Isaac</hi> was the <hi>fruit,</hi> which grew from the seed of God, understand out of the <hi>Ens</hi> of Grace; and <hi>Ismael</hi> grew from the <hi>Ens</hi> of nature out of the Fathers property: for the <hi>Ens</hi> of Grace had given it selfe into the <hi>Ens</hi> of nature; now each did set forth its own figure; with <hi>Ismael,</hi> the kingdome of <hi>nature,</hi> and with <hi>Isaac</hi> the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Grace</hi> was represented: <hi>Isaac</hi> was the twigg which sprung up out of the field of faith; <hi>viz.</hi> in the line of Christ; and from him came <hi>Jacob</hi>; viz. the <hi>Branch</hi> forth-spreading and displaying it selfe into a tree with many boughes and branches.</p>
                              <p n="23">23. <hi>Not</hi> that we are to understand that <hi>Jacob</hi> did <hi>onely</hi> grow and spring forth out of the kingdome of Grace; for, the kingdome of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which Ismael and Esau stood, was also his Ground as to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the <hi>Ens</hi> of Faith, had given it selfe thereinto, and Tinctured nature; and advanced its power, <hi>viz.</hi> the line of the Covenant of God, in nature.</p>

                              <p n="26">26. This (I) brought it selfe of Grace again into the divided <hi>rent</hi> and torn properties of the Adamicall humane Tree; and sprang forth through, and with the Adamicall Tree; and <hi>hence</hi> he had his name <hi>Israel:</hi> being, as, a great number and power of such branches, all which do spring and grow forth in the new Tincture; in which also the <hi>Ens</hi> of the corrupt nature grew up all along; even as the Sunnes and the earths power, doe work and grow together, in the <hi>fruit</hi> of the Tree, and are alwayes in contest one with another, untill the fruit be <hi>ripe</hi>; and a <hi>new</hi> kernell for another fruit be produced and also ripe, and then the tree leaveth the fruit, and sowes the <hi>new kernell</hi> for another young Tree.</p>

                                 <hi>Gen.</hi> XXVII.</note> it hath a twofold conjecture upon the same; one is, as if <hi>Rebecca</hi> onely loved <hi>Jacob</hi> more then <hi>Esau,</hi> and therefore brought him by <hi>craft</hi> to obtain the blessing of his father; and again it conceives, that indeed it was from the appointment and providence of God, because <hi>Esau</hi> was not worthy of the blessing, and therefore it will take upon it <hi>wholly</hi> to condem <hi>Esau,</hi> whereupon also it hath set the <hi>Predestination</hi>; and yet it understands nothing at all of this wonderfull figure.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Now if we would rightly understand and interpret this figure; then we must set here in the figure the Patriarch <hi>Isaac,</hi> in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers stead, who <hi>alone</hi> can bless, who also blessed <hi>Isaac</hi> in <hi>Abrahams seed,</hi> that Isaac should again bless his Seed in the Covenants Line.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And <hi>Esau</hi> was set in the place of the depraved nature, <hi>viz.</hi> in the kingdome of the <hi>corrupt</hi> nature, in mans property, apprehended in the Anger of God.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And <hi>Jacob</hi> we set in the new-birth, in the <hi>humanity</hi> of Christ, which God the Father blessed in <hi>stead</hi> of the depraved <hi>Adam,</hi> when he brought forth a new Generation out of our humanity in this Line.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. And we see here how <hi>Adam</hi> hath fooled away, and lost the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and <hi>divine Vnction,</hi> and how he was rejected in the Earthly Image, from God; and how he hath lost his <hi>Right</hi> of the divine Unction, as here <hi>Esau,</hi> the first birth, and also the blessing.</p>
                           <div type="section">
                              <head>The inward spirituall figure stands thus.</head>
                              <p n="6">6. <hi>Isaac was old, and expected to dye,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.1. to the 4.</note> 
                                 <hi>and called Esau his first-born Son that he might bless him with the blessing of Abraham, and bad him go take some Venison, and dress it for him,</hi> that he might eat gladly thereof, that his soul might be refreshed, and the blessing of the Lord might put forth it selfe in him, <hi>that he might bless Esau,</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> went and did as his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have him, that so he might be blessed; this, in the inward understanding in the figure, is thus.</p>
                              <p n="7">7. When <hi>Isaac</hi> was ready to dye, the Blessing in God the Fathers property, moved it selfe in him, and would bless the <hi>naturall Seed</hi> of the Adamicall nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the kingdome of nature in <hi>Esau:</hi> for <hi>Isaac</hi> longed after venison, <hi>viz.</hi> after the kingdome of <hi>nature</hi> in the beastiall property; <hi>viz.</hi> after the depraved Adamicall man, as to the first creation.</p>
                              <p n="8">8. For the Fathers blessing would cast it selfe upon <hi>Adam,</hi> in whose stead Esau stood, but the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> was <hi>extinct</hi> in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore the naturall man might not be helped and remedied <hi>onely</hi> with a blessing; but there must be another Serious Earnestness; the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:29914:200"/>
Blessing must become a <hi>Substance,</hi> viz. Man, in the kingdome of nature; of which [substantiall blessing] the kingdome of nature was <hi>not</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in its <hi>own</hi> power, and might, as here <hi>Esau</hi> in his kingdome of nature was not capable of the Fathers Blessing.</p>
                              <p n="9">9. For the kingdome of mans nature was so poysoned that it must be <hi>dissolved</hi>; therefore the Blessing of God the Father turned it selfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>womans</hi> Tincture, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the Adamicall female Tincture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the lights Tincture: for the fiery Tincture in Adam was awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened in the <hi>wrath,</hi> viz. in the kingdome of darkness, and was made an Earthly Image, and herein the heavenly was swallowed up and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: Now the Blessing would come to <hi>help</hi> this heavenly disappeared Image, that so it might be quickned again in the blessing; and so the kingdome of nature with which it was incorporated should be blessed, Tinctured, and <hi>Regenerated.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="10">10. Being then two lines went forth in <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and <hi>Isaacs</hi> Seed; <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Ismael,</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> the right depraved Adamicall Image, and in <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> the Line of the Covenant in the <hi>Free</hi> given <hi>Grace</hi>; the Blessing of God the Father which was manifested in Isaac, turned it selfe upon Jacob, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the line of Christ whom God hath anointed, that he should <hi>again anoint</hi> the first-born <hi>Esau,</hi> viz. the first Adamicall depraved man; for the first <hi>Adam</hi> had lost his first birth given him out of the divine Word in the creation, and could not any more be blessed out of <hi>his Centre.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="11">11. For the Soules will was broken off from the Eternall word of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine holiness, and had given it selfe into the Centre of the first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>wrath</hi> of the Eternall nature, into the SeVeration of the speaking word, <hi>viz.</hi> into the opposition, and contentious Contrariety; whence also, Isaac blessed Esau with the word of <hi>Strife,</hi> when he said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in the blessing; <hi>Thou shalt live by thy sword, and break thy brothers yoke from off thy neck</hi>; signifying, that now the depraved nature in him was become a Servant of Gods <hi>Anger,</hi> and should now beare and manage the <hi>Combate</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> had raised up in the life's properties, and be a Servant of the same.</p>
                              <p n="12">12. But that <hi>Isaac</hi> did <hi>not</hi> understand this thing, and <hi>would</hi> have bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Esau with the blessing of the Covenant, and given him the Scepter in <hi>Zion</hi>; doth shew unto us, that <hi>Isaac,</hi> and all the holy children of God, <hi>although</hi> they be born again of the New-birth in the line of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, do not apprehend and understand the <hi>internall ground</hi> of their Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, wherein the kingdome of God worketh and is in power, so as to be able to do any thing thereby in <hi>Selfe</hi>-will; but God turneth this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ground of the place of God, as he pleaseth; and the Soul must see to what he doth; as here Isaac must see to what the Lord had bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by him.</p>
                              <p n="13">

                                    <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.4.</note>13. For Isaac said to Esau; <hi>That he should make him ready Savory meat such as he loved to eat; and then his Soul would bless him:</hi> but now this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing stood in the Line of the Covenant, in which, Christ should spring forth; not in the <hi>Soules</hi> might, but in Gods might; for the soul of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and of all the children of <hi>Adam</hi> were as yet with the Soules root, on the band of Gods Anger, which Anger, this internall incorporated Line of <hi>Grace,</hi> should destroy in Christs death, and wholly incorporate and unite it into the Line of the Covenant.</p>
                              <p n="14">
                                 <pb n="393" facs="tcp:29914:200"/>14. Therefore the Soules will in <hi>Isaac</hi> should not propagate the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of this Covenants line; and give it to the kingdome of the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>soules.</hi>
                                 </note> 
                                 <hi>Soul-like</hi> nature, <hi>viz.</hi> to the first-born Esau, and first Adam; for the soul was a <hi>cause</hi> of the destruction: the fires-tincture received not the might and strength of the <hi>new</hi> vertue, for its might should be broken; <hi>viz.</hi> its proud Lucifer, who likewise is the very same; but the lights tincture, which disappeared in <hi>Adam,</hi> when the fires might introduced dark earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereinto, which Tincture <hi>sprang</hi> forth again afresh in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants line in the power of the in-spoken and promised, incorporated word of Grace, the same had the might and power of the Blessing.</p>
                              <p n="15">15. The seed of the woman, <hi>viz.</hi> the lights tincture and vertue, should bruise the head of the fiery Serpent, and change the soules fiery might into a <hi>meek</hi> Love: fire, the fiery Soules will, shall and must be wholly transmuted and turned into meekness.</p>
                              <p n="16">16. As this disappeared lights tincture was brought from <hi>Adam</hi> into the woman, <hi>viz.</hi> in to <hi>Eve,</hi> which when it was in <hi>Adam</hi> was his fair Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disicall Rose garden of peculiar Love, wherein <hi>God</hi> was manifest; and being now the figure of the new birth was represented in Isaacs <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>; therefore also his wife; <hi>viz.</hi> the blessed <hi>Rebecca</hi> must come, as one, who also stood in the Line of the Covenant; and set forth the right figure of Christ, viz. <hi>Jacob</hi> in the place of the blessing; to signifie, that Christ should be manifested in this Covenants Line in the Seed of the <hi>woman,</hi> viz. in the lights and fires-Tincture, and assume the soules na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the power of the light, that so he might <hi>rule</hi> over the fiery nature of the soul, and change the same into the power of the light.</p>
                              <p n="17">17. Now <hi>Rebecca</hi> Isaacs wife was here in this place a figure of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who brought forth Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the blessed of God, who should bless <hi>Esau,</hi> and all the Adamicall children; and it was so ordered by the Lord, that <hi>Rebecca</hi> should so carry it, for she understood, that the blessing, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>scepter</hi> of Israel did rest in Jacob.</p>
                              <p n="18">18. For being the scepter in Zion lay in the seed of the woman, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>virginity</hi>; the same scepter was here also stirred in the seed of the woman; so that a woman must bring forth the Covenants line to the place of God, the Fathers blessing, which was in <hi>Isaac</hi>; and the mans will, <hi>viz.</hi> the Souls naturall fire-will, must come <hi>behinde,</hi> and be a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Gods wonders, and see what God hath don with him.</p>
                              <p n="19">19. But that it appeareth to be <hi>as</hi> a deceit or cunning Suttlety, in that <hi>Rebecca</hi> did so instruct, and <hi>put on</hi> Jacob to take away the blessing from <hi>Esau,</hi> as if shee Loved Jacob far above Esau, therein Reason hath <hi>blind</hi> eyes; for through the Devills cunning the curse came into the world, and through the divine cunning in the Love, the destruction of death and hell, came again into the Soul: the <hi>divine</hi> cunning killed the <hi>Devills</hi> cunning.</p>
                              <p n="20">20. Understand it aright; all cunning ariseth from the <hi>lubet</hi> or desire; the Devills cunning arose from the false lubet or lust: so likewise Gods <hi>lubet</hi> came again into the womans seed, (into which heavenly <hi>matrix,</hi> the Devill had <hi>insinuated</hi> his lust) and destroyed the devills lust.</p>
                              <p n="21">21. It was of God that <hi>Jacob</hi> obtained the blessing, wholly <hi>contrary</hi> to the minde and will of Reason; for he stood in the figure of Christ, and <hi>Esau</hi> stood in the figure of the depraved <hi>Adam.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="22">
                                 <pb n="394" facs="tcp:29914:201"/>22. Therefore <hi>Esau</hi> was an <hi>hairy</hi> or rugged man, signifying the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous beastiall property, which had awaked in the <hi>Fall,</hi> through lust. Now when <hi>Adams</hi> lust had brought it selfe to substance, then the flesh became gross and <hi>beastiall</hi>; Thus the beastiall part swallowed up the <hi>heavenly</hi> in it selfe, and death was manifested in the flesh, and we see here in this figure very clearly typified how it should be.</p>
                              <p n="23">23. <hi>Isaac</hi> would bless the beastiall man in <hi>Esau,</hi> this God would not: the divine blessing belonged to Christ; but the depraved <hi>Adam</hi> could <hi>not</hi> be <hi>capable</hi> of receiving the blessing of God, unless Christ take this rugged beastiall skin [or form] which <hi>Adam</hi> had put on, as here <hi>Jacob</hi> could not be blessed unlesse he had on him the hairy Beast-like skin.</p>
                              <p n="24">24. God the Father set before him our misery in his Covenant in Christ in our humanity which he assumed; for Christ must enter into our humanity,<note place="margin">

                                 </note> and walk in our <hi>hairy form,</hi> and destroy our death of the beastiall property; as it is written; <note n="*" place="margin">

                                 <hi>He took on him our sickness; and laid on himselfe our Grief.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="25">25. For as <hi>Isaac</hi> took hold of his son <hi>Jacob</hi> in his hairy skin, and <hi>felt whether he was his first-born Son</hi> to whom the blessing belonged, so God the Father reached into the <hi>Essence</hi> of his Son Christ, and felt whether the humanity of Christ were the <hi>first Image</hi> created in <hi>Adam</hi>; <note n="*" place="margin">Note <hi>the cause of the Bloudy-sweat.</hi>
                                 </note> whence the Agony seised on him in the <hi>Mount of Olivet, that he sweat bloody sweat,</hi> of which <hi>Esaias</hi> speaketh plainly; <hi>He took on him our grief.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="26">26. And as <hi>Isaac found outwardly onely Esaus skin</hi> on <hi>Jacob, and</hi> inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>heard Jacobs voice,</hi> and yet blessed him in stead of <hi>Esau,</hi> as if he were <hi>Esau</hi>; so likewise God the Father found <hi>our rugged</hi> humane property on Christ; and yet inwardly he heard, that the voice of God sounded in him; that the divine heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> was within under his assumed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; therefore also his voice did in his Baptisme in <hi>Jordan</hi> rest upon him, when he blessed our humanity, in that he said, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear yee him.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="27">27. So likewise Isaac heard indeed the voice of Jacob under the hairy skin, and understood that it <hi>was not</hi> Esau; but the spirit in his blessing did yet forcibly passe upon him; for he proved in him the incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ground of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the Line of the new humanity; for he said; <note n="*" place="margin">
                                    <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.22.</note> 
                                 <hi>The voice is Jacobs voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau</hi>; in which the spirit intimates, that in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the children of God in flesh and bloud, there is even the first depraved beastiall Adamicall man, with his <hi>hairy skin,</hi> which God doth not look upon, but only the divine voice, which is one spirit with God, doth <hi>inhabit</hi> in the inward Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish-Man.</p>
                              <p n="28">28. And then we see in this figure, that our beasts skin in flesh and bloud, wherewith we do so pride our selves, and make <hi>devout shewes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, is onely a deceit; as <hi>Jacob</hi> in this beasts hide stood as a <hi>deceiver</hi> before his father, and would blinde his father with the beasts skin; so likewise the earthly man cometh in his beastiall property before God, and desireth Gods blessing; but he may <hi>not obtain</hi> it unless he hath <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs,</hi> viz. Christs voice in him, under this beasts skin.</p>
                              <p n="29">29. For, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was smooth, and pure, under this beasts skin, so must we be smooth, pure, and <hi>holy,</hi> in our inward ground <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:29914:201"/>
us; for we see very well in this figure, that the blessing would <hi>not rest</hi> upon <hi>Esau,</hi> who had by nature a rugged hairy beasts skin in his essence, although he was the first-born to whom the blessing belonged by right of Inheritance; for, the <hi>first</hi> Man was become depraved in his nature, and had lost the inheritance of God, the blessing, and the filial inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, resteth onely upon the <hi>Second</hi> new <hi>Adam.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="30">30. Further this figure denotes, that the new man in Christ should take away the scepter and might from the <hi>Devill,</hi> and also from the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and in this blessing, rule over him, in power, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was made Lord over his Enemies: this figure points wholly at <hi>Christ.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="31">31. For as <hi>Jacob</hi> took a strange form on him, and came in <hi>strange</hi> attire before his father, and desired the blessing of him, and also obtained it; so Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eternall word took on him also a <hi>strange</hi> form, <hi>viz.</hi> our humanity and brought the same before his father to bless it.</p>
                              <p n="32">32. And as <note n="*" place="margin">

                                 <hi>Isaac blessed his Son Jacob, with the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth; with Corn and wine:</hi> even so God the Father blessed our humanity, in Christ; for our humanity was also in its originall out of the <hi>limus</hi> of the Earth, and was nourished, and brought up by the dew of heaven, even by corn and wine; this, God blessed to the new birth and <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the dead upon the life to come.</p>
                              <p n="33">33. And as <hi>Isaac</hi> set <hi>Jacob</hi> to <note n="*" place="margin">

                                 <hi>That whosoever should curse Jacob he should be accursed, and whosoever should bless him he should also be blessed</hi>; so God hath set the curse upon the corrupt Adamicall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that whosoever should not be found in the blessing of Christ, he must be Eternally in the curse of God, but whosoever should bring his minde and will into this <hi>Jacobs,</hi> viz. <hi>Christs</hi> blessing, he should be for Ever in the blessing.</p>

                                 <hi>when Isaac had blessed Jacob, then came Esau with his venison, and his father Isaac</hi> was astonished and <hi>said,</hi> why? <hi>who art thou? and he was dismayed at it,</hi> that he had unknowingly blessed <hi>Jacob:</hi> which typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, how that the Adamicall man understands nothing at all of Gods wayes; and how God doth oftentimes wonderfully <hi>leade</hi> him according to the inward ground, and that although he be carried on in the way of God, yet he looketh much at the outward Reason, and often <hi>stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth</hi> at externall Rationall things, at Temporall orders and goods, and suffereth <hi>fear</hi> to surprize him; and would fain that the will of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be done; as here Isaac <hi>trembled</hi> exceedingly when he saw that the will of his reason was broken.</p>

Furthermore, it denotes, that the corrupt Adamicall nature in <hi>Esau</hi> and all men, <hi>cannot</hi> receive the blessing, unless they first <hi>dye</hi> unto their own selfe-Right and will: as <hi>Esau</hi> could not be blessed of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the holy blessing; for he was the type of the corrupt <hi>Adam</hi> according to the kingdome of nature; so likewise the <hi>earthly nature</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be capable of the holy Spirit in its Essence; of which Christ <hi>John</hi> 6 Chap. said; * <hi>Flesh and bloud shall not inheritt the kingdome of God; unless it</hi> fals into the earth, and <hi>enter again into its first wombe,</hi> as Grain that is sown, and resigne its nature to the first mother.</p>
                              <p n="40">40. And then we see here how <hi>Isaac</hi> giveth his Son <hi>Esau</hi> a temporall blessing, and intimates to him, that the naturall man is lead by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world: for to <hi>Jacob</hi> he said; <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <p n="41">41.

                              <p n="42">42. For <hi>Isaac</hi> doth not say, Live thou by thy sword, but <hi>thou wilt</hi> do it, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods wrath in the kingdome of the corrupt nature with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills will, will move thee thereunto; that thou wilt draw the fatness of the earth unto thy selfe, and <hi>wilt</hi> be ruled and driven by the Stars above, and wilt in thy naturall power <hi>drive</hi> away from thee the children of God, who rule in Gods power; that is, when the holy Spirit in Gods children doth Reprove them by reason of their <hi>Tyranny,</hi> they then kill and slay them, and tear the sword of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> from off their Neck, as here <hi>Isaac</hi> said thou wilt do it.</p>
                              <p n="43">43. As indeed <hi>Esau</hi> soon did, and would have killed <hi>Jacob,</hi> so that <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in Gods blessing was fain to <hi>slie from him</hi>; and here he pulled off the yoke of the holy Spirit from his neck; and this prophecy of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch is a figure, how the Esauites, and <hi>Tyrants,</hi> viz. the <hi>fleshly</hi> brethren of the Christians would dwell among the Christians; and be born as to their naturall brotherhood of the <hi>same Parents</hi>; as Esau, and Jacob; and yet they would persecute them with sword, and torments; and thrust them away, and yet stand themselves as if they were the <hi>onely</hi> true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:29914:202"/>
and desire the blessing of God, as <hi>Esau</hi> stood and <hi>wept bitterly</hi> for the blessing, and he did not minde the kingdome of God, but that he might be a <hi>Lord</hi> upon the earth over his brethren and other men; and might have riches, and fullness of the Belly.</p>
                              <p n="44">44. This <hi>Esau</hi> in his blessing is a true type of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> who draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neer to God with the lips, and gives himselfe to an externall seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing service and worship of Christ; and sets himselfe forth as if he did it to God, and stands and makes mighty holy shewes in his hypocrisie and glistering <hi>verballities,</hi> setts forth himselfe with zeal and <hi>devotion,</hi> that so he might be honored of man; and that his God <hi>Mammon</hi> and <hi>Maozim</hi> may be fat, and doth even mourn and lament for malice, when men will <hi>not</hi> do that for him which he will have; when he cannot get enough of the Belly-blessing, according to the will of his God <hi>Maozim</hi>; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever doth but reprove or touch him, and speakes to him of the <hi>Blessing</hi> of God; him he will slay, and cannot endure a true Servant of Christ under him.</p>
                              <p n="45">45. <hi>Reason</hi> supposeth; that being <hi>Isaac</hi> said to <hi>Esau,</hi> Thou shalt live by thy sword; that God hath <hi>commanded</hi> him so to do, and here it props up [its murthering malice, and bloud-thirsty villany] but it is far <hi>otherwise</hi>; God wills <hi>not</hi> any warre; but the kingdome of nature in Gods Anger willeth it; and whosoever is born onely of the kingdome of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he liveth also to the same.</p>
                              <p n="46">46.

                                 <hi>Esau did deadly hate his brother Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob for the blessings sake,</hi> of which notwithstanding he was not capable as to the kingdome of nature, to signifie, that the <hi>true children</hi> of Christ should for this blessings sake, be hated, persecuted, and slain of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the kingdome of nature; and that because, the kingdome of Grace <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p n="2">2. And it further denotes, that the children of Christ, (after they have received the <hi>Vnction</hi> and Blessing, and the new birth begins to spring forth in them, in the blessing;) shall and must forth-with flee with their <hi>thoughts</hi> and minde from their father <hi>Adams</hi> house of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved nature; and it shews that the Devill and the world do soon <hi>hate</hi> them, and they must forthwith give themselves to the pilgrims-path of Christ, and live under the worlds <hi>slavish yoke,</hi> in misery, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; in disfavour and disrespect; for God brings them forth with their thoughts and minde out of their fathers house, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> in flesh, and bloud, so that they do nothing at all regard the <hi>pleasure</hi> of the world, and flee from it, as <hi>Jacob</hi> from his fathers house.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And then we see how wonderfully God guideth his children, and <hi>defends</hi> them from their Enemies, that the Devill in Gods Anger cannot kill them, unless it be Gods will; as he defended <hi>Jacob</hi> from the <hi>fury</hi> of <hi>Esau,</hi> and lead him away from him; and we have here an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent example on <hi>Jacob</hi>; in that he forsook his native home, also father and mother for this blessings sake, and loved <hi>God</hi> more then all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goods, and willingly left all to <hi>Esau</hi>; that so he might but be the blessed of God.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And we see, that when he had left the riches of the world in his fathers house, the Lord appeared to him with the Eternall goods, and shewed him <hi>a Ladder,</hi>

                              <hi>Ladder</hi> (as to his apprehension) <hi>was upon the earth, and the top of it reached into heaven; and thereon the Angels of God did ascend and descend</hi>; which signifyeth that Gods eternall word with the power of heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> with the <hi>Angelicall</hi> divine worlds <hi>Essence</hi> should descend

or immerse it selfe into our Essence, departed from God, and blind, as to God; and assume our humanity: and so unite the heaven with the world <hi>in</hi> man; that the humanity, through this entrance of the Deity into the humanity might have a Ladder unto <hi>God.</hi>

And this is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifyed here in that the Angels of God do ascend and descend on this ladder; also that the heaven in man should be againe <hi>opened</hi> through this entrance of the divine essence into the humanity, and that the children of God should have the Angels for <hi>companions</hi> in this world; which God shewed to <hi>Jacob,</hi> in that the Angels came up and down to him on this ladder.</p>

                           <p n="8">8.

                           <p n="9">9.

                              <p n="42">42.

                              <p n="43">43.

                              <p n="46">46. <hi>Therefore</hi> was Christ borne of a virgine, that he might sanctifie the Womans Tincture againe, and change it into the Mans Tincture, that the Man and the Woman might be <hi>One Image</hi> of God, againe, and no more Man and Woman, but Masculine Virgins, as Christ was.</p>

                              <p n="48">48.

This whole Chapter stands eminently in the figure of Christ: For, when the <hi>Word</hi> was become Man, and would now goe forth from this world and with our humanity possesse his <hi>Eternall</hi> Mansion, then meets him this host of Souldiers in the kingdome of Nature in the Anger of God.</p>

                              <p n="22">22.

                              <p n="26">26.

                              <p n="28">28. And as <hi>Jacob</hi> stood in the wrestling, and had his Thigh touched that he halted, then the Man sayd to him; <hi>Let mee goe; for the Day-breake dawneth; but he answered, I will not let thee goe except thou blesse mee.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="29">29. This is first the figure of Christ, when he <hi>yeelded</hi> himselfe up in the righteousnesse of God in the Fathers Anger, so that the Anger ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our humanity <hi>slew</hi> him; then sayd the righteousnesse: Now let mee goe; for at present, the <hi>Eternall Morning</hi> breaketh forth in mee; But Christ had taken hold of the righteousnesse and sayd; I will not let thee goe except thou blesse the <hi>humanity againe</hi>; that the Judgement may cease; except thou bring the Morning of thy inward power, forth through the humanity, that the Curse may <hi>cease,</hi> and that Man may wholly stand in the divine working againe, in the Blessing.</p>
                              <p n="30">30. Secondly, It is the faire Type or Image, shewing how it goeth with the Repentant Man, when he giveth himselfe up through earnest Repentance into this <hi>Combate</hi> of Christ; in Christs suffering and Death in his victory, and in the <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> wrestleth with Gods severe righteousnesse, which continually assayleth him in his <hi>Conscience.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="31">31. For, Gods righteousnesse in the Conscience sayth; let mee goe; <hi>thou art dead in sinne,</hi> and hast no part in the divine Grace; thou hast pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely and wilfully sinned, and set the Grace behinde thy back, now thou art <hi>mine,</hi> praying will not availe thee, I will not let thee in thy conscience attaine the Grace, thou wilt obtaine <hi>no comfort</hi> more from God, the morning will no more rise to thee in thy conscience, for thou art a childe of Death: Now leave off and let me alone, that I may shutt thee up below in the <hi>dungeon</hi> or chamber of death.</p>
                              <p n="32">32. When this comes to passe, then the poore soule wholly immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it selfe into the <hi>death of Christ,</hi> and giveth it selfe up to the severe righteousnesse of God, into the judgement, for the judgement layeth hold on it: But the soule catcheth hold of the incorporated <hi>Grace</hi> in the death of Christ, and diveth therewith into the most inward ground of the judgement of God, in which ground, God's Love is <hi>broken forth through</hi> the righteousnesse, and through the judgement, <hi>viz.</hi> through the eternall night, and hath made that same night in man to be day.</p>
                              <p n="33">33. Into this day, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Abysse</hi> without all humane possibility or ability, it diveth as a <hi>childe,</hi> that neither can nor will doe any more, that is too unworthy of all Grace, and must indeed give it self up to the judgement; but with <hi>this diving,</hi> the soule yeedeth all its utmost will and ability, and is in it selfe as it were void of nature and creature, and falls againe into the <hi>Word,</hi> wherein it stood in the eternall speaking, before its creaturely nature.</p>
                              <p n="34">34. For Gods righteousnesse and judgement, hath no deeper ground, then meerly the <hi>creaturely</hi> life; but when the will of the soule yeeldeth it selfe up in going forth from the creature, and sinketh into the Abysse, then is it again <hi>as a new childe</hi>; for the Abysse in the eternall speaking word, out of which the highest Love and Grace of God hath manifested it selfe, layeth hold on it, and penetrateth into it, as the Sun doth into the <hi>Ens</hi> of an hearb, whence the hearb becometh half Solar, or of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sun: Thus in this <hi>diving,</hi> the soule in its will, is <hi>half divine,</hi>
                                 <pb n="428" facs="tcp:29914:218"/>
and then it wrestleth with God's severe righteousnesse in flesh and bloud, and will <hi>over-power</hi> the Anger of God.</p>
                              <p n="35">35. Then saith God's righteousnesse in the conscience; let me alone, that is, leave off, and slay me not, for thou seest very well, that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> morning ariseth in mee, cease from <hi>striving</hi> against the judgement of God: But in the right combat the soule saith to God's righteousness, I will <hi>not</hi> leave thee except thou blesse mee, that is, except thou givest mee the <hi>promised Grace,</hi> out of the Death of Christ in his conquest, that I may put on my Saviour Christ, that he may be mine and I his: And then thus saith God's righteousnesse; as to <hi>Jacob</hi>; What is thy name? And then the poore soule nameth it selfe according to its <hi>owne creaturely</hi> name, As <hi>Jacob</hi> did heere, when he called himselfe <hi>Jacob:</hi> But as the Lord said to <hi>Jacob; Thou shalt no more be called Jacob, but Israel,</hi> that is, <hi>a Tree of life.</hi> Thus also saith God to the soule: Thou shalt no more have <hi>self</hi>-names in mee, but thou shalt be called a <hi>Christian</hi> in Christ, viz.

Thus we see that <hi>perdition</hi> cometh <hi>from</hi> the soule, and we see that Gods holy will cannot be manifest in false and wicked working, so long as the soules will worketh evill, so long God's speaking, formeth it self therein, in <hi>anger:</hi> But when it beginneth to stand still from such work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then is God's power of <hi>Love</hi> manifest therein: for if it worketh no more, then worketh, in it, the abysse, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>ONE.</hi>

                                 <hi>that word is God,</hi> viz. a manifestation of the abysse: now if the soule speaketh no more its owne will, then is the unsearchable will, speaking, in it; Where the <hi>creature</hi> standeth still, there <hi>God</hi> worketh.</p>
                              <p n="44">44. Now if the creature will work with God, then must its will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into God, and then God worketh <hi>with</hi> and <hi>through</hi> the creature, for the whole creation, both heavenly, hellish, and earthly, is no other then the working word, the word it self is All.</p>
                              <p n="45">
                                 <pb n="439" facs="tcp:29914:223"/>45. The Creature is a compacted, coagulated vapour and <hi>exhalation</hi> from the word, and as the word is exhaled out of the <hi>free will,</hi> where the free will bringeth it self out of the abysse into the profundity: So also, the free will of the Angels and soules, bringeth the word into a profundity, and that profundity is the creature, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>fire source</hi> to its re-speaking-forth, and out of that re-speaking-forth proceedeth <hi>evil and good,</hi> and according to that re-spoken-forth substance and power, the soule hath its Judgement and sentence.</p>
                              <p n="46">46. For that is the <hi>Judgement</hi> that the evil be separated from the good, and that every thing possess its own principle. Whatsoever soule now speaketh forth <hi>hellish</hi> source, <hi>viz.</hi> the curse, it must into <hi>death,</hi> that it no more bring Gods word into evil and good, but the evil alone, that every thing may remaine with its owne.</p>
                              <p n="47">47. And therefore because in the place of this world, through the word, evill and good is spoken forth, <hi>therefore</hi> in that place is a final day of separation appointed, when good and evill shall cease to be spoken in any place; and the wicked shall have <hi>their place prepared,</hi> where evill shall be spoken in its Eternity, that the good may be knowne, and in the good, the joy be manifest; Also that it may be knowne what <hi>evil</hi> and what <hi>good</hi> are; also what life and death are, and that the children of God may <hi>rejoyce.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="48">48. For if evill were not knowne, joy would not be manifest: but if joy be manifest, then is the eternal word spoken in joy, to which end the <hi>word, with nature,</hi> hath brought it self into a Creation.</p>
                              <p n="49">49. And this is the true ground wherein all conceits and <hi>opinions</hi> are knowne, and all <hi>Sophistry</hi> throwne to the ground, also all strife and contention hath an end. Whosoever rightly seeth and understandeth this, hath no further <hi>question</hi> about any thing, for he seeth that he liveth and subsisteth in God, &amp; he giveth himself up to God, that he may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know and will through him, and speake what and how he will, this party seeketh onely the estate of <hi>lowliness,</hi> that God in him may alone be high.</p>
                              <p n="50">50. But so long as Lucifer hath his dominion in man, so long the creature presseth forward to advance it self, and will be <hi>its owne God,</hi> and that is also a wonder, as Gods wisdome standeth in the wonders in the Love, so it is also in <hi>selfe</hi> and in the appropriation of the creature.</p>
                              <p n="51">51. Every thing is good in its own principle wherein it liveth, but to another it is opposite: Yet it must be so that one may be <hi>manifest</hi> in the other, and the hidden wisdome may be knowne, and be a sport in the severation, wherewith the profundity, <hi>viz.</hi> the eternal one, may sport with it self, before it self.</p>
                              <p n="52">52. We should therefore learne to understand the <hi>Scriptures</hi> aright, how God willeth good and evil, namely, the determination is not in his <hi>very self,</hi> but in his expressed word, <hi>viz.</hi> in nature and <hi>creature</hi>: God hateth <hi>Esaw</hi> in the corrupt nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Esaw's</hi> self <hi>nature: Esaw</hi> was the type of hatred it self; but in Gods self, <hi>viz.</hi> in the impressed or inspired Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> he loveth him.</p>
                              <p n="53">53. Therefore he presents the type of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> together with him, and lets them <hi>both</hi> come out of <hi>one</hi> Seed, to signifie that Christ should call <hi>Esaw</hi> in the corrupted Adamical nature in the
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:29914:224"/>
hatred of God, to repentance, and beget him <hi>anew,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> brought <hi>Esaw</hi> to repentance, so that he let his malice fall, and wept bitterly, and departed from his evil will towards <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="54">54. This therefore is the understanding of the Scripture, that the earthly <hi>Adam</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>corrupt</hi> nature, in his owne will, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, <hi>nor can</hi> finde repentance, for there is no ability therein to good, but the incorporated grace <hi>in him</hi> awakeneth or stirreth up the ability, when the will turneth to it: for it self-will could worke repentance and become good, honest, and vertuous, it <hi>needed</hi> not Grace.</p>
                              <p n="55">55. The decrees in Scripture point onely at two kingdomes, <hi>viz.</hi> the hardning respects the false and wicked will; the false will hardneth it self, <hi>Gods anger</hi> in the wills own substance, <hi>hardens</hi> it; this hardning doth not enter in from without, but is manifested in the wills own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. The will is from God, and the <hi>same</hi> God in the will introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth himself into the hardning, in that manner, as he introduceth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into hell in darkness and torment; the same is also to be understood concerning the kingdome of Grace.</p>
                              <p n="56">56. God willeth in man <hi>onely</hi> that which is Good in the kingdome of his Grace, where the free will yeeldeth it self up into the Grace, there God willeth that which is good, in the will, <hi>through the Grace.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="57">57. But when a man will say, man cannot turne his will towards that which is good, <hi>viz.</hi> towards Grace, that is <hi>groundless:</hi> grace indeed standeth in the abysse of the creature in all wicked men, and the will need onely stand still from wicked working, and then it beginneth as to its self-will, to dive downe into the abysse.</p>
                              <p n="58">58. For that which standeth still, standeth still together with the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal one, and becometh <hi>one substance</hi> therewith, for it goeth into its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Must not the false will or desire for a worldly Law's sake, for feare of punishment, forbeare or stand still from unrighteous works; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then not also for the sake of the <hi>commandement</hi> of God? <hi>Can</hi> it be obedient to a worldly Lord and Master, and for that end stand still for which he would have him, <hi>wherefore not</hi> also to God? especially when the <hi>ability</hi> is as soone given, as a Man doth but incline his will to stand still.</p>
                              <p n="59">59. But the <hi>cause</hi> why the total false wicked will doth not stand still, and incline it self to Grace, is this, that it is clearely a <hi>Thistle</hi> borne, wherein Grace lyeth <hi>too</hi> deeply hidden; and the wrath of God is too strong in nature. Grace draweth it, and sheweth to it, its own falshood, and wickednesse; but it <hi>contemneth</hi> Grace, and worketh as a Thistle doth in the power of the Sun; Such a one is to God <note n="†" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16.</note> 
                                 <hi>a good savour, of death to</hi> the <hi>damnation</hi> in hell, that Grace may be severed from the false and wicked will.</p>

                              <p n="9">9. And then this People raise themselves up against that strange opinion, and cry out in Anger, these have <hi>deflowred</hi> our sister <hi>Dinah,</hi> and have made her a whore, and are inraged against the new found opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as the sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> against <hi>Sichem,</hi> and with fighting, and the sword, with storming and cursing, run on against the deflowrer of their

sister <hi>Dinah,</hi> and <hi>murther</hi> him, and not only him, but all the males that are with him, as <hi>Jacob's</hi> sons did the <hi>Hemorites:</hi> And then the innocent must thus suffer with the guilty, to signifie, that they all of them, both the one and th'other live in <hi>such Religious whoredome:</hi> For the whore for whose sake they take vengeance, is their sister, and borne of their stock, as <hi>Dinah</hi> their sister was, and they came of one Mother.</p>
                              <p n="10">10. We see heere eminently the type of contentions Christendom; how Christendome would be <hi>head-strong</hi> and furious in opinions, and that in great blindness, and not know wherefore, and would not see themselves, that they thus rage in their <hi>owne</hi> whoredome, and strive not about the power of true Christianity, as about the true Christian <hi>life,</hi> but about their contrived opinions, as about their sister <hi>Dinah,</hi> which goes abroad gadding from them, and <hi>gazeth</hi> upon the strange opinions, and cry out upon the opinion for a whore, and yet see not how they should help their sisters <hi>heart,</hi> wherein sticketh the lust of whoredome, As <hi>Jacob's</hi> sons did not see how to help the evill, that their sister might save her credit; And though <hi>Hemor</hi> and <hi>Sichem</hi> sent to them to <hi>give her a Dowry, and would marry their sister,</hi> and love her, and <hi>be circumcised,</hi> and <hi>become one People with them,</hi> and would performe all love, faithfulness and friendship towards them, yet all this did not help.</p>
                              <p n="11">11. And although they <hi>told them,</hi> that if they would be circumcised, and be one people with them, they would give them their sister, yet they were furious in killing and slaying, to signifie, that this is a figure of <hi>future Christendome,</hi> which would arise out of this Stock; As we see that it so comes to pass before our eyes, that men strive about the gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>separated</hi> opinions, and kill and murther one another for them, and yet this is but for the opinion sake of false whoredome, which the <hi>titulary</hi> Christendome hath taken up, wherein they trim themselves in hypocrisie and whoredome, and looke not how their sister might be helped, who is gone astray in a strange opinion, but they take their <hi>swords,</hi> and would slay the new opinion, and snatch their sister who is with childe with another opinion, forcibly againe with her bastard out of <hi>Hemor's</hi> house, and slay <hi>Hemor</hi> and <hi>Sichem</hi> and all their males.</p>
                              <p n="12">12. And though they would <hi>unite themselves</hi> with them, as with the true Christian ground, <hi>viz.</hi> with the chiefe Articles of Christian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, yet it availes not, they will <hi>against all faith and promise</hi> slay and kill, and keepe their opinions, which they have contriv'd in their ease and <hi>pampered jollity,</hi> with their fat bellies, and heathenish festivalls, as it is seene at this day in the contentions and opinions.</p>
                              <p n="13">13. Men of <hi>self-love</hi> have introduced their Christianity into a fleshly kingdome, and finely trimm'd it with Lawes, Ceremonies, and <hi>Opinions,</hi> and have covered it with Christ's purple Mantle, and yet live in meere spirituall whoredome under it, with an hypocritical <hi>shew:</hi> But their hearts constantly beget this lustfull <hi>Dinah,</hi> which runs abroad from the simplicity and humility of Christ, and playes the whore with the Idols of fleshly lust, <hi>viz.</hi> with Pride and Covetousness, meerly with their own Honour and <hi>Reputation,</hi> and a voluptuous life, quite contrary to the true Christian ground.</p>
                              <p n="14">14. But seing the Spirit of Christ dwelleth yet alwayes in his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, he often <hi>stirreth up</hi> men which doe thus acknowledge and see

the sleepe and whoredome of the titulary Christendom in their <hi>Sodomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> life, and turn away from them, and search in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and also in the light of <hi>nature,</hi> whether this their fleshly ground, can subsist in the presence of God, and when they <hi>see</hi> that it is false, then they fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some other ground, and reprove the whoredome of the titulary Christendom.</p>
                              <p n="15">15.

                              <p n="19">19. Behold, O Christendom, the Spirit hath set this before thee in the <hi>figure</hi> of the Twelve Patriarchs, and signifieth, that thou <hi>wouldest</hi> doe thus, <hi>Not</hi> that thou <hi>shouldest</hi> doe it: Though this Strife must come, that the true children of Christ might be exercised and made <hi>manifest,</hi> otherwise if no Strife did arise among the Christians, all wicked men

                              <p n="20">20. Mans true Christianity standeth in the inward ground of the Soule in the ground of man, not in the ostentation and <hi>fashions</hi> of this world, but in the power of <hi>well-doing</hi> in the spirit and Conscience.</p>
                              <p n="21">21. The strife wherewith a true Christian striveth, is onely the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> which casteth away from it, the falshood and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness in flesh and bloud, and suffereth and indureth <hi>all things</hi> willingly for Christs sake who dwelleth in it, that it may not live to it selfe, and please it selfe, and have satisfaction in it selfe, and <hi>Triumph</hi> with the earthly Lucifer, but that he please God his Creatour in Christ Jesus.</p>
                              <p n="22">22. He hath nothing in this world to strive for, for nothing is his owne: for in Christ he is not of this world, but as the Scripture saith, <note n="*" place="margin">

                                 <hi>His Kingdome is not of this world</hi>; so also a Christians Kingdome, so farr as he is a Christian, is not of this world, But in Christ, in God.</p>
                              <p n="23">23.

                              <p n="24">24. <hi>Outward</hi> warre that Christians make, is Heathenish, and is done for the beastial mortal man's sake: for immortality cannot be attain'd or kept with the sword and <hi>forces,</hi> but with Prayer &amp; with entring into the feare of God: But the earthly Lucifer striveth about the <hi>Belly,</hi> and about worldly honour and pleasure, wherein Christ is <hi>not</hi>; but it is the defloured <hi>Dinah,</hi> where men make warrs about the houses of stone, and <hi>temporal</hi> goods, and thereby declare that the spiritual virginity in the Spirit of Christ is made a whore, who playes the harlot for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this <hi>world.</hi>

Have you not alwayes striven about your Colledges or Palaces, and about your <hi>owne Lawes,</hi> wherein you have lived in Opinions, and disputed about those Opinions? What need hath Christ thereof? Christ bestowes himself upon his children, substantially, in a <hi>living</hi> manner, to dwell in them, and will give them his flesh for food, and his bloud for drink; What needeth he opinions, that men should strive about him, who and what he is?</p>
                              <p n="28">28. When I consider a true Christian, then I understand that Christ is and dwelleth <hi>in</hi> him; what meanes then your <hi>outward</hi> worship of God? Wherefore doe you not serve him in your <hi>hearts</hi> and consciences? He is present within you, and not in the solemnity and ostentation of <hi>outward</hi> things: yee have the sword of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> by right, with that you should strive; Use you the Power of the true Apostolick Churches, and not the sword of Mans hand.</p>
                              <p n="29">29. The <hi>Excommunication</hi> is your sword, but yet it must be used in the power of the Holy Ghost, in Divine zeale against the wicked and <hi>ungodly,</hi> and not for that purpose to maintaine humane <hi>Inventions</hi> and fictions, that a man must call your spiritual whoredome in opinions a chast virgin, as for a long time the Babylonish Church hath used it to <hi>such</hi> a Power.</p>
                              <p n="30">30. All outward Ceremonies without the inward ground, that is, without Christ's Spirit and <hi>co-operation</hi> is <hi>whoredom</hi> in the sight of God, that a Man will approach to God <hi>without</hi> Christ the Mediatour: for none can serve Christ but a Christian, where the Spirit of Christ it selfe <hi>co-operateth</hi> in the Service; but how will he serve Christ, that holdeth in one hand the <hi>Cup</hi> of Christ, and in the other hand the <hi>sword</hi> of selfe-Revenge? Christ must, in a Christian, overthrow <hi>sin</hi> by his Spirit, and not the Fathers fiery sword in the Law of <hi>severe</hi> Righteousnesse.</p>
                              <p n="31">31. O ye children of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> the Spirit at <hi>Jacobs</hi> End, hath signified concerning you, that <hi>your swords were murtherous,</hi> that Christ is <hi>not in your Councills,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> sayth; My soule, that is, the Covenant and Grace of Christ, be thou not in their <hi>Churches</hi> and Congregations, nor in their <hi>Councill</hi>; Read the 49<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where the Councill of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees and Scribes; who <hi>institute themselves Pastours</hi> without the Divine Calling; is thereby signified.</p>

                                 <hi>Hemor and his son Sichem, and all the males of the</hi> whole <hi>City, were circumcised</hi> and became <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Israelites.</hi>

                                 <hi>Jewes, and</hi> then presently <hi>were slaine by these two brethren Simeon and Levi,</hi> which indeed is a hard figure to be understood, seeing Reason questioneth whether it were so done or no, that <hi>two men</hi> should slay a whole City? But seeing it is a figure and <hi>was done</hi> even by <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> viz. by the Stock and Root of the Levitical Priesthood, and signifieth the future Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; This therefore is to be understood under it.</p>
                              <p n="35">35. These two Brethren required first and proposed, that if they would be <hi>circumcised,</hi> and receive their Law, they would <hi>give</hi> them their Sister, and afterwards as it came to passe, they slew them all both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and the guilty: This is that which Christ said to the Pharisees; <note n="†" place="margin">

                              <p n="36">36. This also may be said of the <hi>Christian Levites,</hi> they perswade Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be <hi>Baptised,</hi> and <hi>called</hi> Christians, and when that is done, they stick their murthering sword into their hearts, that they learne to <hi>slay other</hi> People with words, which are not called after their name, and are not of their Opinion; They <hi>curse</hi> and damne them, and they give occasion that one Brother <hi>persecutes</hi> another, slanders, condemnes, <hi>hates,</hi> and becomes his malicious enemie, and yet understands not wherefore. Heere it is rightly said, <hi>these</hi> Levites have promised mee their sister to wife, so that I am become a <hi>Christian,</hi> and now they slay me with false Doctrine, and not onely mee but all my generation, who heare them and receive their <hi>blasphemy,</hi> for Divine Truth, and believe them that it is right, that one man should <hi>thus</hi> judge and condemn another, which yet Christ hath earnestly <hi>forbidden,</hi> and thereby now, that man judgeth himself, since he doth that himself, which he judgeth in another.</p>
                              <p n="37">37. Thus is the murthering sword stuck into many innocents hearts, so that they are <hi>guiltlesly</hi> slain by the Levites; But seeing <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi> are placed <hi>together,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> also when he was at his end Prophesied concerning them, and putteth them together, calling them murthering swords, it hath this signification, that they will not <hi>only</hi> slay them with the sword of the <hi>mouth,</hi> but they would also set themselves up in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power and authority, and for the truths sake <hi>kill</hi> their bodies, and would doe it even to them which are under the Circumcision or under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> whom first they had perswaded to be Circumcised or to be Baptized.</p>
                              <p n="38">38. As it is also come to passe among the Christians, when men have first <hi>perswaded</hi> them unto Baptisme, afterwards when they have for a while seen their abhominations, that they live worse then the Heathen, and <hi>will not</hi> in all things give their consent &amp; approbation, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin persecution with fire and sword, and slay them, with their innocent children, both in <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> which is powerfully prefigured in this type of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi>; else that were a grievous grosse murther of the children of the Saints, for them to perswade People to their <hi>Faith,</hi> and give them their <hi>promise,</hi> and then afterwards under such hypocrisie to slay all both innocent and guilty, when they had so deeply <hi>humbled</hi> themselves before them.</p>

Thus Jacob came to Luz in the Land of Canaan, which is called Bethel, with all the People that were with him, and built there an Altar, and called the place El-Bethel, because God there appeared to him when he fled from his brother. <hi>This History once againe prefigureth

powerfully the</hi> future <hi>times, how it would go both with</hi> Israel <hi>and also with Christendome: For when</hi> Levi <hi>and</hi> Simeon <hi>had committed that murther, and slaine all the males of</hi> Sichem, <hi>and taken captive all their wives and children, having plundered and spoiled all, then</hi> Jacob <hi>was</hi> afraid <hi>of the People of the Land, and</hi> then <hi>God called him from thence to go to</hi> Bethel, <hi>and make an Altar there.</hi>

                              <head>The inward Figure standeth thus.</head>
                              <p n="2">2. When men, both the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and afterward the Christians, were grown up in <hi>fleshly</hi> whoredome and unchast life, and became <hi>wicked,</hi> then would God's Spirit depart from them, and then they began a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual whoredome and <hi>Idolatry</hi> and were erroneous in their opinions, and would fall together by the eares, and say one to another, he deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his sister <hi>Dinah,</hi> that is, his <hi>worship</hi> and service of God, and would fall one upon another, and murther, kill, plunder, spoile, and rob one another with <hi>warrs,</hi> and bring their Country to desolation and misery; And then when they should stick in such misery and trouble, they would attaine the <hi>feare</hi> and trembling, as heere <hi>Jacob</hi> upon the murther which his children committed, for the Lord would <hi>touch</hi> their evill consciences, and call them again to Repentance, as he did <hi>Jacob</hi> and his children, when he commanded them to come away from the <hi>place</hi> of this murther, and commanded <hi>Jacob</hi> to make an Altar to him, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Lord, that is, in the <hi>lowliness</hi> of the feare of God.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. So the Spirit heere signifieth, that God would then again send them <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> who would disswade them from their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and wicked life, as heere <hi>Jacob</hi> exhorted his family that they should put away the strange Gods, and the <hi>Pride</hi> of their ear-rings from them, and then when they had thus seene the anger of the Lord, which <hi>destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> their Land, and exceedingly devoured them for their Whoredome, Pride, and Idolatrous life, then <hi>would</hi> they <hi>follow,</hi> and obey the Prophets who reproved them for it; and bring their Idols and strange Gods, <hi>viz.</hi> their Idolatry, before God, and put it away from them, and would <hi>again seek</hi> the Temple of God <hi>within</hi> them, and then would God again build up his Altar in them, and they would again rightly offer sacrifice to him, <hi>viz.</hi> offer up their <hi>soules,</hi> and would cleanse their garments, that is, their <hi>hearts,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> heere commanded his People, this also would the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and among the Christians the true <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> command, and direct.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. And we see further heere a powerfull figure how <hi>Jacob</hi> tooke their Idols and Ear-rings, and <hi>buried</hi> them under an Oake by <hi>Sichem,</hi> where the murther was done. O thou great and wonderfull God! What does this signifie? Nothing else, but that these their <hi>errors</hi> and Idolatry, together with their <hi>warrs</hi> and contentions, should thus for a long time lie <hi>buried</hi> in the anger of God</p>
                              <p n="5">5. And seeing the Spirit mentioneth an <hi>Oake,</hi> under which these Idols, and Pride are buried, the figure is cleere to us; for an Oake is of a magnetick <hi>attractive</hi> kinde, and maketh a <note n="†" place="margin">

And they would stink before God for these abhominations, for the sake of which the Spirit of God would <hi>hide</hi> it's countenance from them, &amp; take away from them the light of his countenance, so that they would run on in vaine errors, and enter again upon the way of such whoredome, and with their <hi>evil</hi> zeale for <hi>Dinah</hi> their sister, which yet is but a deflowrd whore, trample all under with Murther and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</p>
                              <p n="8">8.

                                 <hi>Saints</hi>; Of this it is rightly sayd, <hi>Reuben,</hi> thou art my first strength, but thou hast climed up upon my Bed, and defiled it with unchastity, thou hast used my Concubine, <hi>viz.</hi> my <hi>formed Word,</hi> to thy whoredome, and hast made of <hi>the Churches of my Children,</hi> a whore-house, and hast defiled my Marriage-Bed, which I have in the Churches, <hi>where I beget</hi> my children.</p>
                              <p n="43">43. This the Spirit of God signifieth cleerely, by the declaration of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 49. where he sayth thus concerning these Churches and their sacrifices; <note n="*" place="margin">

                              </p>
                              <p n="44">44. The Spirit speaketh cleerly in this Text: for <hi>Ruben</hi> signifieth the <hi>Ordnance</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>power</hi> out of which it was built, that is the first power of the Christian Church or Congregation, and is Gods Concubine by which he dwelleth; but <hi>their Ministers</hi> are climed up into Gods Marriage-Bed, and have gotten the Concubine to themselves, and taken her <hi>into their power,</hi> and have gotten her with childe with humane <hi>fictions, fleshly</hi> honour and voluptuousnesse; and it sayth cleerly; <hi>Thou art the chiefe in the Offering, and in the kingdom:</hi> for so it <hi>must needs be</hi> when the whoredome is committed: but seeing <hi>Reuben</hi> exerciseth whoredome with the Churches, it sayth thus; <hi>Thou shalt not be the chiefe; for he was unstable therein as water,</hi> and signifieth thereby, that he would give himselfe to fleshly Lust, and <hi>selfe</hi>-Love, and that in unstability, and in that regard is rejected of God.</p>
                              <p n="45">45.

Now when a man is come so far, then <hi>Joseph [viz.</hi> the chast vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin childe of <hi>Sophia</hi>] is even born; then God his father cloathes his soul with the party-coloured coat, <hi>viz.</hi> with the <hi>divine power</hi>; and forth with the Spirit of God in him beginneth to play with the soul, as he did with <hi>Joseph</hi>; for the Spirit of God seeth through the soul, and with the soul (as <hi>Joseph</hi> in the Type <hi>saw</hi> things which were to come, represented to him in the vision of dreames, whereby the Spirit did also play with the soul) even so the Spirit of God doth <hi>forthwith</hi> take delightfull commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the soul of a new <hi>Joseph,</hi> viz. with the inward spirituall world;

So it goeth likewise with Gods new children, when Gods Spirit sendeth them to be <hi>zealous</hi> about the affliction of <hi>Joseph</hi>; and the world doth every way hate and <hi>persecute</hi> them for it; then they thinke in the Reason of this world; dost thou not goe in the wayes of God; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> then doth it goe so with thee, that thou art but the fool of the world; and then the Minde beginneth to be troubled, and knowes not how it is with it; for he heareth, that he is every where <hi>accused</hi> for a frantick wicked person, and hated; for the young minde in flesh and bloud understandeth <hi>not</hi> the divine processe; <hi>viz.</hi> how reason must become a fool, and how Christ doth very willingly take upon himselfe, in man, the <hi>reproach</hi> and scorn of the Devill, and of the world; and how Gods righteousnesse, and <hi>Adams</hi> propagated <hi>Guilt</hi> must be alwayes full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled with suffering, how a Christian must stand in Christs figure.</p>

and though cleerly <hi>David</hi> caused her Husband <hi>Vriah</hi> to be slaine, and used deceipt that he might get <hi>Bethsheba</hi> to wife, which in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature was an <hi>Abomination</hi> and great sin, before the face of God; yet the Spirit hath its figure in <hi>David</hi> thus, seeing God had renewed his Covenant of Grace with him concerning Christ, <hi>therefore</hi> God set the line of his Covenant in <hi>Davids</hi> unrighteousnesse in the woman that he had gotten to himselfe with unrighteousnesse in whoredom by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering her husband, to signifie, that all humane matters and doings are vaine and <hi>evill</hi> in the sight of God, and that he will come <hi>himselfe</hi> with his Grace to help our sinnes and impurity, and introduce his Grace into our sinne and <hi>slay</hi> it with the <hi>Grace,</hi> therefore God represents this Image and Type in <hi>David,</hi> for an <hi>Attonement,</hi> pointing at the coming of Christ, who when he rendred himselfe into this figure, tooke on him the sinnes of all Men, and clensed againe the whoredome of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Thamar,</hi> as also of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bethsheba</hi>; and of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and laid <hi>himselfe</hi> in the Marriage-Bed with them, as he did with <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> and with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bethsheba,</hi> in whom the Line of the Covenant was manifested in <hi>their evill purposes and doings.</hi>

                              <hi>It came to passe on a Day, that Joseph went into the House to doe his employment, and there was none of the people in the House, and shee caught him by his Garment, and sayd, lye with mee, but he left the Garment in her hand and fled, and ran forth out of the House: but when shee perceived that he left his Garment in her hand and was fled forth, shee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the People of the House and sayd; behold, he hath brought in an Hebrew Man to us to defame us; he came in unto mee and would have lyen with mee, but I cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a lowd voyce, and when he heard that I cryed out, and called, he left his Garment with mee, and fled and ran forth.</hi> This now is the figure, shewing, how the Devill through this whorish Woman <hi>strongly</hi> sets upon the soule, especially when the Devill observeth that the soule is <hi>alone,</hi> that the Spirit of God stirreth not in it, then he falls a storming of it, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hold of it in its <hi>lifes</hi> Essence, and will force it in such whoredome, that the Pretious Virgin-childe might be <hi>defiled,</hi> and that shee might with the Serpents power copulate with the soule.</p>

This also is a powerfull figure of the whorish and <hi>unchast</hi> world, shewing, how the faire Daughters of <hi>Eve,</hi> in the instigation of the Devill run after the tender Youths, and <hi>allure</hi> them with flattering hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>behaviour,</hi> with wicked burning Lust, which <hi>trimme</hi> and adorne themselves, as if an <hi>Angell</hi> sate under <hi>their</hi> dresse; and have drawne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an honest vertuous childe, that never desired it, to themselves, and bound them with the Devills chaines, and have bereaved them of their honour and chastity.</p>
                           <p n="43">43. And if there were an honest and chast <hi>Joseph,</hi> who would not goe into <hi>these</hi> Hogsstyes and Jakes of the Devill, they cry out against such a one, and <hi>accuse him</hi> of unchastity, as willing to betray him and rob him of his honour, and yet are even the lustfull Panders, which strow sugar, and give Gall to Eate, which strange people strow sugar so long, as he hath <hi>money</hi> in his Purse, till they bereave him of his <hi>livelyhood,</hi> honour, and Goods, that he have no more to give them, and then they scorne him and leave him <hi>without</hi> a Garment, as <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife did <hi>Joseph,</hi> as he was going out of the house; so the Devill hath the soule, and the whore the Garment for a Pledge; in which whore, nothing else governeth, but the Serpent with its <hi>brood</hi> of young ones, and he that joynes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto them, is <hi>poysoned</hi> by the Serpent: for the Serpent sheds its spawne into body and soule, and poysoneth him so exceedingly, that his <hi>heart</hi> cleaveth to the whore, and runneth after her, as if he were fast tied to her.</p>

But where a true Vision is seene in Man, that is done by the soules modelising, when it co-Imageth or co-modelleth it selfe in the figure through <hi>its Imagination</hi>; then the Image or representation standeth in the right humane <hi>understanding,</hi> though indeed the Astrall Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Imageth or frameth it selfe in <hi>Earthly</hi> formes, so that very <hi>sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> an entire perfect vision appeareth as the work or <hi>effect</hi> in it selfe shall be; also Mans owne Imagination it selfe doth often alter it, what a Man thinks or Imagineth in the day, <hi>viz.</hi> that Magick forme, makes it so, that the figure is according to his Imagination.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Yet the right visions are, when Mans will <hi>resteth</hi> in God, and then is Gods will manifest in Mans will, and then the soule seeth with <hi>Gods Eyes</hi> from its most inward Ground, where it stands in the word of God, and then the Speaking Word goeth with the Soules, into the Magick Image of the Constellation, and then the Astrall Spirit <hi>cannot</hi> Image or fashion it selfe in the Phansie, but must stand in the Image in the figure as the Constellation is, and then the soule seeth what the Most High hath prefigured, and what shall come to passe: and then the Word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the ground of the soule expresseth the figure in the soule, so that the soule <hi>understandeth</hi> it; as heere <hi>Joseph</hi> and also <hi>Daniell</hi> Expressed and Expounded; As soone, now, as the figure of the vision was told be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Joseph,</hi> the Spirit of God was together in the voyce of the relatour, and in <hi>Joseph</hi> Expounded the vision, for so also are the Magick visions of <hi>all</hi> the Prophets.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. For, after God hath once appeared to a Prophet in an audible voyce, and called them to be Prophets, as to <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.4, 6.8.10.</note> 
                              <hi>Samuell</hi>; then afterwards he appeared to them in Magick visions, and <hi>answered</hi> them upon their <hi>Questions.</hi>

                           <p n="9">9. The right Prophetick Ground of the Magicall seeing and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is thus; Every Prophet is a limitt wherein a Time is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or an Age Comprehended; and he is the Mouth of that Kingdome or <hi>Dominion,</hi> that is, when that Kingdome, hath awakened and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Turba</hi> in it, then is he the Mouth of the Inward Ground, which declareth and expresseth the vanity in the <hi>Turba,</hi> and also the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, which hath taken compassion on the humane misery, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the wrath of the <hi>Turba,</hi> and reproveth that Kingdome for their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Idolatrie, and comforteth them with the introverted Grace againe.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. For, his Spirit standeth in the figure, in the Eternall Speaking Word of God, from which the <hi>Life</hi> was expressed or Spoken forth, and became a Creature, introverted againe as an Instrument of the Spirit of God, whereby the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> speaketh and intimateth; for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Spirit could not in its <hi>owne</hi> might and power declare future
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:29914:256"/>
hidden things, if the Spirit of God did not see <hi>through</hi> it, and that the Word of God did also goe together through his Word into the Magick figure which the Prophet <hi>seeth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="11">11. For, the Brophet knoweth <hi>not</hi> any thing beforehand in his owne power and authority, which he declareth, but when the Word mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delleth it selfe together in the figure, then the Prophetick Spirit seeth through <hi>Gods seeing,</hi> how the Word of God goeth also together upon the figure: and then the Word expresseth, declareth, and Expoundeth the figure through the Prophetick Spirit, as heere was done by <hi>Joseph</hi>; when the Kings Officers told their Dreames, then the Word set the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in <hi>Josephs</hi> understanding how it should come to passe, so that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> knew what their visions <hi>meant.</hi>

                           <p n="12">12. But he knew it not beforehand; but in the telling of the Dreame, the <hi>word of understanding</hi> modelled it selfe in <hi>Josephs</hi> understanding, that he knew it; for <hi>Josephs</hi> Spirit stood in a Magick figure, <note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Re-introver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the the word.</hi>
                              </note> introverted againe into the Word, after the manner, as the New Birth in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ standeth introverted againe: so also the other Prophets through whose Mouth, Gods Word, Expounded and expressed from the Inward Ground, through their Mouth, the <hi>Wonders</hi> of God in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> in the formed Creaturely Word.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. By this figure of <hi>Joseph,</hi> in that he obteined <hi>Divine</hi> knowledge and skill, and could expound hidden things; we see, how the introver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit of Man resigned up into God, when he forsaketh all that is his owne, <hi>doth attaine</hi> the Divine Eye to see and understand; so that he gets much more againe then he forsooke, and that he is much richer, then when he enjoyed his owne; for in his owne will he had and possessed onely a Particular; but in the Resignation he gets into the Totall, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>universall,</hi> into All; for ALL is, from the Word of God.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. Therefore if he cometh into that, he cometh into the Ground, wherein all lyeth in the Eternity, and from being poore becomes rich, as <hi>Josephs</hi> figure declareth, that a poore Prisoner became a Prince, and that <hi>onely by the Divine Word,</hi> that had manifested it selfe in him, when the Word in his submissive dereliction and forsaking all, Expressed or spake forth it selfe againe, and so spake or pronounced <hi>Joseph</hi> into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Government, and Dominion, through whom the Word of God would rule in Aegypt, and give the <hi>understanding</hi> for such a Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

                              <hi>by humane meanes,</hi> and release him from misery, and not set his hope up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>favour</hi> of Man, but looke upon God, to see what he will worke by meanes; and though it seeme as if God had forgotten, as heere with <hi>Joseph,</hi> who must remaine Two yeares in Prison, then he must consider with himselfe that God will have him <hi>heere,</hi> but if he will through meanes have him in another Place, then he will <hi>afford meanes</hi> for it, and send it in due time, as is to be seene heere.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. The mishap, of the Kings Officers, in that they were put into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to <hi>Joseph,</hi> was a <hi>meanes</hi> whereby God would bring <hi>Joseph</hi> before the King; but it was not done suddenly, because <hi>Joseph</hi> hoped the Kings Butler would speake a Good word for him to the King, and tell his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency</hi>; but the Butler forgat him, &amp; left <hi>Joseph</hi> lying in the Dungeon, that <hi>Joseph</hi> might wholly despaire of humane meanes, and flie to God, and when he doth that, and <hi>despaires of all humane meanes,</hi> and barely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeth on God, then must even <hi>that</hi> meanes, in which <hi>Joseph</hi> had hoped, and yet also had long despaired of any helpe from it, break forth againe, and stand him in stead.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. By this, a childe of God should learne, that all which he prayeth to God for, that it should stand him in stead by Man, that he should not <hi>set</hi> his hope upon <hi>Man,</hi> but upon <hi>God,</hi> then at length every thing is done which he hath prayd to God for, that should stand him in stead, by humane meanes, when the <hi>Minde</hi> despaires of humane meanes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth downe into God againe, then Gods helpe breaks forth through humane meanes.

                           <p n="2">2. These Dreames of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> were represented to him from <hi>God,</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. With the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> the Magick Art and skill was <hi>Common</hi>; but when it was <hi>misused</hi> to Witchcraft, it was extirpate, although it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the Heathen till the Kingdome of Christ, till the <hi>Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> sprung up, then the Naturall <hi>Magia</hi> was suppressed among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, which in the <hi>beginning</hi> was well that it was suppressed, for the Heathenish <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Religion.</hi>
                              </note> Faith was thereby allayed and quenched; and the Magick Images of Nature, which they honoured for Gods, were rooted out of Mens hearts.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. But when the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> was common, then came <hi>other Magi</hi> up, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sects in Christendome, which they set up for Gods instead of the Images of Heathen Idolls, and drive on greater <hi>Delusions,</hi> then the Heathen with their Magick Idolls.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. For, the Heathen looked upon the Ground of the possibility and working of Nature: but these set themselves <hi>above</hi> the ground of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, meerely in an Historicall Faith, and say that men ought to <hi>beleeve</hi> that which they contrive.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. As at this very Day Titulary Christendome is full of such <hi>Magi,</hi> as have <hi>no</hi> Naturall understanding, either of God or of Nature more among them, but onely an <hi>Empty</hi> Babbling of a supernaturall Magick Ground, wherein they have set up themselves for Idoll-Gods, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand neither the Divine nor Naturall <hi>Magia,</hi> so that the world is made stock-blind by them, whence the Contention and Strife in Faith and Religion is arisen, that men <hi>talke</hi> much of Faith, one drawing this way another that way, and make a multitude of Opinions, which are altogether <hi>worse</hi> then the Heathenish Images, which indeed had their ground and foundation in Nature; but these Images have no ground either in Nature, or in the supernaturall Divine Faith, but are <hi>dumb</hi> Idolls, and their Ministers are <hi>Baals</hi> Ministers.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. And as it was highly necessary and good, that the Naturall <hi>Magia</hi> was discontinued amongst the Christians, where the Faith of Christ was manifest: so now at present it is much <hi>more</hi> necessary that the Naturall <hi>Magia</hi> were <hi>againe</hi> manifest, that indeed Titulary Christendomes Idolls which it maketh to it selfe, might through Nature be made manifest and <hi>knowne,</hi> that Man might know in Nature the Outspoken or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed formed Word of God, as also the New Regeneration, and also the Fall and Perdition, that thereby the Contrived supernaturall <hi>Idolls</hi> might be suppressed, that men might at length in Nature learne to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> seeing Men will not confide in the Spirit of God in the Divine <hi>Magia</hi> of true Faith, but lay their foundation upon the Tower of <hi>Babell,</hi> in the Contention and Contrived <hi>Idoll</hi> Opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Edicts and Traditions of Men.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. I doe <hi>not say</hi> that Men should seeke and preach the Heathenish <hi>Magia</hi> againe, and take up Heathen <hi>Idolls</hi> againe, but that it is needfull to learne to search the <hi>Ground</hi> of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the formed Word of God in Love and Anger, with its re-expression, that Men might not be so blinde concerning the Essence of all Essences.</p>
                           <p n="9">
                              <pb n="507" facs="tcp:29914:257"/>9. For the Fathers of the first Faith, were not so blinde concerning the Kingdome and <hi>Dominion</hi> of Nature, but did know in and by Nature, that there was a <hi>hidden</hi> God, who had made himselfe visible, by the Word of his Exhalation and Information of the Created World, and have <hi>knowne</hi> Gods Word by the Creation, which is now at present much the more necessary, that the Opinion Idolls might come to light and be knowne; that Man might at length see, what <hi>Faith</hi> is, that it is not an Opinion and Conceit, but a Divine <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p n="12">12. But that this Dreame appeared <hi>twofold</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> it signifieth in this figure, first the ground of the Eternall Nature in its seaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, what God would shew thereby; Secondly, as to the second ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, it signifieth the <hi>humane</hi> Ground, which in its Substance hath its Creaturely Originall out of the seaven properties; Moreover it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the <hi>twofold</hi> Man, according to the <hi>Outward</hi> Body, and the outward Spirit, and then according to the <hi>Inward</hi> Soulish or animall Spirit, and according to the inward holy Substance of the Divine Substantiall power; and standeth in the <note n="*" place="margin">

                              </note> figure of a Holy Divine Man, who is faire and full of divine power and vertue, who walketh and feedeth in the true heavenly Pasture of the <hi>Substance</hi> of the Substantiall wisdome of God.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. And it denoteth secondly, a wicked and ungodly Man, who is withered, meager, leane, and ill-favoured as to that Divine Substance, and yet is even the <hi>same</hi> Natures property as the Divine is: but he is withered and corrupted as to its good Substance; the Wrath of the Eternall Nature in the seaven properties hath <hi>consumed</hi> its Substance, so that it is now as a hungry fire-Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. Thus the great God representeth before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> what at this time stood in the figure of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> for he would visite them: first, he sheweth them his great <hi>Grace,</hi> in giving them <hi>Joseph</hi> a Prophet
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:29914:258"/>
and wise Prince to Governe them: also he sheweth them in this vision, that in his Grace in the Kingdome of the inward and outward Nature in the seaven properties, there is meere <hi>Blessing</hi> and good things; if they would walke therein, they would be as the seaven fatt Kine and Eares.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. But if not, then his wrath would come upon them, and <hi>consume</hi> their good things in Body and Soule, and make them leane, dry, and withered; as was done to the Devills, when of Angells they became Devills, then their good things, <hi>viz.</hi> the Substantiall Divine Wisdome in them, faded, and <hi>their</hi> seaven properties of the Eternall Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so ill-favoured leane and dry, as the seaven withered Kine, and the seaven blasted Eares, wherein was no more power and vertue.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. And as the seaven withered Kine, and the seaven dry Eares de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the good fatt Kine and Eares, and were yet more leane and ill-favoured then before, that a man could not discerne that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them: Thereby the great God also signifieth, that the <hi>wicked</hi> Man with his seaven properties of Nature enkindled in the Anger of God, devoureth the Good and faire <hi>Image</hi> of God in him, by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing himselfe into selfe-desire, in which selfe and <hi>wicked desire,</hi> Nature becomes painfull, and falls into unquietnesse and disturbance of its peace, and yet afterwards is still ill-favoured, abominable, loathsome, and drie; as a Covetous churlish hungry Dogge, though he devour much, his <hi>Covetous Nature</hi> in his Envy consumeth him, even his flesh, so that he hath not that which he will not afford to other Dogges.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. Thus the great God represents by this, before the Aegyptians, seaven <hi>Good</hi> fatt <hi>yeares</hi> and seaven dry <hi>barren yeares</hi> which devoured the other seaven, so that a Man could not know the good any more, under which yet very powerfull things are prefigured, as shall be mentioned heereafter.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. But that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was troubled at this vision, and yet understood it not, <hi>neither</hi> could his wise Men interpret it; this signifieth, that <hi>God</hi> himselfe would interpret it by his power and vertue <hi>in</hi> Joseph, and that the Time of this visitation was at hand, <hi>therefore</hi> was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> so mooved in himselfe that he would faine know it.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. But that the Wise-Men in the Light of Nature, could not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it, signifieth, that the <hi>Workes</hi> of God are hidden to the Naturall Man without Grace, and that he knoweth or understandeth nothing of the wayes of God, unlesse <hi>God reveale</hi> or manifest them thereby in and through him, for this was a Motion of the Eternall Nature through the outward Nature, therefore the Naturall Wise-Men <hi>could not</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. And when none could interpret it to the King, the Kings Butler thought on <hi>Joseph,</hi> that he had interpreted his Dreames for him, and told it to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; And heere in this vision of <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> God <hi>called</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph, and that which he had desired two yeares agoe through mans helpe was <hi>fulfilled</hi> and granted unto him.</p>
                           <p n="21">

<pb n="509" facs="tcp:29914:258"/>
hearest a Dreame, thou canst interpret it: and Joseph answered Pharaoh and sayd, that is not</hi>

                                 <hi>In my power.</hi>

                           <p n="22">22. This figure, that <hi>Joseph</hi> put on other Garments and was shaved, when he was to enter in before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> signifieth this to us, that God at present had put off the Garment of his <hi>Misery,</hi> and had now put on him the Garment of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> and would have him now in another place then he was in before; and set him before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Wisdome, and would give him for a <hi>Guardian</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; for the Spirit of <hi>Moses</hi> setteth downe the figure Excellently accurately and properly, as if he had a great desire to play and <hi>delight</hi> himselfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. And wee see further, that <hi>Joseph</hi> sayd to the King, that it stood not <hi>in his</hi> naturall power and <hi>Might,</hi> to know such hidden things, but that God alone gave him to know it, so that he needed neither Art nor Magick Images about it, but <hi>God</hi> would interpret good to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> through him.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. Therefore should a <hi>Magus</hi> give up his will to God, and fix his Magick Faith, (wherewith he will search the figure of Nature in its formes and <note n="†" place="margin">Or, <hi>qualities.</hi>
                              </note> Conditions,) <hi>in God,</hi> that he may apprehend the Word of God, and introduce it into the figure of Nature, and then he is a right true <hi>Divine Magus,</hi> and may master the inward Ground with Divine power and vertue, and bring Nature into a <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p n="25">25. And it is no way to be thought, as if a Christian ought not to dare to meddle with the ground of Nature, but that he must be a <hi>Clod</hi> and <hi>Dumb</hi> Image, in the knowledge and skill of the secret Mysteries of Nature; as <hi>Babell</hi> sayth, Man ought not to dare to search and know it, it were sinne; which all of them one and other understand as much of the Ground of <hi>sinne,</hi> as the Pott doth of the Potter.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. When they should tell <hi>how</hi> sinne is sinne, and how Man doth cause God to be Angry and in wrath, then they have no other way to turne themselves to evade it, but Images or <hi>conceits</hi> of Opinions, which shutt up the Conscience in such Images and Conceits, so that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is <hi>affraid</hi> of their Images, and the Ground of sinne, according to the seaven Properties of Nature; (how their fatt Kine are made leane and drie) they <hi>know not.</hi>

                           <p n="28">28. The time is even <hi>at hand,</hi> wherein the figure of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> shall be brought to Effect, <hi>your Images</hi> of false and wicked Magick shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested to the whole world by <hi>Josephs</hi> Exposition of the Vision; break off from the Images, and pray to God, that he would give you the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> visions, and then you may be partakers of the seaven good Kine and Eares within you.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. If not, then must all your Images of false and wicked Magick be <hi>turned</hi> into such Barren Kine and Eares, as they are indeed for the

most part already in the inward ground, and outwardly <hi>at present</hi> are devouring, and alwayes devoure the Good times and yeares; for they have almost quite devoured and swallowed up into the <hi>Abysse,</hi> all Love, Faith, Truth, Righteousnesse, Humility, and feare of God; and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent also they devoure all outward food and <hi>sustenance:</hi> they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Silver, and there is nothing left but meager and base Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and yet they are so hungry and <hi>greedy,</hi> that they lye gnawing at the Copper, as a Dog at a hard Bone, and would faine have more to devour, and yet there is no more for them.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. Therefore they are so hungry, that they themselves worry and devour <hi>one another</hi> for hunger, and bring their Land and Country into dearth and famine; But heereby they are made <hi>Bondslaves</hi> to the Anger of God in the seaven properties of Nature, as the whole Land of Aegypt was made King <hi>Pharaohs</hi> owne in the Deare time of <hi>Joseph.</hi>

This Anger of God will <hi>heereafter</hi> give you seede, that you must sow Images and Idolls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and devour them againe your selves, as you have cleerly done for a <hi>long</hi> time, and must be its boneslave servants, as <hi>Aegypt</hi> was to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>

                           <p n="35">35. The first devouring Property Covered with Christs Mantle is <hi>Pride,</hi> viz. a Desire of Selfe-Might, under the lowly humble Mantle of Christ, resolving to be potent and splendid, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> under his black Hood, who yet alwayes supposeth he is the most potent, when yet in the presence of God he is but a Lord in <hi>Phantasie.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="36">36. The second property of thy hunger Covered with Christs Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, is <hi>Covetousnesse,</hi> viz. the Devourer, who devoureth himselfe, and
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:29914:259"/>
getteth from others their sweate and flesh from their bones and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, and yet hath nothing, but alwayes lyeth like Poyson <hi>sucking out it selfe:</hi> this hath devoured all Truth, Righteousnesse, Patience, Love, Hope, Faith, and the feare of God, and yet is but a meere hunger: at present it hath eaten all Silver from the Copper, and yet looketh as if it had devoured nothing, for nothing is to be <hi>seene</hi> in it; but that it is hungryer then before; it hath devoured all good times into it selfe, and still alwayes devoureth all <hi>provisions,</hi> which God of his Grace bestoweth, and yet is every day hungryer with devouring, and though he could devoure Heaven, he would devoure <hi>Hell</hi> also, and yet remaineth a meere hunger still.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. The Third property of this Hunger Covered with Christs Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, is <hi>Envy,</hi> viz. the sonne of Covetousnesse, and Pride is his Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this stingeth and pricketh and rageth in the hunger, as poyson in the flesh, it <hi>stingeth</hi> in words and works, and poysoneth all, it <hi>lyeth</hi> and cheateth, and is <hi>never quiet:</hi> the more greedy Covetousness is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure, the greater is this its sonne <hi>Envy,</hi> it will possesse all alone to it selfe, and yet hath <hi>no place of rest,</hi> either in Heaven, this world, or Hell: It can remaine neither in Heaven, nor in Hell, it standeth onely in the hunger of Covetousnesse, and is the <hi>life</hi> of Covetousnesse.</p>
                           <p n="38">38. The Fourth property of Hunger Covered under Christs Mantle, is <hi>Anger,</hi> which is the sonne of Envy, and Covetousness is its Grand-father, what Envy cannot <hi>sting</hi> to death, that will Anger strike and <hi>fell</hi> to death: It is so evill and wicked that it breaks and shatters the Bones to pieces: It alwayes <hi>thirsteth</hi> after Murther, onely that its Father and Grand-father, <hi>viz.</hi> Covetousnesse, Envy and Pride may have roome enough, it destroyeth body and soule in their kinde of <hi>fattnes,</hi> and wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Country and Citie, and is further so wicked that it would destroy Heaven and Hell, and yet hath no where any rest.</p>
                           <p n="39">39. These are the <hi>foure Elements</hi> of Hunger which devoure and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up the seaven fatt Kine and Eares of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and yet are as they were before, and at present <hi>Joseph</hi> hath seene and <hi>manifested</hi> them in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Dreame, so that they are become manifest in the World, and are set before the Eyes of the Watchmen who sit in Councell for Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what is to be done <hi>more</hi> with these dry ill-favoured Kine, for God hath given them the seaven fatt Kine of the Manifestation of his <hi>Grace,</hi> but they devoure all, and yet are so very hungry, that Hell dwelleth <hi>in</hi> their foure Elements, and the Kingdome of the Devill <note n="*" place="margin">

Nature generateth in thee <hi>such a thing</hi> as thy hunger and desire is, thou oughtest to hope for nothing, except thou convertest and puttest on <hi>Josephs</hi> New Garment, and then the Lord will give thee his Spirit, so that thou wilt see and <hi>understand</hi> thy Images, and put them away, and stand with <hi>Joseph</hi> before the Face of God, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> before the Face of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and wilt be able to see and <hi>interpret</hi> the Wonders of God.</p>

This whole Historie of the Dreames of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> are an Image, whereby the Spirit under an outward Action, pourtrayeth and Typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>humane</hi> Ground, how Good, God Created him, and set him in his fattnes, and how he is thus destroyed by <hi>Sathans</hi> Envy and Poyson, and changed into so ill-favoured an Image.</p>
                           <p n="44">44.

the Prison of his <hi>Anger,</hi> that the Minde is well eased againe, like one that is released out of Prison, then sayth the Minde thus; I am very well <hi>eased</hi> in my Prayer in this Repentance.</p>
                              <p n="26">26. For, Gods Anger hath released Nature out of its Prison, that it should with greater <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>industry</hi> presse in to God, for in its <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> it cannot doe so, for it is in anguish, and beholdeth only its commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sinnes which continually drive it <hi>back,</hi> that it is affraid <note n="†" place="margin">

But the Anger of God holdeth it continually with one <hi>Band</hi>; as <hi>Joseph</hi> held one <hi>Brother</hi> in Prison, till they brought the last brother also; and thus must the poore soule remaine tied with one band of the Prison of Death, till it shed forth the last brother, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>inward</hi> ground, and come before God and say; Lord I will forsake all for Christs and my salvations sake, and give up my will wholly to thee, cast mee into Death or into Life, into derision or scorne, into poverty or misery, as thou wilt, I will cleave to thee, I will <hi>not</hi> play the <hi>hypocrite</hi> before thee, and give thee but halfe my will any more, as I have done.</p>
                              <p n="28">28. And then if the Earnestnes proceed to <hi>practice,</hi> that God percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that it is in Earnest, then will also the last brother be let loose, that is, then will also the <hi>last Band</hi> of the Anger of God be loosed: but in the <hi>meane</hi> time, ere it thus come to passe, the soule must lye captive in one Band.</p>

But the great Mercifullnes in the <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ in the inward Ground, presseth in with his Pitty, and great <hi>Compassion,</hi> although at present, he still hideth his countenance of Love from it, that the soule doth not know it, and maketh the troubled soule full of misery, that in selfe it <hi>beseecheth</hi> and weepeth before God, and accompteth it selfe <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Evill and wickedness, and beginneth in such kindled Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bitterly to complaine of its sinnes, and to be sorry, and is also so full of shame in the presence of Christ, that it <hi>hideth</hi> its countenance before God, and knoweth not what to doe for Lamentation; For it seeth in it selfe with its owne Eyes, that the <hi>severe</hi> righteousnesse of God, holdeth and bindeth it in its <hi>Life,</hi> as the Brethren of <hi>Joseph</hi> must see, that their Brother was bound for their sinnes before their Eyes.</p>

                              <p n="37">37. This now is the Most Lovely rich figure, shewing, how God taketh <hi>nothing away</hi> from the Repentant Sinner, when he in his will gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth up all, &amp; <hi>resolveth</hi> to cleave stedfastly to God, he taketh no reward

                              <p n="12">12. This now in the Text stands in a figure, shewing, how the <hi>Old Adamicall</hi> Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Old <hi>Jacob,</hi> thinketh it to be very hard, that he should let all the powers of his <hi>Life</hi> be carried along into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that is, into <hi>Repentance,</hi> into the <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>Joseph</hi> or Jesus; especially when he seeth that he must breake his will, and part with all <hi>temporall</hi> things for it; as Old <hi>Jacob</hi> must part with all his children for this foode.</p>
                              <p n="13">13. It went hard with him, and yet the famine and hunger did so presse upon him that in the end he must <hi>yeeld</hi> and be willing that all his sonnes should goe into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and his youngest sonne went along, and he was alone as one who had no children: so <hi>wholly</hi> must the Outward Nature leave whatsoever it hath or is in it selfe; as having no more power and ability as to <hi>Earthly</hi> things, and give up the <hi>selfehood</hi> of its <hi>inward</hi> soule, which standeth in the Drawing of God, that the inward soule may take the <hi>outward</hi> soules will along with it into Conversion, and then the Old <hi>Jacob,</hi> that is, the Old earthly Adamicall <hi>Body</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alone in its house of Sorrow, and knoweth not now what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it, when its Spirit must goe along into conversion, then think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Earthly Lucifer</hi> in it, <hi>viz.</hi> the fleshly desire; heereby thou wilt loose temporall honour and good things, and be the <hi>foole</hi> of the world; this will not serve thy turne and Lust.</p>
                              <p n="14">14. But the Great Famine, viz. <hi>Sinne</hi> presseth the poore life in all the Three Principles, that it must make ready and goe into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that is, into <hi>Repentance,</hi> and seeke divine foode, and pray for it and <hi>desire</hi> it, from the true householder <hi>Joseph</hi> or JESUS, and in such Prayer and desire fall on his face of great humility before Joseph or Jesus, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire foode of him.</p>

                              <p n="16">16. As the Brethren of <hi>Joseph,</hi> stood the first time before <hi>Joseph,</hi> when he held them for <hi>Spies:</hi> so also Man standeth before God as a Spie of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace; for he thinketh he will <hi>this once</hi> enter into Repentance, that his old sinnes may be forgiven him, but he hath not yet so strongly <hi>tamed</hi> his will, that the will should think <hi>all</hi> dayes of its life while the body lasteth, to remaine in such begun Repentance, but it thinketh onely for <hi>once</hi> thus to destroy Sinne in the Conscience, and to drowne the old sinnes in Repentance and <hi>Sorrow.</hi>

And it cometh also to that passe, that his Conscience, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at first it be <hi>terrified,</hi> is in the End appeased, and divine foode is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him from the heavenly <hi>Joseph,</hi> into the Sack of his <hi>desire,</hi> so that the Anger of God letteth him goe; But the Anger of God in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, taketh a <note n="‖" place="margin">Or, <hi>Pawne.</hi>

                              <p n="18">18.

This figure now, that <hi>Jacobs</hi> children must goe downe into <hi>Egypt</hi> for foode <hi>twice,</hi> and at the <hi>second time</hi> Joseph was first manifested unto them, and the <hi>third</hi> time they tooke along with them their wives and children, and all that they had, together with their father; prefigureth; that when Man through sinne hath spent and <hi>consumed</hi> the first divine food, that he must hunger againe and be in want in his Conscience, so that his conscience <hi>presseth</hi> him &amp; complaineth, as a hungry Belly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth for food, then he thinketh on the first repentance againe, how Grace happened to him <hi>before.</hi>

                              <p n="20">20.

                              <p n="21">21.

                              <p n="23">23. Then comes the poore Conscience, in need, and with trembling, before God, and hath not <hi>many</hi> Confessions or <hi>words,</hi> for it accounteth it selfe too unworthy to speake one word before God, but setteth it selfe before his face, and boweth downe to the Ground, and thus in it selfe <hi>demerseth</hi> it selfe into the Most meere and deepest Mercy of God, into Christs wounds, suffering, and death, and beginneth from its most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ground, to <hi>sigh,</hi> and to fly into Grace, and wholly give up it selfe thereto, as <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren came thus the <hi>second time</hi> before <hi>Joseph,</hi> and fell downe before him.</p>
                              <p n="24">24.

                           <p n="20">20. For Love in its owne property is nothing else, but the <hi>Divine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> out of the profundity or ground of the Eternall One; Love seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nor desireth any thing but the One, for it selfe is the <hi>One; viz.</hi> the Eternall Nothing, and yet is through All, and in All, but the appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of selfe-will, is a Nothing to it.</p>
                           <p n="21">21.

But heerin neither of them destroyeth the other that it should <hi>cease</hi> to be, and be nothing, but that which is overpowered standeth <hi>still</hi> to that which hath overpowered it, the heate to the cold, or the cold to the heate, and there is <hi>no</hi> selfe possession or willing, but one Element wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the other, that the other may be manifest, and when it it manifest, then it giveth it selfe to the <hi>strongest</hi> in the Stirring, and so there is a strife, and yet the greatest Love between them: for, in regard of the <hi>Love struggling,</hi> it is, that the strife and willing or stirring ariseth.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. Therefore Man in respect of his own willing, is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: if he did give his will to God, and did yeeld to him, then God would will through him, and with him, and his willing <hi>were</hi> Gods wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: But seeing he loveth his owne willing, and not that which hath given him the williing; it is a twofold Injury.</p>

                           <p n="27">27. A second is, that he <hi>breaketh off</hi> his Love from the Love of the <hi>Abysse,</hi> and loveth himselfe, and forsaketh the Love that hath given him his Love; and himselfe willeth, goeth, runneth, careth, and looketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many things, and breaketh himselfe off from the <hi>Vnity:</hi> therefore he runneth on in his own will in the formes or qualities of Nature and the foure Elements; as also in the Multiplicity of the Essences of the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Positures of the Starres.</hi>

                           <p n="39">39. For if it have once turned toward Grace, and broken it selfe off from <hi>ungodly Courses,</hi> then it thinketh no Evill at all shall happen, God is bound to <hi>protect</hi> it, and the world doth it wrong, when it reproacheth it as wicked, it ought no more to be subject to plagues and punishments, and it accounteth that honesty and Righteousnes, whereby it stealeth Grace from God, and reckoneth it for its owne, as if it were <hi>no more</hi> Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Sinnes.</p>

                              <p n="42">42. When a Man, as is above-mentioned, becometh a <hi>true Christian,</hi> so that God giveth him his Grace, then he layeth his Grace hiddenly in the Sack of his Body in the <hi>Essences</hi> of Life; and moreover layeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Cup of the <hi>Crosse,</hi> and blameth it no more in Conscience in respect of its manifold committed sinnes, for he hath utterly destroyed them with the Grace of forgivenesse, and filled the Sack of his sinnes with <hi>Grace</hi> for the hunger of the poore soule; but it layeth now the <hi>Cup of Christ</hi> to its Charge, that it is Guilty of that, <hi>viz.</hi> of Christs being scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, also of his Suffering and Death, that he hath brought Christ to the Crosse with his sinnes, that it is verily Guilty of the Cup of Christs Crosse, and <hi>not wholly</hi> righteous.</p>
                              <p n="43">43. For when God by his Grace forgiveth him the <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <p n="44">44. But seeing he cannot doe that, and <hi>is too weake</hi> to enter into such sufferings in the Anger of God, therefore hath Grace put this Cup also into him, that he might drink of Christs <hi>victory,</hi> and Prophesie or Divine of Christs suffering and Death, and make them <hi>knowne.</hi>

But Gods righteousnesse, which now requireth Man to be in the processe of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> in Christs Sufferings and Death, and yet findeth him not <hi>alwayes,</hi> in his Conversation, and <hi>Will,</hi> therein; accuseth him for a Theefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who carrieth the Cup of Christs Crosse but as a Theefe in the <hi>Sack</hi> of his Lifes Essences, and chargeth him of Theft, if he walke other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then in the Processe and Imitation of Christ.</p>
                              <p n="46">46. For Christ hath received Man into his Sufferings and Death, and turned away the righteousnesse of Gods <hi>Anger,</hi> and introduced him with his Guilt of Eternall Death, into his <hi>innocent</hi> Death; and is dead from the sinnes and wickednesse in himselfe, and in this dying of Christ, Gods righteousnesse in the Anger, <hi>requireth</hi> a Christian Man to be.</p>

                              <p n="50">50. For if he be not guilty of them in his Life, yet he is guilty of them in the <hi>inherited</hi> sinne, and hath inherited them also in the <hi>seede</hi> out of which he is proceeded, they lye in his <note n="*" place="margin">

                                 </note>Ground; he cannot excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before God, in the processe of Christ, he is guilty of <hi>all</hi> Adamicall sinnes.</p>
                              <p n="51">51. But this is his Comfort that God <hi>manifesteth</hi> them by the children of his Anger in this world, and so, as a Curse, by the Children of Anger, <hi>fastneth</hi> them to the Crosse of Christ, and in this Manifestation <hi>drowneth</hi> them in him in the Bloud and Death of Christ, in that he still cleaveth to God, as Christ to his Father, and suffered himselfe to be accused of sinnes which he <hi>had not</hi> committed, but had onely inherited them, and so they were taken from him, and given to the Anger of God in his Judgement that he might <hi>condemne</hi> them.</p>
                              <p n="52">52. For thus also <hi>Joseph</hi> in this figure appeased his just Anger, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Brethren; they were all Guilty towards <hi>him,</hi> but he charged them not with their Guilt, but charged them onely with his <hi>Cup,</hi> for he had cleerly <hi>forgiven</hi> them all their Trespasses: but onely concerning the Cup he would <hi>not</hi> hold them Guiltlesse, and yet of right they were <hi>not Guilty</hi> of it; but he had layd it in, as his bounty, and made them guilty of it.</p>
                              <p n="53">53. Thus also hath God given us his <hi>Grace</hi> of meere Love, after that wee were cleerly guilty of Eternall Judgement, and hath layd <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> in the Sack of our Life, with his Suffering &amp; Death, with his Cup of the Crosse, concerning which he doth <hi>not</hi> hold us <hi>Guiltlesse,</hi> wee are all Guilty thereof, and have not this by a Naturall right, but it is layd into us <hi>without</hi> our knowledge; therefore wee cannot release our selves
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:29914:276"/>
of it, except wee cast Christ wholly from us, and <hi>give</hi> our selves againe to the Anger of God, and then Death, Hell, and the Anger of God make us Guilty, and hold us <hi>captive</hi> in them; but at present Man may lay hold on which he will.</p>
                              <p n="54">54. But that <hi>Joseph</hi> caused the Cup to be thrust into his Brother <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamins</hi> Sack, it hath this figure; that Christ dwelleth in the <hi>inward</hi> Man, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Paradisicall brother, and hath this Cup of the Crosse in his Hand, out of which the <hi>guilty</hi> soule and the Body must drink, he thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it into his brothers sack, for that inward ground is his Brother, but the other brethren must drink of it, this brother of Christ holdeth it in him, for he is <hi>Christs</hi> Member and habitation.</p>
                              <p n="55">55. Therefore sayth <hi>Josephs</hi> Steward, by whomsoever the Cup is found, he shall be my servant, but ye shall be quitt; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>inward ground,</hi> the true <hi>Josephs,</hi> viz.

                              <p n="2">2. God gave <hi>Israell</hi> the Law, and commanded them <hi>thereby</hi> to goe home againe into Paradise, even as the figure of the Promised Land, (into which they were to goe, but could not for a long time, till <hi>Joshua</hi> led them in) was as a Type and prefiguration, of the true Leading in by <hi>Jesus</hi>; and under the Law they had also the Paradisicall Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> as also the Prophets, who lead them to Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</p>
                              <p n="3">3.

                              <p n="4">4. But seeing that could not be, and that, neither the Law nor the Covenant could bring them in, back againe, <hi>then</hi> the Heavenly <hi>Joseph</hi> manifested himselfe out of the Covenant, for he could <hi>no longer</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, in regard of Mans misery, and bringeth his great Mercy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, through the Covenant, into the Law; which <hi>Compassion</hi> is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Josephs</hi> great <hi>weeping,</hi> when he could no more withhold from his Brethren, and he wept so that even the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and the people of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> house heard, which signifieth, that this weeping, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mercy and Compassion of God through Christ, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> also, that is, <hi>all Heathen</hi> and People, should heare and <hi>receive</hi> it, even as it came to passe, when Christs weeping and Compassion sounded among all Nations, so that they <hi>all received</hi> it into their hearts, and turned themselves to this <hi>Joseph,</hi> who received them all, and <hi>fullfilled</hi> the Law, together with the Covenant.</p>

But that <hi>Joseph</hi> cryed, let every one goe forth from mee, when he made himselfe knowne to his brethren, that <hi>none</hi> should stay with him; it signifieth this; when Jesus Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the highest Mercy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manifested it selfe out of the Covenant, then must the <hi>Law</hi> with all <hi>Ceremonies</hi> together with the <hi>Covenant,</hi> cease and be gone, also all <hi>Mans ability</hi> and power, as also all <hi>willing,</hi> going, and running must goe forth and depart.</p>

                              <p n="8">8. No hypocrisie or humane Comfort, wherewith Men please and <hi>tickle</hi> the heart, will availe, in this presence of <hi>Joseph,</hi> but a <hi>totall</hi> forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Every Creature, wherein Every thing is left, to the naked soule, and that must in it selfe sink downe in the presence of the heavenly <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> in its will and whole desires, and totally <hi>leave</hi> it selfe to him, and will nothing without his will, and set no other meanes or <hi>Medium</hi> aloft in Esteeme, for all will availe nothing.</p>
                              <p n="9">9. The whole Creaturely Life must be resigned and forsake its will and desires, that the <hi>Creaturely will</hi> may be received and purified againe by the un-creaturely will, that Gods will and Mans will may be <hi>one</hi> will, and then <hi>God is all in all</hi> in him according to the inward and the Outward World, in each world according to its <hi>property,</hi> viz. according to the Eternall Speaking Word, in the soule: and according to the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male soule, <hi>in Spiritu Mundi,</hi> in the Spirit of the world, in all, as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>

It is indeed <hi>in</hi> Man, but not in the possession of the <hi>fiery</hi> Soules <hi>Essence</hi>; it hath another Principle then the soule, and yet is <hi>in</hi> the soule, and <hi>through</hi> the soule, and <hi>from</hi> the soule, after the manner as the <hi>light</hi> is from the <hi>fire,</hi> which is through the fire, and in the fire, and hath its manifestation from the fire, out of which fire and light, <hi>Aire</hi> proceedeth, and out of which aire, dewy <hi>water</hi> proceedeth; and that same dewy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter denoteth, the <hi>substance</hi> of this inward Ground, which giveth to the fire againe, Nourishment, <hi>foode,</hi> lustre, and life.</p>

                              <p n="40">40.

                              <p n="41">41. <hi>Jacob</hi> sayth; <hi>Thou art hee, thy brethren will prayse thee</hi>; in this he looketh <hi>outwardly</hi> upon the Earthly Kingdome; which should arise in the future Time: and <hi>inwardly</hi> he looketh upon the Kingdome of Christ, which both Jewes &amp; Heathens would embrace, and prayse and honour Christ as God and Man.</p>

                                 <p n="21">21.

                                 </p>
                                 <p n="22">22. Therefore the Spirit in the Covenant by <hi>Jacob,</hi> pronounceth so <hi>sharp</hi> and severe a sentence upon it and sayth: this <hi>Dan,</hi> that is, this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Judge, would be a Serpent and Adder in the way of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and would bite the <hi>just right,</hi> viz. the heeles of his horse, that his rider, <hi>viz.</hi> Justice and Righteousnesse might fall to the Ground; and then <hi>Nature</hi> shall waite for the <hi>salvation</hi> of God, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Justice and Right of Christ by and through <hi>Love,</hi> and then <hi>Dans</hi> Office shall <hi>Cease.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p n="23">23. Which ought well to be considered, by thee <hi>Babell,</hi> seeing thou boastest of Christ, whether thy salvation be <hi>in thee</hi> or no; that thou mightest Judge thy selfe and not need to have Judges, who must Judge thy <hi>unrighteousnes,</hi> wherein thou art <hi>no Christian,</hi> seing thou continually murmurest with <hi>Rachell,</hi> and seekest <hi>thy will,</hi> therefore also the Adder and Serpent of <hi>Dan</hi> may well sting thee; for thy Evill <hi>malice</hi> and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes causeth that, <hi>viz.</hi> thy owne <hi>willfullnes</hi>; therefore also hath God given thee up under <hi>Dans</hi> fallen Rider, so that thou must goe along as a slave and <hi>ridden</hi> horse, whom the Serpent stingeth with his venomous sting, <hi>viz.</hi> with the power and authority of <hi>usurping</hi> selfe.</p>
                                 <p n="24">24. But that <hi>Dans</hi> Rider must fall backward, signifieth that this <hi>Dan</hi> with his Office shall fall backward in the <hi>Conscience</hi> of a Christian, when he turneth to Christ and worketh Repentance; for, in <hi>Repentance</hi> Dans Government ceaseth, the Rider Gods Anger falleth backward. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:29914:300"/>
also every Christian is bound, <hi>to forgive every one from his heart,</hi> when Repentance and Confession and acknowledgement of sinnes cometh, and so cast the Office of a Judge behinde his back, for the Office of a Judge is the Office concerning sinne, that <hi>severeth</hi> right from wrong, and alwayes falleth heavy upon that which is false and <hi>wicked,</hi> but the <hi>Serpent</hi> often biteth the Horse in the heeles, <hi>viz.</hi> favour, Greatnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Gifts and bribes: these make <hi>Dan</hi> an Adder and Serpent.</p>
                                 <p n="25">25. And wee see clearly, that <hi>Dan,</hi> viz the Office of a Judge in <hi>Israell,</hi> hath its <hi>Originall</hi> from the murmuring, stubborne, and opposite will, and that <hi>Dan</hi> is onely a determiner of Strife, and not as he supposeth, to be his owne Lord in his Office, but a <hi>divider,</hi> as <hi>Rachell</hi> sayth: God hath Judged my Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> by this <hi>Dan,</hi> her mayds-servants sonne, and <hi>not</hi> her owne sonne; to signifie that a childe of God needeth no Judge, <hi>he judgeth himselfe,</hi> and suffers with patience.</p>

                              <p n="39">39. For <hi>Joseph</hi> was not an <hi>intruding</hi> Governour, but one rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not out of policy, suttlety, and plausible speeches and pretences, so that he can draw and turne the horse about by the tayle, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the simple people, that he turnes him about by the head: and the flattering hypocrite also sayth of such Governours and Rulers, they are the Head; and they doe this onely that they may eate their fatt bread from the Court; he sate not with adorned <hi>Eloquent</hi> acute speeches in the Office of Judicature, but by <hi>divine understanding,</hi> if he would have flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and have been a lascivious adulterer, he <hi>could</hi> well have been a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour with <hi>Potiphar:</hi> but that ought not to be; for in him, stood the figure of a <hi>true Christian</hi> Man, shewing how such a one would regulate his <hi>life</hi> and also his <hi>Office,</hi> and how the good well-spring, Christ, would flow forth through him, and judge and rule through him.</p>

                              <p n="44">44. For, one that feareth God, and leaveth selfehood or appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing for his owne, he getteth in stead thereof, <hi>all,</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ, the Heaven and the World is his, whereas on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the wicked must supply himselfe with a peece of that, which he hath <hi>stolen</hi> in suttlety, and acquired to himselfe with deceit, and take nothing of it away with him but the <hi>hell</hi> only and his wicked unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and the <hi>Curse</hi> of miserable people whom he hath tormented upon Earth, they have <hi>kindled</hi> hell-fire with their Curse <hi>in him,</hi> and that he taketh along with him.</p>
                              <p n="45">45.

But that he sayth: according to the desire of the <hi>lofty</hi> in the world, he signifieth under it, the <hi>prosperity</hi> of the blessing to those that are blessed; for as the Rich of the world desire only highnesse and good things, so these in the blessing of God receive <hi>temporall</hi> and <hi>Eternall</hi> good things; these shall from the blessing of <hi>Jacob,</hi> come upon the head of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> that is, upon his children, so that they shall in this sprouting, beare good fruit: for the Head signifieth the <hi>blossomes</hi> and <hi>fruit</hi> of this Tree.</p>

                                    <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.27.</note> 
                                 <hi>Benjamin is a ravening Wolfe, in the Morning he will devour the prey, but in the Evening he will divide the spoyle: Benjamin</hi> was <hi>Josephs</hi> neerest owne deare brother, and yet the Spirit sayth of him; he is a ravening <hi>Wolfe,</hi> who in the morning would devour the prey; In this Testament of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> is couched the most hidden <hi>secret</hi> figure of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet in its Type in the unfolding in the Effect and work, it is the most manifest and <hi>open</hi> figure, which is cleere in the fullfilling, so that Men may see it with bodily Eyes, and yet in their Reason are quite blinde concerning it.</p>
                              <p n="49">49. This figure is fullfilled, and yet is in <hi>action,</hi> and shall be yet also further fullfilled, it is very secret, and yet as manifest as a Sunshiny Day, and yet is not understood; but it is knowne to the <hi>Magi</hi> and Wisemen, who indeed have written much concerning it, but it hath not been yet rightly <hi>explicated,</hi> while, the time of the Evening (when <hi>Benjamins</hi> spoyle shall be <hi>divided</hi>) was far off, but now it is neere; therefore wee shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer somewhat concerning it, and hint the sence and meaning for those of <hi>our society</hi> to consider of, and yet remaine as it were dumb to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, seeing they sit in the dark, and open their Jawes onely after the <hi>spoyle.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="50">50. The two Brethren <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> are the Image or Type of <hi>Christendome,</hi> and of a <hi>Christian</hi> Man, which in their figure are twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> the Adamicall Man in his <hi>Nature</hi> is signified by <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and the New Man out of the <hi>Covenant</hi> in the Spirit of Christ is signified by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>; and the figure representeth, how Christ hath assumed the Adami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Man, and that this Man is halfe Adamicall and halfe heavenly, and that <hi>entirely</hi> in one person which cannot be divided.</p>
                              <p n="51">51. So also in this Image or Type he prefigureth Christendome, and how they would receive Christ and become Christians, <hi>viz.</hi> that in them <hi>Christ,</hi> and also the Evill Wolfe <hi>Adam,</hi> would governe, that is, when they would receive the Faith, they would be so ravenous raving and zealous as a Wolfe, and would draw the Heathen to them with power and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, and yet would devour them, that is, whosoever will not above all, <hi>hold</hi> the same Opinion with them, they would presently fall on to <hi>Condemne</hi> that other Opinion, and <hi>persecute</hi> it with warres &amp; the sword, as a raging Lyon or Wolfe biteth and devoureth; thus in zeale they would devour round about them with <hi>Excommunication</hi> and the <hi>sword</hi>; and that therefore, not because they are zealous in the Spirit of Christ, but from the Wolfe of the <hi>Evill Adam,</hi> which would alwayes set it selfe, in Spirituall and Worldly States and polities, <hi>above</hi> the Spirit of Christ.</p>
                              <p n="52">52. Thus their <hi>Zeale</hi> would be only from the devouring Wolfe, Men being more zealous under the Name of Christ for temporall Goods, fatt livings, good dayes, and worldly honour, then for Love, Truth, and <hi>Salvation:</hi> they will not be zealous in the power of Christs <hi>Love,</hi> but in the power of the devouring <hi>Wolfe:</hi> Also in the Zeale of their accustomed Exercises and Worship, wherein yet they would but play the hypocrites
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:29914:303"/>
before God, they themselves would <hi>devoure</hi> one another as covetous greedy Wolves; and so outwarldly the Wolfe would Governe. But yet <hi>inwardly</hi> in the true children, Christ would governe: <hi>Outwardly</hi> Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, <hi>viz.</hi> the Naturall <hi>Adam,</hi> which indeed is also a Christian, but it is first, <hi>after</hi> his Resurrection, when he is quitt of the Wolfe; and <hi>Inwardly Joseph,</hi> who is hidden under the Wolfe.</p>
                              <p n="53">53. And now the Spirit of <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Covenant of God, pointeth at the <hi>Time,</hi> shewing how it would be: <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> time of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they would be zealous, &amp; hunger after God, in the Spirit of Christ, and yet must <hi>hide</hi> themselves from their Enemies, as a Wolfe that Men hunt as an Enemie.</p>
                              <p n="54">54. But when they shall be great and possesse <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> that is, when Christs Name shall come under the power and authority of <hi>Dan,</hi> so that Lawes and Ordinances shall be made out of pretence of <hi>Christian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and its Orders and Exercises shall come under <hi>worldly</hi> authority and dominion; then will this Christendom be a Wolfe, which will no more judge and proceed in the Love of Christ, but whosoever will not call all their <hi>Belly</hi>
                                 <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Orders, good and right, those they would devour with the sword of Excommunication, with fire and <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <p n="55">55. Thus would <hi>Benjamin</hi> in the Morning, <hi>viz.</hi> in his <hi>rising</hi> up, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the prey, and towards the Evening he would againe divide this devoured spoyle, that is, <hi>towards the End</hi> of the world, when <hi>Josephs</hi> Government will get aloft againe, so that Christ shall be <hi>wholly</hi> manifest, and that this Wolfe shall cease, then will <hi>Benjamin,</hi> viz. the holy true Christendom, divide the <hi>spoyle of Christ,</hi> wherewith Christ hath suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Death and Hell.</p>
                              <p n="56">56. This dividing or distribution of the spoyle shall come, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, and yet is not, though it is really in <hi>Truth,</hi> and the whole world is blinde concerning it, except the children of the <hi>Mystery:</hi> The Time is, and is not, and yet truly is, when this prey and spoyle of Christ and also the Wolfes prey, shall, through <hi>Josephs</hi> hand, be given into <hi>Benjamins</hi> hand, and be <hi>divided</hi> and distributed.</p>
                              <p n="57">57. O <hi>Babell,</hi> let this be a Wonder to thee, and yet no wonder neither; for thou hast nothing, and seest nothing, at which thou <hi>canst</hi> wonder; as a young plant groweth from a <hi>Seede,</hi> and becometh a great Tree which bringeth forth much faire fruit; so that a Man would <hi>wonder</hi> at the Graine or seede how so excellent a Tree, and so much good fruit hath lyen hid in <hi>one</hi> only <hi>Graine</hi> or seede, which men neither knew of, nor saw before. But, because Men have knowledge and <hi>experience</hi> thereof, that it is possible, that a Tree should come out of one graine or seede, Men wonder <hi>not</hi> at it; yet Men see not <hi>how</hi> it comes to passe, or where that great power and vertue was; so also at present, Men see the Graine or <hi>Seede</hi> of the Tree well enough, but <hi>Reason</hi> contemneth that, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not, that such a Tree lyeth therein, whence such good fruit should come, that thereby the Kingdome of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> at the End of
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:29914:304"/>
Time, shall be called a <hi>dividing</hi> or distribution of the <hi>prey</hi> and spoyle.</p>
                              <p n="58">58. But <hi>Joseph</hi> must first be a <hi>Governour</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then <hi>Benjamin</hi> cometh to him, and then <hi>Joseph</hi> giveth him five Garments of sumptuous apparell, and five times more foode from his Table then the other; when the famine <hi>famisheth</hi> the Land, and the soule of <hi>Jacob</hi> hungereth, then know, that God will thereby draw <hi>Israell</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> viz. into <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and then is the time of visitation, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> carrieth his <hi>spoyling sword</hi> in his mouth: But <hi>Josephs</hi> countenance smiteth him, so that he cometh into great Terrour, and <hi>feare of Death</hi>; because the Silver Cup of <hi>Joseph</hi> was found in his Sack, at which he is ashamed, and letteth his spoyling sword and Wolves Teeth, <hi>fall from him</hi>; and then <hi>Joseph</hi> manifesteth himselfe to him, together with all his brethren, at which there will be such <hi>Joy,</hi> that the <hi>Wolfe Benjamin</hi> will become a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and yeeld his wooll patiently: this is the End of that Speech.</p>
                              <p n="59">59. <hi>The Testament of Jacob, is a figure of the whole time of the world: from</hi> Adam <hi>to the</hi> End: <hi>of which wee will set downe a short figure for the Reader that knoweth the vision or Histories, to Consider of.</hi>

that the Minde is a wellspring to Good and Evill, and the Scripture intimateth thus much to us; that the Fall and <hi>perdition, is</hi> arisen <hi>from</hi> the desire to the <hi>selfe</hi> of the properties, therefore it is most highly <hi>necessary</hi> for us, to learne to understand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how wee may come againe out from the assumed <hi>selfehood,</hi> wherein wee have paine necessity and Torment, into the unity, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Ground and fountaine of the <hi>Minde,</hi> wherein the Minde may <hi>rest</hi> in its Eternall Ground.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER With an Account of the following <hi>Tractate.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T'S no less common with men would seem wise, than inconsistent with those that are really so, to find a facile Faith for what they like, and a sturdy Diffidence for what they dislike: Like the twins of a byass'd Judgment, the one savouring of Affection, the other of Prejudice, and both of Partiality.</p>
                  <p>That some Passages in the precedent Life will meet with such, I make no question, and therefore thought it not unnecessary to acquaint them with this Truth, that what therein is related concerning our Author, by the learned Gentleman that penn'd the Narrative, was receiv'd not from uncertain wandring Reports, but Authentick Information, from the Tongues and Penns of those, that (during his life upon Earth) were his familiar Associates; Men consciencious both in Words and Deeds, well knowing what strict account must be rendred of both. And how sad an Account have they then to make, whose Throats, like open Sepulchers, blast with their breath (as far as their venome reaches) the most eminent Gifts of God in men that bear his Image? whereof did they know the danger, it could not but make them tremble to consider how their poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned Arrows will return and stick in their own Souls: Yet have some not feared malitiously to defame this deep illuminated man of God; A man whose Writings (though not to us made Canonical by Miracles) mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly appear to have been the Dictates of God's Spirit; and the Will of
<pb facs="tcp:29914:323"/>
God, the Rule of his whole life; alwaies resigning himself (as his own Pen testifies) to the Divine Will: to will and work nothing but according to the will of God. Yet against the spirit of this pious man (as if they feared an Ecclips of their Evening splendor, by the Day-light of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) have some (especially among the Lamps of our Tabernacles) spit forth their Venom, in Aspersions so injuriously false, and palpably absurd, that neither Reason nor Religion, Prudence or Piety, could yield any motive thereunto; only the Monster of their own frailty. Thus doth the Prince of the Air blind men with self-love; that though in others they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor unrighteousness, yet themselves can rashly proceed to sentence, before they understood him, yea some of them, before they had read one Leaf in his Writings: VVhereas others that have seriously studied him, and (with divine assistance) understood much of him, can justly as clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the true concordance of his writings, with the word of God in Holy VVrit; and their inconsistence with conceited Sects, corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, both of our own and former Ages, and all Heterodox Opinions whatsoever. VVell may be said of him, what an experienc'd Philosopher writeth of <hi>Paracelsus</hi>;

                  <p>'Tis true, in respect of the common stile of most Authors, his language may, to some, seem somwhat monstrous; So do the Characters of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Children, <hi>primo intuitu</hi>; and many, even Scripture expressions, to the Ears of the Natural man Besides, he proceeds much by affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not Disputing, but Convincing Error; having not received his Knowledge from men, or from the imperfect fallible Principles of the Schools, but from the true Fountain of Wisdom and Knowledg. Nor did he write, as most do, by transcription out of other mens Books; nor were his Dictates neither, the Products of his own Fancy, but by Divine influence; and (as is his own expression) out of his <hi>Three-leav'd Book,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:29914:323"/>
the Hand of God had opened in him: wherein he found the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not only of all that <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, Christ and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles taught in Sacred Scripture, but of all Mysteries also in Heaven and Earth, as himself affirms in his <hi>Epistles,</hi> and many other of his writings. But lest his own Testimonie should seem invalid, I make bold to insert what a learned <hi>German</hi> writeth of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Now (<hi>saith he</hi>) when Reason supposeth that it is ascended up to the height, with its Wisdom and Arts, God hath stirr'd up this our dear <hi>Jacob Behmen</hi> (a plain unlearned Tradesman) and gifted him with such a noble endowment of <hi>the Universal Knowledge of God and Nature,</hi> and shewn him <hi>the Centre of all Beings</hi>; How all things arise from God Originally, consist in God, and again return and flow into him <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereby to call man to the knowledge of God, of himself, and all things; That he might turn from the corrupt Dark being of this World to Christ the only Light <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>This high, rare, and pretious Gift (which hath not been manifested in the like manner and Degree, Height and Depth, Breadth and Length before these times) our <hi>Jacob Behmen</hi> learned in God, hath employed in all faithfulness and simplicity, and lay'd it forth as it was given and imparted to him: And in all his writings hath lay'd his ground in God, and hath reared up his whole Building, very deeply founded, from <hi>Him</hi>: As Christ speaketh of the wise Master-Builder, that <hi>he digged deep, and layd his foundation on a Rock, whereupon he built his Tow'r on High.</hi> As it is clearly to be seen how he doth all along, drive and press at God, Christ, and his Spirit; at Faith and Love; at the mortifying of the old, and the renovation of the new-man; And in brief, at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration in Christ of God's Image in us, which did disappear in <hi>Adam</hi>; Also he shew<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th the Order, Harmony, and Birth of all things; and how they subsist by the power of the yet uncessantly working word of Gods <hi>FIAT,</hi> and hold their Analogy and orderly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the wisdom of Gods wonders: But he doth not set it forth with words of Scholastick knowledg, and contrived Art of VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in <hi>Babel,</hi> and of her Builders; but as it was given him according to the knowledge of Nature, in his own Gift. And though such Tearms and Phrases as he uses seem hard and harsh at first, yet the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of an observant Reader, that earnestly desireth knowledge for his Edification, will (by the indwelling Grace of God) so bring him into a right apprehension thereof, that what before seem'd difficult
<pb facs="tcp:29914:324"/>
and dark, will at length be plain, clear, and easy, as it hath hapned to my self.</q>
                     <hi>Thus far his own Country-man and Accquaintance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover he had the knowledge of that wonderfull Mystery (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Secrets of the whole Creation) <hi>The language of Nature,</hi> and that in his Native tongue; whereby the very name of every thing gave him clear Inspection into the Nature of it. This Knowledge had <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency, but by his Fall lost it: Else it had been understood (as our Author affirmeth) in the Language of every Nation.</p>
                  <p>Now to the incredulous, if they could but fathom his depths, I should only bid them ask themselves this Question; VVhether <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> ever did or can produce such sublime Knowledge, such pure and distinct knowledge of the highest Mysteries? knowing that upon debate with their serious Thoughts, they must speak the Negative. But there is a malicious Ignorance possesseth many, by which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all things above their, Sphear, and cry down that excellency in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which exceeds the fathom of their own Comprehensions: I need not travail for Proof or Instance, <hi>Istorum plena sunt omnia,</hi> They are no where not to be found.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the following Tractate, it contains <hi>Four Tables</hi> with their <hi>Explication</hi>; wherein may be seen, by a spiritual eye, the Ground and Foundation of all the Authors Works, and profound Mysteries; Yea there is also clearly decypher'd, that so much sought, and so rarely found Secret <hi>Cabal</hi> of the antient <hi>Rabbies.</hi> These Tables indeed contain the Summe of all the Authors writings, of all his Knowledge, of all in Heaven and Earth, yea of all the highest Mysteries that Man, in this life, is capable of knowing.</p>
                  <p>The First Table, as the <hi>Radix,</hi> briefly includes the rest; The other three are Branches of the First, and all together are properly termed an A.B.C. to all that the Author hath written; which when I perceiv'd, I could not but much desire their publication; and not knowing when or by whom that might be done, I furnish'd my self with all necessaries thereunto; and so by God's enablement perform'd it with that care and diligence, which the Majesty of the matter requires. And though I know it a general Expect, that the skill of a Translator should illustrate his Author, yet that, in this and some other of his Writings, can not well be done; for whoever (not perfectly baptised into his Spirit) shall render them in the genuine phrase of other language, and not punctually <hi>verbatim,</hi> will force his Reader to a double loss, both in the significancie of expression, and in the mind of the Mystery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:29914:324"/>In a word, this following Tractate I have annexed to the Author's Life, and both, not unfitly, to his <hi>Mysterium Magnum</hi>: For the first ten Chapters of that Book, are not only introductory to the following Commentary, but likewise an excellent illustration of these Tables; wherein the pious Reader, by a due search, may happily find (<hi>pulsanti dabitur</hi>) a greater Treasure than the VVorld can afford, and that to his infinite satisfaction; which I heartily wish him, together with the Life, Light, and Love of Jesus Christ; In whom I rest</p>

                     <head>A Brief Explication of the first Table, of GOD revealed; how out of himself he continually begetteth, and breatheth forth himself: And how this Table is to be understood.</head>
                     <p>NUmber. I. Is the <hi>Abyss,</hi> the <hi>Nothing,</hi> and the <hi>All.</hi> There we begin to consider, what God in himself is, without [or besides] Nature and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and this consideration of the hidden God, extendeth unto <hi>Wisedom,</hi> Numb. 7. Therein is understood how God dwelleth in all, and how all things from him have their existence; but, himself is to all <hi>Incomprehensible,</hi> and as a <hi>Nothing</hi>; yet through that <hi>All,</hi> he maketh himself visible, sensible, and <note n="(a)" place="margin">Invenible <hi>Findlich.</hi>
                        </note> attainable.</p>
                     <p>Numb. 2. Is the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Abyss.</hi> And by it, at the right side, FATHER, and on the other side, JE. This signifieth the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Abyss,</hi> which is the <hi>Father</hi> of all <hi>Beings.</hi> And the JE signifieth the Eternall <hi>One,</hi> as the <hi>Name</hi> JESUS from the Eternall <hi>One.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Numb. 3. Is the <note n="(b)" place="margin">Good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <hi>Beneplacitum.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Delight</hi> [Lubet] or Impression of the <hi>Will</hi>; by which (towards the right) standeth SON, and opposite to it, HO, signifying how the self-will includeth it self in the place of its possession: The place is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation out of it self; where God begetteth God; according to the good pleasure of his propriety. The HO is the breathing of the will, through which the Delight passeth.</p>
                     <p>Numb. 4. Is <hi>Science</hi> or <hi>Motion:</hi> at the Right standeth SPIRIT, and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it VA. <hi>Science,</hi> is the attraction of the <hi>Will</hi> to the place of God; where the <hi>Will</hi> comprehendeth the Delight which proceeded to the Son, or to the breathing; by which outbreathing is understood the Spirit of God. And here is understood the great Name JEHOVA, as the <note n="(d)" place="margin">Three in one.</note> Tri-une Being; how the Father of himself begetteth the Son; and how the Holy Spirit proceedeth from both, and yet they be but one Being, which hath nothing before it. For the <hi>Science,</hi> in the drawing in, is understood a Root of the Eternal knowledge, or motion.</p>
                     <p>Numb. 5. Is <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Trinity,</hi> signifying that the Tri-une Being, may be known, as a Similitude of the <hi>Will, Mind,</hi> and <hi>Senses</hi>; wherein lyeth the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal understanding. Thus is the Ternarie, the one Eternal understanding, and cause of all things.</p>
                     <p>Numb. 6. Standeth WORD, signifying distinction in the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as speaking, the <note n="(e)" place="margin">Or sensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. <hi>Empfludlig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keit.</hi>
                        </note> Perception of it self; which word abideth Eternally in God himself; and God as the Power of Perception, is the Eternal good.</p>
                     <p>Numb. 7. Standeth <hi>Wisdom,</hi> signifying the outspoken Word, as the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Divine Contemplation; wherein God to himself is Intelligible, Perceptible, and Revealed. And thus far is God to the Creature, Invisible, Incomprehensible, not Natural, nor Creatural.</p>
                     <p>Below the line standeth Beginning of the <hi>Great Mysterie,</hi> or of the <hi>Eternal Nature</hi>; As of the Separability, Perceptibilitie, and Sensibilitie of the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; wherein is understood, the Divine Extrication or Revelation, how God introduceth himself in the eternal Nature, in Love and Wrath; and not in himself, for himself is the one Eternal good, but without Distinction, were not perceptible or manifest.</p>
                     <p>Here is to be Noted, that the 7. <hi>Capitall Forms of Nature,</hi> are marked (to distinguish them from the other Numbers) with I.II.III.IV.V.VI.VII.</p>
                     <p>Numb. 8. The second <hi>Principle,</hi> standeth to the Right. And Numb. 9. The
<pb facs="tcp:29914:326"/>
first <hi>Principle,</hi> to the left. Thus Numb. 9. signifieth the Fathers Propertie, through the speaking of the Word in Wrath; And the second Numb. 8. sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the Sons propertie in Love; where the Love of God by the expressed Word is revealed. As that in Love, Numb. 8. sheweth the Angelicall power-world; and that in Wrath, Numb. 9. signifieth the Dark power-world of Painfulness, wherein God is an Angry God.</p>
                     <p>Numb. 10. Standeth <hi>Tinctur,</hi> signifying the Temperature of all powers, how there through speaking they go forth in Distinction and Formes; as first in the 7. Capital Forms, the Desire, <hi>Science,</hi> Anguish, Fire, Love-Fire, Sound, and Being. And further, there standeth by every Capital Form, what Properties are born and proceed out of themselves.</p>
                     <p>For, if there must be a speaking; then the power must first contract it self, that it may breath forth it self; then it begetteth that Comprehensive or Magnetick <hi>Impression,</hi> the something (which is the Beginning) wherein the <hi>Fiat</hi> which attracteth the powers is understood.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Is the <hi>first Capital Form</hi> of the spiritual Nature, and standeth with Numb. I. <hi>Desire,</hi> which Desire sharpneth it self, from whence existeth <hi>Sour, Hard,</hi> and the cause of <hi>Cold</hi>; and is the ground of all <hi>Saltish</hi> properties <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> in the Spiritual world; and <hi>Essential</hi> in the External world. So also the Desire of <hi>Impression</hi> is cause of its own overshadowing, or Darkness in the Abyss; as all these Forms belong to Numb. I. To the desire of <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Infass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligkeit.</hi>

                     <p n="2">II. By the <hi>second Capital Form,</hi> standeth <note n="(g)" place="margin">Pricking.</note> 
                        <hi>Compunction</hi> or <hi>Science</hi>; sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the contraction of the Desire; where the first enmitie or contrary will ariseth; for hardness and motion, are not alike. Now in this <hi>form</hi> ariseth moving and feeling; as the root of pain; wherein is understood the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Poyson-life, both spiritual and <note n="(h)" place="margin">Essential.</note> corporall; and in the <hi>Darkness</hi> the <hi>paine</hi> or Torment of the wicked life; Neither was the good life without the root of the Evill manifest unto him; and that is the root of Gods wrath, according to the Perception [sensibility] of the eternall Nature.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The <hi>third Capitall Form</hi> is <hi>Anguish</hi>; which ariseth from the desire of Impression, and from the Enmitie of Compunction, where the will stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in <note n="(i)" place="margin">

And here is the <hi>Word</hi> become distinct; and is the root of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> both Spirituall and Essentiall, [Corporall] wherein is rightly understood the <hi>Hellish Fire</hi> in <hi>Darkness,</hi> in painfull life, as appears in the Table downward.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The <hi>fourth Capitall Form,</hi> is call'd <hi>Fire</hi>; where is Understood the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Fire,</hi> from the painfull <hi>Sulphurish root</hi>; for the Will goeth out of Anguish again into Libertie; And the Libertie goeth to its Revelation in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish: In which Conjunction cometh that terrible [like a flash of lightning] Coruscation, where the <hi>Abyss,</hi> as the Eternall good, is revealed; And is in the <hi>Forms of Nature,</hi> the Understanding and Life, in the dark Enmitie; and in the <hi>Libertie</hi> is the root of <hi>Joy,</hi> or rouzing up the <note n="(k)" place="margin">Faculties. <hi>Kraffen.</hi>

                     <p>A. This lower A, is the object, or operation of the threefold I, or Spirit; from whence eternally spring Motion, Colours, and Vertue.</p>
                     <p>I, is the essential Effluence of the triple I, where the Trinity floweth forth into Unitie. And in this whole word ADONAI, is understood the Eternal life of Gods unity.</p>
                     <p>The word FATHER, is the Eternall beginning of operation and will in the threefold I of the Unitie.</p>
                     <p>The word SON, is that Operation of Power, as comprehension of the will into which the triple <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The word <hi>Delight</hi> [or <hi>Lubet</hi>] signifieth the effectual sensibility of the Will; as the highest ground of original love; where the will of the Abyss findeth its self in its <note n="(b)" place="margin">

                     <p>Now in this Table is rightly understood what God, without Nature and Creature, is, in <hi>Trinitie</hi>; as in a triple breathing of the Unitie in it self; where nothing can be said of the place, or dimension of his habitation: for God is neither here, nor there, but every where alike; as the Abyss is consider'd, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Eternall Unitie without Nature and Creature: and thus is he an active power and essence of Unity. But that really such power and vertue is therein, may well be understood, in the effluence of the world, and the Creatures therein, generated by the breath of God: and there is nothing in the being of this world, which beareth not witness thereof, if truly considered.</p>

                        <p>As under the figure I. standeth <hi>Desire</hi> or <hi>Comprehending,</hi> whereby is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that the <hi>Desire</hi> is <hi>Magnetick,</hi> and incloseth, and darkneth it self, which is also the ground of <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal darkness,</hi> and from that <note n="(g)" place="margin">Orig.

                        <p>Under number 2. standeth <hi>Science</hi> or <hi>Drawing,</hi> which is the second Form to Nature; as the motion of the <hi>Magnetick</hi> attraction, from whence the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of Nature existeth; and is the <hi>ground of all Contraries,</hi> for <hi>Hardness</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> are Enemies; Motion breaketh the hardness again, and yet also begetteth Hardness by attraction. Thus two Essences have their existence in the desirous out-flown-will of God; as the drawing of the <hi>Magnetick</hi> power, giveth Motion and Sensibilitie; and the thing attracted affordeth Essence; wherein is understood the cause <note n="(h)" place="margin">Orig. 10.</note> of Spirit and Body; as in the attracting of Sensibilitie is caused the Spirit; and in the extracted, the body or cause to Corporietie.

                        <p>And in these two Forms, <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>In-drawing,</hi> in their out-flown Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is understood Gods <hi>Wrath</hi>; and though they be the ground of the sensible life, Yet if the light shineth therein, then are they the ground of the Joy-King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as an inward motion of Gods Unitie; and a ground of the five Senses; whence also the creatural life hath taken its beginning; and therein standeth its <note n="(k)" place="margin">Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Uerte<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In the <hi>third space</hi> standeth the <hi>third Form</hi> of Nature called <hi>Anguish,</hi> as a spiritual <hi>Sulphur-source,</hi> according to its <hi>propertie:</hi> This taketh its Ground from the first and second Form; as from the <hi>Magnetick Desire,</hi> and from the Motion of Drawing; where the out-flown Eternal will, in that unquietness standeth in Anguish. This Anguish is the cause of Natural Will, Mind, and the Senses, and is the Wheel of Life, as the cause of the Firing-life: for when the out-flown will of Gods Unitie standeth in <hi>Anguish,</hi> then it longeth again after Unity, as after Rest, and the Unity or Rest longeth after Motion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, for in the Unity there can be no Revelation without Motion; and therfore the Divine will freely floweth out of it self; and the Divine <note n="(l)" place="margin">Luber.</note> good pleasure in the out-flown-will, bringeth it self into a Desire and Motion unto a sensibility; that it may perceive it self, and remain two in one Essence; as the sensible Divine delight, and the cause of sensibility; wherein God calleth himself a Loving God, according to the sensibilitie of Divine Love-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and an Angry God according to the cause of sensibility; as after the
<pb facs="tcp:29914:329"/>
Eternal Nature. And thus, we understand by <hi>Anguish</hi> (when the divine Light is not revealed therein) the Hellish fire, and an Eternal despair and Terrour: where the Self-will of Nature continually standeth in a dying Torment; ever desiring to be released from such a condition, which I therefore call the <note n="(m)" place="margin">Little.</note> lesser Death; it is the Eternal dying Death; but in the Hardness, it is the great still-standing Death. This Form if it hath not Light, is the head-spring of the false minde; but if it perceiveth Light in it self, then is it the spring and ground of the sensible mind, and the right root of fire, as appeareth in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 3. downwards.</p>
                        <p>The fourth <hi>Form,</hi> numb. 4. is the <hi>Fire</hi> of the Eternal Nature; understand spiritual Life-fire: and that existeth from a continual conjunction or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning of <hi>Hardness</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> Understand, that thence ariseth the <hi>Painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; but the <hi>Splendor</hi> existeth from the Delight of the <hi>Free-will</hi>; where the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Delight [good pleasure]</hi> is acuated in the properties; then like a flash [<hi>of lightning</hi>] it shineth through the continued Conjunction, of the great meekness of the Unity, and the <hi>Fierceness</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> of the three first <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; for then it is in the Essence of the Conjunction, as if Steel and Stone were rubb'd together; whence the flash ariseth. Such a <hi>Flash,</hi> is the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Eternal</hi>; for it is the Revelation of Divine Motion, and hath the properties of Nature; and also the Revelation of the Unity of Gods effluence in it self. Now which of these two getteth predominancy, in that standeth the Life.</p>
                        <p>The splendor of the <hi>Fire,</hi> is the Light from the effluence of Gods Unity; and the Essence of the <hi>Fire</hi> is the out-flown will, which hath brought it self with the desire into such Properties. Thus in the out-flown firy will, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi>; and in the sensible sharpned Lights power from the Unitie, we understand the Spirit wherein God is revealed, and understood in the spiritual essence; and in the Fire two Kingdomes separate themselves, as the Kingdom of Glory from the efflux of Gods Unity, and the Kingdom of the properties of Nature; and yet [these two Kingdoms] dwell in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one. The Kingdom of Nature is in it self, that great <hi>Eternal Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> but the Light is the Kingdom of God; of which <hi>S John</hi> saith, <hi>The Light shineth in darkness, but the darkness comprehendeth it not.</hi> As day and night dwell in one another, and yet the one is not the other.</p>
                        <p>Thus from the Fires own propertie, comes the painful life, if it break it self off from the Eternal Light, and doth (as in the propertie of selfhood) enter the object; then is it only fantastick and foolish; even such as the Devills were, and the Souls of the Damned are; as appears Numb. 4. downwards.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>fift Propertie of Nature,</hi> is the second <hi>Principle,</hi> with its foundation understood; (as the Essence of the Unity in the Light-power) where in the out-flown Unity is a fire-flaming-love understood, whence existeth the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding-Spirit, with the five Senses.</p>
                        <p>The first three <hi>Forms</hi> are only the property to Life; and the fourth is the Life it self; but the fift is the true Spirit. When the fift property is revealed out of the Fire, then she dwelleth in all the rest, and changeth them all into her sweet love, that no more painfulness nor Enmity is discerned, but even as the day changeth the night.</p>
                        <p>In the first 4. <hi>Properties,</hi> is that life like the Devills; but when the Lights-power (as the second Principle) is revealed in the property, then is it an Angel, &amp; liveth in divine power &amp; holiness, as appeareth in the Num. 5. downwards.</p>
                        <p>The sixt Property, is the Understanding, as the <hi>Sound,</hi> where the properties in the Light stand all in an equality; then they rejoyce, and the power of the five Senses is manifest, and all the properties rejoyce in one another; and thus the love of the Unity leadeth it self into working, willing, sensibility, finding,
<pb facs="tcp:29914:330"/>
and <note n="(n)" place="margin">Highness <hi>Pochkeit.</hi>
                           </note> celsitude. Thus is there a contrary in the <hi>Eternal Nature</hi>; that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties existing therein, the love is known, and that there might be something, to be beloved, wherein the Eternal Love of Gods Unity may work, and God may be praised. For if the properties of life be penetrated with the Divine love-flame, then they praise the great love of God, &amp; yield themselves all again into the Unity of God. Such rejoycing &amp; knowledge could not be revealed in the Unity, did not the Eternal will bring it self into painfull moving properties.</p>
                        <p>The Seaventh Property, is that Essence, wherein all the other are essential; wherein they all act, as the Soul doth in the Body: wherein the Natural, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential, Eternal <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God (as the <hi>Mysterium Magnum</hi>) is understood; out of which the visible World, with its Essence and Creatures, did arise.</p>
                        <p>Thus by this Table is understood the hidden Spiritual world, as the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manifestation of God; from whence the Angels and Souls of Men recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their existence; therefore may they turn themselves to evill or good, for both lie in their Center.</p>
                        <p>This Spiritual world is no other than Gods revealed Word, and hath its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Eternity to Eternity; for therein is Heaven and Hell understood.</p>

                     <head>An Explanation of the third Table, MACROCOSMUS.</head>
                     <p>IN this Table is understood, how the hidden spiritual world hath made it self visible; and with its own breathing forth, hath made it <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Gegen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wurff.</hi>
                        </note> an object where the Eternal <hi>Principles</hi> are out-flown; and the powers therein became co-mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. For the External Nature is no other than an efflux or object of the Eternal Nature. The 4. Elements exist from the first 4 Properties of the Eternal Nature; as the Earth and grossness of all Essences of the Dark desire, where the other six Properties alwayes became co-material; as we may conceive of Metals and Powers, good and bad. The Air existeth from the motion of the <hi>Magnetick</hi> Impression; The Water from the abrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [breaking off] of the Impression, where Heat and Cold are in Strife; the Fire of the spiritual fire. The cold is Perceived in the <hi>Magnetick</hi> sharpness, as in the right root to Fire.</p>
                     <p>Before the seven Properties, above the Table, standeth <hi>Ground of Nature</hi> distributed in the three first Forms. And in the fourth and fift Form or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, is divided the word <hi>Pure Element.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With the word <hi>Ground of Nature,</hi> is understood the root of the 4. Elements,<note place="margin">The Pure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in the Elements; and is called the <hi>Quint-essence</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as the <hi>Tinctur</hi> of the equality of Nature: both are that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult <hi>Arcanum</hi> so much sought for.</note> as the four causes of Motion and Sensibility. By the word <hi>Pure Element,</hi> is understood the Temperature, or the equalitie of Nature, and the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; where the Light also is sensible, Moving, and Elemental. Thus is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, how the Eternal Element, as the motion of Divine Power is accuated by the ground of Nature, and revealed in the Light; where the pure <hi>Element</hi> is the motion of the inward Spiritual world; and at the Creation of the world, went forth into a Being; and is understood of the fift <hi>Essence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Paradise</hi> in the 6. and 7. Properties, signifieth the spiritual work in the Lights Essence; as a springing up, or spiritual growth, which at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, sprung up through all the 4. Elements; and out of the Earth formed it self into all manner of fruits, and changed all the properties of wrathfulness into a Temperature. But when those fierce properties, with the 4. Elements, were awakned, by the alienated desire, and false will in <hi>Adam,</hi> and attain'd the Dominion, then the Greening [springing forth] retyr'd back; that is, it remayned in the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the inward Ground, and is yet in the 4. Elements, but, in the Inward <hi>Pure</hi> Element only; and may not be attain'd but in the New-birth of the inner man; and in the material <hi>Tincture,</hi> wherein the Paradisical working is also manifest to our understanding.</p>
                     <p>This Table sheweth from whence all Essences [or Beings] in this world did arise; and what the Creator is; namely that the Creator hath been the divine power-world; which the <note n="(b)" place="margin">Monas</note> Unity, as the Eternal will, hath moved, which will, is God himself, But the Separator or Divider,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Einheit.</hi> God made first the Angelical light world, which in this place (after the Devills Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie) separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into this external vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible ess<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The seven Dayes, and seven Planets, signify the seven Properties of the spiritual world, The three Principle <hi>in Spiritu Mundi,</hi> as <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercurius,</hi> signifie the Trinity of the divine Revelation; as an everlasting Spring or Fountain, whereout all external Creatures are flown, do flow, and
<pb facs="tcp:29914:331"/>
will flow, even to the end of this time; and therein the Separator, with the 7 <hi>Properties,</hi> is understood. In this Table we see what proceeded from the 7 <hi>Properties</hi>; and how the Spiritual power hath brought it self into a Material one (as in the <hi>seven spaces</hi> downwards appears) whereby we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand whence Good and Evill sprung up in this World.</p>

                     <p>IN this Table, <hi>Man</hi> is held forth as a similitude of the Three worlds,<note place="margin">What Man is in his Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the Spirit of Error; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the New-birth, which Christ reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and will have, <hi>John 3.</hi>
                        </note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Soul, Spirit, and Body; What he hath been in the beginning, according to his Creation; What he is become in the fall, by the Spirit of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and What he will be in the new birth through the Spirit of Christ; which is a true Essential Image, out of the three Principles of the Divine Revelation; as from the outflown Word of the Divine will.</p>
                     <p>Man according to the Soul, is an Eternal Nature of the firing quality, as a spark out of the Center, from whence the fire existeth: If this ground cannot reach into the divine Light; then is it a Darkness of the <hi>Magnetick</hi> attractive desiring power; but if he reacheth out of the fire, unto the light, that his <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> desire feeds on the out-flown Unity of Gods Love; the ariseth from that fire the good true Spirit, even as light shineth out of a Candle. These are now two Principles, the <hi>Soul,</hi> in the fire of Eternal Nature; and the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the light of Divine Power. But the Body is the third Principle; as an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the visible world, from the Starrs and Elements, formed into an Image, out of the seven Properties of Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Soul hath the seven Properties of the inward Spiritual world,<note place="margin">N. B. The Difference between the Soul, and the Spirit of the Soul which without God, is but a dead Image.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Nature; But the Spirit of the Soul is without these Properties; for it standeth out of Nature, in Gods unity but through the Souls firie Nature, is manifested in the Soul; for it is the true Image of God; as an <hi>Idea,</hi> in which God himself worketh and dwelleth; so far as the Soul brings her desire into God, and submits unto Gods Will: if that be not done, then is this <hi>Idea,</hi> or Spirit of the Soul, dumb and actless [not working], standing like an Image in a Looking-Glass, which soon vanisheth, and hath no being, as it befell <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall. But if the Soul submits to God, and bringeth its Magnetick hunger into Gods Love, the Soul then attracteth divine Essence, namely, the Essential Wisedom of God; then her <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> becometh Essential in the Lights power, and obtaineth a pious life; as being then the true Temple of God, wherein Gods Unity is revealed and operative.</p>
                     <p>But if the Soul herself with her desire, bring in self-love; and with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire turn herself into the seven Properties, to try them; and feedeth on the vain delights of the seven Properties; then she extolls herself, and maketh to herself an <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                     <p>Thus the Unity, as the Element, was broken [or divided], and the four Elements strove for predominance; whereupon suddenly from without, fell in the Inequality, as <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> and the <hi>Astral</hi> division working in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and Gods wrath (according to the Dark worlds propertie) in the Soul; which caused in them (according to the Soul),<note place="margin">Thus was our Nature first corrupted: which ground was never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered.</note> Horror, Anguish, Necessity, and Eternal despair; and in the Body, arose Heat, Cold, Woes, Sickness and a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life. Thus Gods Image, the whole man, fell from his Ordinance; and became a disguised monster: and the awakened Properties presently began to set up their Government, with Envying, Murthering, Raging, Tearing and Tormenting. Love was changed into Pride and self-love; Desire, into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness; Sensibility, into Envy; and the lifes fire, into wrath: Thus was the Hellish foundation, in the whole Man, revealed, and ruled both in Soul &amp; Body.</p>
                     <p>Now this Hellish Foundation, is the Spirit of Errour; for which man must have been damned, had not the Divine mercy, the Serpent-treader (a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

There the true Spirit (as the human <hi>Idea</hi> and Gods <hi>Image</hi>) is renewed again, and filled with the Divine Love-Essence. And thus the human Soul, through Christs Soul and Spirit in that love and divine Essence, hath again attain'd an open Gate unto God.</p>
