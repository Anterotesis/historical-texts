            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO speak for a Play, if it can't speak for it self, is
vain; and if it can, 'tis needless. For one of
these Reasons (I can't yet tell which, for 'tis
now but the second day of Acting) I resolve to say nothing
for <hi>Aesop,</hi> though I know he'd be glad of help; for let
the best happen that can, his Journey's up Hill, with a
dead English weight at the Tayl of him.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Paris</hi> indeed, he scrambled up something faster
(for 'twas up Hill there too) than I'm afraid he will do
here. The <hi>French</hi> having more <hi>Mercury</hi> in their Heads,
and less Beef and Pudding in their Bellies. Our Solidity
may set hard, what their Folly makes easy; for Fools I
own they are, you know we have found 'em so, in the
Conduct of the War: I wish we may do so, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the Peace; but that's neither <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Business,
nor mine.</p>
            <p>This Play, Gentlemen (or one not much unlike it)
was writ in <hi>French</hi> about Six Years since, by one Monsieur
<hi>Boursaut,</hi> 'twas play'd at <hi>Paris</hi> by the French Comedians,
and this was its Fate.</p>
            <p>The first day it appear'd, 'twas routed (People seldom
being fond of what they don't understand, their own
sweet Persons excepted). The second (by the help of
some bold Knight Errants) it rally'd. The third it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd,
the fourth it gave a vigorons Attacque, and the
fifth put all the Feathers in Town to the scamper; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
<pb facs="tcp:43843:3"/>
'em on the fourteenth, and then they cry'd out Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>'Tis not reasonable to expect, <hi>Aesop</hi> should gain
so great a Victory here, since 'tis possible by fooling
with his Sword, I may have turn'd the edge on't. For
I confess in the Translation, I have not at all stuck to the
Original; Nay I have gone farther, I have wholly
added the Fifth Act, and crowded a Country Gentleman
into the Fourth, for which I ask Monsieur <hi>Boursaut</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
with all my heart, but doubt I never shall obtain
it, for bringing him into such Company. Though after
all, had I been so complaisant to have waited on his Play
word for word, 'tis possible even that might not have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
the success of it. For though it swam in <hi>France,</hi> it
might have sunk in <hi>England.</hi> Their Country abounds in
Cork, ours in Lead.</p>

            <l>GAllants; We never yet produc'd a Play,</l>
            <l>With greater fears, than this we act to day.</l>
            <l>Barren of all the Graces of the Stage,</l>
            <l>Barren of all that entertains this Age.</l>
            <l>No Hero, no Romance, no Plot, no Show,</l>
            <l>No Rape, no Bawdy, no Intrigue, no Beau:</l>
            <l>There's nothing in't, with which we use to please ye:</l>
            <l>With down right dull Instruction, w'are to tease ye,</l>
            <l>The stage turns Pulpit; and the World's so fickle,</l>
            <l>The Play-House in a whim, turns Conventicle.</l>
            <l>But Preaching here, must prove a hungry Trade,</l>
            <l>The Pattentees will find so, I'm afraid.</l>
            <l>For though with Heavenly Zeal, you all abound,</l>
            <l>As by your Lives and Morals may be found,</l>
            <l>Though every Female here o're flows with Grace,</l>
            <l>And Chast <hi>Diana's</hi> written in her Face;</l>
            <l>Though Maids renounce the sweets of Fornication,</l>
            <l>And one Lewd Wife's not left in all the Nation;</l>
            <l>Though Men grow true, and the foul Fiend defy.</l>
            <l>Though Trades-men cheat no more, nor Lawyers ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Though not one spot be found on <hi>Levi</hi>'s Tribe,</l>
            <l>Nor one soft Courtier, that will touch a Bribe:</l>
            <l>Yet in the mid'st of such Religious Days,</l>
            <l>Sermons have never born the Price of Plays.</l>

Linnen. Then discharge your Conscience, utter the truth from your

A Heart full of Treason; a Mouth full of Lyes, a Belly full of Drink,

employ it to break the Heathenish Match he proposes to you.
<stage>To Aesop.]</stage> Yes, Sir, My young Lady has been in Love these two
years; and that with as pretty a Fellow, as ever enter'd a Virgins
Heart. Tall, Straight, Young, Vigorous, Good Cloaths, Long
Periwigg, Clean Linnen: in brief, He has every thing that's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
to set a young Lady a Longing, and to stay it when he has
done: But her Father, whose Ambition makes him turn Fool in his
old Age, comes with a back stroak upon us, and spoils all our sport.
Wou'd you believe it, Sir? he has propos'd to her to day, the most
confounded ugly Fellow: Look, if the very thoughts of him don't set
the poor thing a crying? And you, Sir, have so much power with
the old Gentleman, that one word from you, wou'd set us all right
again. If he will have her a Wife; In the Name of <hi>Venus</hi> let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
her a handsome Husband, and not throw her into the pawes of a
thing that Nature in a merry humour, has made half Man half Monkey.</p>

                  <p>I live in a Village hard by, and I'se the Best Man in it, tho'
I say it, that shou'd not say it. I have good Drink in my Sellar, and
good Corn in my Barn; I have Cows and Oxen, Hogs and Sheep,
Cocks and Hens, and Geese and Turkeys; but the truth will out,
and so out let it. I'se e'en tyr'd of being call'd plain <hi>Roger.</hi> I has
a Leathern Purse; and in that Purse, there's many a fair half Crown,
with the King's Sweet Face upon it, God bless him: And with this
Money I have a mind to bind my self Prentice to a Courtier: It's a
good Trade, as I have heard say, there's Money stirring: Let a
Lad be but diligent, and do what he's bid, he shall be let into the
Secret, and share part of the Profits. I have not liv'd to these Years
for nothing: Those that will swim, must go into deep Water: I's
get our Wife <hi>Ione</hi> to be the Queens Chamber-maid; and then—
Crack says me I; and forget all my Acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the business. You who are the King's great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,

some little private familiar Intelligence, That your Wisdom is entring
into Treaty with the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of all Good and Evil, a fine Lady.
I have Travell'd, Sir, I have Read, Sir, I have Consider'd, Sir, and I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43843:15"/>
find, Sir, that the Nature of a fine Lady, is to be—a fine Lady, Sir;
a fine Lady's a fine Lady, Sir, all the World over; she loves a fine
House, fine Furniture, fine Coaches, fine Liveries, fine Petticoats, fine
Smocks; and if she stops there—she's a fine Lady indeed, Sir. But
to come to my Point.</p>
                  <p>It being the <hi>Lydian</hi> Custom, That the fair Bride should be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on her Wedding-Day, with something that may signify the Merit
and the Worth of her dread Lord and Master, I thought the Noble
<hi>Aesop</hi>'s Pedigree, might be the welcom'st Gift that he could offer. If
his Honour be of the same Opinion,—I'll speak a bold Word; There's
ne'er a Herald in all <hi>Asia,</hi> shall put better Blood in his Veins, than,

I hope your Honour will please to excuse me, since, to speak the
Truth, I get my Bread by't, and maintain my Wife and Children:
And industry, you know, Sir, is a commendable thing. Besides, Sir,
I have debated the business a little with my Conscience; for I'm like
the rest of my Neighbours, I'd willingly get Money, and be sav'd
too, if the thing may be done upon any reasonable Terms: And so
Sir, I say, to quiet my Conscience, I have found out at last, That
Flattery is a Duty.</p>

                  <p>Ay, Sir; a Duty: For the Duty of all Men is to make one
another pass their time as pleasantly as they can. Now, Sir, here's
a young Lord, who has a great deal of Land, a great deal of Title,
a great deal of Meat, a great deal of Noise, a great many Servants,
and a great many Diseases. I find him very dull, very restless, tyr'd
with Ease, cloy'd with Plenty, a Burthen to himself, and a Plague to
his Family. I begin to flatter: He springs off of the Couch; turns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
round in the Glass; finds all I say true; Cuts a Caper a Yard
high? his Blood trickles round in his Veins; his Heart's as light as his
Heels; and before I leave him—his Purse is as empty as his head. So
we both are content; for we part much happier than we met.</p>

make their Foes to tremble in her stead; Furnish their Heads with

Creditors with Bags of Gold, instead of Chasing 'em with Swords and
Staves; Be faithful to their King and Country both, and St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>A Crab-fish once her Daughter told,</l>

                  <l>She cou'd not bear to see her go,</l>

                  <l>To polish you like me;</l>
                  <l>It makes me almost mad to see,</l>
                  <l>Y' are still so aukward an ungainly Iade.</l>
                  <l>Her Daughter smil'd, and look'd askew,</l>
                  <l>She answer'd, (for to give her her due)</l>
                  <l>Pertly, as most Folks Daughters do:</l>
                  <l>Madam, Your Ladiship, quoth she,</l>
                  <l>Is pleas'd to blame in me,</l>

                  <p>You have a peevish, positive, covetous, old Father, and he
forces you to marry a little lean, crooked, dry, sapless Husband.
This Husband's gone abroad, you are left at home. I make you
a Visit; find you all alone; The Servant pulls to the Door; the
Devil comes in at the Window. I begin to wheedle, you begin
to melt; you like my Person; and therefore believe all I say; so

                  <l>A Peacock once, of splendid show,</l>
                  <l>Gay, gawdy, foppish, vain—a Beau,</l>

                  <l>He pleas'd her, though he made her smart;</l>
                  <l>He pierc'd her with so much Address,</l>
                  <l>She smil'd the Moment that he fix'd his Dart.</l>
                  <l>A Cookow in a Neighb'ring Tree,</l>
                  <l>Rich, honest, ugly, old—like me,</l>
                  <l>Lov'd her as he lov'd his Life;</l>
                  <l>No pamper'd Priest, e'er study'd more,</l>
                  <l>To make a vertuous Nun a Whore,</l>
                  <l>Than he to get her for his Wife.</l>
                  <l>But all his Offers still were vain,</l>
                  <l>His Limbs were weak, his Face was plain,</l>
                  <l>Beauty, Youth, and Vigour weigh'd</l>
                  <l>With the warm desiring Maid,</l>

                  <l>She'd have a young Gallant; so one she had.</l>
                  <l>But e'er a Month was come and gone,</l>
                  <l>The Bride began to change her tone,</l>
                  <l>She found a young Gallant was an inconstant one.</l>
                  <l>She wander'd to a Neighb'ring Grove,</l>

                  <l>An Aged Husband, Rich, tho' plain,</l>

                  <l>'Tis true, I'm but a young Philosopher,</l>

                  <l>The fond pursuit I soon observ'd of Riches,</l>
                  <l>Inclin'd me to enquire into their worth:</l>
                  <l>I found their value was not in themselves,</l>
                  <l>But in their power to grant what we cou'd ask.</l>
                  <l>I then proceeded to my own Desires,</l>
                  <l>To know what state of Life wou'd suit with them:</l>
                  <l>I found 'em Moderate in their Demands;</l>
                  <l>They neither ask'd for Title, State, or Power;</l>
                  <l>They slighted the Aspiring Post of Envy:</l>
                  <l>'Tis true, they trembled at the Name Contempt;</l>
                  <l>A general Esteem was all they wish'd;</l>
                  <l>And that I did not doubt might be obtain'd,</l>
                  <l>If furnisht but with Vertue and good Nature;</l>
                  <l>My Fortune prov'd sufficient to afford me</l>
                  <l>Conveniencies of Life, and Independence.</l>
                  <l>This, Sir, was the result of my Enquiry;</l>
                  <l>And by this Scheme of Happiness I build,</l>

                  <p>Alas, Sir, I have too great a Spirit ever to let Afflictions

lead me to my Business with you. Sir, my Husband was a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vener.</p>

                  <p>Sir, 'Tis not the first time I have been taken for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess,
my Mother us'd to say, as I lay in my Cradle, I had the
Air of a Woman of Quality; and truly, I have always liv'd like
such. My Husband, indeed, had something Sneaking in him (as
most Husbands have, you know Sir) but from the Moment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I set
foot in his House, bless me, what a Change was there! His Pewter
was turn'd into Silver; his Goloshoes into a Glass Coach, and his
little Travelling Mare into a pair of <hi>Flanders</hi> Horses. Instead of
a greasie Cook-Maid to wait at Table, I had four tall Foot-men,
in clean Linen; all things became new and fashionable, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
look'd aukward in my Family. My Furniture was the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of my Neighbourhood, and my Cloaths the admiration of the
whole Town; I had a Necklace that was envy'd by the Queen,
and a pair of Pendants that set a Dutchess a crying. In a word,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43843:21"/>
I saw nothing I lik'd, but I bought it; and my Husband, good
Man, durst ne'er refuse paying for't. Thus I liv'd, and I flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd,
till he sickned, and dy'd; but e'er he was cold in his Grave,
his Creditors plunder'd my House. But what pity it was to see
Fellows with dirty Shoes, come into my best Rooms, and touch
my Hangings with their filthy Fingers. You won't blame me,
Sir, if with all my Courage, I weep at this sensible part of my
Misfortune.</p>

                  <speaker>For.</speaker>
                  <p>But now, Sir, to my Business. Having been inform'd
this Morning, That the King has appointed a great Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
for the Marriage of young Women who have liv'd well, and
are fallen to decay: I am come to acquaint you, I have two strap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Daughters just fit for the Matter; and to desire you'll help.
'em to Portions out of the King's Bounty, that they mayn't whine
and pine, and be eaten up with the Green Sickness, as half the
young Women in the Town are, or wou'd be, if there were not
more helps for a Disease than one. This, Sir, is my Business.</p>

                  <l>She told 'em they were busie Folks,</l>
                  <l>And when her Husband wou'd have spoke,</l>
                  <l>She bid him kiss her Br</l>
                  <l>With that they all e'en gave her o'er,</l>
                  <l>And she persisted as before,</l>
                  <l>'Till with a deal of strife,</l>
                  <l>She swell'd at last, so much her Spleen,</l>
                  <l>She burst, like one, that we have seen,</l>
                  <l>Who was a Scrivener's Wife.</l>

This, Widow, I take to be your Case, and that of a great many
others; for this is an Age, where most People get falls, by clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
too high, to reach at what they should not do. The Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker's
Wife reduces her Husband to a Cobler, by endeavouring
to be as Spruce as the Taylors: The Taylor's brings hers to a
Botcher, by going as fine as the Mercers; The Mercer's lowers
hers to a Foreman, by perking up to the Merchants; The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's
wears hers to a Broaker, by strutting up to Quality; and
Quality brings theirs to nothing, by striving to out-do one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If Women were humbler, Men wou'd be honester. Pride
brings Want, Want makes Rogues, Rogues come to be hang'd,
and the Devil alone's the Gainer. Go your ways hone, Woman;
and as your Husband maintain'd you by his Pen, maintain your
self by your Needle; put your great Girls to Service; Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will keep 'em honest; much Work, and plain Diet, will cure
the Green sickness as well as a Husband.</p>

May it please your Majesty; <hi>Polidorus Hogstye,</hi> of <hi>Beast-Hall,</hi>
in <hi>Swine County, most humbly represents,</hi> That he hates to Pay
Taxes, the dreadful Consequences of 'em being inevitably these;
That he must retrench two Dishes in Ten, where not above six of 'em
are design'd for Gluttony.</p>
                  <p>Four Bottles out of Twenty; where not above fifteen of 'em are
for Drunkenness.</p>
                  <p>Six Horses out of Thirty; of which not above Twenty are kept
for State.</p>
                  <p>And four Servants out of a Score; where one half do nothing
but make Work for t'other.</p>
                  <p>To this deplorable Condition must your Important Subject be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
or forc'd to cut down his Timber, which he wou'd willingly
preserve, against an ill run at Dice.</p>
                  <p>And as to the necessity of the War, for the Security of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
he neither knows, nor cares, whether it be necessary, or not.</p>
                  <p>He concludes, with his Prayers for Your Majesty's Life, upon
condition, you will Protect him and his Fox-hounds, at <hi>Beast-Hall,</hi>
without e'er a Penny of Money.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I am your—most devoted Servant; and if you please to

                  <p>Why, you must tell him—'Tis natural to you to dislike
Folks at first sight: That since you have consider'd him better,
you find your Aversion abated: That though perhaps it may be
a hard matter for you ever to think him a Beau, you don't despair
in time of finding out his <hi>Iene scai quoy.</hi> And that on t'other
side; tho' you have hitherto thought (as most young Women
do) that nothing cou'd remove your first Affection, yet you have
very great hopes in the natural Inconstancy of your Sex.</p>
                  <p>Tell him, 'tis not impossible a change may happen, provided
he gives you time: But that if he goes to force you, there's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
piece of Nature peculiar to Woman, which may chance to
spoil all, and that's Contradiction: Ring that Argument well in
his Ears: He's a Philosopher, he knows it has weight in't.</p>
                  <p>In short, Wheedle, whine, flatter, lye, weep, spare nothing, it's
a moist Age, Women have Tears enough; and when you have
melted him down, and gain'd more time, we'll employ it in
Closet-Debates how to cheat him to the end of the Chapter.</p>

her Knees; and through thick and through thin, from Quarters

Hark thee, Stripling. Being in a very merry humour, I don't
care if I discover some Paternal Secrets to thee.</p>
                  <p>Know then; that how humoursome, how whimsical soever
we may appear, there's one fixt Principle that runs through almost
the whole Race of us; and that's to please our selves. Why do'st
think I got my Daughter? Why, there was something in't that
pleas'd me. Why do'st think I marry my Daughter? Why, to
please my self still. And what is't that pleases me? Why, my
Interest, what do'st think it shou'd be? If <hi>Aesop</hi>'s my Son-in-Law,
he'll make me a Lord: If thou art my Son-in-Law thou'lt
make me a Grand-father. Now I having more Mind to be a Lord
than a Grand-father, give my Daughter to him, and not to
thee.</p>

               <l>Upon a rotten one—if you'll believe us?</l>
               <l>Sir, I'll tell you what the Projectors did:</l>
               <l>They imbark'd Twenty thousand pound upon a Leaky</l>
               <l>Vessel—She was built at <hi>Whitehall;</hi>

I think they call'd her—the Patent—ay, the Patent;</l>
               <l>Her Keel was made of a Broad Seal—and the King</l>
               <l>Gave 'em a White Staff for their Main Mast.</l>
               <l>She was a pretty tight Frigat to look upon, indeed:</l>
               <l>They spar'd nothing to set her off; they Guilded her,</l>
               <l>And Painted her, and Rigg'd, and Gunn'd her;</l>
               <l>And so sent her a Privateering.</l>
               <l>But the first Storm that blew,</l>
               <l>Down went the Mast, a-shore went the Ship—</l>
               <l>Crack says the Keel, merry cry'd the Pilot;</l>
               <l>But the Wind was so high, his Prayers cou'd not</l>

               <l>Why, Sir, as for the Scoundrels, they, poor Dogs,</l>
               <l>Stuck by the Rack. The Captain gave'em Bread,</l>

               <l>That he did; he made the Boat-Swain's Mate,</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Because he took ne'er a Town last Campaign.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ae.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Why I don't care a Sous whether it was in's power or
not. But I have a Son at home, a brave chapping Lad; he
has been Captain in the <hi>Militia</hi> this twelve months, and I'd
be glad to see him in his Place. What do you stare for, Sir?
ha? I gad I tell you he'd scour all the Devils. He's none of
your Fencers; none of your <hi>Sa, Sa</hi> men. <hi>Numphs</hi> is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
that's his Play. You may see his Courage in his Face.
He has a pair of Cheeks like two Bladders; a Nose as flat as
your Hand, and a Forehead like a Bull.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ae.</speaker>
               <p>In short, Sir, I find if you and your Family were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>And so they wou'd, Sir, Clap me at the Head of the
State, and <hi>Numphs</hi> at the Head of the Army; He with his
Club Musquet, and I with a Club Head peice, we'd soon
put an end to your business.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ae.</speaker>
               <p>I believe you wou'd indeed. And therefore since I
happen to be acquainted with your extraordinary Abilities, I
am resolv'd to give the King an account of you, and employ
my Interest with him, that you and your Son may have the
Posts you desire.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

hope you won't refuse me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ae.</speaker>
               <p>Why 'tis in behalf of the two Officers who are to be
displac'd, to make room for you and your Son.</p>

               <p>The same. 'Tis pity they should be quite out of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;

               <p>Why do I think so?—These Courtiers will ask the

Army, can understand the business of Ploughing and Hunting.</p>

               <p>I perceive, Sir, by your Looks, what I have said has

more if you wou'd give it leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <stage>Taking his Hand.]</stage> Come, Sir tho' I am a stranger to you, I
can be your Friend; My Favour at Court does not hinder me
from being a Lover of my Country. 'Tis my Nature, as
well as Principles, to be pleas'd with the prosperity of mankind:
I wish all things happy, and my study is to make 'em so.</p>
               <p>The Distempers of the Government (which I own are great)
have employ'd the stretch of my Understanding, and the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of my thoughts, to penetrate the Cause, and to find out the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43843:38"/>
Remedy. But alas! all the product of my study is this; That I find
there is too near a Resemblance between the Diseases of the State and
those of the Body; for the most expert Minister to become a greater
Master in one than the College in t'other. And how far their Skill
extends, you may see by this Lump upon my Back. Allowances in all
Professions there must be, since 'tis weak Man that is the weak Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor.
Believe me, Senator, for I have seen the Proof on't. The
longest Beard amongst us is a Fool. Cou'd you but stand behind the
Curtain, and there observe the secret Springs of State; you'd see in
all the Good or Evil that attends it, Ten Ounces of Chance for
One Grain either of Wisdom or Roguery.</p>
               <p>You'd see perhaps, a Venerable Statesman, sit fast asleep in a great
Downy Chair; whilst in that soft Vacation of his thought, Blind,
Chance (or what at least we blindly call so) shall so dispose a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
secret Wheels, that when he wakes, he needs but write his
Name, to publish to the World some blest Event, for which his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
shall be rais'd in Brass.</p>
               <p>Perhaps a moment thence, you shall behold him torturing his
Brain: His thoughts all stretcht upon the Wrack for Publick Service.
The live-long Night; when all the World's at rest, consum'd in
Care, and watching for their safety, when by a Whirlwind in his
Fate, in spight of him, some mischief shall befall 'em, for which a
furious Sentence strait shall pass, and they shall Vote him to the Scaffold.
Even thus uncertain are the Rewards and Punishments; and even thus
little do the People know when 'tis the Statesman merits one or t'other.</p>

Sir, our Men in Business do the best they can?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ae.</speaker>
               <p>Many of 'em do: some perhaps do not. But this you may
depend upon; He that is out of business is the worst Judge in the
World of him that is in: First, because he seldom knows any thing of
the matter; and secondly, because he always desires to get his place.</p>
