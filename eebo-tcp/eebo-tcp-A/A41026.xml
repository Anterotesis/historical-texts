         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all the <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of all ſorts in theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> or elſewhere.</head>
            <p>FRIENDS and People, the Truth hath been declared among you; and the ſound of it hath been heard by you, and the everlaſting Goſpel hath been preached, and muſt be preached <hi>to all Nations, Kindreds</hi> and <hi>Tongues,</hi> that thereby the large love of God may be known, and made manifeſt unto all mankind, that he would not have any to periſh, but that they might all come to the knowledg of his truth, that they might be ſaved. And therefore he hath uttered forth his voyce from on high, and is cauſing the ſound of it to be heard in the Nations, that all people ſhould fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his Judgement is come, and coming; and his day is appearing after ſo long a time of darkneſs, and night of apoſtacy which hath been over the face of the earth; even over all Nations, Kindreds and People, for many ages and Generations paſt, <hi>So that darkneſſe hath covered the earth, and groſſe darkneſſe the people,</hi> and the way of the Lord hath been hid from them, which is a ſtraight way, and a way of holineſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the unclean cannot walk, but they have been walking in untro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den paths, &amp; in crooked ways, &amp; have been erred from the Lord, and from his way, dayes without number, nor have not known it. For their hearts have been filled with filthineſſe, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of uncleanneſſe, in ſo much that they have committed ſin with greedineſſe, and followed after the vanityes of their own minds, and walking after their own hearts luſts, to the ſatisfying thereof, and have been ſtubborn and rebellious children againſt the Lord, in ſo much that the Lord hath been againſt them, and his jealouſie hath been provoked, and his indignation hath been kindled againſt them, and his wrath hath been revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe and unrighteouſneſſe of men, who have holden his truth in the unrighteouſneſſe, and there hath not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106922:3"/>been peace to him that came in, nor to him that went out; for that which was manifeſted of God in them hath not been regarded, therefore hath the anger of the Lord been kindled, and his hand hath been ſtretched out ſtill, becauſe of all the abominations that have been committed in the Nations, and among the people: who have profeſſed the knowledge of his name; whereby his Name: hath been prophaned and blaſphemed among the Heathen round about, <note place="margin">2 Theſſ, 2.9, 10, 11.</note> and his Truth diſhonoured which they have profeſſed in words, but in works denyed, and held it in the unrighteouſneſſe; Who have not received the truth in the love of it (<hi>which God hath ſhewed unto them</hi>) nor have not obeyed it, but have taken pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs, &amp; therefore have they been given up to ſtrong deluſions, to beleeve lyes, and to commit iniquity with a high hand, and rejected the truth, and erred from it in their hearts, and ſtriven againſt it, and have loved their evil deeds, and their unrighteous wayes, and have not choſen the way of the Lord, nor ſerved the Law of the Lord with their hearts nor with their minds, <hi>but whileſt they have drawn nigh unto God with their mouths and with their lips have honoured him, their hearts have been removed far off from him:</hi> And their fear towards him hath been taught by the precepts of men; for the Precepts of God, and his Commands, and Law in the heart hath been diſregarded and caſt behind their backs; <note place="margin">Iſa. 5.24.</note> 
               <hi>And they have deſpiſed the word of the Holy One of Iſrael: Therefore as the fire devoureth the ſtubble, and as the flame conſumeth the chaffe, ſo their root ſhall be rottenneſſe, and their bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſhall aſcend as the duſt; for behold the Lord will come with fire, and with his Chariots like a whirl-wind to render his anger with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his rebukes with ſlames of fire; for by fire and by his ſword will the Lord plead with all fleſh, who have corrupted their wayes before him,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 66.15.</note> 
               <hi>and delighted in the thing that was not good, whereby he hath been provoked to anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now this is come to paſſe among all the Profeſſions in the world, who have had the Scriptures of truth which was declared and ſpoken forth by the Holy men of God, from the Spitit of Truth which was in them, and dwelt in them; whereby they were made able Miniſters (<hi>not of the letter but</hi>) of the Spirit; by which they were able to try, and judge of all Spirits whether they were of God, and ſaw many in their dayes who had gotten the true words, and had a form of godlineſſe but denyed the power, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106922:3"/>ſo they turned away from ſuch, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.5.</note> and did bear their teſtimony then againſt ſuch whom they ſaw ſeparating themſelves, being ſenſual having not the Spirit, and ſaw ſuch <hi>as were erred from the Spirit going in the way of Cain, to envy, and running greedily after the errour of Balaam, for gifts and rewards, and for the wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, And ſuch as ſerved not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bellyes, and preached for filthy lucre, and through covetouſneſſe with fained words made merchandize of the people, and were enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe God was their belly, who gloryed in their ſhame, whoſe and was deſtruction, who minded earthly things;</hi> And ſuch as had great ſwelling words of vanity, whileſt they themſelves were ſervants of corruption, and what they knew; <note place="margin">Iude 10.</note> 
               <hi>They knew na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally as bruit beaſts, and in thoſe things they corrupted themſelves. And falſe Prophets there was,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>as there ſhall be falſe Teachers amongſt you;</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>who privily ſhall bring in damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and many ſhall follow their pernitious wayes; by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhould be evil ſpoken of; And that perillous times ſhould come, that men ſhould be lovers of themſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traytors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God,</hi> 2 Timothy 3.</p>
            <p>Now all thoſe before mentioned, were, and are erred from the Spirit of truth which was in the Saints, the holy-men of God, who ſpake forth the Scriptures which declares of theſe things, that there was ſuch then, and that there ſhould be ſuch. Therefore now behold all People and ſee whether the things which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles prophecyed of concerning the falſe Teachers which ſhould come, be not come to paſſe abundantly in the Generations ſince their dayes, and alſo in this our age; inſomuch as the whole world hath been deceived by them, and led after them, and they have drawn them into many Religions, Sects, and Opinions, and ſet them to kill and murther one another about Religion, and about the Scriptures, and about their worſhips and Laws to compel men to them; being all erred from the Spirit, and from the Truth, and now know not the Truth, nor the Spirit which was in the Apoſtles and Saints, in which Spirit they worſhipped God in their dayes; and thoſe then that got Chriſts words, and the Prophets
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106922:4"/>words, and had not his Spirit (<hi>but were arred from it</hi>) and were out of the Life, and out of the Truth, which they did profeſſe in words; Theſe I ſay the Saints and true Chriſtians, who were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, and had his Spirit, with it they tryed the ſpirits of the other, who had it not; and found them not to be of God, nor to be beleeved, nor received, but turned from; for they were falſe Spirits and falſe Prophets which were gone out into the world from Chriſt, and from the Saints, that had the Spirit of God in them, by which they tryed the other, and found them to be of the world, and <hi>Antichriſts</hi> in the ſpirit of this world, and by it led, which cometh from him who is called, <hi>The god of this world who had blinded their minds.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">12 Cor. 4.</note> And ſo they were not true Prophets (or Seers) or true Miniſters of Chriſt, nor true Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, but falſe Teachers, falſe Miniſters, falſe Prophets and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists,</hi> and blind guids gone out into the world, in the worlds Spirit, and ſo with that ſpirit they could not confeſſe Chriſt come in the fleſh, though in words they might ſay he was come in the fleſh (as all the Prieſts and Profeſſors who are called Chriſtians, do now at this day in words confeſſe him) but not with the Spirit confeſſe him, as their fruits make it manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Now ſaith the Apoſtle, hereby know ye the Spirit of God. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh is of God; And every Spirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Christ as come in the fleſh is not of God, and this is the ſpirit of Antichriſt, whereof ye have heard that it ſhould come, and even now already is in the world. Ye are of God little children, and have over come them, becauſe greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world. They are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them. We are of God, he that knoweth God heareth us: Hereby know me the Spirit of Truth and the ſpirit of Error,</hi> John 1.4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. verſes. Now if thoſe had not had Chriſts words, and confeſſed him in words to be come in the fleſh, (while they were out of his life, and of another ſpirit) then the Apoſtle would not have called them <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> but he would have called them <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> but this was it which did differ them from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>unbelieving Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Heathers</hi> then; Namely, They had the words of Chriſt and the Saints, and the Prophets, and did profeſſe them as the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> do now
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106922:4"/>the Scriptures, but are erred from the life of Chriſt, and from the Spirit that was in the Saints who gave forth the Scriptures as they were then, whom <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes of, erred from the life and Spirit of Chriſt and the Saints, and ſo were Antichriſts, and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and falſe Teachers and Deceivers, which were gone out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, from the Saints life, and Spirit, and ſo the World heard them, (as they doe now the Prieſts and falſe Teachers) and they drew people after them then, from the Saints the true Church, and ſo ſet up falſe Churches and Religions in the World, and falſe worſhips in imitation of the true Church, and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and true worſhip of God, which is in the Spirit; and ſo by this means deceived people then at the firſt, and ſcattered them from God, and led them into confuſion, and darkneſſe, and diſorder, and errour, and ſo they broke out into many Sects, and Opinions, and Religions, and wayes of Worſhip; being once gone from the true Worſhip, which is in the Spirit of God alone, in which the unity is, &amp; where this is wanting there cannot be unity, nor gathering unto God nor true worſhip of God: And ſo after the Apoſtles deceaſe, they being erred from the true Spirit, who did profeſſe themſelves to be gatherers, could not gather unto God, but did draw people more and more from God; and ſo the whole world went after the falſe Prophets and falſe Teachers.</p>

            <p>Now are not thoſe grievous Wolvs &amp; Antichriſts that turn againſt ſuch, and rent ſuch, &amp;c. I ſay, are not theſe the grievous Wolves that are entered? and the Antichriſts that are gone out into the world? And is there not now very many of them Antichriſts and Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, among the Profeſſors, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Chriſtians, or Antichriſtians, Who are out of the life of Chriſt and the true Chriſtians? Such are not with Chriſt, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and ſuch gathereth not with him, but ſcattereth, and rents, and tears his Lambs, and Sheep, and perſecutes Chriſt, and his Church the true Chriſtians, who are followers of him, and are gathered to him by his Spirit in them. <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
               <hi>And if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Now the Antichriſts who are gone out into the World, and the Wolves come in Sheeps cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who inwardly are ravening Wolves; theſe have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt in them, nor are his, and ſo do turne againſt him and his; and they are of another ſpirit, which their fruits doe make manifeſt, whereby they may eaſily be known: The true Chriſtians knew them ſo merly, and did bear their teſtimony againſt them; ſo we know them now, and have, and doe beare our teſtimony againſt them, for their fruits have appeared more plainly in this, then in any age ſince the Aroſtles dayes.</p>
            <p>Therefore now come all ye Prieſts, Teachers, and Profeſſors in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106922:5"/>the world who are called Chriſtians; try your ſelves, and examine your ſelves, and ſee what ſpirit ye are of, who act theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned againſt the true Chriſtians, and Sheep of Chriſt, (who by you in ſcorne are called Quakers) who hear his voyce, and follow him; and yet ye confeſſe Chriſt in words to be come in the fleſh: But what ſpirit is this in you, by which ye are led to act theſe things wherein ye are now found? Is this the Spirit of Chriſt, or the ſpirit of Antichriſt gone out into the world, which lyes in the wickedneſſe, where there is many Antichriſts? and the world hears them, for they are of its own; but who are true Chriſtians and followers of Chriſt Jeſus, <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4.5.</note> (<hi>who is not of this World</hi>) and are led by his Spirit, theſe the World will not hear; nay, the Prieſts and Profeſſors therein, but cry againſt them, and ſpeake all manner of evill againſt them falſely for Chriſts ſake (by whoſe ſpirit they are gathered out of the world) and ſay hang them, away with them, they are not fit to live upon the earth; and ſo would murder, and kill, and deſtroy. By this we know that this ſpirit is not of God, nor doth confeſs Chriſt come in the fleſh, but denyes him who came not to kill, but to ſave mens lives; and to deſtroy the Devill, who was a murderer from the beginning; and therefore we cannot beleeve that ſpirit, but deny it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt it, to be that ſpirit of Antichriſt gone out into the. World; and the ſame ſpirit that was in the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Jewes,</hi> who would have Jeſus crucified, &amp; <hi>Barrabbas</hi> releaſed, (who was a Robber) for he was of their own ſpirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they chuſed him before Jeſus, who was of another Spirit, and bore witneſs againſt them for their hypocriſie, and therefore they hated him.</p>
            <p>And ſo now, they that are of God, in the Spirit of truth have tryed this ſpirit, which the Prieſts are in now, and have found it to be the ſpirit of errour, which neither knoweth God, nor loveth him; <hi>For he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4 8.</note> And ſo all who are found perſecuting for conſcience ſake, and compelling men to ſweare, and to worſhip God in their wayes which they have ſet up, and hating and envying of people, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling and reproaching for matter of Religion, and worſhip, &amp;c. are found to be of that ſpirit which is not of God, <note place="margin">1.3.12, 13.</note> which loves not nor knows not God, who is love; but is of the Devill, <note place="margin">Iohn 8.44.</note> who was a Murtherer from the beginning, and a Lyar from the beginning, <note place="margin">1 Iohn 2.22.4.20.</note>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106922:6"/>(and the father of all lyars, and murtherers, and Perſecutors, and envious ones) who is out of the Truth, from whence all lyes, and murther, and envy, and pride, and hatred, and perſecution, and ſtrife, and emulations, and enmity cometh, and all the deeds of darkneſſe: And he is <hi>the god of the world, who hath blinded the minds of all men of the World that beleeve not, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>

And againe, <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So Friends and people all, know this aſſuredly, that there is none ever comes to the Door, to find the Door, but who cometh to the Light which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned them withall, and <hi>every one that cometh into the World,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn 1.9.</note> to waite in it, and beleeve in it, and be obedient to it; For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>While ye have the Light,

               <note place="margin">Iohn 12.35.36.</note> So who are children of the Light, they ſee, and are not blind, (as the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites</hi> were, and as the Profeſſors now are, who beleeve not in the Light of Chriſt.) I ſay, they ſee the Door, which is Chriſt, from whence the Light comes, and enter in, and are his Sheep, who know the true Shepheards voyce; But all who deny the Light, and turn from it, and hate it, and ſpeake againſt it, they are the children of darkneſſe, who are unbeleevers, that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, the Door is ſhut againſt them, and the Light is their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: So they are all walking in darkneſſe, and wearying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and groping, and cannot find the Door, and ſo never come to enter in by it, nor to find reſt for their ſoules, but are ſtill without where the <hi>Sodomites</hi> are (ſhut out of <hi>Lots</hi> Door,) and without where the Dogs, and Unbeleevers are, and where the Whoremongers, and Murtherers, and Lyars are, and the Unclean, and Sorcerers, and the Idolaters are, <note place="margin">Iſa. 55.</note> 22 <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.

And till ye come to hearken diligently to the Light, ye cannot know your ſouls to live, but ſtill are the people that are dead while ye live, and that <hi>have eares, and hear not, eyes, and ſee not,</hi>

And here are all the Profeſſions of the World, and their Prieſts, and Teachers, (even the higheſt of them all) who denyes that Chriſt Jeſus hath inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened every one with his true Light, and tell people its a naturall Light, and a deluſion of Sathan to draw them from it, and ſeduce them, and tells them its not ſufficient to lead to ſalvation, &amp;c.

            <p>And now People, Let me tell you who comes to the true Light which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned every one with that are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106922:7"/>come into the world, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. and beleeve in it, and wait in it (which is true and ſpiritual) it brings people to ſpiritual ſeeing, and lets them ſee and diſcerne the thoughts and intents of their hearts; and who comes to believe in this Light, and hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to it, they come to hear the voyce of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live; So theſe are they that come out of death, and come to be made alive unto God; then they are not dead men, <note place="margin">Ephef: 2.1.</note> nor deaf men, as the Scripture ſalth, <hi>You hath he quickned, who were dead in your ſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And bring them to ſee the Light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, then will they not be blind men, who have eyes and ſee not, and ears and hear not, as the Scripture ſaith, <note place="margin">Iſa. 47.</note>, <hi>I will give him for a Covenant, for a Light unto the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, &amp;c.</hi> And again ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Buy of me eye ſalve that ye may ſee,</hi>

               <hi>and gold that ye may be rich, and white rayment that ye may be cloathed,</hi> then ye will not be blind men nor naked. And who believes in the Light of Chriſt (which is ſpiritual) which Chriſt hath enlightned them withall, it will bring them to underſtand the things of God, and gives to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, <note place="margin">1 Cor: 2.10, 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> and to know God. And this is it which reprooves, and judgeth the deceit, and pride, and hypocriſie, and errour in the heart, and the deſperate wickedneſſe in the heart, and the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe in the heart, and that which is contrary to God in the heart, and diſcerns the thoughts and intents of the heart, and ſo brings people to be of an underſtanding heart, and to diſcern the ſpiritual things of God, <note place="margin">Heb. 3.10.</note> and not allwayes to be of thoſe that have hearts and underſtand not; <note place="margin">Rom: 1.21.</note> who are erred in their hearts, and know not the way of God, and are become vaine in their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and by their fooliſh hearts are deceived. And again who come to the Light, and wait in it, they come to taſte and ſavor the things of God, and come to taſte of the Heavenly giſt, and to taſt of the word of God, and the power of the world to come, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.3.5. And they come to diſcerne the things of God, from the things of the world, and come to diſcern between the Spirit of God, and the ſpirit of the world, and come to have Salt in themſelves to ſavour withall, that which will ſeaſon the heart
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106922:7"/>(which is not to be trodden under mens feet) for it is good to judge out that which hath corrupted the heart, <note place="margin">Matth: 5.13.</note> and deſiled it; <note place="margin">Mark 9.5.</note> The Light which ſhines in the heart, which hath no fellowſhip with darkneſſe, nor with the works of darkneſſe; And ſo this will ſeaſon it, and keep it cleah from corrupting, as every one minds it, and keeps to it, to love in, and beleeve in it, and obey it; For there is nothing that is corrupt brought forth, <note place="margin">Matth: 15.11.</note> but firſt is in the heart, for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 7.20.</note> 
               <hi>thefts, murthers, adulter yes, uncleanneſſe;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth: 15.18.19</note> 
               <hi>for that which goeth into the man doth not deſile the man, but that which cometh out;</hi> So eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one whoſe minds be turned into the Light of Chriſt, this will bring you to taſte, and ſavour, and diſcern between the good and the evil, the Light and the darkneſſe, the precious and the vile, the holy and the prophane, the clean and the unclean, the right hand and the left; the Sheep and the Goats; him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not, between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſweareth, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.2.</note> and him that feareth an oath. So then ye will not put darkneſſe for Light, and Light for darkneſſe; nor call evil good, nor good evil; <note place="margin">Mal: 3.15.18</note> nor put bitter for ſweet, not ſweet for bitter; nor call that which is corrupt holy; nor the proud happy, as they did in former times (who wereblind) and as they do now, who deny the Light of Chriſt, and teach peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that it is but a natural light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are they now who are blind, and without diſcerning, and taſting and ſavouring of the things of God; and their hearts are hardned through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſle of ſin, and they are without feeling.</p>
            <p>Now the Light of Chriſt wil let you ſee what is in your hearts, and in your minds, and in your thoughts, and what ye think, and what ye ſpeake, <note place="margin">Luke 6.45.</note> 
               <hi>For a good man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>out of the treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth good things, and an evill man out of the treaſure of his heart bringeth forth evill things;</hi> Now whoſe minds are turned to the Light of Chriſt within, it will let you ſee what treaſure you have in your hearts, and what ye do bring forth; or whether ye be the good men which brings forth good things, good words, and good deeds, good deſires, good motions, good thoughts, and good affections; or whether ye be the evil men (who out of the evil treaſure of your hearts) brings forth the evil things, as evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This will let ye ſee whether the good things be there, or the evil
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106922:8"/>things be there at all times (if ye do minde it) and ſhew ye what ye bring forth, and what ye keep in ſecret, which ye would not have ſeen, for that is the evil doer, who doth not doe truth, that would not have his work ſeen, and ſo doth not love the Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Light will reproove him; but the good man who doth truth, he loves it, and brings his deeds to the Light to be proved. And the Light will let ye ſee if there be any deceit, <note place="margin">Ier: 17.9.</note> or hypocriſie in your hearts, or deſperate wickedneſſe there, and it will reprove for that, and will ſearch your hearts, and try your Rains, and ler you ſee what rules there, and what Reigns there, in your hearts, and in your minds, and deſires, and affections; and whether ye have any Rains to hold in your deſires and affections, that they ſhould not run into the luſts and vanityes of the world, and of the fleſh; yea, or nay. And it will let ye ſee whether ye have the girdle of truth to girt up the loins of your minds to God; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are at liberty and looſe, and toſſed to and fro, as the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Sea, yea, or nay. And it will let ye ſee whether ye have a Bit and Bridle for your tongue, <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.9.39.</note> which otherwiſe will be unruly, and thereby you will offend, <note place="margin">Iames 1.26.</note> if ye uſe it as your own; I ſay the Light will diſcover this unto every one whoſe minds are turned to it, <note place="margin">Iames 3.2.</note> and wait in it, and who hearken diligently to it, and beleeve in it, and obey it; they ſhall come to know their ſouls to live; For obedience to it is life, and diſobedience to it is death.</p>
            <p>And now whileſt men who have been in power to govern the Nations, have been making laws without to bind mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to limit them, and compell them to this or that worſhip, and have been talking long of Reformation and Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have gathered-Churches (as they have called them) and made Leagues and Covenants, and Aſſemblies of Divines (ſo called) to make confeſſions of Faith, Catechiſmes, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Forms of worſhips (as Directoryes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to worſhip God by, and to ſettle Church-Government, and have Laws that all that would not worſhip God in ſuch a way, and ſuch a Form as they had ſet up, to fine them, impriſon them, and whip them, and ſtock them, and baniſh them, and hang them, or cut oft their ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe have been the Reformations in the world, in the Apoſtacy, among the Apoſtate Chriſtians, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles' Among the Proteſtants and Papiſts, with their Laws, and Statutes, and

            <p>But now mind People, what hath all this produced? For they have all this while begun at the wrong end of the work, and their labour hath been in vain hitherto, and will be; and little Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hath been wrought among people all this while, for many himdreds of years paſt, but one Generation hath exceeded another in wickedneſſe, pride and covetouſneſſe, drunkenneſſe, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, deceit and hypocriſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, what hath it brought ſorth, but to make people hypocrites, not Saints, falſe Chriſtians, not true Chriſtians; and Wolves in Sheeps cloathing; to profeſſe God and Chriſt in words, but in works to deny God; And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Scriptures to be their Rule, and yet they are walking as contrary to that which they call their Rule, as if they had no Rule at all, nor no Scripture at all, nor no Law at all to bind them to this or that form of worſhip.</p>
            <p>Theſe are but <hi>Babels</hi> builders, whoſe work the Lord is comingto confound &amp; throw down, &amp; their languages is already confounded; and they are all on heaps ſtill; After all their buſtle and ſtir, which the many builders have made for many hundreds of years about Religion, and worſhip, and Reformation; and they are as far from the true worſhip as they were: And people do not yet know the Truth, nor the true worſhip of God which is in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <note place="margin">Iohn 4.23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>And the Lord is ſeeking ſuch to worſhip him, as worſhip him in the Spirit, and in the Truth, for God is a Spirit.</hi> But all the world, Teachers, and the Prieſts, and Profeſſors therein, do not know the Spirit of God, nor know not the truth yer, and ſo were not like to worſhip God in it, or to find him in their outward worſhips, and carnal Ordinances, and Doctrines, and Commandements, or in the outward Obſervations and Forms, which men have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Nay, <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all this while people have been erred from the Spirit of God, and the Wolf hath been covered with the Sheeps cloathing, <note place="margin">Matth: 7</note> and the Wolves nature ſtill retain'd and lived in, and not the

               <hi>They have been all inwardly ravening Wolves,</hi> and not in the true Chriſtians nature, which is the Divine Nature, Innocent and harmleſſe, and ſeparated from ſinners. Now it hath been contrary in the world and is ſtill; they that depart from iniquity are made a prey of, and have been; even the innocent and harmeleſſe Sheep, and Lambs of Chriſt have been rent and torn by the Wolves, who did appear like Sheep in the Sheeps cloathing, and had the Saints words in their mouths, and have made havock and ſpoyl of their goods, and impriſoned their bodies, where the life of Chriſt hath been made manifeſt in any meaſure, which is the Divine nature which the Saints and true Chriſtians were made partakers of, as ye may read in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Theſe I ſay have been made a prey upon, and perſecuted in all ages, ſince the days of the Apoſtles by the Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, which doth appear, that though they have had the Sheeps cloathing on, <note place="margin">Matth. 7.15, 16, 17.</note> yet they were inwardly ravening Wolves, and by their fruits they are ſeen, and now do appear plainly in this our age and day, wherein never more profeſſion hath been made ſince the days of the Apoſtles, then now hath been of late years, and yet their fruits have been as bad as the worſt; Even perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the innocent to death without cauſe, devouring of them, and making a prey of them, and accounting of them as ſheep for the ſlaughter all the day long.</p>
            <p>Theſe are not, nor never were the fruits of the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who were called Sheep of Chriſt; for it is contrary to their nature to perſecute any, to whip or impriſon any, to kill or deſtroy any, to bite and devour, and rend and tear to peeces like Dogs and Wolves (as this Generation hath done, <note place="margin">Ieremy 23.</note> of Prieſts and Profeſſors) But now this is not contrary to the Wolves nature to devour and rent and tear, <note place="margin">Iſa. 56.</note> nor contrary to their nature, <note place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> who come in ſheeps cloathing for the fleece, <note place="margin">Ezek. 34.2, 3.</note> and divine for mony, and preach for hire, <note place="margin">10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Therefore all ye Profeſſors of the Scriptures, and Teachers of the Prophets and Chriſts words, and the words which ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by tradition from your fathers. <note place="margin">Acts 13.41.</note> Its no wonder if the things declared of by the Prophets, Chriſt, and the Saints, be ſtrange to you, that ye neither know them, nor can believe them, ſeeing ye me all erred from the Spirit of the Father, even that Spirit which was in the Prophets, <note place="margin">Iohn 16.25.</note> Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, and Saints, which ſhews plainly of the Father, <note place="margin">13.verſe.</note> and ſhewed them things to come, which was, and now is the Saints Comforter, which Chriſt ſaid he would ſend; <hi>Even the Spirit of Truth, which ſhould lead them into all Truth, and ſhould bring all things to their remembrance.</hi>

            <p>This the Saints did receive in former times, by which they did plainly declare, <hi>what they had heard, and what they had ſeen, and taſted, and handled of the word of life;</hi> And this the Saints do now receive, even the ſame Spirit of the Father which was in the Saints, and is now in the Saints, and ſhall be in the Saints to the end of

We have not received the ſpirit of this World, but we have received the Spirit which is of God, by which we know the things which are freely given to us of God; which things we declare in the plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit, and not with words which mans wiſdome teacheth, comparing ſpirituall things with ſpirituall. But the naturall man perceiveth not the things of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe to him, neither can he receive them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> And ſo with this Spirit which we have receiv'd of God the Father, &amp; the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, doe-we ſpeaks of the things of God, which we have ſeen with him; by which Spirit the Saints are now led to declare forth the Truth to the world as it is revealed in them from the Father of ſpirits, as the Children of God did formerly by the ſame Spirit, who ſaid, <hi>As many as are the Sons of God,</hi>

Who receives a gift from God, they receive that which is perfect, that which is heavenly, that which is free, and that which comes from the Father of Lights, and ſo with that they ſee, and know, and can freely declare of the things of God, of the heavenly things, of that which is perfect, of that which is holy, of that which is true, of that which ſins not, of that which is born of God, which overcomes the World, as the Saints did of old, who ſaid, <hi>hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit,</hi> 1 John 4.13.

This is the true God, and eternall life; and this we have not of our ſelves, but this we have freely received from God, (as the Saints had) and this we freely declare, and teſtifie to the world as they did, that ſo others might come to receive of the ſame from him, in whom the <hi>fullrieſſe of the God-head dwells, of whoſe fullneſſe have we all recel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <note place="margin">Iohn 1.16.</note> and grace for grace.</hi> And ſo we have nothing to boaſt of, or glory in of our ſelves, for it is by grace, which is the free Gift of God, that we are what we are; that no fleſh might glory in his ſight, but that all the Honour, and the Praiſe, and the Glory might be given unto God alone, <note place="margin">Rom. 11.6.</note> from whence every good, and perfect gift cometh. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.29.</note>

            <p>And what Errour, and Hereſie, and wickedneſſe is there that can be named, that is not amongſt them? And you (Oh ye Preiſts and Teachers notwithſtanding all your outward Laws) who have had all theſe fair pretences to keep up your Forms of worſhips withour the power, even by your outward Laws, and carnal wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, as Stocks, and Whips, and Priſons, and Courts, and Leagues, and Covenants, and Oaths, and Proteſtations, and Aſſemblies of Divines, (ſo called) and Confeſſions of Faith, and Directories to worſhip by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this hath been but to hold up your Trade to preach for hire and filthy lucre, and for your bellyes, and to bear rule by your means over the people, and to keep them ſtill in the houſe of bondage, and darkneſſe, in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> to labour in the Brick, and ſo have been as the Taskmaſters over them, who would

And now the Lord hath heard their cry, and is riſen, and come to deliver his people from under you, even from under the mouths of ſuch devouring Wolves, who have made a prey upon them; And have cryed peace to people in their ſins and wickedneſſe, and have had mens perſons in admiration becauſe of advantage, and have kept and do keep many there.</p>
            <p>Now ye that have done ſo, have not been the Miniſters of Chriſt, but of Antichriſt; not of righteouſneſſe, but of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and Meſſengers of Satan; <note place="margin">2 Gor. 11.15.</note> though ye have transformed your ſelves into ſeveral forms and ſhapes, but your end is ſeen, and your reward will be according to your work; For though the ſtrong man armed have kept the Palace, <note place="margin">Matth 12.29.</note> and ſo the things therein hath been in peace, <note place="margin">Luke 11.12.</note> yet now a ſtronger then he is come <hi>(who is in us)</hi> even ſtronger then he who is in the world; And this is he whom we preach, Chriſt Jeſus the true Light, who hath enlightned every one that cometh into the world, which convinceth them of ſin, <note place="margin">Matth. 10.34.</note> and reproves for ſin, and ſpeaks not peace to them there, but ſends a ſword to take it away, and leads them out of ſin who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves and obeys him; and this is he who ſaves his people from their ſins, and deſtroys the work of the Devil.</p>
            <p>And he is come and appeared in his Servants and Miniſters, as of old; <note place="margin">Acts 26.18.</note>

            <p>Therefore do I exhort and warn every one of you in the fear of the Lord, to turn in your minds to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus within you; <hi>Who is given for a Light to the Gentiles, and for a new Covenant to the houſe of Iſrael,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And this we can declare forth freely unto the Nations round about, which we have freely received of him, even of his Spirit of truth, which was the promiſe of the Father, <hi>To lead us into all truth,</hi> whereby we are come to know the Leadings of the Spirit; and know that we are the Children of God, and taught of God; and led by his Spirit, and this is it which doth comfort our hearts, and aſſure us that we are his Children: <hi>And as many as are the Sons of God, the ſame are led by the Spirit of God;</hi> as the Children of this world are led by the ſpirin that is of the world, which is of him who is called <hi>the God of the world;</hi>

But all who receives it, and are obedient to it, they know the movings of the Spirit, and the teachings and leadings of the Spitit; and what it is to be borne of the Spirir, and what it is to live in the Spirit, and to walke in the Spirit, and to mortifie the deeds of the body by the Spirit, and ſo to be quickned by the Spirit; and what it is to be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106922:24"/>rayſed up from the Dead (<hi>with Chriſt</hi>) by his Spirit dwelling in them; <note place="margin">Rom.8.11.</note> 
               <hi>Now if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his.</hi> Therefore how can any of the Prieſts, and Teachers, and profeſſors in the world confeſſe Chriſt come in the fleſh, and know not the Spirit which is of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who ſay they have not the ſame Spirit that was in Chriſt &amp; the Apoſtles, and Saints, and ſay none have the ſame Spirit now which they had? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay truly they are not like to know that Spirit, who are erred from it, nor confeſſe Chriſt come in the fleſh, who are of another ſpirit, which not being the ſame, muſt needs be the ſpirit of this world (<hi>which is the ſpirit of Antichriſt</hi>) by which they cannot <hi>know the things of God; <note place="margin">1 Cor.2, 12, 13, 19.</note> for none knowes the things of God, ſaving the Spirit of God;</hi> neither were they like to diſcerne them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate them by the Spirit which they have not, but are erred from it; nor know the Scriptures which were given forth by the Spirit of God in the Prophets, Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, but give their private interpretation of them, and meaning which they add to them, which is of no private Interpretation; for the Spirit of the Lord was but one in all them that ſpoke them forth; and them who are in the ſame Spirit and Life now reads them, <note place="margin">Iſa. 9.24.</note> and knows them again as they were ſpoken, and knows the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of them, which is not private, but publique, and plaine, and manifeſt; But all who are of another ſpirit, they <hi>are erred not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Math. 2.29.</note> 
               <hi>nor the power of God</hi> (as Chriſt ſayd) and ſo they neither know that which hath been ſpoken by the Spirit of God formerly, <note place="margin">Mark 2. 24.</note> not what the ſame Spirit ſpeaketh expreſſely now, not what the Scripture meanes where it is ſpoken plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely. <note place="margin">Ezek. 3.</note> And truly it is no wonder now to ſee it ſo; <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1.</note> for people and their teachers are ſo farr erred from the Spirit by which the Scriptures were ſpoken forth, that it is become a ſtrange thing (<hi>which cannot be beleeved</hi>) even amongſt all forts of profeſſors who are called Chriſtians; For one to ſay he is moved by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord to ſpeake, <note place="margin">2 Pet.1.20, 21.</note> or to pray, or to doe any thing elſe <hi>(as the ſervants of the Lord were in former times)</hi> and this is become a ſcorne and deriſion amongſt them, which is a ſhame to them, and doth plainly maniſeſt what ſpirit they are of.</p>
            <p>Now if they were Children of God, or Sons of God (<hi>who are led by the Spirit of God, as ſome of thone profeſſe themſelves to be</hi>) mark this diligently, then muſt they needs know the meaning of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106922:24"/>the Spirit of God, and the leadings of it, otherwiſe it could not lead them and they not know it; And they would be in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall feeling, and taſting, and ſavouring, and diſcerning of the things of God in themſelves, and of the fruits of the Spirit in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brought forth, and try all Spirits with that, and know them, and love the good, and not mocke and ſcoffe at them. And ſo I ſay, then it would not be a ſtrange thing unto them, if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were come to know a motion, or leading by the Spirit of God in themſelves, which would manifeſt that they were the Children of God, and Sons of God; that they were of Chriſt, who have his Spirit, and are led by it, and ſo were true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and followers of Chriſt; and this would be a true reſtimony to themſelves, and to others; And then ſurely they, neither any of you would mocke, or ſcoffe, or ſcorne at any who can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the ſame.</p>
            <p>But now the want of this hath cauſed your nakedneſſe appear to your ſhame, and to the ſhame of all your blinde guides whom ye have ſo long been following for teaching, who have cauſed you to erre by their lyes, otherwiſe they might have brought you to have known the truth before now, and to have raught you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manners, then to have ſcoffed at it, and at thoſe who have declared it amongſt you, and walke in it (<hi>whom you in ſcorne call</hi> Quakers) and utter forth evill words, which corrupts the good manners; howſoever if it were ſo, that we were not in the truth, but in the errour, and not moved by the Spirit of the Lord, as ye ſay, but erred from it; then we were but where ye are.</p>
            <p>Now Friends this I ſay, and teſtifie in the Lord, and know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly that my teſtimony is true, and Gods witneſſe in all your Conſciences ſhall beare witneſſe to it to be true, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth will beare witneſſe to the ſame; That ye cannot ſay in truth (<hi>whom any of you doe ſcoffe, or ſcorne, or mocke, or reproach any of us, or others</hi>) that ye are moved thereunto by the Spirit of God, or led unto it by the Spirit of God, or taught by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to doe ſo, or taught by the Scriptures to doe ſo, which the holy men of God ſpoke forth, which ye call your rule. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can ye ſay, that ſcoffing, and ſcorning, and repſoaching, and perſecuting is the fruits of the Spirit of God. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is the fruits of that ſpirit in you which luſteth to envy, <note place="margin">Iames. 41.5.</note> which is of the Envious one, the enemy of all mankinde, the Devill, who
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106922:25"/>was a lyar, &amp; a murtherer from the beginning, &amp; out of the truth.</p>
            <p>And ſo it is he that moves ſome to murther now, and ſome to accuſe falſly, (<hi>for he is the accuſer of the Brethron</hi>) and he moves ſome to perſecute, and to hate, and to caſt into priſons now, <hi>(thoſe that live in the truth, and bear witneſſetoit)</hi> and he moves others to ſcoffe, and ſcorn, and ſpeak all manner of evill of them that are good now in theſe dayes, as he did of old; He it was that led <hi>Cain</hi> to murther his Brother <hi>Abell</hi> who was a righteous man, and it was he who moved <hi>Iſhmaell</hi> to mock at <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was the Son of promiſe; and it was he <hi>(the Devill)</hi> that moved the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> to ſay that Chriſt had a Devill, and that he caſt out Devills through <hi>Belzebub,</hi> &amp;c. and led them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure Chriſt, and put him to death, and <hi>Judas</hi> to betray him, and the High Prieſts and the reſt to ſpit upon him, and ſmite him, and Crown him with thornes, and mock at him, and to ſay haile King of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and to cry to have him crucified, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> to be releaſed, <hi>(who was a Robber)</hi> Now here are ſome of the fruits of that ſpirit which is not of God, nor of Chriſt Jeſus, but is againſt God, and againſt Chriſt Jeſus: And the Scripture ſaith <hi>Be not ye mockers, leſt your bonds be made ſtrong;</hi> and the Scriptures ſpeaks of ſome who mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed thoſe whom he ſent to warn them till his wrath broke out upon them to deſtroy them; now they that did ſo were not mov'd &amp; led by the Spirit of God, but by the evill ſpirit which is of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Therefore now all people try and examine your ſelves, and ſee what Spirit ye are of, and what Spirit ye are led by, by the fruites which ye bring forth: For this I ſay, and know and teſtifie, that there is no people upon the face of the earth, but they are either of the good Spirit, or of the evill Spirit; that is, they are either led by the Spirit of God, or by the Spirit of the Devill; and this is that, which doth nearly concern all people to know which of theſe they are led by, <note place="margin">Chron. 6.16.</note> which they may know by the fruits which they bring forth, <note place="margin">Iſa. 6.22.</note> for that is it which doth, and will make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt plainly, even as a Tree doth manifeſt it ſelfe what it is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evill, by the fruit it brings forth, for the fruit doth come from the ſap and vertue, (<hi>or as I may ſay, the ſpirit and life that is in the Tree</hi>) which comes from the Root of it, and ground in which it ſtands; <note place="margin">Math. 7.16, 17, 18, 19.</note> Now the Scripture ſaith, <hi>A good Tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good fruit,</hi> and again, <hi>If the Root be holy, ſo are the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:106922:25"/>then the fruit is good, there is the good Tree; but now if the root be rotten or corrupt, which ſtands in the curſed ground, then the branches will be rotten and corrupt, &amp; the fruit will be evill, or none at all, and there is the corrupt Tree, which is to be hewen down and caſt into the fire, and burned, for it is good for nothing elſe; And there is the plant which muſt be plucked up, which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>the Father hath not planted,</hi> for its a degenerate plant.</p>
            <p>Now people theſe Parables are true, therefore learn to read them, and underſtand them with the Light that Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned you withall, who ſpake them forth unto the World, who is the Gift of the Fathers love unto the World, whom he hath ſent a Light into the World, that all men through the Light may beleeve, which they that did beleeve in him who is the Light, he ſaid unto them, <note place="margin">Joh. 1.9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>it was given to know the Miſtery of the Kingdoms of God, <note place="margin">Math. 13.11.</note> but unto the World who did not then beleeve in him, they were Parables,</hi> and are ſo ſtill to this day.</p>
            <p>Now the Light which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned you withall is the Gift of God to you, and the manifeſtation of his Spirit which is given to you, <note place="margin">Titus 2.11.</note> and his grace which hath appeared unto you all, <hi>(which brings ſalvation)</hi> therefore receive it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in it, and be obedient to it, and ſo you will come to know the Miſteries of the Kingdome, <note place="margin">Rev.3.7.</note> and to underſtand all the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which Chriſt ſpake to the World, &amp; know the Key of <hi>David</hi> which opens and none ſhuts, and ſhuts and noman opens; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye will all remame in the dark World ſtill, which loves not the Light, but doth chooſe darkneſs rather; and they will remaine Parables to you ſtill, and ye will be ſhut up in the unbelief, and in the darkneſs, &amp; the Light will be your Condemnation for ever.</p>
            <p>Therefore in true love I exhort you all to conſider, in time oh all ye People, Profeſſors and Prophane, that ye may eſcape that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condemnation and Judgment which will come upon all the World of Unbeleevers, and ungodly men, who doe not beleeve in the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, who is come a Light into the World, but ſlight it, and hate it, (<hi>and ſay it is not ſufficient to lead to Chriſt, and to lead to ſalvation</hi>) which reproves you for ſin, and for your evill deeds, that ye might be turned from ſin and from the power of Sathan to God; otherwiſe your ſins, and your evill deeds, which now ye love rather then the Light which reproves them, will be ſufficient to ſinke ye downe into hell, and into the pit of perdition.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:106922:26"/>
            <p>I ſay now is the day of the Lords viſitation of his grace and mercy and love to your ſouls, that he would not have any of you to periſh, but all to come to the knowledge of his truth, which would ſurely ſave you, and ſet you free. Every one therefore ſeriouſly to ſit downe and conſider where ye have been, and what ye have been doing, and what ye are doing, and what ye have gotten, and what ye doe poſſeſſe of all that which ye have made profeſſion of, and what aſſurance ye have of the health, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and ſalvarion of your ſoules; and what certain Evidence and teſtimony ye have thereof in your ſelves, and to your ſelves; For that alone will ſtand you in ſtead, and be your comfort and ſtay in time of trouble, and in the houre of tempration, and when ye come to lye upon your death-beds, when all things elſe will fayle you, and yeeld ye no comfort nor helpe; nay your teachers whom ye have ſo long been following, cannot helpe you, nor comfort you, if ye have not the witneſſe in your ſelves, and teſtimony of Gods Spirit to beare witneſſe with your ſpirits that ye are the Children of God; all your profeſſion will be nothing worth, which hath only ſtood in words and out-ſide worſhips, and formes, without the power and life of that which ye have profeſſed.</p>
            <p>Therefore honeſtly conſider in time, and turne in your minds to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in all your Conſciences, which is Gods witneſſe in you all, which will either accuſe or excuſe you, and acquit, or condemne you in every thing that ye doe, or word ye ſpeake, or thought that ye thinke. If ye doe turne your minds into it, and waite in it, by it you will come to ſee, and examine, and truly to ſearch and try what is in your hearts and minds at all times, and ſo come to be acquainted therewith, and ſee what lodgeth there. Otherwiſe ye will not know, nor be acquainted with your own hearts, which will then deceive you, for they are deſperately wicked, and ye will not know that wickedneſſe that is there, which is ready to joyne to any thing that is evill, and to be led into any errour; but as ye doe minde that of God within you, which will ſearh your hearts, and try your reynes. And in this Condition have people been, and are ſtill in the World, and in all their profeſſions there and worſhips, which ſtands in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſervations, and carnall ordinances, and worſhips ſet up in mens wills, and practiſed in the worlds ſpirit, which knowes not God, nor the things of God, and are in their own wills, and led
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106922:26"/>by that ſpirit. So their hearts &amp; minds are drawn out into thoſe things, to looke at the things that are ſeene which are temporall, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.16.</note> which are of the World, from that which may be known of God, which is manifeſt in them, from the things which are not ſeene, which are eternall, and with which they ſhould know the true, and living God, <note place="margin">Acts 17.23.</note> whom they have for a long time been thus ignorantly worſhipping, not knowing of him, though he was not far from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, neither have they known the true worſhip of him, which is in the Spirit, &amp; in the truth, in wch the true Church ſtands and is gathered our of the world, and out of itsworſhips &amp; wayes and cuſtomes, which are corrupt, and are upholden by mens lawes, made in their corrupt wills, whereby they have compelled people to their worſhips which is not true, but are all erred from the truth, and true worſhip, and true Church which is in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the pillar and ground of truth, wherein they worſhip God in the Spirit, and in the truth, and ſo have found the Father, <note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> who is ſeeking ſuch to worſhip him in this his day, which now is dawned after the long night of Apoſtacy &amp; darkneſs which hath been over all people, ſo that the whole earth hath been covered with darkneſſe, and the vayle hath been over all faces, and the whole Earth been corrupted by the abominable worſhips that hath been therein in this time of darkneſſe in the falſe Church, which is the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the mother of harlots, and the abomination of the Earth <hi>(gotten up in the roome of the true Church)</hi> with her falſe worſhips in Imitation of the true worſhip, whereby all nations have been drunken with the Cup of her forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; <note place="margin">Rev. 17.2.18.</note> And all the Emperours, Kings, Princes and Judges, <note place="margin">18.3.9.</note> and Rulers of the Earth, <note place="margin">19. &amp; 19.</note> and they have all been making of Lawes to uphold her, and ſhe hath ridden upon them, for they have been the beaſt which have carried her; <note place="margin">Rev. 13.4.</note> and the beaſt and the falſe Prophet <hi>(which receives their power from the Dragon) have made warr with the Saints,</hi>

               <hi>and overcome them; and their blood hath been ſhed by her, which hath cryed, and doth cry unto the Lord for vengeance, and the Lord hath heard the cry of it. And he is now riſen to take vengeance upon all them that dwell upon the earth, where the Devill hath been their King,</hi>

And all her Merchants ſhall cry woe and alacke, who have been made rich with her merchandize: and the great City ſhall fall in which they have been trading; which is Babylon the mother of them all;</hi> in what forme, or profeſſion, of ſhew, or colour, or dreſſe ſoever they have appeared; <hi>For the houre of her Judgement is come, and ſtrong is the Lord that Judgeth her.

And the decree of the Lord is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and gone forth againſt her, <note place="margin">Rev. 8.4.</note> and the warre is openly proclaimed againſt her, and the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophets who have gove forth to deceive. <note place="margin">Rev. 17.4.</note> And the Lambe is come forth, and his ſword is drawne, and ho is riding on conguering and to conquer, and with him are his Saints, who are called, and faithfull, and choſen, who are made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow him whither ſoever he goes. <note place="margin">Rev. 14.4.</note> And the victory is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, the Lambe and the Saints ſhall have the victory; and their weapons are not carnall, but ſpirituall: For with the ſword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which proceeds out of the mouth of the Lambe ſhall all his enemies be ſlaine; and great ſhall be the day of ſlaughter of Gods enemies, who have the Beaſts marke, or his name, or are of the number of his name; <note place="margin">Rev. 21.27.</note> they ſhall all be ſlaine both ſmall and great; even all whoſe names are not written in the Lambs book of life, who was ſtaine from the foundation of the world.</hi> And this the Lord is now bringing to paſſe in this his day, <note place="margin">Zach. 4.6.</note> not by might, nor by power, but <hi>by my Spirit will I doe this,</hi> ſaith the Lord.
