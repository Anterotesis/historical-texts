            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Should not have ſuffered this Excellent Medicine, call'd the <hi>Vatican Pill,</hi> to have been detained ſo long from Publick Knowledge, and Uſe, had I not Expected, that ſome perſon of greater Authority and parts then my ſelf, ſhould have given it its deſerved character, and thereby a more hopefull and univerſal reception. But I find the cauſe of this reſerve, to have been the <hi>fear of Cenſure,</hi> becauſe this fruitfull Age, doth every day prodigally create, <hi>More Doctors</hi> then <hi>Maſters of Art</hi>: But this conſideration hath not altered my purpoſe of doing this intended good; for it is not a <hi>Strange thing, acquired</hi> by <hi>long Study, hard labour, and far travel,</hi> which I offer, nor to be vouch'd by a volumn of <hi>precarious teſtimonies</hi>; But I only recommend to the uſe and benefit of infirm Perſons, a <hi>Medicine,</hi> which from many years before my time, unto this day, hath (by infinite Experiments) advanc'd its fame, and repute, above Detraction: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well known to many Perſons of great quality (who (the more the pitty) Keep and value it as a <hi>Grand Secret</hi>) to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the moſt powerfully operative Remedy</hi> of this kind, in all extreams, which Europe in this Age hath afforded.</p>
            <p>Its Original was from the <hi>Imperial Court</hi> in Germany,<note place="margin">Orige.</note> the Author (famous as well for his great learning as his Dignity) was Archiater or Cheif Phyſitian in ordinary to the Emperour<note n="*" place="margin">1693. Es tempore Lues Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerea Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniam Obrepit.</note> 
               <hi>Maximilian</hi>; from whence it was at firſt called the <hi>Imperiall Pill.</hi> Afterward being transferr'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and new proofs given continually for many years together of its wonderfull Vertues, it was by the Speciall command of<note n="*" place="margin">Anno 1534.</note> 
               <hi>Paul the third,</hi> committed to (that Noble treaſury of learning) the <hi>Vatican Library,</hi> that it might not be loſt to Poſterity, and ſo it was called the <hi>Vatican Pill</hi>; and the rather, to diſtinguiſh it from the Imperiall Pill of <hi>Meſue</hi> then Extant; ſince which, in the time of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the 8th. it was reviſed by the moſt acute Phyſitians then being, from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103697:2"/>
whom it received a very great improvement both in the <hi>Preparation</hi> and <hi>Operation</hi>: And was made more appropriate to ſome ſevere Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, then raigning, and at this day diſtributed univerſally into all Europe.</p>
            <p>The Nature of this Pill,<note place="margin">Natura.</note> is to Penetrate, Digeſt, cleanſe, attenuate, diſcuſs, and open all obſtructions, to attract into the Stomack and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines; and then carry off from thence all crude, indigeſted, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted humours, and ſuch juices as are unprofitable to the body, yet not by any violent, acrimonious quality therein, which may furiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Expulſive faculty to a promiſcuous diſcharge of all humours at once, both good and bad; and ſo <hi>with the Tares, root out the Wheat too</hi>: But being received into the ſtomack, doth vertually convey it ſelf into all parts of the body, and by a certain familiarity and affinity with each humour, and aſſimilation of Subſtance doth draw forth and expel each offending humour, and whatſoever is Supervacaneous, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable to the conſervation of the whole. And by this Energy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, doth cure <hi>all humoral diſeaſes.</hi> This is the true genuine property and <hi>Nature</hi> of this our <hi>Vatican Pill</hi>: Which both in the Election of materials,<note place="margin">Praepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</note> and a peculiar and moſt elegant Preparation, is brought into the higheſt perfection of any ſuch medicine now in being. Every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ingredient herein being ſingly extracted by a diſſolvant analogous to its own Nature; whereas Spirit of Wine, the common diſſolvant of extracted Medicaments, cannot equally act upon all; for ſome being of a more hard and fix'd ſubſtance, reſiſt its force, whilſt others of a more airy and light body, have their volatile Eſſences totally exhal'd and devout'd by it.</p>
            <p>So that ſuch an imperfect compoſition, muſt conſequently have an imperfect and deficient operation, whilſt ours, ſeverally imparting their eſſences to appropriate, and adapted Menſtruums, or diſſolvants, have their virtues exalted to an exquiſite perfection, at length all thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated liquors being conjoyn'd, are united into that <hi>Maſs</hi> which is the true Subſtance of this <hi>famous Vatican Pill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vertues hereof are manifold,<note place="margin">Vires.</note> it being as was ſaid, extenſive to all parts of the body, (viz) from the ſtomach, to the Liver, Spleen, Gall, Meſentery, and all other parts ordained to convey to the Body its nouriſhment, thence to the more remote and ſolid parts, as the Muſcles nerves tendons, joynts; and habit of the body.</p>
            <p>It works by ſtoole, and urine; by ſweat when required, and alſo by vomit, when the ſtomack is overcharged, elſe not; by which means the body is diſcharged of all Superfluous, corrupt, unneceſſary, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103697:2"/>
humours which tend to the forming of diſeaſes, the whole maſs of the blood purified, all obſtructions of what kind, or in What part ſoever opened, and the cauſe thereof removed; The ſtomack is cleanſed from all crudity, and foulneſs; loſt appetite reſtored, dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion perfected; fumes, windineſs, heavineſs, ſwelling, and fluſhing heats after eating, diſſolved; alſo difficult breathing, movable pains, in the joints, back, hips, leggs, and elſewhere; palpitation of the heart, faintings, ſick qualmes, troubled and uneaſ, ſleeps, ſtinking breath, violent, and laſting pains in the head, Catarrhs or rhewms falling upon the lungs, and other parts; and all evills which may any way happen to the Reins, ſeminall veſſels, and other parts, deſigned for generation in man or woman; and in a word (not to trouble the Reader with a tedious Catalogue of Diſeaſes) all ſoul mixtures of the blood, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humours, diſcraſy, or intemperature of the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body, cauſed either by Surfeits in Eating, drinking, labour, watching, exerciſe, paſſions of the mind, immoderate venery, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paine; or whatſoever elſs may (by oppreſſion of the Spirits, or diſſipation of naturall heat) drive the body into extreams, pervert the courſe of nature, create or nouriſh Diſeaſes, are by vertue of this <hi>Excellent Medicine,</hi> wholly ſubdued, carried off, and the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to is wonted health and Vigour. Theſe are the generall vertues of this Pill.</p>
            <p>In the uſe of which, (that I may not amuſe the Reader with many unneceſſary Rules) obſerve,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſus I.</note> That the ſtomack be not overcharged with meat or drink when you take this Pill, for thereby is its operation diſappointed, and the ſtomack diſabled to work a due concoction of the meat.</p>
            <p>That the Doſe or portion hereof to an ordinary conſtitution,<note place="margin">2.</note> is 5 or 6. Pills; and more or ſewer, as each one finds their own ability; which is eaſily found, by begining with a Small Doſe, and encreaſing, as you find your ſtrength to anſwer the operation of them; and ſo continue with that proper doſe. Having now found the quantity agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your Body,<note place="margin">3.</note> Obſerve well, that they are not to be taken all at once but ſome at night, &amp; the reſt in the morning. As for Example, if your Doſe intended be 3 Pills or 4, take one at night, going to bed (3 or 4 hours after a very light Supper;) and the reſt in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning following. If your Doſe be 5, 6, or more, take 2 at night, and the remainder in the morning; with this farther Caution, that your morning doſe be double the quantity at leaſt, of thoſe you take over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and the reaſon is this (viz) that this little doſe taken at night, is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103697:3"/>
intended only as a preparative to tnoſe you reſerve for the morning; that is, to looſen, diſſolve, and make thin ſuch groſs, and tough humours, as lye deep, and remote from the immediate attaque of the Medicine, and diſpoſe them to Evacuation, which is performed by the following greater doſe, more Effectually, and with more eaſe and profit to the body, then if the whole number had been taken at once.</p>
            <p>After that your Pills taken in the morning,<note place="margin">4.</note> have wrought once, you may drink either clear poſſet drink, or thin broth, and not before; and drink not too often, leaſt they be forced through the bowels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have perfected their work.</p>
            <p>Let your diet be of good nouriſhment,<note place="margin">5.</note> eaſy of digeſtion, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. Salted meats, old cheeſe, and ſuch courſe fare are to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, during the uſe of the Pill.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the generall rules, which I propound in the uſe of this our <hi>Vatican Pill</hi> Which being duly obſerv'd, I am well aſſured, that they who ſhall uſe them, will find happy Succeſs, and the deſired effects thereof; and ſhall have cauſe to bleſs God for them, in whoſe hands only are the iſſues of life.</p>
            <p>There are yet ſome particular Diſeaſes,<note place="margin">Scurvy.</note> which by a ſpecifick, on more appropriate Quality they Cure, in which is required a peculiar Regiment, or order, in the uſe of them: The firſt, whereof is the <hi>Scurvy.</hi> A Diſeaſes which holdeth a ſecret and dangerous faction in the body; and though its firſt aſſaults are light and more tolerable, yet it inſenſibly undermines it, and brings on certain (though gradual) ruine: its eaſier ſymptoms, are looſe teeth, ſore gums, and mouth; little Spots in the skin, faintneſs, and ſtiffneſs of the Limbs. Which do in time amount to ſoul ulcers, larger, purple, or dark and dusky ſpots in divers parts, whitiſh cruſty ſcabs like leproſy, hard to cure; ſharp pains in the legs, arms, and ſolid parts, which are ſtill attended with wearyneſs and indiſpoſition to move; the whole oeconomy of the ſtomack is deprav'd, appetite loſt, much crudity and indigeſted matter load the ſpleen and parts adjacent, which cauſe ſtubborn obſtructions there, from whence the reall <hi>Miaſma,</hi> or <hi>Originall infection of the Diſeaſe</hi> ariſeth; and yet— <hi>in varias ins eſt tranſire figuras</hi>: it takes upon it the ſhapes of other Diſeaſes, as Apoplexy, Palſey, Feavers, Agues, Dropſy, Pluriſy, intolerable Head-Ach, Gout, Cholick, Gripings in the guts, and many others, and often the Pox. Which it ſo exactly imitates, that they may be judged to be twins of the ſame Parent: Yet in all theſe, it retains its Scorbutick Idea, tis ſtill the Aſs in the Lyons skin; and though it puts on theſe various forms, tis ſtill the Scurvy. Which by the uſe of this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103697:3"/>
Excellent Pill is perfectly cured; and they are to be uſed according to the rules before preſcribed; only the drink here appointed, is to be conſtantly taken during the cure, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take of Egrimony, Tamaris, and Roman wormwood each 4 great handfuls cutt Small, Saſſafras ſhaved thin, half a pound; Juniper berries Six onnces. Juices of water-creſſes; brooklime, and Scurvy graſs, each a quart; beat your berries Small and put them all into a Rundle<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of four gallons of ordinary beer or ale; let it ſtand 4 or 5 dayes, then uſe it as your common drink, at meat, and all other times; and in the uſe of this, and the Pill, as aforeſaid, doubt not of your Cure by Gods help: where Roman wormwood is not to be had, uſe common worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, but in leſs quantity: and put not in your ingredients till the drink hath wrought.</p>
            <p>Another ſpecifick Cure wrought by this Pill, is of the Dropſie,<note place="margin">Dropſy</note> whoſe ſymptomes are ſo obvious to every Eye, that they need no deſcription, only that there are three diſtinct ſpecies, or kinds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, cal'd by greek Authors, <hi>Sarcites, Aſcites,</hi> and <hi>Tympanites.</hi> The firſt ſhews the whole Body tumified with a watery humour between the Skin and the Fleſh; the ſecond, the Belly fil'd and diſtended with water; and this is moſt dangerous, and (if not taken in time) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, being ſuppli'd with an unceſſant exudation or dripping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the capacity of the Abdomen, cauſed by an habituated weakneſs of the Liver, and other Bowels. The third, called <hi>Tympanites,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſame Belly to be ſwell'd and ſtretched out with wind, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with water in <hi>Aſcites.</hi> Theſe are all cured by the timely uſe of this Pill, taken by the Rules aforeſaid; only you need not take any over night: for here the humours are thin and fluid enough, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you are to take the drink, before preſcribed in the ſcurvy, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the compoſition, ſix handfuls of green Broom ſtamped, and three handfuls of the Roots of dwarf-Elder, commonly called Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort; and uſe this drink with the Pills till you are well, which will be with as much ſpeed as can be expected; and more then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other courſe.</p>
            <p>The like ſucceſs is found in the <hi>Gout,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gout</note> (provided that the nerves be not ſhrunk into knots, nor the ſubſtance of the part waſted) for as there is herein a concurrence of two common cauſes, an afflux of humours, and weakneſs of the Joynts; ſo is there in the <hi>Pill</hi> a two fold opperation; firſt it removes the offending humour from that part; and then leaves the nerves and tendons ſo fortified, that no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſhall be ſuffered to ſettle there for the future; the ſame is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

performed in the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> or in what part elſe the <hi>Gout</hi> ſhall faſten: The uſe of the <hi>Pill</hi> in this Diſeaſe, is according to the firſt directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in the perfecting this <hi>Cure,</hi> there is required the Co-operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Balſamick liquor, to be out wardly applyed, which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and keep in readineſs by me, which may at all times be had at a reaſonable rate: in the uſe of both which <hi>Medicines,</hi> I dare promiſe a perfect Cure. A farther <hi>Grand</hi> proof of the excellencies of this <hi>Pill,</hi>
               <note place="margin">POX.</note> is in the <hi>Cure of the Pox,</hi> whoſe ſuperficial and lighter Symtomes it ſoon removes, as litle itchy puſtules running over the Body, Ulcers and Warts in the Privities, <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> or involuntary waſting of the Seed (with excoriation, cauſing a ſharp and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking pain. in Piſſing.) But when it hath ſunk deeper into the Body, ſeized the Liver, depraved its faculties, infected the Bloud, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the humours, weakned the Nerves, and Joynts; looſened the ſolid parts, cauſed filthy eating Ulcers, in divers parts; as the Mouth, Throat, and emunctories, in the privities and fleſhy parts, and thoſe deep malignant, and hardly: cured alſo, dry cruſty ſcabs in the Head, about the Eye-Brows and Forehead, the Chin and Beard; when it ſhall have faſtned Nodes, or hard callous knots, upon the Bones of the Scul, Armes, Leggs, Thighs, &amp;c. and theſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with heavy gnawing paines in almoſt every part, and in the Night (when the languid body expects a quiet repoſe) which do (if not prevented) waſt and wholly enervate the body, and bring on an irrecoverable Conſumption. I ſay, when theſe horrid and dreadful ſymptomes appear, which diſcover <hi>a Radicated or deep rooted Pox</hi>; then ſhall this <hi>Pill</hi> manifeſt its unequalled vertues; and let the diſeaſed know, to their comfort, that by the uſe of this <hi>Pill,</hi> when other means have failed, they ſhall find their Ulcers dry up, their dry hard <hi>Elephantiack</hi> cruſty ſcabs fall off, their paines va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, their Nodes and excreſcencies by degrees waſt, and their weakned bodies recover their former ſtrength and vigour. They are to be taken daily after the directions given, Evening and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but the doſes ought to be larger, yet equal to the patients ſtrength: continue for twenty one Dayes at leaſt, if your ſtrength will beare it; if not, you may intermit ſome times; leave it not off ſuddainly, but by degrees; falling to thrice a week, and then twice, and ſo by degrees leſſen the doſes; but leave them not quite off, till you are perfectly well. During your whole courſe, obſerve a ſlender, but wholſome Diet: tis convenient to eat but once a day, yet if your ſtomack require more, at night you may eat a cruſt of bread with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103697:4"/>
a few Raiſins of the Sun: let your drink be ſmall Ale, well wrought and ſettled: if your buſineſs calls you abroad, cloath your ſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry warm, and avoid cold, and drinking: in obſerving theſe cautions, you will with great ſatisfaction reap the benefit.

            <p>Furthermore, in all Womens Diſtempers,<note place="margin">Women.</note> it is of excellent uſe, to thoſe eſpecially who want their Monthly Iſſues, by which a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of evills are are cauſed; as ſweld leggs, great (but fruitleſs) bellies, weak back, loſt appetite, frequent faintings, vomitings, and ſhortneſs of breath, conſtant Headach, and (which is not the leaſt of griefs) loſs of Beauty, a freſh, lively, airy, complexion, chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pale, dull, warty hiew, with divers other ſecret diſtempers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known to Women; for which there is not a more certain and preſent Remedy then this our <hi>Pill</hi>; Which is in theſe caſes to be uſed according to the rules firſt appointed.</p>
            <p>It is a Soveraign Remedy for all intermitting Feavers, or Agues, and Cures them after the third or fourth time taken: Obſerve ſtrictly the time of the approach of your fit; and about two hours before it, take a large doſe of the <hi>Pill,</hi> 5 or 6, or more if your body will bear it. When you find your fitt coming, drink a large draught of poſſet-drink boyld with Carduus. If you vomit, drink more, and urge the vomit as much as you can with the poſſet-drink: and when it works downward, leave drinking, and walk about your chamber to avoid ſleeping; for that is of evil conſequence in this caſe.</p>
            <p>To conclude, this Pill may be taken at all times of the year, and in all caſe, excepting acute and peracute diſeaſes, deſperate conſumptions, great evacuations, with loſs of Spirits and ſtrength: and in theſe caſes there ought to be good advice taken, before any medicine be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred; Moreover, when the body labours under ſome great diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; with variety of ſtrange Symptoms, and accidents not uſually met withal; when the ſigns of the diſeaſe are confuſed, doubtful, and often changing; it is moſt probable, that it is not one ſingle diſeaſe which afflicts the patient, but that there is a complication of two or more diſeaſes a once in the ſame body: &amp; there being uncertainty in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſeaſe there can be no certain rule given for the uſe of any one medicine; and therefore, to whomſoever this ſhall happen, or any other doubt concerning the uſe of this Pill, I doe freely invite all perſons upon this account, to apply themſelves to me, and I ſhall give my judgment of their diſtemper, and advice for the better ordering
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103697:5"/>
themſelves in the uſe of the Pill. For which, I ſhall not expect any gratuity. They who are farr Diſtant, may by Letter, uſe ſome freind in Town, to ſend to me.</p>
            <p>In all ſuch diſtempers, where this Pill is not of uſe, I have alwaies by me, medicines of Singular Vertue, and Efficacy, prepared with mine own hands, with all care and diligence imaginable; among many others, I have an Excellent <hi>Balſamick Eſſence</hi> for the <hi>Lungs,</hi> which reſtores ſuch as have languiſhed in Conſumptions, cures old Coughs, &amp; all diſeaſes of the Lungs, even to a wonder. Alſo an <hi>Eſſentiall Spirit</hi> called <hi>Flammula Vitae,</hi> which wonderfully comforts the heart, revives drooping Spirits, reſtores decaying nature, preſerves the <hi>Radicall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi> Supports youth, keeps back the infirmities of Old age, and gray hairs; makes the body luſty and Vigorous; helps concoction, and diſpoſeth the whole man to cheerfullneſs, and health.</p>
            <p>I have now only one Objection to anſwer, in relation to the <hi>Vatican Pill.</hi> It may poſſibly be ſaid, that notwithſtanding this large Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium I have here given of it, it may not be rightly prepared according to the true <hi>Proceſs</hi>: I anſwer, that the true Proceſs of preparing this ſaid Pill, is well known to many perſons of quality in this town, who have a very high eſteem for it (and not without cauſe) To any ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I do frankly offer a free acceſs at all times to my <hi>Laboratory,</hi> where they may ſee the whole preparation wrought with mine own hands; for I give that truſt to none elſs. And this I conceive may be ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all who are doubtful, and alſo to all who ſhall uſe this <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Pill.</hi>
