         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have received now a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
accompt from most of the
Shires of <hi>England,</hi> of the severall
grievances and oppressions they
sustaine, and nothing as yet from
<hi>Dorset-shire;</hi> Sir, I would not have you thinke
that I serve for a Land of <hi>Goshen,</hi> that we live
there in Sunshine, whilest darknes and plagues
overspread the rest of the Land: As little
would I have you thinke, that being under
the same sharpe measure that the rest, we are
either insensible and benummed, or that that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49120:3"/>
Shire wanteth a servant to represent its suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
bouldly.</p>
            <p>It is true M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Speaker,</hi> the County of <hi>Dorset</hi>
hath not digested its Complaints into that
formall way of Petition, which others (I see)
have done; but have intrusted them to my
Partners and my delivery of them by word of
mouth unto this Honourable house. And
there was given uuto us in the County Court,
the day of our Election, a short memoriall of
the heads of them, which was read in the
hearing of the Free-holders there present,
who all unanimously with one voyce signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon each particular, that it was their
desire that we should represent them to the
<hi>Parliament,</hi> which with your leave, I shall do,
And these they are.</p>
            <p>1. The great and intollerable burthen of
Ship-money, touching the legality whereof
they are unsatisfied.</p>
            <p>2. The many great abuses in pressing of
Souldiers, and raysing Moneys concerning
the Same.</p>
            <p>3. The multitude of Monopolies.</p>
            <p>4. The new Canon, and the Oath to be
taken by Lawyers, Divines, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49120:3"/>
5. The Oath required to be taken by
Church Officers to present according to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
new and unusuall.</p>
            <p>Besides this, there was likewise presented
to us by a very considerable part of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
of that County a note of remembrance
containing these two particulars.</p>
            <p>First, the imposition of a new Oath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be taken by all Ministers and others,
which they conceive to be illegall, and such
as they cannot take with a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the requiring of a pretended
Benevolence, but in effect a Subsidy, under
the penalty of Suspension, Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Deprivation, all benefit of appeale
excluded.</p>
            <p>This is all we had particularly in Charge:
But that I may not appeare a remisse servant
of my Countrey, and of this House; give me
leave to adde somwhat of my own Sense.</p>
            <p>Truly M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Speaker,</hi> the injurious sufferings
of some worthy members of this House, since
the dissolution of the two last <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
are so fresh in my memory, that I was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not to open my Mouth, in any businesse
wherein freedome and plaine dealing were
requisite, untill such time, as the breach of our
priviledges were vindicated, and the safety of
speech setled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49120:4"/>
But since such excellent Members of our
House thought fit the other day to lay aside
that Caution, and to discharge their soules
so freely in the way of zeale to his Majesties
service, and their Countries good: I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
that confidence of theirs for a lucky
Omen to this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and with your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
licence my thoughts too, a little.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Speaker,</hi> under those heads which I
proposed to you, as the grievances of <hi>Dorset-shire,</hi>
I suppose are comprised the greatest
part of the mischiefs which have of late yeers
layed battery either to our Estates, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</p>
            <p>Sir, I doe not conceive this the fit season
to search and ventilate particulars, yet I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
I cannot forbeare to adde somwhat, to
what was said the last day by a learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of the long Robe, concerning the acts
of that reverend new <hi>Synod,</hi> made of an old
Convocation. Doth not every <hi>Parliament</hi>
mans heart rise to see the Prelats thus usurpe
to themselves the Grand Preeminence of
<hi>Parliament?</hi> The granting of Subsidies, and
that under so preposterous a name as of a
<hi>Benevolence,</hi> for that which is a <hi>Malevolence</hi>
indeed; A <hi>Malevolence</hi> I am confident in
those that granted it, against <hi>Parliaments:</hi>
and a <hi>Malevolence</hi> surely in those that refuse
it, against those that granted it: for how can
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49120:4"/>
it incite lesse? when they see wrested from
them what they are not willing to part with,
under no lesse a penalty then the losse both of
Heaven and Earth: of Heaven, by Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication;
and of the Earth by Deprivation;
and this without Redemption by appeale.
What good Christian can think with patience
on such an insnaring Oath, as that which is
by the new Canons enjoyned to be taken by
all Ministers, Lawyers, Physicians, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates
in the Universities? where, besides the
swearing such an impertinence, as that things
necessary to salvation are contained in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;
besides the swearing those to be of
Divine right, which amongst the learned,
never pretended to it, as the Arch things
in our Hierarchy. Besides, the swearing not
to consent to the change of that, which the
State may upon great reason think fit to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
Besides the bottomlesse perjury of an <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Besides all this M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Speaker,</hi> men must sweare
that they sweare freely and voluntarily what
they are compelled unto; and lastly, that they
sweare that Oath in the literall sence, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
no two of the makers themselves, that I
have heard of, could ever agree in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>In a word, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Speaker,</hi> to tell you my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of this Oath, it is a Covenant against
the King, for Bishops and the Hierarchie; as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49120:5"/>
the Scottish Covenants is against them, only
so much worse then the Scottish, as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
not of the Supremacy in Ecclesiasticall
Affaires, and we are sworne unto it.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> for those particular heads
of grievances whereby our estates and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
are so radically invaded; I suppose,
(as I said before) that it is no season now to
enter into a strict discussion of them; only
thus much I shall say of them, with appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to the Countrey for which I serve,
that none can more justly complaine, since
none can more justly challenge exemption
from such burthens then <hi>Dorset-shire;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you consider it is a Countrey subsisting
much by Trade; or as none of the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous;
or as exposed as much as any to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Invasion.</p>
            <p>But alasse Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> particular lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
are hardly distinguishable in univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
groanes.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> it hath bin a Metaphor fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and if my memory faile
me not, was made use of in the Lord Keepers
Speech at the opening of the last, that what
money Kings raised from their Subjects, they
were but as vapours drawne up from the
Earth by the Sunne, to be distilled upon it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49120:5"/>
againe in fructifying showers: The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> hath held of late yeares in
this Kingdome too unluckily: what hath bin
raysed from the Subject by those violent
attractions, hath bin formed, it is true, into
Clouds, but how? to darken the Sunnes own
lustre, and hath fallen againe upon the Land
only in Haylstones and Milldews, to batter
and prostrate still more and more our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to blast and wither our affections; had not
the later of these bin still kept alive by our
Kings owne personall vertues, which will
ever preserve him in spight of ill Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
a sacred object, both of our admiration
and loves.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> It hath bin often said in this
House, and I think can never be too often
repeated, <hi>That the Kings of England can doe
no wrong;</hi> but though they could Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>
yet Princes have no part in the ill of those
actions which their Judges assure them to be
Just, their Counsellors that they are Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and their Divines that they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious.</p>
            <p>This Consideration Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> leadeth
me to that which is more necessary farre,
at this season, then any farther laying open
of our miseries, that is, the way to the reme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49120:6"/>
by seeking to remove from our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
such unjust Judges, such pernitious
Counsellours, and such disconscient Divines,
as have of late yeares, by their wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
provoked aspersions upon the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the gratiousest and best of Kings.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> let me not be misunderstood,
I levell at no man with a forelayd designe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
let the faults and those well proved lead us
to the men: It is the only true Parliamentary
method, and the only fit one to incline our
Soveraigne. For it can no more consist with
a gracious and righteous Prince to expose
his servants upon irregular prejudices; then
with a wise Prince to withhold <hi>Malefactors</hi>
how great soever from the Course of orderly
Justice.</p>
            <p>Let me acquaint you Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> with an
Aphorisme in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> no lesse Authentick
(I think) in the Body politike, then in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.
This it is Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Bodyes to be
throughly and effectually purged must have
their humours first made fluid and movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>The Humours that I understand to have
caused all the desperate maladies of this
Nation, are the ill Ministers. To purge them
away cleerly, they must be first loosened, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled,
and extenuated, which can no way be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49120:6"/>
effected with a gracious Master, but by truly
representing them unworthy of his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And this leadeth me to my motion, which
is, that a select Comittee may be appointed to
draw out of all that hath bin here represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
such a Remonstrance as may be a faithfull
and lively representation unto his Majestie of
the deplorable estate of this his Kingdome,
and such as may happily point out unto his
cleere and excellent judgement, the perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Authors of it. And that this Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
being drawn, we may with all speed
repayre to the Lords, and desire them to
joyn with us in it; And this is my humble
motion.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Rise not now with an intent to
speake to the frame and structure
of this Bill, nor much by way of
answer to objections that may be
made; I hope there will bee no
occasion of that, but that we shall concurre all
unanimously in what concerneth all so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally.</p>
            <p>Only Sir, by way of preparation, to the end
that we may not be discouraged in this great
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49120:8"/>
worke by difficulties that may appeare in the
way of it, I shall deliver unto you my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
in generall of the vast importance
and necessity that wee should goe thorow
with it.</p>
            <p>The Result of my sence is in short this.
That unlesse for the frequent convening of
<hi>Parliaments</hi> there be some such Course setled,
as may not be eluded; neither the people can
be prosperous and secure, nor the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
solidly happy. I take this to be the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
necessarium:</hi> Let us procure this, and all
our other desires will effect themselves: if this
Bill miscarry, I shall have left me no publique
hopes, and once past, I shall bee freed of all
publique feares.</p>
            <p>The Essentialnes Sir of frequent <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
to the happinesse of this Kingdome,
might be inferr'd unto you, by the reason of
contraries, from the wofull experience which
former times have had of the mischievous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of any long intermission of them?</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> why should we clime high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the levell wee are on, or thinke fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then our owne Horizon, or have recourse
for examples in this businesse, to any other
promptuary then our owne memories; nay
then the experience almost of the youngest
heere?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49120:8"/>
The reflection backward on the distractions
of former times upon intermission of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the consideration forward of the
mischiefes likely still to grow from the same
cause if not removed, doubtlesly gave first
life and being to those two dormant Statutes
of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> for the yearly holding of
<hi>Parliament:</hi> And shall not the fresh and
bleeding experience in the present age of
miseries from the same spring, not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld
in any other, obtaine a wakening,
resurrection for them?</p>
            <p>The Intestine distempers Sir, of former
ages upon the want of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to have had some other cooperative
causes, as somtimes, unsuccessefull Warres
abroad; somtimes, the absence of the Prince;
somtimes, Competitions of Titles to the
Crown; somtimes, perhaps the vices of the
King himselfe.</p>
            <p>But let us but consider the posture, the
aspect of this state, both toward it selfe, and
the rest of the world, the person of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
and the nature of our sufferings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
since the third of his Reigne. And there
can be no cause colourably inventable, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
to attribute them, but the intermission,
or which is worse, the undue frustration of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49120:9"/>
               <hi>Parliament,</hi> by the unlucky use, if not abuse
of Prerogative in the dissolving them.</p>
            <p>Take into your view Gentlemen, a State
in a state of the greatest quiet and security
that can be fancyed, not only injoying the
calmest peace it selfe, but to improve and
secure its happy condition, all the rest of the
world at the same time in Tempest, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions,
in uncomposable Warres.</p>
            <p>Take into your view Sir, a King Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
to three Kingdomes, by a Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
of all the Royall lynes in his Person, as
undisputably as any Mathematicall ones in
<hi>Euclide.</hi> A King firme and knowing in his
Religion, eminent in vertue; A King that
had in his own time given all the Rights and
Liberties of his Subjects a more cleare and
ample confirmation freely and gratiously,
then any of his Predecessors (when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had them at advantage) extortedly, I mean
in the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is one Mappe of <hi>England,</hi> Mr <hi>Speaker,</hi>
A man Sir, that should present unto you now,
a Kingdome, groaning under that supreme
Law, which <hi>Salus populi periclitata</hi> would
enact. The liberty, the property of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
fundamentally subverted, ravisht away
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49120:9"/>
by the violence of a pretended necessity; a
triple Crown shaking with distempers; men
of the best Conscience ready to fly into the
wildernesse for Religion. Would not one
sweare that this were the Antipodes to the
other; and yet let me tell you <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi>
this is a Mappe of <hi>England</hi> too, and both at
the same time true.</p>
            <p>As it cannot be denyed Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that
since the Conquest there hath not bin in this
Kingdome a fuller concurrence of all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
in the former Caracter, to have
made a Kingdome happy, then for these 12
yeares last past; so it is most certaine, that
there hath not bin in all that deduction of
ages, such a Conspiracie, if one may so say of
all the Elements of mischiefe in the second
Caracter, to bring a flourishing Kingdome
if it were possible, to swift ruine and deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>I will be bold to say, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> and I
thanke <hi>God,</hi> we have so good a King, under
whom we may speak boldly of the abuse of
his power by ill Ministers, without reflexion
upon his person.</p>
            <p>That an Accumulation of all the publique
Grievances since <hi>Magna Carta,</hi> one upon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49120:10"/>
another, unto that houre in which the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi>
of <hi>Right</hi> past into an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
would not amount to so oppressive; I am sure
not to so destructive a height and magnitude
to the rights and property of the Subject, as
one branch of our beslaving since the <hi>Petition
of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The branch I meane is the judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Ship-money. This being a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of <hi>England</hi> in both aspects.</p>
            <p>Let him Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that for the unmatcht
oppression and enthralling of free Subjects
in a time of the best Kings raigne, and in
memory of the best Laws enacting in favour
of Subjects liberty, can find a truer Cause
then the ruptures and intermission of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi>
Let him, and him alone be against
the setling of this inevitable way for the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
holding of them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true Sir, wicked Ministers have bin
the proximate causes of our miseries, but the
want of <hi>Parliaments</hi> the primary, the efficient
Cause.</p>
            <p>Ill Ministers have made ill times, but that
Sir, hath made ill Ministers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49120:10"/>
I have read among the Laws of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
a forme of recourse in their Oaths and
vows of greatest and most publique concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to a three-fold Deity, <hi>Supplicum Exau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditori,
Purgatori, Malorum depulsori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not but we here assembled for
the Common-wealth in this <hi>Parliament,</hi> shall
meet with all these Attributes in our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</p>
            <p>I make no question, but he will gratiously
heare our Supplications. Purge away our
Grievances, and expell Malefactors, that is,
remove ill Ministers, and put good in their
places.</p>
            <p>No lesse can be expected from his wisdome
and goodnesse.</p>
            <p>But let me tell you Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> if we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
not of one Attribute more in him; if
we addresse not our selves unto that, I meane
<hi>Bonorum Conservatori;</hi> we can have no solid,
no durable Comfort in all the rest.</p>
            <p>Let his Majesty heare our Complaint never
so Compassionatly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49120:11"/>
Let him purge away our Grievances never
so efficaciously.</p>
            <p>Let him punish and dispell ill Ministers
never so exemplarily.</p>
            <p>Let him make choyce of good ones never
so exactly.</p>
            <p>If there be not a way settled to preserve
and keep them good; the mischiefes and they
will all grow againe like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Locks,
and pull down the House upon our heads.
Beleeve it Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> they will.</p>
            <p>It hath bin a Maxime among the wisest
Legislators, that whosoever meanes to settle
good Laws, must proceed in them, with a
sinister opinion of all Mankind; and suppose
that whosoever is not wicked, it is for want
only of the opportunity. It is that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of being ill Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that we must take
away, if ever we meane to be happy, which
can never be done, but by the frequencie of
<hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No State can wisely be confident of any
publique Ministers continuing good, longer
then the Rod is over him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49120:11"/>
Let me appeale to all those that were
present in this House at the agitation of the
<hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right.</hi> And let them tell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
truly, of whose promotion to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of affaires doe they think the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
would at that time have had better
hopes then of Mr. <hi>Noy,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
both having bin at that time, and in
that businesse as I have heard, most keen and
active Patriots, and the later of them to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
aggravation of his Infamous treachery
to the Common-wealth be it spoken, the first
mover, and insiister to have this clause added
to the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> that for the comfort
and safety of his Subjects, his Majestie would
be pleased to declare his will and pleasure,
that all his Ministers should serve him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws and Statutes of the
Realme.</p>
            <p>And yet Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> to whom now can all
the inundations upon our liberties under
pretence of Law, and the late shipwrack at
once of all our propertie, be attributed more
then to <hi>Noy,</hi> and those, and all other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
whereby this Monarchy hath bin
brought almost to the brinke of destruction,
so much to any as to that Grand Apostate
to the Common-wealth, the now Lievtenant
of <hi>Ireland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49120:12"/>
The first I hope <hi>God</hi> hath forgiven in the
other world; and the later must not hope to
be pardoned it in this, till he be dispatcht to
the other.</p>
            <p>Let every man but consider those men as
once they were.</p>
            <p>The excellent Law for the security of the
Subject enacted immediatly before their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to imployment, in the contriving wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
themselves were principall Actors.</p>
            <p>The goodnesse and vertue of the King they
served, and yet the high and publique op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
that in his time they have wrought.
And surely there is no man but will conclude
with me, that as the deficience of <hi>Parliament</hi>
hath bin the <hi>Causa Causarum</hi> of all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
and distempers of the present times:
so the frequencie of them is the sole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Antidote that can preserve and secure
the future from the like.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> let me yet draw my Discourse
a little nearer to his Majesty himselfe, and
tell you, that the frequencie of <hi>Parliament</hi>
is most essentially necessary to the power, the
security, the glory of the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49120:12"/>
There are two wayes Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
Rule, either by Feare, or Love, but
one of happy and safe Rule, that is, by Love,
that <hi>firmissimum Imperium quo obedientes gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>Camillus</hi> advised the Romans.
Let a Prince consider what it is that moves
a people principally to affection, and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
towards their Soveraigne, He shall see
that there needs no other Artifice in it, then
to let them injoy unmolestedly, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto them of right; If that have bin
invaded and violated in any kind, whereby
affections are alienated, the next considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a wise Prince that would be happy,
is how to regaine them, to which three things
are equally necessary.</p>
            <p>Renistating them in their former liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Revenging them of the Authors of those
violations.</p>
            <p>And secureing them from Apprehensions
of the like againe.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>God</hi> be thanked, we are in a good
way of.</p>
            <p>The second in warme pursuit of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49120:13"/>
But the third as essentiall as all the rest,
till we be certaine of trienniall <hi>Parliament,</hi>
at the least; I professe I can have but cold
hopes of.</p>
            <p>I beseech you then <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> since that
security for the future is so necessary to that
blessed union of affections, and this Bill so
necessary to that security.</p>
            <p>Let us not be so wanting to our selves;
let us not be so wanting to our Soveraigne,
as to forbeare to offer unto him, this power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
this everlasting Philter to Charme unto
him the hearts of his people, whose vertue
can never evaporate.</p>
            <p>There is no man Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> so secure
of anothers friendship, but will thinke fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
intercourse and accesse very requisite
to the support, to the Confirmation of it:
Especially if ill offices have bin done between
them; if the raysing of jealousies hath bin
attempted.</p>
            <p>There is no Friend but would be impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to be debarred from giving his Friend
succour and reliefe in his necessities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49120:13"/>
Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> permit me the comparison of
great things with little, what friendship,
what union can there be so comfortable, so
happy, as between a gracious Soveraigne
and his people, and what greater misfortune
can there be to both, then for them to be
kept from intercourse, from the meanes of
clearing misunderstandings from interchange
of mutuall benefits.</p>
            <p>The people of <hi>England</hi> Sir, cannot open
their Eares, their Hearts, their Mouthes, nor
their Purses, to his Majestie, but in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We can neither heare him, nor complain,
nor acknowledge, nor give, but there.</p>
            <p>This Bill Sir, is the sole Key that can open
the way to a frequencie of those reciprocall
endeerments, which must make and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
the happinesse of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Let no man object any derogation from
the Kings Prerogative by it. We doe but
present the Bill, 'tis to be made a Law by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49120:14"/>
him, his honour, his power, will be as conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
in commanding at once that <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
shall assemble every third yeare, as in
commanding a <hi>Parliament</hi> to be called this
or that yeare: there is more of Majestie in
ordaining primary and universall Causes,
then in the actuating particularly of subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
effects.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but that glorious King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the third, when he made those Laws for
the yearly Calling of <hi>Parliament,</hi> did it with
a right sence of his dignity, and honour.</p>
            <p>The truth is Sir, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are
never in their glory, in their splendor, in
their Majestique Soveraignty, but in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where is the power of imposing Taxes?
Where is the power of restoring from inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacites?
Where is the legislative Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Marry in the King, Mr. <hi>Speaker.</hi> But how?
in the King circled in, fortified and evirtua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King out of <hi>Parliament</hi> hath a limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
a circumscribed Jurisdiction. But wayted
on by his <hi>Parliament,</hi> no Monarch of the East
is so absolute in dispelling Grievances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49120:14"/>
Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> in chasing ill Ministers, we doe
but dissipate Clouds that may gather againe,
but in voting this Bill, we shall contribute,
as much as in us lyes to the perpetuating our
Sun, our Soveraigne, in his vesticall in his noon
day lustre.</p>
