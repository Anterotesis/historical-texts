            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This <hi>Chapter</hi> is as pressing a Scripture for Exhortation. And the first Exhortation is, <hi>That men would walke worthy of their Calling: ver.</hi> 1. Their calling to be <hi>Christians;</hi> Their <note place="margin">Ver. <hi>1.</hi>

            <p>All for Vnity. And let me tell you. VVe often read of <hi>One</hi> in the Scripture: but the word <hi>Vnity</hi> in the Abstract, is no where read either in Old or New Testament, but onely in this Chapter, and here 'tis twice. For we are exhorted to keepe it: <hi>ver.</hi> 3. But how <note place="margin">Ver. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> long? why euen <hi>till we be made perfect: ver.</hi> 13. that is, to the end ofthis life. <note place="margin">Ver. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>VVhy, but what need was there of this Exhortation at <hi>Ephesus?</hi> What? why sure <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> very great need. For Saint <hi>Anselm</hi> tells vs, <hi>Schisma fuit,</hi> there was a Schisme and a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there. And <hi>Charismata,</hi> the eminent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3027:3"/>
Graces which God had giuen many of them, was made the cause of the Schisme. For Corruption at the heart of man breedes pride euen out of Gods graces. And they which had these gifts despised them which had them not, and separated from them. This gaue occasion to <hi>false teachers to enter in, and lye in wayt to deceiue: ver.</hi> 14. This <note place="margin">Ver. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note> was the state of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> How was it in the <hi>Citie</hi> and the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> there-while? How? why, the Citie was then a very famous Citie in <hi>Ionia,</hi> a part of <hi>Asia the lesse.</hi> At this time subiect to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire.</hi> Their <hi>Proconsul and other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties were ouer them, Acts</hi> 19. But <hi>Diana</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 38.</note> was goddesse there and the Citie heathen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephesus</hi> then was Ethnicke: No Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but <hi>Paganisme</hi> auowed by the state. And the Citie was a stranger to the Church that was in it. A Stranger <hi>and without as the Apostle speaks,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Yet such is the force <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12.</note> of Christian Religion, that as <hi>Herod &amp; Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> were troubled when <hi>Christ was borne</hi> S. <hi>Math.</hi> 2.

               <note place="margin">S. Mat. <hi>2. 3.</hi>
               </note> were troubled when the name &amp; Religion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3027:4"/>
of <hi>Christ</hi> was borne and nursed vp among them. <hi>For the word of God did no sooner</hi>

               <hi>growe and preuaile at Ephesus: Acts</hi> 19. 20. <hi>but by and by there arose no small trouble about it: ver.</hi> 23. <note place="margin">Ver. <hi>23.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Citie</hi> and the <hi>state Heathen,</hi> yet trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when <hi>Religion</hi> came in: Therfore, A <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> &amp; a <hi>state Christian</hi> must needes be more troubled when <hi>Religion</hi> goes out. And the ready way to out <hi>Religion,</hi> is to breake the <hi>Vnitie</hi> of it. And the breach of the <hi>Vnity of Religion</hi> will be sure to trouble the <hi>City</hi> first, and hazard the <hi>state</hi> after. For the state, whether <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> hath euer smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more or lesse, as the Church hath crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into Diuisions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S. Paul</hi> I know wrote this <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> not the <hi>Citie.</hi> And hee called for <hi>Vnitie bound vp in peace</hi> for the Churches good, without any expresse mention either of Citie or state. Yet hee well knew that the good both of the State and the Citie would follow vpon it. For <hi>Vnity</hi> is a binder vp; And <hi>Vnity of Spirit,</hi> (which is religion's vnity) is the fastest bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3027:4"/>
that is. And lest it should not bind fast enough, it calls in the <hi>band of peace.</hi> So that no man can exhort vnto, and endeauor for the <hi>Vnity of the Church,</hi> but at the same time, he labours for the <hi>good of the state.</hi> And if it were so at <hi>Ephesus</hi> where the state was Heathen; much more must it needs be so, where the state is Christian.</p>
            <p>I shall follow my <hi>Text</hi> therfore both in it selfe, and in the Consequent which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes vpon it. In it selfe, and so 'tis for the <hi>Vnitie of the Church. And a maine Text it is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> (sayth S. <hi>Ierome) against Heresie and Schisme.</hi> In the Consequence it hath: And so tis for the <hi>Vnity of the State.</hi> And a full Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is. For <hi>Vnitie</hi> not kept in the Church is lesse kept in the state And the <hi>Schismes and diuisions</hi> of the one, are both Mothers and Nurses of all <hi>disobedience and dis-ioynting</hi> in the other. So the <hi>Apostles</hi> exhortation goes on directly to the Church, by Consequent to the State. And it will behoue both Bodies that all the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall members of each <hi>Endeauor to keepe the Vnity of the Spirit in the band of peace.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:3027:5"/>
The <hi>Text</hi> hath sixe particulars. For first, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> here's the thing it selfe, to which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle exhorts. That's <hi>Vnity.</hi> Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> All Vnity will not serue the turne. It must be the <hi>Vnity of the Spirit.</hi> Thirdly, what's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to be done with this Vnity, <hi>It must be kept.</hi> Fourthly, there will bee no keeping of it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> without a <hi>strong Endeauour.</hi> Fiftly, this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Endeauour to keepe will bee to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if it be not <hi>in peace.</hi> And sixtly, Peace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> it selfe cannot hold it longe, except it bee <hi>bound vp in Vinculo,</hi> in the strongest <hi>band</hi> that peace hath.</p>
            <p>I beginne with that which is the matter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> Exhortation. Tis <hi>Vnity;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very charitable tye, but better <hi>knowne</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> then <hi>loued.</hi> A thing so good, that 'tis neuer broken but by the worst men. Nay, so good it is, that the very worst men pretend best when they breake it 'Tis so in the Church; Neuer <hi>Heretick</hi> yet rent her bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, but he pretended that hee raked them for <hi>truth.</hi> Tis so in the state. Seldome any <hi>vnquiet Spirit</hi> diuides her Vnion, but hee pretends <hi>some great abuses,</hi> which his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3027:5"/>
would remedie. <hi>O that I were made a Iudge in the land, that euery man which hath any Controuersie might come to me, that I might doe him Iustice.</hi> And yet no worse then <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was King, when this Cunning was vsed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. <hi>Vnity</hi> then both in Church and <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 4.</note> Common Wealth is so good, that none but the worst willingly breake it: And euen they are so farre ashamed of the breach, that they must seeme holyer then the rest, that they may bee thought to haue a iust cause to breake it.</p>
            <p>Now to <hi>be one</hi> here whether in Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or Common-wealth is not properly taken, as if all were to be shrunke vp into <hi>one Body.</hi> But <hi>One</hi> is taken here (saith <hi>Paulinus</hi>) <hi>pro</hi>

            <p>For, if <hi>Vnity</hi> be broken, if a <hi>Diuision</hi> bee made, the parts must be <hi>aequall</hi> or <hi>vnaequall.</hi> If the parts be <hi>aequall,</hi> neither of them hath more then halfe its strength. If they bee <hi>vnaequall,</hi> one hath not so much. And that

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3027:8"/>
'tis <hi>the Spirit</hi> that ioynes all the members of the Church into one Body.

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>vnity of the Spirit is</hi> closer then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> any corporall vnion can bee. For <hi>Spirits</hi> meete where Bodies cannot; and neerer then <hi>Bodies</hi> can. The Reason is giuen by Saint <hi>Chrysostome: Because the Soule or Spirit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hom. <hi>9.</hi> in Eph.</note> 
               <hi>of man is more simple and of one sorme.</hi> And the Soule apter in it selfe to <hi>Vnion</hi> is made more apt by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which is <hi>One,</hi> and loues nothing but as it <hi>tends to One.</hi> Nay, as the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is <hi>One,</hi> and cannot dissent from it selfe; no more ought they whom the Spirit hath ioyn'd <hi>in One:</hi> and the Spirit hath ioyn'd the Church <hi>in One;</hi> Therefore he that diuides the Vnity of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3027:9"/>
Church, practices against the Vnity of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>vnity of the Spirit</hi> (so called, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> because it proceeds from the Spirit of Grace, continues in Obedience to it, and in the end brings vs to the Spirit that gaue it) is the cause of all other <hi>vnity</hi> that is good; and the want of it, the Cause of all defects in <hi>vnity.</hi> The presence of it is the Cause of <hi>all vnity that is good:</hi> Of all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church, no man doubts. But 'tis of all without the Church too. For no <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then men or states</hi> did euer agree in any good thing whatsoeuer, but their <hi>vnity</hi> proceeded from this <hi>Spirit,</hi> and was so farre forth at least <hi>a vnity of the Spirit.</hi> And for states that are Christian, and haue mutuall relations to the Church that is in them: S. <hi>Gregories</hi> Rule is true. <hi>The vnity of the state</hi>

               <hi>depends much vpon the peace and vnity of the Church:</hi> therefore vpon the guidance of the same Spirit.</p>
            <p>And as the presence of <hi>the vnity of the Spirit</hi> is the Cause of <hi>all vnity</hi> that is good: so the want of it is the Cause of all defects
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3027:9"/>
in <hi>vnity.</hi> For as in the Body of a man the Spirit holds the members together; but if the soule depart the members fall asunder: So 'tis in theChurch (saith <hi>Theophilact</hi>) and <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> so in the state. So litle <hi>vnity</hi> then in <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> as is, is a great Argument, that the <hi>Spirit is grieued,</hi> and hath iustly withdrawn much of his influence.

            <p>Now this noyse at <hi>Ephesus</hi> doth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> onely tell vs that Vnity needs <hi>keeping,</hi> but it informes vs farther of the way to <hi>keepe</hi> it. The way to <hi>keepe vnity</hi> both in Church

and state is for the <hi>Gouernors</hi> to carry a watchfull eye ouer all such as are <hi>discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> or <hi>feard,</hi> to haue priuate ends. For there's no priuate end, but in something or other it will be lead to runne crosse the publique: And if <hi>gaine</hi> come in, though it be <hi>by making shrines for Diana,</hi> 'tis no matter with them though <hi>Ephesus</hi> bee in an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare for it.</p>
            <p>And certainely there's no <hi>keeping</hi> of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in either Church or state, vnlesse men will be so temperate (when it comes to a lumpe at least) as to lay downe the priuate for the publique's sake, and perswade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to doe the like: Else (saith Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>) <note place="margin">Hom. <hi>9.</hi> in Ephes.</note>

For in the Church they which seeke their owne, and not that which is <hi>Christs</hi> (who is <hi>publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Ecclesiae,</hi> the publique interest of the Church) depart from the <hi>Vnity of the Spirit.</hi> And in an earthly Cittie, the vnitie of that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3027:13"/>
is gone, when the <hi>Cittizens</hi> studdie their owne, not the publique good.</p>
            <p>Why, but when then is <hi>Vnity</hi> to be <hi>kept?</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> When? why, surely at all times, if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. But especially it is to bee <hi>kept,</hi> when Enemies are banded together against Church or state. Then aboue all other times <hi>looke well to the keeping of Vnity.</hi> Am I deceiued? or is not this your Case now? Are not many and great Enemies <hi>ioyn'd</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you? Are they not <hi>ioyned</hi> both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church and against the state? Are they <hi>ioyned,</hi> and are you <hi>diuided?</hi> God forbid. It cannot be that you should so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Church of Christ, or the Bowels of your owne Countrey, and your own. Ioyne then and keepe the Vnity of the Spirit, and I'le feare no danger though <hi>Mars</hi> were <hi>Lord of the Ascendent,</hi> in the very instant of this Session of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and in the <hi>second house,</hi> or <hi>ioyned,</hi> or in <hi>aspect</hi> with the <hi>Lord of the second,</hi> which yet <hi>Ptolomey</hi> thought <note place="margin">Aphoris. <hi>84.</hi>
               </note> brought much hurt to Common-wealths.</p>
            <p>But suppose all danger ouer (I would it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> were) yet <hi>keepe Vnity</hi> at all times. For Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3027:13"/>
are as Cunning as malice can make them: And if <hi>Vnity</hi> be not <hi>kept</hi> at all times, at that time when tis not <hi>kept</hi> they'l make their breach. And they'l make it certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For if the <hi>Vnity of the Spirit</hi> be gone, the <hi>Spirit</hi> is gone with it; And if the <hi>Spirit</hi> bee gone, <hi>Christ</hi> is gone with him: And if <hi>they</hi> be gone, <hi>God the Father</hi> is gone with them. And what misery will not follow when an Enemy shall come vpon a state, and finde the whole blessed <hi>Trinity, Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> gone from it, to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that <hi>Vnity</hi> which is banished out of it?</p>
            <p>Yea but you will say; If <hi>Vnity</hi> be lost, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> wil quickly fetch it backe againe. Soft: <hi>First</hi> tis more wisedome to <hi>keepe it</hi> then to bee driuen to fetch it backe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> before <hi>Vnity</hi> be thrust off, it would be well thought vpon, whether it be in your power to <hi>bring it backe</hi> when you will. The <hi>Spirit,</hi> I am sure, is not, and tis His <hi>Vnity.</hi> And, loose it when you will, 'tis like the losse of <hi>health</hi> in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body; Iust like. For there euery <hi>Disease</hi> is with some <hi>breach of Vnity;</hi> either by <hi>Inflammation</hi> in some noble or vitall

part: or by <hi>strife</hi> in the humors: or <hi>Luxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in the loynts: or by <hi>breaking</hi> veines or sinewes; still with <hi>some breach ofVnity.</hi> Well. What sayes the <hi>Patient</hi> therewhile? What? Why, He sayes he wil recouer his health, &amp; then take care to <hi>keepe it.</hi> Yea, but what if <hi>Death</hi> seaze vpon Him before health be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered? What then? Had it not beene better &amp; safer a great deale to <hi>keepe health</hi> while he had it? And is not death a iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his distempering his humors? I will not apply, to either Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: but certainely 'tis better for both to <hi>keepe the Vnity of the Spirit;</hi> then trust to the Recouery of it when 'tis lost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Keepe</hi> then <hi>the Vnity of the Spirit;</hi> but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> know withall, (and it followes in the <hi>Text</hi>) that if you wil keepe it, you must <hi>Endeauour</hi> to keepe it.</p>
            <p>For it is not so easie a thing to <hi>keepe Vnity</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in great Bodies as 'tis thought; There goes much labour and <hi>endeauour</hi> to it. The word is <gap reason="foreign">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whence comes it, that that which clings so together, as all <hi>Vnity</hi> doth is so hard to <hi>keepe?</hi> Whence? why I'le tell you: I presume you'll <hi>endeauour</hi> the more to <hi>keepe it.</hi>

            <p>But as to <hi>keepe Vnity</hi> is a worke of <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and takes vp much <hi>endeauour</hi> of the best: so 'tis a glorious worke, and worth their <hi>endeauour.</hi> It is a pitifull thing to see a man but reputed wise, and his <hi>Endeauour,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:3027:15"/>
vaine: But beside the comfort that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, there's a great deale of honour to see a wisemans endeauour like himselfe. And nothing is more like wisedome then <hi>Vnity.</hi> For wise Counsells, are seldome better knowne by any thing then this; That as they are in themselues <hi>One and varie not;</hi> so they tend <hi>to One and distract not.</hi> That <hi>One</hi> end is <hi>verity</hi> in the Church; <hi>Safetie</hi> in the state; and <hi>Vnity</hi> in both.

Halfe that <hi>endeauour</hi> spent in <hi>keeping Vnity,</hi> would doe what all our hearts desire, and more too.</p>
            <p>VVhy, but then how shall we be able to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> set our <hi>Endeauour</hi> right <hi>to the keeping of this Vnity of the Spirit?</hi> How? why the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells you that too, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And the way he <note place="margin">Verse <hi>2</hi>
               </note> proposes is so direct, that I dare say, if you <hi>endeauour,</hi> you shall <hi>keepe the Vnity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> both in Church and state.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> then all <hi>Endeauour</hi> to keepe <hi>the Vnity of the Spirit</hi> is void, if it bee not vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For the <hi>Spirit</hi> will neither bee kept,

next. <hi>Tis in peace,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Peace</hi> in this place is not taken as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 'tis opposite to <hi>Warr.</hi> But it is that <hi>Peace,</hi> which opposes all iarring and <hi>falling out,</hi> especially <hi>falling off</hi> one from another. It is not considered heere as opposite to warr. For that <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Warr</hi> cannot possibly stand together. But this <hi>Peace</hi> in which <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is kept,</hi> is most vsefull, most necessarie, when <hi>Warr</hi> is either threatned or begunne. For as there is most need of <hi>Vnity</hi> against Vnited Enemies: so is there most need of <hi>peaceable dispositions</hi> to Vnite at home, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst forces from abroad: Therefore the <hi>Learned</hi> agree heere, <hi>That Peace stands for a Calme, and quiet dispose of the hearts of men, and of their carriage too,</hi> that the Vnity of the Spirit may be preserued. And certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without this <hi>peaceable disposition,</hi> tis in vaine to say wee endeauour for Vnity; either to get, or to keepe it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Peace</hi> then heere spoken of, differs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not much from the vertue of <hi>meekenesse.</hi> Onely it adds aboue <hi>meekenesse</hi> towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>quietnesse</hi> with them. As it agrees

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> you must haue <hi>a firme peace.</hi> The reason is, because in this Vnity many are brought together. And many will not be held toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3027:19"/>
without a band. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered this. <hi>Vnitas fine nodo facilè dissoluitur.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> De Doct. Christiana prolo.</note> That Vnity (<hi>saith he</hi>) which hath no knot, is easily dissolued. This Vnity is so comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, so beneficiall both to Church and state, that it cannot be too fast bound. But if it be not fast bound, both it and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit will soone be lost.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>in vinculo,</hi> in that which bindes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this is to be obserued: It compasses about all which it containes, and then where it meets there's the <hi>knot.</hi> So that which is bound is held close within the Imbracings of the band. And the <hi>band</hi> is not of one substance, and the <hi>knot</hi> of another, but both of one and the same substance. So tis heere. For the <hi>vnity of the Spirit</hi> is contained and compassed, as it were <hi>by peace: Peace goes before it,</hi> to bring it in: And <hi>Peace goes with it</hi> when tis in: And <hi>Peace goes round about it,</hi> to keepe it in. And where the two ends of <hi>Peace</hi> meete, there vnity is fast and <hi>knit vp.</hi> And the <hi>knot</hi> is of the same substance with the band, <hi>Peace too.</hi> And therefore where the ancient reading of the <hi>Text</hi> is To
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3027:19"/>
keepe Vnity in the band of peace, there some will haue it, to keepe <hi>Vnity in vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lapide. Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>quod est pax,</hi> In that band which is peace.</p>
            <p>This <hi>band</hi> as 'tis the <hi>band of vnity;</hi> so 'tis <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> well fitted to the <hi>vnity it bindes.</hi> For if you marke it, it bindes <hi>vnity,</hi> and the band is but <hi>One. In vinculo pacis:</hi> in the band of peace; <hi>One band.</hi> And yet that which is <hi>vnum</hi> is not <hi>vnius,</hi> that which is but <hi>One,</hi> is not onely of <hi>One.</hi> For it bindes many, whole Churches, whole Kingdomes. And both bodies are euer safest, when the band is <hi>One;</hi> and that <hi>One</hi> able to hold them. For when this <hi>One band of peace</hi> cannot binde close, tis a shrewd Argument, either that some <hi>ill humor swells,</hi> and will not endure the band; or that the <hi>band</hi> it selfe is <hi>strained</hi> and <hi>made weake.</hi> And in both these cases, timely helpe must be applied, or the <hi>vnity of the Body</hi> is in Danger.</p>
            <p>You may see this plaine in the <hi>Naturall body.</hi> The <hi>out-band</hi> of the body is the <hi>skinne.</hi> If the body be too full of <hi>humors,</hi> and they foule and in Motion, the body swells till the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3027:20"/>
skinne breaks. So tis in the Church, and so tis in the state, when the Body is too full of humors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>inner-band</hi> of the body is the <hi>Sinewe.</hi> 'Tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the very word which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> vses; The <hi>band</hi> or the <hi>sinew of peace.</hi> If the <hi>sinew</hi> bee broken or ouer-strained, theres much paine and weaknesse in the body, and the members hang as loose, as if they were falling one from another. And so tis in the <hi>Ecclesiasticall;</hi> And no other then so, in the <hi>Ciuill Body.</hi> If there be but a <hi>straining in the band,</hi> though perhaps the <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new</hi> be not yet <hi>broken,</hi> tis high time to looke to the Vnity of the body. Well. What Remedie then? What? Why, sure there's none but <hi>Vinculum Vinculi:</hi> The <hi>sinew</hi> must haue a <hi>swathe:</hi> And that which was wont to binde the body, must bee bound vp it selfe. And if the Cure light not into honest and good <hi>Chirurgions</hi> hands, it may proue a <hi>lame Church,</hi> and a <hi>weake state</hi> euer after. God blesse the body therefore, and direct the Chirurgions.</p>
            <p>Now as the <hi>Band</hi> of these great Bodies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:3027:20"/>
the Church, and the state, may be <hi>broken:</hi> so the <hi>knot,</hi> which hath euer beene hard to <hi>vntie,</hi> may be <hi>cutt.</hi> And both Church and state haue euer had Cause to feare both, both <hi>breaking</hi> and <hi>cutting.</hi> Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> was afraid of this in the Church, by and by after the <hi>Apostles</hi> times. And therefore <note place="margin">Epist. ad phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph.</note> He writes to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> In any case <hi>to flie and to shunne</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition or cutting off this knot. And indeed tis not fit for any man imployed about this <hi>band of peace,</hi> to haue his <hi>Rasor</hi> about him. And <hi>Dauid</hi> was afraid of this in the state; and hee had Cause, great cause. For some wilde vnruly men cryed out then. <hi>Lett's breake their bands in sunder, and cast their cords from vs, Psal.</hi> 2. What bands? Why, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 3.</note> All the bands of peace, and all the bands of allegiance too. <hi>For the Consultation then was</hi> (saith <hi>Caluin</hi>) <hi>to depose Dauid. But hee that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In Psal <hi>2.</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>And then brake them in peeces like a Potters vessell, ver.</hi> 9. Now the Breakers of the band <note place="margin">Verse <hi>9.</hi>
               </note> of peace both in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth are <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>disobedience.</hi> For these
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3027:21"/>
two cry one to another. Thatis, <hi>Pride to disobedience,</hi> Come lett's breake the band.</p>
            <p>And this is very obseruable, and with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> reference to this band of peace too. You shall neuer see a <hi>disobedient</hi> man, but hee is <hi>proud.</hi> For hee would Obey, if he did not thinke himselfe fitter to gouerne. Nor shall you euer see a <hi>proud man</hi> stoope <hi>to binde</hi> vp any thing: But if you see him stoope, take heede of him, 'tis, doubtlesse, to <hi>breake the band of peace.</hi> The Reason's plaine; If hee stoope to binde vp, Hee knowes hee shall bee but <hi>one of the bundle;</hi> which his pride cannot endure. But if he stoope to loose the band, then he may bee <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>shew his vertue</hi> (as he calls it) that is, hope To runne formost in the head of a <hi>Faction.</hi> Fond men, that can bee thus bewitched with pride against themselues. For when they are <hi>bound vp,</hi> though but as one of the Bundle, yet therein, vnder God, they are strong and safe: But when the <hi>Band is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> and they perhaps, as they wish, in the <hi>Head,</hi> headlong they runne vpon their own Ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:3027:21"/>
Thus you haue seene the <hi>Apostles</hi> care for <hi>Vnity:</hi> For Vnity, but faine would he haue it <hi>of the Spirit.</hi> This Vnity hee desires you should <hi>keepe;</hi> yea <hi>studdy</hi> and <hi>endeauour</hi> to keepe, as the <hi>Spirit</hi> is ready to preuent and assist, that you may bee able to keepe it. This Vnity must be kept <hi>in peace:</hi> And if you will haue it sure, in the <hi>band of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which remaines is: that you obey and follow the <hi>Apostles</hi> Exhortation. That all of you in your selues, and with others, <hi>endeauour to keepe the Vnity of the Spirit in the band of peace,</hi> both in Church and Common-wealth. For <hi>good Counsell,</hi> such as heere our <hi>Apostles</hi> is, doth not make Church or state happy, when tis giuen, but when tis followed. And to the danger that may come, it addes <hi>guilt,</hi> to all such as will not obey the <hi>counsell,</hi> that they may preuent the <hi>danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let me say thus much for the <hi>Vnity of the Spirit;</hi> 'Tis that which ties vs one to another, and all to God, and God to all. <hi>Without God</hi> wee cannot be safe, either in this life, or that to come. And <hi>without this</hi>

               <hi>Vnity,</hi> no man is sure of his Neighbours assistance, nor any man of Gods. But by this Vnity, <hi>GOD</hi> himselfe is content to be <hi>bound</hi> to you. And that which is bound, is sure, and ready at need. <hi>Et fortis cum</hi>

Now to <hi>Keepe Vnity,</hi> I haue made bold to direct you <hi>one way already;</hi> and heer's an other. 'Tis necessary that the <hi>Gouernors</hi> haue a good and a quick eye to discouer the cunning of them that would breake the <hi>Vnity</hi> first, and the <hi>whole Body</hi> after. You shall giue a guesse at them by this. They'll speake as much for Vnity as any men; but yet, if you marke them; you shall still finde them <hi>busy about the knot, that bindes vp Vnity in peace:</hi> somewhat there is that <hi>wrings</hi> them there. They will pretend perhaps, tis very good there should be <hi>Vinculum,</hi> A Band to binde men to Obedience, ô God forbid else: but they would not haue the <hi>knot</hi> too hard. Take heed. Their aime is; They would haue a little more liberty, that haue too much already. Or perhaps they'll pretend, they would not <hi>vntie the knot,</hi> no, there may bee danger in that, but they would onely <hi>turne</hi> it to the other side, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this way it lyes vneasily. But this is but a shift neither. For <hi>turne the knot</hi> which way you will, all <hi>binding to Obedience</hi> will be grieuous to some. It may be they'll protest,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3027:23"/>
that though they should vntie it, yet they would not leaue it <hi>loose.</hi> They would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps tie it otherwise, but they would bee sure to knit it as fast. Trust not this pretext neither. Out of Question, their meaning is <hi>to tie vp Vnity in a Bow-knot,</hi> which they might slip at One End when they list. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, whatsoeuer they pretend, if they be <hi>curious about the knot,</hi> I pray looke to their <hi>fingers,</hi> and to the <hi>Band of peace</hi> too. For whatsoeuer the pretences bee, they would be at the dissoluing of <hi>Vnity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well. Prouide for the keeping of Vnity; And what then? Why, then God blesse you with the <hi>Successe of this Day.</hi> For this <hi>Day,</hi> the <hi>seuenteenth of March, I. Caesar</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw <hi>Sex. Pompeius.</hi> And that Victory was in <hi>Spaine;</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> which had long beene troublesome, setled, and came quietly in, by that one Action. And this very <hi>Day</hi> too, <hi>Fredericke the Second</hi> entered <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and recouered whatsoeuer <hi>Saladine</hi> had taken from the Christians. But I must tell you, These Emperours and their forces were great <hi>keepers of Vnity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:3027:23"/>
The first <hi>Lesson</hi> at this <hi>Daies Euening pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> is <hi>Iudg.</hi> 4. There <hi>Sisera,</hi> Captaine of <hi>Iabins</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And now, to conclude. I beseech you Remember, That all this <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> what ere it be, and when tis at the best, is but <hi>Vestigium,</hi> a track, and a footing of that euerlasting peace which is to come. And I would not haue you so loue this <hi>peace of grace,</hi> that you should at any time forget the infinite <hi>peace ofGlory:</hi> The <hi>band</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of nor <hi>Earth,</hi> nor <hi>Hell</hi> can breake. For tis not folly onely, but madnesse (saith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>) to loue this <hi>Peace,</hi> this <hi>Vnity,</hi> which <note place="margin">Par. <hi>3.</hi> pastor. curae. Ad. <hi>23.</hi>
               </note> is but a foot-step, a print in the dust, soone worne out, soone defaced: and not loue God and his Peace, <hi>A quo impressum est:</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:3027:24"/>
whose very foot made this so safe, so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, so pleasant as it is. But I cannot but hope <hi>better things of you, and such as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> safety heere, and <hi>Saluation</hi> hereafter. For <hi>you haue not so learned Christ,</hi> as that you can preferre any Vnity before his, Or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the safe keeping of that which is <hi>his footstep</hi> in this world; <hi>The Vnity of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs therefore all pray vnto GOD: That he will euermore giue both the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>People, the comfort of his Spirit:</hi> That that <hi>Spirit</hi> of his may so direct all your <hi>Counsells,</hi> that they may be for <hi>Vnity.</hi> That following the direction of this Spirit of <hi>Grace,</hi> wee may enioy the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the same Spirit, both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> That all our <hi>Endeauours,</hi> publike and priuate, may tend to the <hi>keeping</hi> of this <hi>Vnity.</hi> That our <hi>keeping of Vnity</hi> may bee such as it ought, In <hi>Peace,</hi> in the very <hi>band of Peace.</hi>
