            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>NO sooner does any person merit the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching name of a good Author, but he has the happiness to meet with envy; yet every one who will not spare the perishing paper deserves not this title, though he cares his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65200:3"/>
with those flattering Epithets of <hi>gentle,</hi> and <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,</hi> since even the Stationer sometimes circumvents your good opinion with the same appellatives. But such an Authour who seems to command his fame rather than receive it from the world, he like moral vertue (which is plac'd between two opposites of excess and defect) shall be sure to find a Parallel opposition from two sorts of vitious Criticks. I may justly stile them so, the one a poor dwindled Critick, who is in that defect of wit and judgement, that his endeavour is only to be thought to have a small portion, by the detracting of them in another. The other is in that excess of conceit that he cannot forbear to discover by his own vanity his judgement to be illegitimate. Now no place abounds with more witty writers, and worse judges than this City of <hi>London,</hi> whilst true Criticks are more moderate, being conscious of those peccadilloes, that every Writer as man must be subject to. They know that expert <hi>Homer</hi> sometimes may be took napping; therefore they willingly allow Poets with Painters to rove in a large field of fancy, often repeating,
<q>
                  <l>— hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim,</l>
               </q>
and as wise men think themselves generally too green to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all on and Criticize, remembring that Maxime of <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65200:3"/>
               <hi>Longinus,</hi> a better judge sure than any of these dare ever aspire to be,
<q>

               </gap>, that Criticisme must be the deliberation of much experience. But these ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Criticks without any examination convict any Author and presently suspend him: but who gave them this authority? I am sure they were never qualified for the place by Nature, or by Art; how then can any one expect the least justice from them, when their Justice only holds a sword in her hands without any scales, and may be accounted blind from her ignorance, and not from impartiality? Since then I am to speak to the Athenian <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> I hope it may be lawful to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row two Greek words which will more emphatically denote them. There be some that damn a book <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, not interpreting or understanding the Author, and these in our English tongue are called <hi>Fopps,</hi> Persons whose judgement lyes alwayes in the ear never in the brain, who hear what others say, and then speak like them: they are just like an Eccho, a reiterating voice, and nothing else: as Poets are pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted licking up what old <hi>Homer</hi> let fall, so these lap up the Critical vomit which another has ejected. What judgement can they give of a book whose palat is solely Critical, and they were never at any time stil'd judges,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65200:4"/>
unless when with the cusp of their tongue they could determine of the virtue or vice of a glass of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and as one said well when he forbad any one to read his book with prejudice, or after dinner, these very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for these two reasons since their heads are alwaies fill'd with prejudice, and the fumes of a full stomach, by all sober men are thought unfit to be of a Jury.</p>
            <p>The other sort are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or as they are called by others <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, persons which do not only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret badly, which they do, but also doe it wilfully. I can only fancy them a sort of vermin with very little eyes, but many teeth, and nailes, who though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe much harm, by reason of their weakness, yet strive to make up that want with their malice. These creatures for the most part live by gnawing of books, and never leave nibling, till they can make some hole to discover some imperfection, whilst they deface the book of its native beauties, and expose those faults which themselves have made. Thus having show'd you the malignity of these animals, being inclin'd by a strong habit to inhumanity, they are like butchers, not to be permitted to sit upon the life and death of an Author. Such as these who think themselves Criticks, but are not so, have endeavour'd to traduce the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> when true Criticks, if they would, are asham'd to decry them, whilst others that are more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65200:4"/>
modest than to be pretenders, justly admire them. As for my self, I never had the satisfaction of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which frees me from the suspicion of an <hi>offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vindication,</hi> yet I do know him, though far better in his Playes, and what has been my misfortune to want in the society of the father, has been some way made up in the ingenious and pleasant company of the children.</p>
            <p>Some weeks agoe there came out the <hi>Censure of the Rota on Mr. Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Conquest of Granada,</hi> which I lightly read over, for it deserv'd little consideration. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I was surpriz'd at the indiscretion of the Author to venture his poor thinn Off-spring to seek its Fortune in cold winter weather, but especially in such a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous time, when there was great need of wast Paper. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, how could he help his weak book, though it made sad moan, crying out
<q>
                  <l>Deferor in vicum vendentem thus &amp; odores.</l>
               </q>
Poor Author he imagin'd no harm, he only made use of the <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> as servants used to doe, make bold with his betters, and so forth. Thus much I did then argue for his simplicity, finding him to be so obliging to Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> as to pick excellencies out of his Play, on purpose to affront him, that many Readers believ'd, it design'd by one of his best freinds for a complement to show the world, that if any one attempted to wound his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65200:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
honour, the Archers vanity did not so much lye in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing his time to split an hair, as to hit a thing out of his reach.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Rota</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>— &amp; est mihi saepe vocandus</l>
                  <l>Ad partes,</l>
               </q>
has show'd in his censure so little conversation with Greek and Latin, nay English Poets, as I shall prove by and by, that it is disputed by some, whether it was simplicity or madness provoked him to paint him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in colours so ridiculous. In all reason Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> will give me little thanks, since the goodness of an ominous cause may lose much of its lustre by the badness of the Orator; yet let Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> look on with some diversion, since he would not be himself should he seem at the least concern'd, whilst his laurel which he deservedly wears has sufficient virtue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it self from the <hi>bruta fulmina</hi> of any loose tongue.</p>
            <p>Now give me leave to tell you, that having read the <hi>Censure,</hi> I had a great desire to find out the place where this <hi>Cabal</hi> sat: so one day meeting with one of my acquaintance, I ask'd him if he had read such a Pamphlet, he told me, he had lost so much time as to read it, and if I would goe with him he would bring me to their <hi>Academy</hi> which was a large room in a Coffee-house kept for them, where thrice a week they met re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65200:5"/>
from company, but of late since the Printing of the <hi>Censure,</hi> they find none so hardy as to Answerer it, they have admitted a free access, with design, I believe, that they telling the threats of the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> and with what severity the answer is sure to be handled, might deterr the Writer from any further proceeding, and make him consult his safety in the throwing away of his pen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I very gladly embrac'd this newes, and bid him lead the way. We came soon to the place, and somewhat too soon, for the <hi>Athenian Virtuosi,</hi> to give them their beloved title, were not yet come, and the door-keeper said he durst not let any in, before the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> came, lest the room should be crowded, and several curiosities by handling be misplac'd; but I knew what the Fellow drove at, so gently tickling him in the hand, he let us in, where we prov'd him a lyar, by finding some company ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, and one man with a goose-quill in his ear very busily marshalling books, paper, and pens: Asking one of the company who he was, I was answer'd he was <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary</hi> to the <hi>Society</hi>; a worthy employment, thought I; and without doubt a worthy person; I presently made my address to him, desiring to know how long it would be before the <hi>Athenian Virtuosi</hi> met? The clean beast, after much chewing of the cud, answer'd, it would be <hi>Thirty minutes.</hi> I admir'd at the periphrasis of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the man, having more mind to view the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The first thing I beheld, was o'r the chimney in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a chimney-peice a Label held up in the beakes of two Owles, and in it these words written,
<q>The Coffee-Academy of the Athenian Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi instituted by <hi>Apollo</hi> for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gazet-Philosophy, Mercurie's Diurnals, &amp;c.</q>
and underneath these words written,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Having read the Label I told my Friend the design of the Owles was very natural, because they were birds sacred to <hi>Minerva,</hi> and the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> went under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Athenians</hi>; but that their Academy should be under the patronage of <hi>Apollo,</hi> I thought was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular to the traditions of poetry, nor any way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with history; and I wondred that these Criticks in poetry should be so over-seen. My Friend told me he admired at the absurdity, but who must judge the Criticks? He proceeded with the belief, that those were not Owles, but two of the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> since they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled the nature of those birds, being afraid to come

abroad and spy faults fairly by the light of reason, lest they should be peckt at by every puny writer, and prosecuted with all the scorn, and derision imaginable, but love to flutter about in the dark, and make a noise in the twilight of prejudice. I then askt him, why the Academy thought it fit, to place it self in a Coffee-house, since it was instituted by <hi>Apollo</hi>; it had been more agreeable to have been in a Tavern; O, said he, that may be for many reasons, first, as well to hinder expences, as to vindicate the sober inclinations of the persons; since they intended to tax the manners of a poet as well as his writings, it was convenient at least to be hypocrites, and to disguise their own; and Coffee being esteem'd by its admirers a suppresser of fumes, and a great friend to the memory, they might be so simple to hope, it would put <hi>idaeas</hi> into their heads, that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there before: he added that they were inventing a drink for their own use of Hellebore, and other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which will so refine their gross conceptions, that at length they should be rendred so acute as to make faults in the writings of any man. Or perhaps another reason is for the better divulging the fame of the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> since persons of all qualities from all parts resorted to such places. I told him that could be no great reason, for they might hire a poor fellow for a small matter who would soon call the multitude together with a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65200:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or they might steal the Tablet from the Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners shops, wherein is written, The Office of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and hang it at their street door, where when any poet shall come in he may be certified whether any longer he shall have fame or no fame, whether that shall live or die alter death, whether poetry should be to him a rich wife or a poor wife, or whether he should have many children by her, and all this, without the help of <hi>judicial Astrology</hi>: And I further told him, I should rather call this place a <hi>Lottery</hi> than an <hi>Academy,</hi> since that was more usual in a Coffee-house, and a good poet in this place might draw twenty blanks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one prize; and I wisht that speaking of false wit, as well as false newes, had been lyable to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the proclamation. Having paraphras'd a little upon this inscription, we lookt about, and beheld that on one side of the room were set up the heads of many Grammarians, and Criticks, and on the other side the heads of Greek and Latin and some English poets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom I wondred at these mighty three, <hi>Hopkins, Sternhold,</hi> and <hi>Wild,</hi> D D, but I was soon pacified when I found <hi>Chaerilus</hi> amongst the Greeks, and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyllus</hi> amongst the Latins; and why should any good Author repine, that he is excluded, may not the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> set up whom they please, may they not set up their own heads, nay upon poles, if they please, in their own
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65200:7"/>
room? But I ask'd my Friend why Dr. <hi>Wild</hi> wore a different wreath from all the rest, when every one else had one of <hi>Bayes,</hi> he had one of <hi>Herrings</hi>? My Friend told me he heard the reason of a Gentleman that was here the other night. The Author of the Censure of the <hi>Rota,</hi> you must know, is very intimate with Dr. <hi>Wild,</hi> and was with him eating of Herrings, when his Spouse run out with a herrings tail bobbing in her mouth, to receive the Letter from the Post which brought the joyful newes of his Majesties toleration. Now this Academy being instituted, and several poets heads being to be set up, a Letter was dispatched to Dr. <hi>Wild</hi> to invite him to be Prolocutor to the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> (since it is well known, he writes as malitiously and as poorly as any of them) but in the close they ask'd him, since 'twas the honour the Academy intended him, whether his head should be set amongst the Criticks, or the Poets, (and indeed he might very well be either) he return'd them great thanks for the great honour they design'd him, but as for that weighty place to be Prolocutor, he begg'd some time to consider on it: As to the other favour of being set up, either as Poet or Critick, he told them plainly, he was ambitious of both, and did not much care if his head was divided, and half set amongst the Poets, and half amongst the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; but on second thoughts, he referr'd all to their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65200:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
better judgments, with this <hi>proviso,</hi> if they should set him amongst the Poets, he might wear a wreath of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,</hi> since they alwayes brought him good luck, when he had any thing to do with them, wondring why <hi>Will. Lilly</hi> could never find good omens hoarded up for him in the house of <hi>Pisces.</hi> So in fine he kiss'd their hands with this resolution, that he did not doubt but they would become him better than his <hi>Bayes.</hi> For this reason you see him thus adorn'd, and I was told last night that the Academy finds him more pliant than ever, and are in great hopes of obtaining that malitious person to strengthen their party. Since he hates innocent ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and beauty in the Church, why may he not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr them in any thing? Having wearyed our eyes with these objects, we turn'd about, and at the end of the room were three <hi>presses,</hi> without any <hi>books</hi> in them, with <hi>Optimi</hi> written upon the first, <hi>Mediocres</hi> upon the second, and <hi>Mali</hi> upon the third, which presses I soon imagin'd to be the <hi>Thecae</hi> for books, as they were esteem'd of by the <hi>Virtuosi.</hi> I laughing ask'd my Friend which he thought the worst (with leave from the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks) either <hi>Mediocres,</hi> or <hi>Mali</hi>? But he told me it were better to let this paradox alone now, and pass on, lest we should be prevented by their coming. So walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the room we found whole rowes of <hi>teeth,</hi> and many <hi>nailes</hi> sow'd upon cloath, and pinn'd to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65200:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hanging; and looking more earnestly, I perceiv'd that most of them were such as we call doggs teeth. I could not imagine at present that these were meant to make good my simile, I apply'd to them; nor did I think that the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> were Toothdrawers. Yet they would be glad that their adversaries teeth and nailes were drawn, for even then a lyon would be an innocent beast. But a little further we beheld many engins of torture: here indeed was the scene of death, here was one book suspended, another torn upon a tenterhook, a third dead from a stab receiv'd from a cruel Penknife; drawing nearer I found them all belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> Here lay <hi>Almanzor</hi> stretcht upon the rack, that pain might force out words far distant from his thoughts; here the <hi>Maiden Queen</hi> lay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowr'd, and there the <hi>Indian Emperour</hi> was defac'd wich the scratches of a barbarous stile. Whilst my Friend and I were finding a name fit to decry these most unjust proceedings, we heard the door unlock, and the door-keeper cry out, Make room there for <hi>Aristarchus, Scribonius,</hi> and <hi>Opilius,</hi> make room I say for <hi>Hyginus, Palaemon,</hi> and <hi>Orbilius.</hi> I was amaz'd at these thundring names, considering whether or no, the Academy de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ign'd this for an exemplary distich; at last I remembred these were great Criticks, and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians, and that <hi>Orbilius</hi> was <hi>Horace</hi>'s School-master,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65200:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and had whipt him often for not learning his lesson in old <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi> wherefore he was stil'd by him <hi>Plagosus.</hi> Now thought I, these <hi>Virtuosi</hi> imitate the Popes, As they assume the gentle names of <hi>Innocent, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Pius,</hi> when they are <hi>bloody, unmerciful,</hi> and <hi>irreligious,</hi> so these wear the names of great Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whilst they all deserve with naked posteriors to tremble under the falling rod of the fierce <hi>Orbilius.</hi> They had scarce plac'd themselves, when more came in, but were Anonymous, 'twas no matter, I could tell who and what they were, by this gleek of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, the shrug, the shaking of the head, and tossing back the peruke with indignation: they had just reacht the table, when the door-keeper with a great deal of breath cry'd out, <hi>Make room for Cassus the Author of the Censure of the Rota</hi>; bless me, said I to my Friend, why is he called <hi>Cassus</hi>? Why, said he, I will tell you, he affects that name being delighted with the story of a certain poet called <hi>Cassus,</hi> who writ so much, that his very papers suffic'd to burn him when he was dead; he has vow'd to scribble so much if he lives. Alas, he values not the quality, so there be quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, he is resolv'd to keep his vow, and to write any thing against any body: he has many general Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets ready, that as soon as any new book is out with a little alteration, whip he carryes them to the book-seller,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65200:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he is a perfect <hi>Stubbist,</hi> who though he must for ever despair to have those parts, and that learning, yet has attain'd to that likeness in his will to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict every one. I smil'd at the strangeness of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and whilst he was held in some serious discourse, by one as he was coming on, I wondred at the elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his gestures, he would so knit his browes, and work the muscles of his mouth. I assur'd my self he was in labour, and us'd that midwifery to bring his imaginations to the birth: when he was delivered, he was a great enemy to the mans buttons, and would so stare in his face, forcing him to a smile, which he took for approbation, when the poor man did it only to be rid of him. Being sat down he bid the Secretary bring the teeth and the nailes; at this I concluded that these Criticks really us'd them in biting, and tearing other mens works; and I was confirm'd in this opinion, when I perceiv'd every one busy, but most of all <hi>Cassus,</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some of the sharpest of them into his upper jaw, where I presume he had lately broke some of them out in medling with some piece of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Conquest of Granada,</hi> that prov'd too hard for his teeth. Now every one having fitted himself with tusks, and talons, <hi>Aristarchus</hi> rose up, and made a short speech. It was an <hi>Encomium</hi> upon the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> and the happiness of this age, wherein such judicious persons had taken the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65200:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great trouble, for the benefit of mankind, to give each Poet that desert which their examination should allow him. After this <hi>Scribonius</hi> told them, that <hi>Mr. Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> derided their <hi>Censure,</hi> and held the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> in that contempt, as if they were not; Does he so, sayes <hi>Cassus,</hi> does <hi>Almanzor</hi> despise those that would reclaim his rage? I would Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> were here, or any of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers to speak for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secretary, bring hither his <hi>Conquest of Granada,</hi> and there I could show him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Errataes; whith that he opened the Play, and scratching the leaves very carelesly, cry'd out, here's a fault, and there's a fault, where is there not a fault, if we will make them so, dares he, or any one deny it? At this dull impertinency, I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear smiling; which <hi>Cassus</hi> perceiving, ask'd me, if I would be so bold as to defend him? I told him, if he would draw up Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s faults under some heads that I might make my plea, I would endeavour to take off his objections. Why then, said he, if you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended my <hi>Censure,</hi> as I cogitate you have, you may there animadvert, that the Author Scholastically pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes Mr. <hi>Dryden dupliciter. Primò<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for the irrationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the transcendentality of his <hi>Idaea</hi>'s. <hi>Secundò,</hi> for his superbosity, in prostrating the fame of defunct, and breathing Authors. I was so startled to hear <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> alter his stile, that turning about to ask what tongue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65200:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he spoke in, my Friend imagining my surprize told me in my ear, that <hi>Cassus</hi> was a great <hi>Term-driver,</hi> and had two wayes of speaking, the one more moderate, as I had heard, and this last was in use, when he would stupify a shopkeeper, confound a chambermaid, or puzzle his antagonist. Having now consider'd the meaning, I told him, if I might obtain a patient ear, I would make some answer. At this, <hi>Cassus</hi> called for his breast-plate, on which was writ, <hi>The Author of the Censure of the Rota</hi>: is serv'd both for pride and for defence, I wish he would wear it alwayes in the streets, for then if he should chance to lose his way, he would never be lost, but be sent home by a Bedle safe to the Academy. Having arm'd himself, <hi>Eja age,</hi> said he, if you will act in any <hi>Hypothesis</hi> dissentaneous to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Circle, I my self provocate to a contrary ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, and <hi>Cassi gratiâ</hi> the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> will give you auscultation. After I had blow'd my nose, I thus began. Your first objection (O <hi>Virtuosi Athenian</hi>) is in the language of <hi>Cassus</hi> against the irrationality of the transcendentality of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Idaeas,</hi> which for my countrymens take, I thus faithfully render into English, against the unreasonable extravagance of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s conceptions, which ye have strove with much labour to find in his <hi>Conquest of Granada:</hi> so whilst I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending that, I shall all the while vindicate an Heroick
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65200:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Poem, which must be by showing you, what the Masters of Poetry esteem to be its latitude, in what consists its grandeur, and what renders it uncapable of that title. As for its latitude, I must lay down before you the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of its subject, which is Heroick vertue. By <hi>Aristotle</hi> it is called divine, not because it was peculiar to the Gods, but when a man was endued with this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it elevated him above mankind, and as much as humane nature could bear, it rendred him like a Deity; therefore it is defin'd by the best Moralists, a habit of mind not attain'd by humane industry, but inspir'd from above, to undergo great actions with an irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable violence, and a most happy success, which other mortals were not able to perform. Without doubt Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> made his <hi>Almanzor</hi> after this original, making him to do things above nature though not against it, placing in his soul humanity and fierceness mingled together, and him in a sphere rather nearer the <hi>Hero</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> than of <hi>Scudery.</hi> Not so much a Greek as to imitate <hi>Achilles</hi> in his ferity, nor so Frenchified as to admire the stupidity of <hi>Oroondates</hi> in weeping at the feet of his Mistress. Since Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription has followed the precepts of Philosophy, all unprejudic'd Men with reason must speak for <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,</hi> that with <hi>Achilles</hi> Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has rendred him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable, unless his detractors by wounding him in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65200:11"/>
the heel, will discover as much their fear as their base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. I think there is no need to urge this clear point any further, but to pass on and to tell you, in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists its grandeur. It is plac'd by all in a lofty stile, and in the rapture of a Poet. Look up (O <hi>Athenian Virtuosi</hi>) and see my witnesses! O <hi>Homer</hi> dost thou hear this illiterate Censure,

               <hi>Cowley,</hi> than whom none knew better to make or judge a Poem. In praising of Sr. <hi>Wm. Davenants Gondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> he seems to characterize Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Conquest of <hi>Granada.</hi>

            <p>Thus I have with hasty touches drawn out the mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line beauty of an Heroick Poem; now if this censur'd play of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s be of it self exact and true, if it is fram'd by the rules of art, and keeps it self strict to the laws and canons of ancient Poets, as many of his envious enemies acknowledge, if you tear off the title page, and represent it without any relation to him, then this impertinent Censure without any violence will of it self fall to the ground, being supported by so weak a foundation as prejudice. When Criticks shall be found to be like foolish Parishioners, who in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves commend what they hear, untill they look up, then they mislike the man, and by their consequence the Sermon. Thus the Conquest of <hi>Granada,</hi> as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Granada,</hi> is a very good play, but as made by Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> fit to be exploded, when all Poets from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> down to <hi>Ben,</hi> were esteem'd good, if their Judges could ascribe to them <hi>Ciceroes</hi> commendation;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65200:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Pro Archia Poeta mentis viribus excitari, &amp; quasi divino quodam spiritu afflari.</hi>) But Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> because he goes by his own name, must not have the essence of a Poet, that is fiction, nay he must lose the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a son, and with quiet render up, or else those goodly fields of fancy, the uninterrupted inheritance of his forefathers must be confiscated because he has offended this Committee. His Muse must turn Quaker, or else be accounted light, she must have nothing to do with that goodly pride of figures, conceits, raptures, and sentences, without which gawdy retinue Mr. <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Muse never took the air.</p>
            <p>I know the sons of the Poets have far less revenues, than their forefathers enjoy'd. The Greek Poets besides the other five, had a whole dialect appropriated to themselves, they might sound out <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. This made <hi>Martial</hi> complain in his time, that they could not renew the same lease, but had lost many of their priviledges; yet it was very well with them, if we consider the inconveniencies of their children, whilst the barbarous Criticks of these times are so whimseycal, and so unjust, as to allow some their own freedomes, and some none. If Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity uses <hi>Enallage numeri</hi> when Greek and Latin commanded it, and English Poets very often make use of it, since the idiom of our tongue will bear it in prose,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65200:14"/>
but better in verse, it is put down for an unpardonable enormity. I will forbear quotations to prove this known point, lest I prove my self Pedantick, and you more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> as <hi>Persius</hi> stiles it, <hi>librat in Antithetis,</hi> that is, use a seeming contradiction, which in all poets is and must be esteem'd wit, shall nevertheless wilfully be damned by this Academy, as in your Censure.</p>

            <p>I am at last come to my second objection, which is Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s superbosity in prostrating the same of defunct, and breathing Authors, which I shall thus translate, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s pride in contemning dead, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65200:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
living Authors. To which I shall not speak much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am so great a stranger to him, therefore I can only produce his own words to vindicate their Master, and if he wrongs them no more in his thoughts than in his writings he may safely plead Not guilty. In his Essayes and prefaces, as he payes veneration to the dead, so he payes submission to the living: though he cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire any of them blindly. And it is so unjust a calumny to urge that he labours to pluck leaves from the Baies of <hi>Ben. Iohnson,</hi> when he adds to them by stiling him incomparable, one to be admir'd for many excellencies. In his preface to <hi>Maximin,</hi> he does not pretend any thing of his own to be correct, but submits his faults to the mercy of the Reader, being as little apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his own errours, as to find those of others. In his defence of his Epilogue, he ascribes to dead Authors their just praises in those things where they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd us; and in those where we contend with them for preheminence, he acknowledges the advantage to the age, and not to wit. There might be produc'd many places which do strongly pronounce his judicious modesty: if he discovers any faults in other Poets, 'tis because his are too severly handled by others, and the reason why he does disturb the dead, is only that they would rise, and plead for him, as he professes in his Epilogue to the <hi>Conquest of Granada.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>If in the feaver of his writing he has discover'd any passion, the impertinency of the age is to be blam'd for troubling him, otherwise he is more to be esteem'd for his judgment than censur'd for his heat. If he tells us that <hi>Iohnson</hi> writ by art, <hi>Shakespeare</hi> by nature; that <hi>Beaumont</hi> had judgment, <hi>Fletcher</hi> wit, that <hi>Cowley</hi> was copious, <hi>Denham</hi> lofty, <hi>Waller</hi> smooth, he cannot be thought malitious, since he admires them, but rather skilfull that he knows how to value them.</p>

where there are none. If the <hi>Fopps</hi> of the age are stung, that they kick up dirt, no person can blame Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> for lashing them, since it would grieve any one, nay it would raise the choler of any ingenious man to that degree against then, when such will be so inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, nay so absurd, to censure a Poet, whilst they themselves cannot write, and perhaps not read, with commendation. This stirr'd up many antient Poets, and what Poet ever escaped such sinful examiners? It vex'd <hi>Martial,</hi> that at last he told them his verses were bad, yet he challeng'd them to mend them,

            <p>Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> having rebated the edge of all objections that can be brought to defend your assertion, it would appear very inconsistent with modesty to alledge his arguments for my own; since he has found so good, and I can find no better, and 'tis to himself he must give the thanks, that he stands arm'd cap-a-pee. I will no longer give my humanity the trouble, in reclaiming, if it were possible, your folly; but only acquaint you that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> salutes you in a Semistanza of your much honour'd <hi>Hopkins.</hi>

            <p>At this <hi>Cassus</hi> started up, and told me, I was sawcy, not in observing that decorum, which the gravity of the place requir'd. After some whispering the door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper was commanded to clear the room, and to take special notice of me, that I might be let no more into the <hi>Academy,</hi> with the assurance that I should upon occasion be severely dealt with for this rudeness. My Friend and I departed much pleas'd with this scene of mirth: at his lodging we found a hypocritical pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet aginst Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> left by his book-seller; after a short view I perceiv'd the needy Author plaid the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giary, having transcrib'd all those objections from <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> which <hi>Cassus</hi> had borrow'd from the Rehearsal, whence 'tis easy to gather, that it is difficult to find fault with Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> when his enemies are forc'd to tautologize. Indeed the Burlesque way of writing is the most hopeful to abuse a good Author, since the fantastick dress tickles the Reader, and makes him laugh whether he will or no; and that the good old <hi>Axiom</hi> would hold here, <hi>corruptio optimi fit pessima.</hi>

            <p>TWO things may here be inquir'd after, why <hi>Mr. Dryden</hi> is defended, since the unsavoury breath which proceeds from the fore-door of those windy <hi>Criticks,</hi> is to be regarded no more than that of the back-door, since they are both doom'd to the same date, to live for a moment and then to expire; but if he is defended, why so late, when delay will argue heaviness, or fear; indeed I neither bit my nailes nor scratch'd my head for this, nor will I conceit my Antagonist, like <hi>Hercules,</hi> a conquerour in his cradle, but rather, one of those Lapwing-writers, who venture to run with the shell on their backs, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of which rashness has alwaies so much deterr'd me, that this which was drawn up long agoe for my own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, should have slept in quiet, if the compliance to some had not been a motive to the contrary. Yet in this skirmish, I hope his presumption may be sufficient to keep me from despair.</p>
