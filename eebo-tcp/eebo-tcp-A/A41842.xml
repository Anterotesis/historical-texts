         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BLessed were those days, when Christians,
whether frown'd or smil'd upon by the
World, lived by Faith, and walked in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Love; and Ministers sought
the things of their Lord and Master, Iesus
Christ, and not their own: When Gospel-Truth
was plainly declared by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and Reverendly received, and not
wantonly debated by Hearers; When Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Ordinances were prised and used for
the Enjoyment of God in them; When
Iesus Christ was all in all in Mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
And when the Holy Ghost went
<pb facs="tcp:107525:3"/>
forth sensibly in Calling, Furnishing, and
Countenancing Ministers in their Work.
A great measure of this Blessedness did
the Western Parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> Enjoy,
especially from the Year 1651 to 1660.
Amongst the many bright and shining
Stars in Christs Right Hand, which he
set upon his <hi>Candlesticks,</hi> in that part
of <hi>Brittain,</hi> two Youths deserve ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Remembrance in the <hi>Church,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Hugh Binning,</hi> and Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
Gray.</hi> The former Lived but to
the twenty sixth year of his Age; of
whose Labours, though several excellent
things are Published, his Discourses of
some of the Principles of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
deserve Special Regard. They have
been often Printed, and their Depth,
Gravity and Excellency deserves a larger
Commendation than I can give them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Andrew Gray,</hi> his Contemporary,
dyed in the twenty second year of his Age.
He was Born of a Noble Family, bred
up at the Vniversity, where he profited
signularly in Learning, and Polished the
excellent Parts God had given him. The
<pb facs="tcp:107525:3"/>
Saving Grace of God reacht him about
the nineteenth year of his Age, and at
twenty he was called and setled in the
Ministry of the Gospel at <hi>Glasgow</hi> (a
bright Candlestick in that day) with Mr.
<hi>James Durham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stairs,</hi>
Ministers of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
of singular Worth. After two
years painful and successful Labours there,
the Lord called him to his Rest. His sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Gifts for Preaching, his charming
way of Delivery both in Voice and Action,
the power he was endowed with, and the
great success on Mens Hearts, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
attended his Labours, were so E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,
that he was followed by Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
wherever he Preached, more than
any other Minister in that Land in his
Day, and became the blessed Instrument of
the Converting of many to the Faith of
Christ.</p>
            <p>What is Printed of his Sermons, was
principally by the Notes taken by some of
his Hearers, sometimes compared with
what he Wrote himself, which render
them but lean Sceletons of the Discourses
of a Minister under such singular Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb facs="tcp:107525:4"/>
and Assistance of the Holy Ghost,
as he usually was, in his Work. It is well
known what Imperfections attend such
posthumous writings and what allowances
judicious persons read them with. How
these two came forth alone, thou shalt
know.</p>
            <p>A worthy Christian in <hi>Lancashire</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much taken with Mr. <hi>Gray's</hi> Sermons,
he design'd to reprint these two, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>The Great Salvation,</hi> and to give
some hundreds of them to his poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
for their Souls good. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
finding that the first Publishers of
them were two Ministers in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
one of them being my honoured Father,
and I also bearing his Name, he did not
know but that I was one of the persons
that first sent them to the Press; and
therefore he desired me to Preface to them.
I told him his mistake, and that I being
very young when Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> dyed, could
Testify no more of my own Knowledg, but
that I had seen him in my Fathers House
and Pulpit, and that I do well remember
the high Character be had from all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:107525:4"/>
Ministers and Christians that knew him,
and that his Death was lamented bitterly,
as a publick Calamity, and a Prognostick of
evil to come. Although another might
be more fit than I to Commend them
to the Publick; and if it had been put to
my cheice, I might have pitched on some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else of this Author, or of another,
for that Chritable end, driven at, yet
seeing every one is to be left to their
own Liberty in good works of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I would neither divert his design, nor
deny his request.</p>
            <p>These two Sermons, now again publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
contain no matters or point of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy,
(except the main things of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
be so accounted in this Age, wherein
angry contention is more minded by many,
than solid Believing and Holy walking)
They hold forth the greatest of Truths,
and best of Tidings (<hi>The great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wrought out compleatly by the
Son of God our Saviour.</hi>) They warn
gravely of the greatest, commonest and
most Damning of all Sins (<hi>the neglecting
thereof.</hi>) They earnestly call to the most
<pb facs="tcp:107525:5"/>
important of all Gospel-Duties (<hi>the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acceptance of this Saviour with his
great Salvation.</hi>) May some of the same

            <head>A
SERMON
Concerning the
GREAT SALVATION.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Heb. 2. 3.</bibl>
               <q>How shall we escape if we neglect
so great salvation, which at the first began
to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
unto us by them that heard him?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis everlasting Gospel which is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto you, is that glorious Star,
which must lead us to the place where
blessed Christ doth lye. This Gospel
and glad tidings of the great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is come near unto you: And Christ is standing
at the everlasting doors of your hearts, desiring that
ye would open unto him. There is that one great
request, which Heaven this day hath to present unto
you, and it is; that ye would at last embrace this great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107525:6"/>
salvation freely offered by him. It is the thing for
which ye are called to mourn this day, that since the
dayes of your fathers, and since the beginning of
your own dayes, ye have stopped your ears from the
sweet and chaunting voice of this blessed Chamber.
<hi>Ye would never dance to Christ when he piped: Neither
would ye weep to him when he lamented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come to the words which we have read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you: The Apostle (in the former Chapter) had
been discoursing most Divinely of the matchless and
incomparable excellencies which are in our Lord
Jesus: And in the first verse of this second Chapter,
he draweth forth an Exhortation from his former
Doctrine, which in short is this, That they would
take heed to the Blessed Doctrine of the Gospel, <hi>and
not at any time to let it slip out of their minds;</hi> and that
they would keep this Gospel as a jewel of great
price, and would not sell it, but that they would be
induced to buy it. And this Exhortation he presseth
by two Arguments.</p>
            <p>The first Argument is in the second verse, where
he saith, <hi>If the word spoken by Angels was stedfast, and
every transgression and disobedience received a just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of reward, &amp;c.</hi> This is, if the transgression
of the Law which was delivered but by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of <hi>Angels,</hi> and every disobedience to it was so
severely punished; let that provoke you to take
heed that ye transgress not the precious Gospel
which was spoken by the Lord himself.</p>
            <p>The second Argument is in the words which we
have read unto you, and it is taken from the certain
and infallible stroak of the justice of God, which
shall come upon those who slight this great salvation;
it is impossible (saith he) that there can be a City of
refuge for those who slight this <hi>great salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107525:6"/>
Now in the words which we have read, there are
these six things to be considered.</p>
            <p>I. First, That is an evil incident to the hearers of
this precious Gospel and great salvation, to slight and
undervalue it: This is clearly presupposed in the
words; otherwise there had been no ground or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
for the Apostle to threaten so terrible things
against the slighters of it.</p>
            <p>II. The second thing to be considered in the
words, is, that the stroak and ruine of those who
slight this great salvation, is certain and infallable, it
will surely come upon them; this is clear from those
words, <hi>How shall we escape?</hi> As if he had said, there
is no imaginable way for us to escape, if we neglect
(this) <hi>so great salvation;</hi> we may have a City of refuge
when we are pursued by the Law, or when we are
pursued other ways by the justice of God; but if
once we slight this great salvation, there remaineth
no city of refuge (no door of escape left open) unto
us; for where will the person flee that slighted this
great salvation!</p>
            <p>III. There is this third thing whereof we shall
take notice from the words, that the stroak of the
justice of God cometh justly upon them who slight
this great salvation; and truly it is a most equal and
reasonable stroak; which is also clear from the words,
<hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?</hi>
where he puts it home to their consciences, as if he
had said, think ye not that it is just and righteous
that (if ye slight the great salvation.) there should
not be a door of escape left open unto you: He put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the question home to their conscience to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
yea, or no.</p>
            <p>IV. The fourth thing to be considered in the
words, is this, that the slighting this great salvation
is a sin that hath many aggravations which attend
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107525:7"/>
and wait upon it. And it hath two great aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the words which I have read; the first
<hi>great aggravation</hi> in that word of the Text, <hi>graet
salvation;</hi> as if he had said, if it were not a <hi>great
salvation, you might have</hi> some cloak or excuse for
your slighting of it; but seeing it is such a great and
external salvation, there is now no cloak left for
your sin. The second aggravation is from the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this salvation, in these words, <hi>which at first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be spoken by the Lord, and confirmed unto us by
those that heard him,</hi> viz. <hi>His Apostles;</hi> whereby he
telleth them this great salvation is no notion nor
fancy; but a most certain, sure and real salvation,
which yet they flight.</p>
            <p>V. The fifth thing whereof we shall take notice
from the words, is this, That there are no persons
(be whom they will, Minister or people) who slight
this great salvation, that shall have a door of escape.
Hence it is that the Apostle putteth himself among
the rest, saying, <hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so
great salvation?</hi> that is, <hi>How shall I Paul escape if I
neglect so great salvation, and so frustrate the grace
of God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. Sixthly we would take notice of this from,
the words, That not only heart-dispising of this great
salvation, but even also the very neglecting of it hath
a certain infallible and unspeakable ruine attending
upon it.</p>
            <p>Now before we begin to speak to any of these
six things, (which we have observed from these
words) there are these two things whereunto we
shall speak a little for clearing of the words; first,
what is meant here by <hi>great salvation:</hi> Secondly,
how it is said that Christ was the <hi>first preacher of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, we conceive that by the great salvation is
understood the Gospel, as is clear, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107525:7"/>
where it is called <hi>the Gospel of our salvation;</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi>
13. 26. it is called <hi>the word of this salvation;</hi> so that
by the words of this salvation is understood the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
and those precious offers which are contained in
it. And we conceive it may be called a great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in these eight respects.</p>
            <p>I. First, it is called the great salvation in respect
of the price which was laid down for it; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no less price laid down to purchase this great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
than the <hi>blood of the Son of God.</hi> From
whence then doth salvation flow unto you? it comes
running to you in a stream of the blood of the Son
of God; this is clear, <hi>Heb. 9. 12. Neither by the
blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own blood he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in once into the holy place, having obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
redemption for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Secondly, it is called a great salvation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the many difficulties and oppositions
which lie in the way of bringing it about. What
great impediments (suppose ye) lay in Christs way
before he could accomplish and bring about this
great salvation? Was not the Justice of God to be
satisfied? was he not to dye, and to be made like
unto one of us? was he not to lie in the grave? and
was he not to bear the torments of hell before this
great salvation could be accomplished and brought
to pass? there were such impediments in the way of
bringing about this great salvation, that if all the
Angels in heaven had been set to work, they had
been all crushed under it; had it been but that one
great impediment to <hi>satisfie the justice,</hi> and pacifie
the wrath of God, even that was a pass, through
which none could go but the eternal Son of God. It
was so guarded, that none durst to adventure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it (much less could any win through it) save he
onely <hi>who was mighty to save.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:107525:8"/>
III. Thirdly, it is called a great salvation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of that high estimation which the Saints have
of it. O what an high estimation have the Saints of
this Gospel salvation! there is no mercy which they
think comparable to this; all other mercies are but
little <hi>Zoars</hi> in comparison of this great mercy and
Gospel salvation.</p>
            <p>IV. Fourthly, it is called a great salvation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of those noble effects which this salvation bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
about and produceth. Some of the great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the Gospel, <hi>David</hi> hath cleared, <hi>Psa.</hi> 19. 7,
8, 9, 10. Is not this a great effect (of this Gospel sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation)
to bring us out of nature into an estate of
grace? And that is an effect of this great salvation.
Is not this a great effect to make us who were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
become friends? And that is an effect of this
great salvation. Is not this a great effect to make us
who were moving in the way to hell, move in the
way to heaven? And that is an effect of this great
salvation. Is not this a great effect to make us who
were <hi>far off,</hi> to be now <hi>made near?</hi> And yet that is
an effect of this great salvation. And is not this a
great effect to make us <hi>who were darkness become light
in the Lord?</hi> And that is the great effect of this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-salvation.
Yea, I may say, time would fail me
to tell all the great effects of this great salvation.
But O will ye come and see, and that will best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the question unto you, what the noble effects
of this great salvation are.</p>
            <p>V. Fifthly, it is called a great salvation in respect
of the great advantages which do redound to the
person who embraceth it. First, is not heaven a
noble advantage? and that is the gain which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the embracers of this great salvation. Secondly,
Is not Jesus Christ a notable advantage? And yet he
is the advantage which attendeth the embracers of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107525:8"/>
this great salvation. 3dly, is not eternal communion
with God a noble advantage? and that advantage
attendeth the embracers of this great salvation. 4thly,
is not eternal liberation from the body of death a
great advantage? and that attendeth the embracers
of this great salvation. Fifthly, is not eternal singing
in the enjoyment of God a great advantage? and
that attendeth the embracers of this salvation. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is not eternal seeing of God as he is, a great and
noble advantage? And yet this (as all the former)
attendeth the embracers of this great salvation.
Yea, would ye be rich? O then embrace this great
salvation. Would ye be honourable? Come and
embrace this great salvation. Would ye be eternally
happy? O then come and partake of this great
salvation.</p>
            <p>VI. Sixthly, it is called a great salvation in respect
of all other salvations that ever were accomplished.
There was never a salvation or victory obtained by
any General or Captain (unto a Land or people)
that could have the name of great salvation in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of this.</p>
            <p>VII. Seventhly, it is called a great salvation in
respect of the authority of it; we have spoken of the
greatness (as to the meritorious cause) of it, and
how great things it doth effectuate; and also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the authority of it, it is a great salvation.
Would you know who is the Author of this great
salvation? it is Christ. <hi>Hebr. 5. 9. He became the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of eternal salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> And
must not this salvation be sutable to him who is the
Author of it? this is one of the most noble and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant
beams of the Majesty of the Son of God the
Mediator, that he is the Author of this great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:107525:9"/>
VII. Eighthly, it is called a great salvation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the continuance and duration of it. It is not
a salvation which is but for a day; but it is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
salvation, <hi>Hebr. 9. 12. He obtained eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the second thing whereunto we shall speak
for clearing of the words, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> How it is said
that Christ was the first preacher of this eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
We do not think that the words are thus to
be understood, that the Gospel and this great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was never preached before Christ came in the
flesh; but we think the meaning of the words may
be one of these three: if not all of them.</p>
            <p>I. First, That all the preaching of this great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
under the Law, did come very far short in the
point of fulness, in comparison of Christs preaching
of it; therefore is Christ said to be the first preacher
of this great salvation; as if he had said, I know
<hi>Adam</hi> he preached of this great salvation; and
<hi>Enoch</hi> he preached of this great salvation; and the
twelve Patriarchs they preached of this great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and all the Prophets who went before Christ,
and are now in heaven, they preached of this great
salvation; but all their preaching deserved not the
name of preaching in comparison of Christs; for
<hi>never man spake as he spake.</hi> Thus Christ was the
first great preacher of this great salvation.</p>
            <p>II. Secondly, This may be the meaning of it,
that Christ was the first preacher of this great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in respect of his clear way of preaching of it;
for he was the first preacher of it without types and
shadows; he was the first preacher of it clearly
and fully, with so much demonstration and power of
the Spirit.</p>
            <p>III. Thirdly, The meaning of this (that Christ
was the first preacher of this great salvation) may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107525:9"/>
relate to his appearing to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise when he
became the first and great preacher of this salvation,
when he did speak that word unto him, <hi>The seed of
the woman shall tread down the head of the Serpent.</hi>
The first glorious preaching of this great salvation
was when Christ preached to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise.
And that was the first and glorious morning of this
blessed Gospel.</p>
            <p>Now we shall speak a little to the first of these six
things which we have observed from these words;
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there are many within the visible Church
who are neglecters and slighters of this great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
(do ye not all take with it?) it is clear, <hi>Matth.</hi>
23 towards the close; and chap. 20. 5. where those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
being invited to come to the marriage, or feast
of the Gospel, it is said of them <hi>they made light of it;</hi>
which are the same words in our Text: And <hi>Luke</hi>
14. 18. when they were invited to come, it is said,
<hi>They all with one consent began to make their excuse;
and</hi> Isa. 28. 2. <hi>This is the rest wherewith ye shall make
the weary to rest, this is the refreshing; yet they will
not hear.</hi> Now is there a person here, who dare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
this charge, that he is a slighter of this great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?
I confess I am afraid that you will not take
with it; therefore I shall propose eight sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who are slighters of this great salvation, and
I charge you as you will answer to God one day,
that you search your hearts, whether you be among
the number (in the catalogue) of the slighters of this
great salvation.</p>
            <p>I. The first sort of persons who are slighters of
this great salvation, are those persons who go about
to establish their own righteousness, and will not
submit to the righteousness of Christ; (in a word) it
is that sort of persons who think they may win to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107525:10"/>
heaven by a Covenant of Works, and will not take
the Gospels way of travelling to heaven in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace. And surely there is not a person
here who hath not that cursed inclination to be as
little obliged to Christ (for his salvation) as he can;
we would go to heaven without <hi>the way,</hi> which is
Christ. And (believe me) there are many in this
Congregation who go thus about to establish their
own righteousness. And I shall propose six sorts of
persons who fall under this first rank.</p>
            <p>1. The first sort are those who trust on their own
civility, and think that will carry them to heaven;
those are the persons who go about to establish their
own righteousness. Say they, I defie the world to
say any thing to me, <hi>I was overmore an honest man</hi> and
I trust therefore that I shall go to heaven; but I say
to thee, (O Atheist that thou art) thou shalt never win
to heaven by those means, till thou come to Christ
with this, <hi>All my righteousness is like filthy rags.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The second sort are those who build their
confidence upon their denial of their good Works,
but yet come never this length to make use of Jesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>3. The third sort are those who build their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
upon their duties; they think they will come
to heaven by their good prayers, by their reading,
and by their fasting, (like unto that Pharisee, <hi>Luke</hi>
18. 11.) <hi>I thank God I am not like other men; for
I fast twice in the week, I pay tithes of all that I possess:</hi>
But I say unto thee, thy duties will never bring
thee to heaven if Christ he not the end of all thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
nor can you perform a duty without him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>4, The fourth sort of Persons who fall under this
first rank of slighters of the great salvation, are those
who trust on their convictions; if they have once
been convinced of their sin and miserable estate,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107525:10"/>
they think there is no more to do, Christ will never
reject them, so they sit down and build their hope
upon those convictions.</p>
            <p>5. The fifth sort of persons are those who build
their confidence upon their resolutions; say they,
oftentimes I have resolved to be a better man than
I am, therefore I think (which is the fearful delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of many) that <hi>God will accept the will for the deed;</hi>
but it had been good for many such a word had not
been in the Bible; or that their cursed eyes had
never read it. But know this that though thou hadst
as strong resolutions as <hi>Peter,</hi> or as good wishes as
<hi>Balaams</hi> had, if thou never labour to bring them to
practice, God shall say to thee, <hi>Depart from me, I know
you not:</hi> Any of you who build upon your resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
you will build upon a sandy foundation, these
being many times a <hi>goodness but like the morning
dew,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. And the sixth sort of persons who fall under
this first rank of slighters of the great salvation (and
wherein the evil is most subtil) are those who build
their salvation upon their graces; these also go
about to establish their own righteousness; but I
say to such, Their graces cannot be the foundation of
their hope, though they may be as evidences to
strengthen their hope. Now are there none here
who fall under this first rank of slighters of the great
salvation? or are there none here who will confess
that they have gone about to establish their own
righteousness? I say to thee who wilt confess, put
a rope about thy neck, and come to Christ; for he
is a merciful King: I say to thee, Come to Christ
with this, <hi>All my righteousness is like filthy rags;</hi> and
if thou wilt come with this in sincerity, he shall say,
<hi>Bring forth the white robe and put upon him.</hi> If thou
canst be brought to speak that in sincerity to Christ,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107525:11"/>
there shall be no more betwixt Christ and thee, but
<hi>Come and cloath him with the whole robe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Secondly, Those persons slight the great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
who delay their taking hold of the precious
offers of the Gospel: for there are many (when we
preach this Gospel, and when we hold out the great
salvation to them) who say, <hi>I will follow Christ, but
I must first go home and bury my father;</hi> (and so they
delay to take hold of this great salvation) But I say to
you (whoever you be) that thus delay to take hold
on this great salvation, you are the slighters of it.
Is there a person within these doors who dare but
acknowledge that he hath slighted this great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and delayed to embrace it? O tell me what do
your consciences speak! Are there any but they
most acknowledge they come under this second
rank? And I say, to you who have thus delayed,
will you yet embrace it? I say even unto you who
are old men (now past sixty years, and have slighted
this great salvation so long) yet this day this great
salvation is offered unto you: What say you to it?
O what do you say to this offer? Are ye saying, I
must now delay (and not receive this great salvation)
till my Harvest be by and over? I say unto thee,
that the Harvest of the wrath of God is ripe, and he
shall put in his sickle, and cut thee down. I will say no
more to those who thus slight this great salvation, but
this, <hi>Why <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and ye all the day in the Market place
idle, and doing nothing.</hi> O will you at last be induced
to take and embrace this great salvation before it be
hid from your eyes.</p>
            <p>III. Thirdly, Those persons are the slighters of
this great salvation, who complement with Christ
when they are invited to come and partake of it: And
say silently (to the Minister, or rather to their own
consciences) <hi>I pray you have me excused at this time;</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:107525:11"/>
as those, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 18. But I would only ask of such,
Have you any lawful excuse why you will not come
and partake of this great salvatiou? is there any
person here that hath any lawful excuse to present?
I shall never take that off your hand, <hi>Have me excus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
But be sure of this, I shall never excuse you, but
accuse you; therefore I desire that those persons
who have slighted the great salvation, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing
with Christ, that they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
no more with him at all, but now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it.</p>
            <p>IV. The fourth sort of persons who slight this
great salvation, are these who give way to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
and unbelief, so that they will not come
and partake of this great salvation: I say, such of
you are slighters of it, and Christ will esteem you
such. Oh if ye knew the worth and vertue of this
great salvation, there would not be a temptation
(you could meet with) that would hinder you from
embracing it, but if thou couldst not answer these
temptations, thou wouldst not own them. I say unto
such undervaluers and slighters of the great salvation
as discouraged persons. (<hi>And those who stay long in the
place of the breaking forth of children</hi>) that when you
cannot answer your objections, which hinder you
from closing with Christ, I entreat you disown
them, as if ye heard them not: Say ye, Think ye
this lawful? I say it is both lawful and expedient,
for it was the practice of believing <hi>Abraham; He
considered not his own body</hi> being dry as an old stick,
<hi>nor the deadness of</hi> Sarahs <hi>womb.</hi> He did not consider
these things which might have been objections to
keep him from believing. He might have started at
these two objections; Alas, I am old; and that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
could he not answer; and my wife is past
child-bearing; neither could he answer that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107525:12"/>
What then did he with them? He slighted
them both, and considered them not. Secondly, I
would say this to you who thus slight it because of
discouragements; If ye did know the worth of the
great salvation which is in this Gospel redemption
that is offered unto you, although ye had an army of
objections to go through, ye would go through them
all, <hi>To get a drink of the water of this well of Bethlehem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. The fifth sort of persons who slight his great
salvation, are those who will not do so much as take
care, and give pains to hear this great salvation offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them; for there are some persons who (if
they come to the Church) desire to sit farthest off,
and so never take care to hear a word of this great
salvation: and such are dreadful slighters of it. Like
unto these mentioned, <hi>Ier. 6. 10. To whom shall I
speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold
their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken,</hi> Isa.
28. 12. <hi>But they would not hear,</hi> Jer. 7. 10. <hi>who say
we are delivered to do all these abominations: Yet they
did come and stand before him, in the house which was
called by his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. Sixthly, Those persons are slighters of this
great salvation who (when they hear it) are no
more (nay not so much) affected with it, than if we
were telling unto them the most senseless history of
<hi>Thomas</hi> the <hi>Rymer,</hi> or some other old fable. Like
unto these mentioned, <hi>Ier. 6. 10. The word of the
Lord is unto them a reproach, they have no delight in it.</hi>
I would pose you all, as in the sight of the Author
of this great salvation (men or women) did you
ever set your selves (or took ye ever pains) to bring
up your hearts to the love of this great salvation?
Was it ever the rejoycing of your hearts that Christ
dyed and rose again? I do certainly believe it (and
I am perswaded) that there are decrees past in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107525:12"/>
against many of you, <hi>That in hearing ye shall hear,
but not understand; and in seeing ye shall see, and shall
not perceive:</hi> For God hath made your hearts harder
than the Flint or Adamant; so that ye <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> refuse
to return when he doth exhort you. Believe me
(if I may so <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) I think there is as much proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
that the stones in the wall would hear (if we
would speak to him) as soon as many of you.</p>
            <p>VII. Seventhly, Those persons are slighters of
this great salvation, who did never complain that
they wanted a right to this great salvation. I hope
some of you are now convinced that ye never came
within the compass of this great salvation: I say yet
unto you, if ye did never spend one hour in secret
weeping and lamenting, because ye had not aright to
this Gospel redemption, it is but too probable you
never had yet a right to it. Yea, know it, that
such of you would little care to let precious Christ
depart without any grief of heart: I think if this
were voiced within this house to day, whether or
not shall Christ go and depart, I doubt if there
would be many heart-dissenters, though many tongue
dissenters: Oh, I fear, there would be many hearts
here, saying, O Christ, depart and go thy way: Yea,
there are many Gadarens here, <hi>who prefer their kine
and swine to precious Christ, and would beseech him to
go out of their coasts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VIII. Eighthly, Those persons slight the great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who never took pains to engage their hearts to
take hold of Christ and the Gospel. Christ is near
to you this day: The great salvation is near to you,
and is now, even now offered unto you, therefore
are there any who will take pains to lay hold on it?
I obtest you all who are here, by the beauty and
excellency of him, who is the Author and of this
great salvation, that ye come and partake of it; <hi>I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107525:13"/>
obtest you</hi> by all the Joyes of Heaven that ye em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
this great salvation; <hi>I obtest you</hi> by all the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
in Hell that ye embrace it; <hi>I obtest you</hi> by the
promises of the everlasting covenant that ye embrace
it; <hi>I obtest you</hi> by all the curses which are written in
this book of the covenant that ye embrace it. <hi>I obtest
you</hi> by the love you owe to your immortal souls, that
ye will once be wise, and come partake of this great
salvation. May I now have it, saist thou? Yea, I say
unto you all, ye may have it to day, ye may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of it before ye go hence: And so before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
any further, I do in the name and authority of
him who sent me here to day, and is the Author of
this great salvation, freely offer it unto you to day.
But I <hi>know</hi> there will be eight sorts of humors (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this house today) in relation to this great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which now is offered unto you.</p>
            <p>1. I <hi>think</hi> there will be some of <hi>Gallio's</hi> dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here to day, that will care for none of these things:
Yea, there are many here who will not give a fig for
this rich offer of the great salvation. But, I say,
Cursed be that person who putteth on <hi>Gallio's</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
(to day) that will care for none of these things.</p>
            <p>2. I fear there will be many of <hi>Pilates</hi> humour
here (to day) who will say, they find nothing against
the man; yet will cry forth, <hi>Take him and crucifie
him.</hi> They find no fault with Christ, and yet will be
content that he be crucified. Now can ye say any
thing against Christ, who is the Author of this
great salvation? Produce your strong arguments;
Are there any here who have any thing to say against
him? I am here to answer in his name; I hope
there is not one here who hath any thing to say
against the Author of this great salvation. And
why then do ye not <hi>take</hi> him? See unto your selves
that there be none of <hi>Pilates</hi> humour here to day,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107525:13"/>
that will cry out, <hi>Ye find nothing in Christ why he
should not be received,</hi> and yet will be content <hi>that he
be crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. There will be many of the Jews humor here
to day, who cry forth, <hi>Away with Christ, away with
Christ, and give me Barabas.</hi> But oh, what a hellish
word is that! <hi>Away with spotless Christ, away with
transcendent Christ, and give us the world.</hi> Now are
there any here who will be so gross slighters of this
great salvation? Will ye slight this great salvation,
and embrace your idols, which shall once prove a
crown of thorns unto you?</p>
            <p>4. There will be some of <hi>Felix</hi> humor sound
here to day, that will say, <hi>O Christ go away at this
time, and I will here thee at a more convenient season:</hi>
But I say unto you who will not hear me to day, nor
embrace this great salvation, I shall defie all the
Ministers in <hi>Scotland</hi> to assure you, that ye shall get
another offer, if ye send me away to day; There is
not one that can or dare engage that the great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall be in your offer any more. Therefore, I
say, let none of <hi>Felix</hi> temper be here to day, that
will say, <hi>they will hear Christ at a more convenient
season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. There will be some of <hi>Balaams</hi> temper to day,
who will desire to <hi>dye the death of the righteous,</hi> and
to have their last end like his; yet they desire not
to live the life of the righteous: But I say unto you,
ye shall never dye the death of the righteous, if ye
live not the life of the righteous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:107525:14"/>
6. There will be some of you here to day, who
(I hope) at least will be of <hi>Agrippas</hi> humor, that
will say, <hi>Thou hast almost perswaded me to be a
Christian:</hi> I say unto thee, O wilt thou quickly out
with that word almost, and put in that word altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and say, O precious Christ, <hi>Thou hast altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perswaded me to be a Christian:</hi> However, if thou
come no greater length, I intreat thee come this
length, that so thou mayst cry out, <hi>I am almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to embrace Christ the great salvation,</hi> and may
be ere long ye will come further.</p>
            <p>7. There will be some of <hi>Iudas</hi> temper here to
day, <hi>who will betray Christ for thirty pieces of silver.</hi>
Yea, some would sell Christ, Heaven, their Idols and
all, for less then <hi>thirty pieces of silver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. I think there will be many of <hi>Esaus</hi> profane
temper here to day, <hi>who will sell their birth-right for
a mess of pottage.</hi> Now will ye enquire at your selves,
Am I the person that will give my <hi>birth-right for a
mess of pottage?</hi> doth my heart say, <hi>I will sell my birth
right, because I am hungered and ready to dye, what
will it profit me? give me a mess of pottage, and I will
quit my birth-right.</hi> I know it, there are not a few
such here to day: Therefore I intreat you enquire
at your selves what is your humor. Oh shall the
great salvation that ye have flighted so long, be
slighted this day also, and shall there be none to
embrace it? Oh enquire and stand in awe, lest the
wrath of the most high pursue you.</p>
            <p>Now I shall give you these seven considerations,
which may provoke you not to slight, but embrace
this great salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:107525:14"/>
1. The first consideration, That the not embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this great salvation is one of the greatest acts of
folly that can be, <hi>Ier. 8. 9. They have rejected the
word of the Lord,</hi> (and immediately it is subjoyned)
<hi>And what wisdom is in them?</hi> And so <hi>Solomon</hi> doth
assure you they cannot be wise who neglect this
great salvation, <hi>Prov. 1. 7. Fools despise wisdom and
instruction:</hi> Therefore may not I say unto you,
be who ye will, (though ye were the greatest heads
of wit in all this place) ye are but stark fools as long
as ye neglect this: But would you be wise indeed,
and wise unto eternal life? Then I intreat you come
and embrace this great salvation.</p>
            <p>2. The second consideration to provoke you not
to slight the great salvation, is this, that the ruine
and destruction of the slighters of it, is most certain
and infallable, <hi>Ier.</hi> 11. 11. Where (speaking of
slighting the covenant, which is indeed this same
great salvation) there is a Therefore put to the
threatning. <hi>Therefore thus saith the Lord, I will
bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.</hi>
I defie you all, who are the slighters of this
great salvation, to find a back door, when Justice
shall pursue you: for there is no door to escape if
ye embrace not this great salvation: But the <hi>earth
will disclose your iniquity, and heaven will declare
your sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Let this consideration provoke you
not to slight this great salvation, that Christ is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
serious, and earnest that ye should embrace
it: And I think that <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 23. speaketh out his
exceeding seriousness, where four times he beggeth
of his hearers, that they would give ear and hear
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107525:15"/>
his voice, saying, <hi>Give ear and hear my voice, hearken
and hear my speech.</hi> What needeth all these exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?
but that Christ is most serious that they
would embrace the great salvation. And O, that
there were a person here to day, as serious to the
bargain as Christ is! But be who ye will that flight
this great salvation, [believe me] the day is coming
wherein ye shall cry out, Alas for my slighting of it!
Wilt thou therefore think presently with thy self
(O thou slighter of this great salvation) what wilt
thou say of thy slighting it? When the Devil shall
be leading thee in thorow those dark gates of hell!
O slighter of the Gospel, how many alasses wilt
thou cry, when thou shalt be passing thorow these
dark gates into thy everlasting prison? Wilt thou
not then cry out, O me (a slighter of the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
salvation) whether am I now going? Alas now
for my slighting the Gospel! And as thou passest
thorow, thou shalt meet with numbers of miserable
comforters; there is not one in that prison, who
can comfort thee; but many dreadful a lasses shalt
thou then both cry and hear, if thou embrace not
this great salvation.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, Let this provoke you not to slight
the great salvation, that ye will get it for a very
look: O ye within this house to day, ye will get
this great salvation for one look, <hi>Isa. 45. 22. Look
unto me and be saved, all the ends of the earth;</hi> for a
very look ye will get this great salvation, and do ye
ever think to get Heaven at a lower rate?</p>
            <p>5. The fifth consideration to provoke you not
to slight this great salvation any more, is this, There
is not one of you who is a slighter of it, but your
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107525:15"/>
slighting it shall increase your immortal bonds. Man
or Woman, be who thou wilt, when thou art slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this great salvation, thou art but plating a cord
wherewith to bind thy soul eternally in these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
flames, <hi>Isa. 28. 22. Be ye not mockers, lest
your bonds be made strong.</hi> I say therefore unto you,
<hi>old men,</hi> mock not, <hi>lest your bonds be made strong: Old
Women,</hi> near unto your graves, mock not, <hi>lest your
bonds be made strong: Young men,</hi> be ye not mockers,
<hi>lest your bonds be made strong: Young Women,</hi> who
are in the flower of your time, mock not, <hi>lest your
bonds be made strong:</hi> but now alas, will there for all
this be a person here to day who will be a moker of
this great salvation?</p>
            <p>6. The sixth consideration to provoke you not
to slight this great salvation any more, is this: Ye
know not but that your days may be near unto a
close, I say, you know not but the day of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this great salvation may be near unto a close.
What knowest thou O man or Woman, but this
shall be the last Sermon that ever thou shalt hear
concerning this great salvation? and yet for all
this, shall we be sent away without one consent to
embrace or receive it? O will ye be perswaded to
look to Christ, and so to take him?</p>
            <p>7. The seventh consideration to provoke you not
to slight the great salvation, is this, that there is a
five fold salvation comprehended under this great
salvation.</p>
            <p>1. The first is this, come and partake of this
great salvation, and thou shalt have salvation from
thy idols. And hereby I do proclaim liberty this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107525:16"/>
day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto captives. I am sent forth this day with
the Keyes of your Prison-house, to open your prison
doors unto you, if ye will embrace this great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Play unto you, O ye <hi>prisoners, come forth and
show your selves;</hi> for the Keyes of your prison-house
are with us to open your prison doors unto you;
therefore O come forth and embrace this great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Will there be any (shall I think) here that
will refuse to come forth? <hi>O go forth and flye from the
land of your captivity, and from the house of your
bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thou shalt have salvation from thy darkness
and from thy ignorance. I say unto you, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
no more of God then the stones in the wall,
I command you to come forth, and partake yet of
this great salvation, and unto you shall light arise;
even the day spring from on high and visit you.</p>
            <p>3. If ye will come and partake of this great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
ye shall have deliverance from all your fears.
Dost thou fear that thou shalt be poor? Come and
partake of this great salvation, and thou shalt be
delivered from it. Art thou afraid of hell? Come
and partake of this great salvation, and thou shalt be
delivered from that fear. Art thou afraid at the
wrath of God? Then come (I say) and partake of
this great salvation, and thou shalt have redemption
from that and all thy fears; <hi>With him is plenteous
redemption, and he can make thee quiet from the fear
of evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. If thou wilt come and partake of this salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thou shalt have deliverance from all thy anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and from all thy cares: Ye are now careful
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107525:16"/>
and anxious about many things; come and partake
of this great salvation, and it will make you careful
but onely for <hi>the one thing necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. If ye will come and embrace the great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
offered unto you this day, ye shall be helped
before ye go hence to sing that song, <hi>O death where is
thy sting, O grave where is thy victory!</hi> Now O will
ye come and embrace this great salvation, <hi>and ye
shall be more then conquerors thorow Christ who loveth
you.</hi> Are there therefore any here to day that
would have victory over the Devil, and over their
own heart? Then come and embrace this great
salvation, and then your victory is certain.</p>
            <p>But now to press home this great salvation upon
you a little further; There are nine sorts of Persons
who are invited to come and partake of this great
salvation offered this day: And I charge you
answer to your names when ye are called, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
not to come.</p>
            <p>1. First, I invite and call here to day, all who
are willing to come and embrace this great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now are there any of you here to day, who
are called <hi>willing?</hi> Then I invite you to come aud
embrace this great salvation, <hi>Rev. 22. 17. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
will, let him come:</hi> But Oh, are there none here
to day who are named willing? I intreat you if
there be any, do not deny your name, but come
when ye are called and embrace this great salvation.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Those persons who thirst for it, are
invited to come, and partake of this great salvation,
<hi>Rev. 22. 17. Let him that is athirst come.</hi> Now if
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107525:17"/>
there be any here who are named thirsty, let them
come and partake of this great salvation, and they
shall be satisfied.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, are there any moneyless folk here to
day? Let them come and partake of this great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Are there no monyless folk here to day? I
mean not that money or coin in your purses; but
want ye money? That is, Want ye righteousness?
Then I pray you come and partake of this great
salvation. I say, are ye so poor that ye have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the fear of hell? then I pray you come.
If there be any here who have nothing to commend
them to Christ, but necessity: I say unto all such,
<hi>O come, come, come,</hi> and partake of this great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, Those persons are invited to come
(and I wish there were many such) who are <hi>weary;</hi>
but oh! Are there none here to day who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>weary?</hi> Are you not weary in pursuit of your
sins? If there be any such here to day, I say unto
you, <hi>O weary folk, Come, come, come,</hi> and partake of
this great salvation, and of this excellent Gospel-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
that was purchased at so dear a rate.</p>
            <p>5. Fifthly, Those who are heavy-loaden are
invited to come, (and I think all of you may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this name) are you <hi>heavy-loaden?</hi> O then
come! But are there none here who are heavy-loaden
with sin, with misery, and estrangement from
God? If there be any such here, I say unto thee,
old man or young man, be who thou wilt, O come
and partake of this great salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:107525:17"/>
6. Sixthly, Are there any here to day who are
called blind? I say, if there be any of you who
think you want eyes to see the precious excellencies
of Christ, I invite you to come and partake of this
great salvation.</p>
            <p>7. Seventhly, Are there any who are called
lame here to day? I say unto such, <hi>O come, come,
come,</hi> and partake of this great salvation; for weare
sent forth to day to call in the blind and the maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the lame, that they may come and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
this great salvation; therefore are there none
here to day who may be called such? Are you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blinde nor lame? I hope many of you will not
deny that you are such; therefore I say unto you,
<hi>O blind, halt and maimed, Come, come,</hi> and partake
of this great salvation.</p>
            <p>8. The eight sort of persons invited, are those
who are <hi>sick;</hi> therefore if there be any sick folk
here to day, be who you will, I say unto you, <hi>O
come</hi> and partake of this great salvation; <hi>for the
whole need not the Physician, but the sick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Ninthly, Are there any here to day who
know not their name, or their condition? I say
unto you, O nameless folk, Come and partake of
this great salvation; Come to Christ for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of your souls condition; Come as a nameless
one, and he shall not reject thee, though thy case
were so evil that thou couldst not give it a name;
for <hi>of all that come unto him he sendeth none away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now where do you find your name and sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name?
O do you not know it? I hope now you
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107525:18"/>
may know; therefore I entreat you answer to it,
and so come away and partake of this great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>But I am afraid there be many strong iron bars in
the way of some of you, which you cannot win
over. Ah, how fast are some souls locked in Satans
snare! And therefore I shall speak a little for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
of those bars that hinder from embracing
this great salvation, that so you may be the better
helped to remove them.</p>
            <p>I. The first great iron bar which keepeth folk
romembracing this great salvation, is the bar of
ignorance; and I am afraid that this (as a mighty
bar) hindereth many of you: You are ignorant of
your selves, and of the condition of your souls; you
are ignorant of the Law, and of its severity and
you are ignorant of the precious Gospel in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendency.
O pray unto God that for Christs
sake he would break that great bar of ignorance;
for till that be done, Christ may take up that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
<hi>Ierem. 5. 4. Surely they are foolish, they
know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of
their God.</hi> I say this bar of ignorance keepeth you
from embracing this great salvation.</p>
            <p>II. The second bar which keepeth many from
closing with Christ, is, the bar of <hi>presumption;</hi> for
some will cry out, What need have I to embrace
the great salvation? Have I it not already? But
I say unto thee, O fool, thou art (by all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance)
yet in bondage. O that this evill bar of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
were put away; for it is one of the
greatest impediments which lieth in the way of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107525:18"/>
your embracing this great salvation that is in your
offer to day: Therefore I say unto you, if you will
come no further, I intreat you come this length, to
confess that you want this Gospel-salvation, and
that you are indeed strangers to this Redemption
purchased by Christ.</p>
            <p>III. The third bar that keepeth persons from
embracing this great salvation, is the bar of <hi>unbelief;</hi>
you belie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e not what we say to you about this great
salvation; I know that some of you are of the
Stoicks and Epicures humor, who cry out, <hi>What
meaneth this man? he seemeth to be the setter forth of
some strange God.</hi> But I say unto you, I am not the
setter forth of any strange God, but it is Jesus of
<hi>Nazareth</hi> whom I preach unto you. Alas, some
of you think this great salvation to be some morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dream, or some golden fancy: But I say unto
you it is neither a dream nor fancy; but a real
truth that we preach unto you.</p>
            <p>IV. The fourth bar that keepeth persons from
embracing this great salvation, is the bar of <hi>discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement;</hi>
this strong bar keepeth many so fast,
that they cannot embrace this great salvation,
though it be freely offered unto them. I shall say
no more to you who are such, but counsel you to do
as those four Lepers did, 1 <hi>Kings 7. 4. who sate at
the gate of Samaria; who said, Why sit we here till we
dye? if we say, We will enter into the City, then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
is in the City, and we shall dye there; and if we
sit still here, we dye also. Now therefore come, and let
us fall into the Host of the Syrians; if they save us
alive we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but dye.</hi>
Even so say I unto you, that if you abide in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107525:19"/>
state of unbelief, you shall surely be undone;
therefore go forth; for you know not but God
may work a great salvation for you; and if you
will quit your unbelief, and close with Christ in
the offer of this great salvation (by faith) you shall
have no more to do <hi>but eat and drink, and divide
the spoil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. The fifth bar which with-holdeth persons
from embracing of this great salvation, is the bar of
<hi>unwillingness; Ye will not come to me that ye may
have life.</hi> And alas, this is an iron bar indeed, by
which all that are in hell have barred themselves
out of heaven. Alas, shall you be such wretches
also? O what a dreadful sound is that? <hi>Woe unto
thee O Ierusalem; Wilt thou not be made clean?
when shall it once be?</hi> Ah, <hi>Turn you, turn you, why
will you dye?</hi> Why will you sligh this great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
O will none of you this day embrace it?</p>
            <p>VI. The sixth bar that with-holdeth persons
from embracing this great salvation, is the bar of
<hi>worldlymindedness:</hi> Many of you are so fixed to
the World, that you cannot come and close with this
great salvation. I may allude to that word spoken
of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 22. that he <hi>hid himself among
the stuff;</hi> for many have buried and nested them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the midst of the world, that they cannot
embrace this great salvation.</p>
            <p>VII. The seventh bar which keepeth many from
embracing this great salvation, is the bar of <hi>hardheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness;</hi>
there hath such a stupidity and hardness of
heart seized upon many, that let Christ preach as
he will to them (by his Word, or by other dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107525:19"/>
they are no more moved, than if his Word
and dispensations were a thousand miles from them.
O that strong bar of hardness of heart, when shall
the Omnipotent hand of God break it?</p>
            <p>VIII. The eight bar that hindereth many from
embracing this great salvation, is the bar of <hi>sloathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
Many of you cannot be at the pains to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it; but I say unto you, there is but small
pains in the way of godliness: I say unto you, it may
so easily be had, that it is in your offer to day; and
if you will, you may put forth your hand and take
it. Consider therefore what you will do. O will
you despise it? I say, will you still neglect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
it? will you but read that dreadful word? <hi>Acts</hi>
13. 40, 41. <hi>Behold ye dispisers, and wonder, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish:</hi>
Tell me freely, Would you have us to return
this answer to him who sent us, that you are despis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the great salvation? Say to it, are there
none of you who (for all this) will consent to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of this great salvation? O captives and prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and you who are in the bonds of <hi>Satan,</hi> Will
you come and partake of this great salvation, and
you shall be made free? I have an act of release
for you to day; if you will come and make use of
it, you shall be set at liberty. But, oh shall the
prison doors be cast open, and yet none come forth?
But that I may come to a close, I say yet unto you,
O poor <hi>Prisoners; go forth, go forth,</hi> and partake of
this great salvation. Oh will you not come foth?
What holdeth you in? the foundation of your pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-house
is shaken to day; therefore if you will
but come forth, and cast a look to Christ, your very
shackels shall fall off your hands, and you shall be as
those who were never bound. Now I leave this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107525:20"/>
with you, and to make you think upon it, I shall
speak these five words to you, and I intreat you
think upon them.</p>
            <p>1. First, I have excellent tydings to tell you;
(I hope some of you will give ear to them) <hi>viz.</hi>
there is a great person come here to day, and that
is the Mighty Author of this great salvation, who
hath brought everlasting righteousness with him,
desiring you to make use thereof; it is his desire
that you would take his excellent gifts at his hand.
These I say are the tydings that I have to preach
unto you; and I hope never to be declared a lyar
for what I preach unto you: I say yet unto you,
that Christ the Author of the great salvation desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to give it freely unto you, if you will but take
it. But O will you not take it? I think if you did
see an hundred men lying in prison or dungeon
without all light, bread or water, and a great
Prince coming to them, saying, I desire you all to
come forth, and partake of this great liberty which
I bring unto you; and every one of them should
answer, <hi>I scorne to come forth at this time;</hi> would
you not think them exceeding great fools? And
yet I fear this act of great folly falls out in many
of your hands to day; that when Christ hath given
us the keys of your prison doors, and they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
you will not come forth: But I must intreat
you yet to come forth and shew your selves. For
who knoweth but we may be commanded to shut
your prison-doors again, and to seal them with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
seals, with an unalterable decree from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
never to be recalled! Wherefore O ye pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
<hi>Go forth, go forth</hi> from your prison house.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:107525:20"/>
2. Secondly; I would say this to you, that it is
not without much ground that this salvation (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to yon) is called a great salvation. I know
a little paper of two or three sheets might contain
all the salvations that ever any man obtained; but
the world would not be able to contain all the books
which might be written to the commendation of
this great salvation; yea, (unto any who will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it) I say; First, if thou find not this salvation
above thy faith, then go thy way when thou art
come: But I know thou wilt finde it both above
thy faith and hope. Secondly, if thou find it not
above thy desires when thou art come unto it, then
go thy way again; but were thy desires as the
sand upon the Sea shoar, thou shalt always find
more in this salvation than ever thou couldst desire.
Thirdly, if this salvation be not above what thou
canst conceive, then go thy way when thou art
come to it; but think of it as thou canst, it shall
always be above thy thoughts of it. Fourthly, if
this salvation be not above thy opinion of it, then
go thy way when thou art come unto it; but I
know thou wilt find it far above thy opinion of it.
Therefore seeing it is so great a salvation, as that
all the world could not contain all the books that
might be written in the commendation of it; O
will you embrace it, even to day, while it is in
your offer?</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, I would say this unto you, Be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that there is no sin that will more provoke
the Majesty of God to punish you, than the sin of
slighting this great salvation. <hi>Bring forth these mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,</hi>
saith the Lord, (of the slighters of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation)
<hi>and slay them before me.</hi> I entreat you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107525:21"/>
inquire at your own hearts what you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
when you are reproved for slighting of it.
Old men, will you ask at your own hearts what you
will answer to Christ when he shall propose that
question to you, Why slighted you the great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Old women, what will you answer when he
shall say to you, Why slighted you the great salvation?
Young Men and young women, inquire at your own
hearts, what you will answer, when Christ shall say
to you, why slighted ye the great salvation? Can
ye imagine any answer to that question? O dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
shall that wrath of God be, that shall be execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the slighters of this great salvation!</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, I would say this unto you, that
Heaven is waiting to hear what exhortation the
offer of this great salvation doth get among you.
Here is the great salvation, here is the offer of it, and
here is the commendation of it; what say you to
it? Is it not an excellent salvation? is it not a free
salvation? is it not a great salvation? is it not an
eternal salvation? Why then do ye not welcome
it? Can any of you say any thing to the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of it? I know you cannot; Yea, I dare
say, your own hearts are admiring it as most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
and therefore, O will ye accept it? Alas,
shall there be none here who will be found accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this great salvation, so freely offered to
day!</p>
            <p>5. Fithly, I would say this to you, let all the
Angels praise him who is the author of this great
salvation. All the Saints round about the throne
praise him who is the author of this great salvation.
All those who are expectants of heaven, praise
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107525:21"/>
him who is the author of this great salvation. All
ye to whom this offer is made, praise him who is
the author of this great salvation. O heaven praise
him who is the author of this great salvation, O
all ye fowls of the air, praise him who is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this great salvation. O fire, hail, snow,
vapours, stormy winds, and tempests, praise him
who is the author of this great salvation. All the
tribes of the earth, praise him who is the author
of this great salvation; our own soul praise him
who is the author of this great salvation, and all
that is within us, bless him, who is the author of
this great salvation. O who would not praise him,
who is the author of this great salvation? Are
there any here that will refuse to commend him?
O think upon him, and let not this be a day of
slighting him. Now where are your hearts at
this time? I will tell you where many of your
hearts are; they are thinking upon the World:
But I am sure there are not many of them think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon this great salvation. Now what resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mind ye to go away with to day? Oh, have
ye no resolution beyond what ye had when ye
came hither to day; Are there any here who have
this resolution, <hi>To whom shall we go, but to him who
is the author of this great salvation, who alone hath
the Words of eternal life?</hi> Even the Lord breath it
upon you. Or is this your resolution, that through
Christs strength (<hi>forsake him who will) ye will never
forsake him?</hi> Or have ye this resolution? <hi>That ye
will esteem more highly of this great salvation then
ever ye did?</hi> O that <hi>the Lord would keep these in the
in the imaginations of the thoughts of your hearts for
ever.</hi> But as for you who have no resolutions to
embrace this great salvation, O wherewith shall I
commend it unto you? Do not your own necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107525:22"/>
commend it? But if nothing can perswade you
to come away and embrace it, then this place
shall be an heap of witnesses against you? <hi>for it
hath heard all the words of the law which he hath
spoken unto you,</hi> John 24.</p>
            <p>Oh cast your eyes upon these pillars of the house
and stones in the walls. I take them as so many
witnesses, that they may speak and testifie against
you in the great day of the Lord, if ye neglect this
great salvation to day. Therefore as ye go away,
be thinking upon it, and whether or not ye mind
to embrace it now while ye may have it; This
day I have set life and death before you: I have
set before you both the great salvation and the
great damnation; And O that ye had understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all these things, that ye being wise might be
provoked at last to embrace this great salvation,
the which we do yet again entreat you to think
upon. Is not heaven looking upon you at this
time, to see what ye will do with this great offer
of salvation, which I have this day from the Lord
presented unto you? Now to him that can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you to embrace this great salvation, this
gospel redemption, this blessed mystery, into which
the Angels desire to pray, to him <hi>who can bring you
back from the pit, and can enlighten you with the light
of the living:</hi> To him, who hath the keys of your
prison, <hi>Who can open, and none can shut, and can shut,
and none can open:</hi> To him, <hi>Who hath all power in
Heaven and in Earth communicate, to him who can
deliver you from the power of the Grave, and can set
you free from all your enemies,</hi> we desire to give praise,
<hi>Amen.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THere are two great and most ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
complaints in these dayes. 1.
There are many who complain, that
their estates and persons are in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and that they are sold for
Slaves to the hands of strangers: But O that we
could also turn over the complaint to this, that our
souls are in bondange, and that we are yet <hi>in the
gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity,</hi> that so
we might be provoked to long for the great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is in our offer! 2. There are many
complaining (and not without much cause) that
there is now such a toleration of errours: But O
wilt thou complain also of this, that within thy
heart there is a toleration of lusts; is there not
an act of toleration concluded in thy breast, that
the devil and all his company may reign in thee
at pleasure. Oh ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ye not need of great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Shall I tell you, that Christ is courting you
to embrace it, and that he putteth on all his most
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107525:23"/>
glorious robes, and manifesteth himself unto you, a
a suitor making offer of himself and of his great
salvation! O tell me, have ye seen him? Or do
you think to see him this day? What robes hath
he on? There are five glorious robes wherewith
he clothes himself when he condescendeth to
manifest himself to his people.</p>
            <p>First, He cometh to his own with the <hi>garments
of salvation,</hi> according to that word, <hi>Zach. 9. verse
9. Kejoyce, O dauhter of</hi> Sion <hi>greatly, shout O daught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of</hi> Jerusalem; <hi>for behold thy King cometh unto thee,
he is just and having salvation;</hi> Ay, your King is
come here to day, and will ye not fall in love
with him when he is cloathed with the garments
of salvation? Can ye ever have a more conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sight of Christ than when he is cloathed with
such an excellent robe, and offering you salvation?</p>
            <p>Secondly, He appeareth to his own sometimes <hi>in
garments dyed in blood,</hi> according to that word,
<hi>Isa. 63. verse 1. 2. Who is this that cometh up from</hi>
Edom <hi>with dyed garments in blood, as one that
treadeth the Wine Fat!</hi> And now I say to you that
will not look to Christ when he appears in the
garments of salvation, have ye a heart to refuse
him that hath fought such a combat for you, who
<hi>hath trode the wine press alone,</hi> and hath stained all
his garments with the blood of thy enemies? or is
there any here, who dare refuse his salvation, when
they see how <hi>he treadeth his enemies in anger, and
trampleth them in his fury,</hi> and thus <hi>sprinkleth their
blood upon his garments?</hi> O tremble at this sight,
and seek quarter from him in time, or he shall
dye his garments with the blood of thy mortal
soul.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Christ appeareth unto his own, being
cloathed with these humble robes of condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107525:23"/>
when he came in the <hi>similitude of sinful
flesh.</hi> O what a sight was that, to behold the
Prince of Heaven cloathed with our nature? What
a sight was that to behold him that was <hi>cloathed
with light as with a garment;</hi> to be cloathed with
our infirmities, yet he condescended to cloath
himself thus, that we might have access unto him,
and be partakers of his gifts: O can we refuse
him, when love hath thus pressed him to put on
the beggars weed, that <hi>he might say to worms ye are
my brethren, and my sisters!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Christ sometimes manifesteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being cloathed with the garments of beauty
and ravishing majesty; such was the sight that
the Spouse got of Christ, <hi>Song 2. verse 3. As the
Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood, so is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
among the Sons;</hi> and <hi>Song</hi> 5. when she saw
him <hi>white and ruddy, and the Standard-bearer of
ten thousand;</hi> And such was that joyful sight of
him, when his garment was as the light, and
white as the Snow, which he had at the transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
when these glorified ones did come [as it
were] Ambassadours from that higher house to
make him a visit.</p>
            <p>And fifthly, Christ he sometimes appeareth to
his own in robes of dreadful majesty, and terrible
highness and loftiness, when the soul upon the
first sight of him remains dead, and there remains
no more life in them; such was the sight <hi>Daniel</hi>
got, in his tenth Chapter, and such was the sight
that <hi>Iohn</hi> got of Christ, <hi>Revel. 1. verse</hi> 17. And
I would ask of all that are here, what a sight have
ye gotten of Christ to day? in which of all these
robes have ye seen him? It is true, we are not to
look for the extraordinary sights of him; but yet
if ever thou hast seen him in any of his wooing,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107525:24"/>
robes, sure he hath appeared matchless; and how
then shall ye then refuse him?</p>
            <p>But now to come to the words I was speaking
unto you of; The first thing in the words [to
wit] That there are many who live under the
offer of this great salvation that do slight it, and do
not embrace it: And now I shall only add a few
things further unto you. 1. Let me propose a few
considerations to perswade you to embrace this
great salvation: God forbid we go away before
we embrace this gospel salvation: and therefore I
charge you in his name, go not away before ye
embrace it. And to press it home upon you,
there are these eight or nine properties of this
great salvation that is offered unto you this day.</p>
            <p>And first, it is <hi>a free salvation;</hi> ye have no more
a do but to put forth your hand and take it. O
come and take it! Christ hath foughten for this
salvation, and there is no more required of you but
to come and reap the fruits of his victory; <hi>Who
ever will let him come;</hi> there is nothing that should
move you to stay away: <hi>O captives, bond-slaves to
Satan, O prisoners of hope!</hi> will ye come and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the great salvation? What holds you from
coming away and partaking of it? it is freely
offered unto you: Ay, believe it, Christ requires
no more of you, but that ye should come and take
it out of his hand; <hi>if we consent to obey,</hi> the
bargain is ended; <hi>ye shall eat the good of the
land,</hi> Isa. 1.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This great salvation, is a compleat
salvation that is offered unto you to day; this is
clear, <hi>Luke 1. verse 71. That we might be saved
from our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate
us.</hi> There is not any enemy that is in thy way,
but if thou wilt come and partake of the great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107525:24"/>
salvation, thou mayest have victory over it; so
compleat a salvation is it that is in your offer this
day. O shall we pass away and not embrace it!
O shall our cursed hearts undervalue this compleat
salvation that is come to your door? Believe it,
salvation is near unto you, ioye will take it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a wonderful salvation; it is such a
salvation as the Angels desire to pry into it, and it
is such a salvation, that all the Prophets desired to
pry into it: It is almost six thousand years since
all the Angels in Heaven fell into a sea of wonder
at this great salvation. It is almost six thousand
years since <hi>Abel</hi> fell into a sea of wonder at this
great salvation? And what think you is his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
this day? He is even wondering at this great
salvation. Would you ask at all the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
would they not all say, O embrace the great
salvation! Would ye ask at all the Saints that are
above, would they not advise you to embrace the
great salvation? Should ye ask at <hi>Adam,</hi> would
he not say, O embrace this great salvation? Could
ye ask at <hi>Abel,</hi> would he not say, O embrace the
great salvation? And would not all the Patriarchs
say unto you, O embrace the great salvation? And
do not all that have tasted of the sweetness of it,
cry out unto you, <hi>Come and embrace the great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth property of this salvation is, that it
was bought at an exceeding dear rate, it is a dear
salvation, Would you know the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christs coming to this salvation, and your
coming to it? it is this: Christ was forced to
travel through all the Armies of the Justice of
God. He was forced to drink of the cup of the
wrath of God, before he could come to purechase
this great salvation; and now what is requird of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107525:25"/>
you to obtain this? we may say no more, but put
out your hands and take it. Will ye look to the
price that was laid down for this salvation? there
is not a wound in the body of Christ, but it saith,
<hi>This is a dear salvation:</hi> There is not a reproach
Christ met with, but it saith, <hi>O is not this a great
salvation!</hi> there is not a necessity that he was put
into, but it saith, <hi>is not this a great and dear salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!</hi>
O Sirs, will ye not come and take this
great salvation, this dear salvation? What must
I give for it, say ye? I say, ye must give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for it; come and take <hi>it without money and
without price;</hi> It was dear to Christ, but it shall be
cheap unto you. O, is it not cheap unto you! I
assure, if you will come to the market to buy
the great salvation, there is none of you that
needeth to stand for the price of it. O come
and take it, and have it, and there shall be no
more priceing.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is an everlasting salvation, that ye
shall enjoy the fruits of throughout eternity, as is
clear <hi>Heb. 9. 13. He became the author of eternal
redemption unto us;</hi> it is a salvation that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
can never be able to take out of your hand;
if ye take it, ye shall never be robbed of it again.
O come and partake of this great salvation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the gates of hell shall never prevail against
you.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It is a noble and honourable Salvation;
it is not to be taken out of one slavery to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but it is to be taken <hi>out of prison that we may
reign,</hi> Luke 1. 71. compared with <hi>vers.</hi> 74. it is,
<hi>That we being saved may serve him without fear in
holiness and righteousness all the days of our life.</hi> I
say, Come, come, and partake of this great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that your glory may be increased, and that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107525:25"/>
ye may be exalted above the Kings of the
earth.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, It is a most advantagious salvation:
What are the advantages of any salvation that are
not to be found in this? Is there not peace to be
found in through this salvation? is there not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to be found through this salvation? is there
not eternal enjoyment of God to be found through
this salvation? Yea, all salvations are in this
one salvation.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It is a royal salvation, for it cometh to us
from and through the Son of God: Christ is the
author of it, and we conceive Christ may be said
to be the author of this salvation, in these respects.
1. He is the meritorious cause that did procure
it, it was the price of his blood that was laid
down for to purchase this great salvation. 2. He
is the fountain from whence it floweth, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that word which we have cited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9.
<hi>He became the author of eternal salvatiou.</hi> 3. He is
the person that fitteth our Spirits for the partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, and it is he that removeth mountains
out of the way, that we may have fair access unto
the great salvation. 4. It is he that must perswade
our hearts to embrace and to take hold of it; He
standeth without, and cryeth to the heart to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
this great salvation: and he standeth within,
making the heart cry out, Content, I will embrace
the great salvation. He is indeed the person that
commendeth and doth point forth this great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
unto us, he is the noble Minister of it; it
began first to be preached by him.</p>
            <p>Now is there any of you that have fallen in
love with the great salvation, that ye may try
your selves? I shall give you some evidences of the
persons that are near unto this great salvation. 1. Is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107525:26"/>
thy estymation of the great salvation increased,
be what it was in the morning when thou camest
hither? is thy estimation of the great gospel salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a foot higher then it was in the morning? I
say unto thee, thou art not far from the great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
come away. 2. Is thy desire after the
great salvation increased, be what it was in the
morning? Hath thou stronger desires after the
great salvation then before thou camest hither,
that is an evidence thou art not free from it. 3.
<hi>Is thy thoughts of thy necessity</hi> of the great salvation
greater than they were? Thinkest thou that thou
hast more need of the great salvation than ever
thou thoughtest before? And is thy opinion and
thoughts of saving thy self, less than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou camest hither? Art thou forced to cry out,
<hi>None but Christ</hi> can save me; I say thou art not
far from the great salvation; wilt thou come away!
O that you would once seal this Conclusion with
much heart-perswasion, <hi>I am undone without Christ,
I am undone without Christ,</hi> who is the Author of
this great salvation: Are there any of you that
are sensible that you are in the fetters of sin, and in
the bonds of iniquity? Are you brought to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of this, that you are yet in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness?
I say if thou be brought to this length, to
be sensible of thy bonds, and art crying out, <hi>O Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
hasten and come away;</hi> I say, if thou be
sensible, of thy bonds and imprisonment, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, <hi>O thou that wast anointed from eternity to
proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the
prison to them that are bound;</hi> O hasten and come
away and redeem me, <hi>even poor me;</hi> sinking, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
perishing, self destroying <hi>me;</hi> thou art not
far from the great salvation. 4. Art thou a person
who beginneth to weep because thou hast been so
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107525:26"/>
long a stranger to Christ, and the great salvation?
Old men that are here, How long have you been
strangers to the great salvation, and to the Author
of it? Now will you shed one tear for your
estrangement? and cry out, Woe is me that
Christ and I have been so long a sunder? I say, if
thou hast come that length, thou art not far from
the great salvation; <hi>Come away:</hi> O pitty your
selves, make haste, make haste, and <hi>come away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now in the third place, let me give you
some evidences by which you may know more
clearly whither or no you have embraced this
great salvation, that you may know your selves,
and that you walk not down to your grave with a
lye in your right hand.</p>
            <p>The first evidence of a person that hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the great salvation, is, that he will have
an high esteem of the Saviour and Author of the
great salvation: Hast thou a matchless esteem of
matchless Christ the Saviour of the world? that is
a speaking evidence unto thee, thou art a partaker
of the great salvation: Art thou come to this
length, that thou cryest out, <hi>None but Christ, none
but Christ!</hi> It is a speaking evidence, that thou
art come to be a partaker of the great salvation,
when thou canst cry out that word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 2.
<hi>The Lord is my strength and my song, he alone is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
my salvation:</hi> if Christ hath become thy salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then it is like he hath become thy song. I
would ask this of you, Were you ever brought
this length, that you durst nor adventure to praise
Christ alone, but was forced to call in all the
creatures, and say, <hi>O magnifie the Lord with me;</hi>
O that is an evidence that you have embraced his
salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:107525:27"/>
Secondly, Those who have embraced the great
salvation, will study to maintain and keep their
grips of it; they would study to hold fast so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a Jewel; this is prest, <hi>Gal. 5. 1. Stand fast
in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free;</hi>
yea, they will study to walk suitably to this noble
mercy, at least, they will strive and endeavour to
do it, as is also prest in that same verse. I say, if
thou hast been made a partaker of the Gospel of
salvation, thou wilt strive to keep thy self from
the power of those things that once triumphed
over thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A person that is a partaker of the
great salvation, will have a high esteem of this
mercy and salvation; so <hi>Paul</hi> when he speaketh
of it here, he cannot but put some note of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
to it, calling it <hi>the great salvation;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I say, if thou hast embraced the great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thou wilt have so high esteem of it, that not to
be so subjected to it as thou shouldst, or to be in
subjection to the power of thy lust in any measure,
will be thy burden and affliction; the man will
be sorry when he is brought forth from the house
of his bondage unto the red Sea; he will be sorry,
that when he should have songs of triumph over
his Idols put in his mouth, that they should sing
songs of triumph over him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A person that hath embraced the
great salvation, he will be longing sometimes for
the day when this salvation shall be compleat,
when he shall sing that song with that <hi>numerous
multitude which cannot be numbered,</hi> Revel. 7. 9.
O what a day shall it be, when thou shalt begin to
sing that song! after this (saith he) <hi>I beheld, and
lo a great multitude of all people which no man could
number, of all people, nations and languages, stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with
white robes, and palms in their hands, and they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
and how cryed they? <hi>They cryed with a loud
voice.</hi> They would not mutter the song, nor sign
silently; but <hi>cryed with a loud voice:</hi> And what
did they cry? they cryed with a loud voice, <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto our God who sitteth up the Throne, and to
the Lamb.</hi> I would only ask of you that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the great salvation, what songs shall be
put into thy mouth when the waters of <hi>Iordan</hi>
shall divide themselves, <hi>that the ransomed of the
Lord must pass thorow!</hi> when thou shalt sing that
song <hi>Psal. 115. 1. Not unto us, not unto us, but unto
thee belongs the glory of our salvation.</hi> O what a day
shall that be, when that excellent song shall be put
into thy mouth! yea, what a day shall it be when
thou shalt be cloathed with those excellent gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are made mention of, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 10. for he
hath cloathed thee with the <hi>garments of Salvation;</hi>
and he hath covered thee with the <hi>robe of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
O what robes are these? Did you ever see
such excellent robes as these must be? I think we
will misken our selves; O do you not think we
will misken our selves, when we shall put on those
excellent robes! Now therefore is the bargain
closed, or will ye go away before ye take this great
salvation? Dare ye go out at these doors and neglect
the great salvation? I would ask this of you,
think ye it will not be most sad, that Christ should
tell this in Heaven of you to night, I was preached
to a pack stones, that none of them would love
me! Will ye not be feared that this report shall
be carryed back to Heaven of you! for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
can Christ carry back but this? Now is the
cord of this great salvation let down unto you, is
there none of you that will take a gripe of it! will
ye flighter after it? will ye make this a rejoycing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107525:28"/>
day in heaven, that is a fasting day unto <hi>you?</hi> and
the <hi>way</hi> to make it so, is, to embrace the great
salvation. Now what <hi>say ye</hi> to it, old men? let
me speak to <hi>you,</hi> and ask <hi>your</hi> thoughts of the great
salvation; <hi>Gray</hi> Hairs should be a crown of <hi>glory</hi>
if it be found in the <hi>way</hi> of righteousness; old men,
speak <hi>your</hi> minds, that <hi>young</hi> men <hi>may</hi> not have
<hi>your</hi> bad example: What <hi>say ye</hi> of this salvation? Is it
not a most glorious salvation? is it not a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
salvation that is in <hi>your</hi> offer? I intreat <hi>you</hi> speak
<hi>your</hi> minds, tell Christ <hi>ye</hi> are content to take the great
salvation; otherwise, whoever he be that will not
partake of this gospel salvation, I in the name and
<hi>authority</hi> of Christ our Master, denounce eternal
and irrevocable war against him; put on <hi>your</hi>
harness, <hi>ye</hi> shall not boast when <hi>ye</hi> put it off again;
the wrath and <hi>fury</hi> of God shall come upon <hi>you</hi> to
the uttermost if <hi>ye</hi> embrace not this great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Other wars are but for a time; the greatest
Captains that ever the earth did <hi>carry,</hi> are now laid
<hi>down in the sides of the Pit, and their swords broken
under their head.</hi> Armies of ten hundred thousand,
a hundred <hi>years</hi> time have laid them all in their
graves, and ended all their contests; but there is
no discharge of this war that shall be concluded
betwixt Christ and <hi>you:</hi> it shall become an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and most terrible war, which shall be but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
when time is ended. Now peace or war,
which of them will <hi>ye</hi> choose? Dare <hi>ye</hi> send a
charge to Christ, and <hi>say ye</hi> will defie him? I am
afraid there will be two things that <hi>many</hi> of us shall
report to <hi>day.</hi> First, I am afraid there will be
<hi>many</hi> that will give <hi>Pharaohs</hi> repot to the offer of
the great salvation; and <hi>say, Who is the Lord, that
I should obey him?</hi> I tell <hi>you</hi> who he is, He is <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders.</hi> O
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107525:28"/>
embrace him before he go hence, and give not
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> report, lest <hi>ye</hi> be drowned in the Sea of
his wrath, whence there shall be no <hi>recovery. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
I fear there will be <hi>many</hi> here to <hi>day,</hi> that
will give <hi>Demas</hi> report to this precious offer: I
will go and forsake Christ, and embrace this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
world: O bad exchange! Cursed be he that
shall make it! Will <hi>ye</hi> be of <hi>Demas</hi> humour. I
fear there hath been <hi>many</hi> of that humour of a
long time; but I entreat <hi>you</hi> once be wise before
<hi>ye</hi> die. I confess that proverb, Old fools, are
twice fools: I think old men that will not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the great salvation, I think <hi>ye</hi> are triple
fools. What wait <hi>ye</hi> for? is there <hi>any</hi> thing can
afford <hi>you any</hi> satisfaction but this great salvation?
Now are <hi>ye</hi> convinced old men, that Christ is
waiting for <hi>your</hi> answer, I intreat <hi>you</hi> before <hi>ye</hi>
go hence, speak <hi>your</hi> minds what <hi>ye</hi> think of the
great salvation: is it not a <hi>lovely</hi> salvation? is
it not <hi>lovely</hi> now? What <hi>say ye</hi> to it? I am to
go <hi>away,</hi> and the offer is to be taken up at this
time, and it is hard to <hi>say,</hi> if ever <hi>ye</hi> shall have
an offer again. I would <hi>only say</hi> this to <hi>you,</hi> and
be sure of it; though I should never be a partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of this great salvation, <hi>yet</hi> I shall be a witness
against <hi>you</hi> that are not partakers of it. I tell and
declare unto <hi>you,</hi> I shall be a witness against
<hi>you,</hi> if <hi>ye</hi> embrace not the great salvation; Now
old men, are <hi>ye</hi> perswaded to embrace it? let me
obtest <hi>you by</hi> the <hi>beauty</hi> of Christ, come and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the great salvation, ye that are travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the borders of eternity: Now if ye will
give no more, give this, will ye go home and
think upon it? I shall not be uncharitable, nor
enter to judge your thoughts. I fear there shall be
many declared and found guilty amongst us, that we
have declared unto heaven we will not embrace the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107525:29"/>
great salvation, but have troden the blood of the <hi>Son
of God under foot.</hi> Now I entreat <hi>you every</hi> one of <hi>you,</hi>
ask of <hi>your</hi> selves if <hi>ye</hi> be the persons that will <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
in your hearts to do so.</hi> Now I shall leave it with
<hi>you,</hi> let it not be a witness against <hi>you:</hi> I shall leave
it with this; O come <hi>away,</hi> old men, <hi>young</hi> men, old
women, and maids; come and embrace this precious
gospel salvation. Ye <hi>may say, ye</hi> bid us come; but we
cannot come: I desire no more of <hi>you,</hi> but to come
with this; Lord I am content to come, but I cannot
come: Come once to that: for if once <hi>ye</hi> be content
to receive it, it will not be long before <hi>ye</hi> be able to
receive it. Now shall Christ depart, and will none of
<hi>you say ye</hi> are content to take him, will <hi>ye</hi> charge <hi>your</hi>
own consciences with this; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I content to take
Chrst and the great salvation; O blest, blest, blest be
he that is the author of this <hi>great salvation,</hi>
and blest be he that gets <hi>any</hi> of the ends of
the cord of the great salvation, that we
sink not under the wrath and <hi>fury</hi> of the Lord!
Come and embrace this great salvation;
and again I <hi>say,</hi> come and embrace it; for what can
ye have if <hi>ye</hi> want it; and what can <hi>ye</hi> want if <hi>ye</hi> have
it; I shall <hi>say</hi> no more, but close with that word,
<hi>Isa. 62. vers. 21. Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed to the
ends of the World, to those that are far off:</hi> What hath
he proclaimed, <hi>Say ye to the Daughter of</hi> Sion, <hi>Behold
thy salvation cometh, behold it cometh!</hi> I <hi>say</hi> to <hi>you</hi> that
are the ends of the World, Salvation is brought hear
unto <hi>you, Stout-Hearted and far from Righteousness,</hi>
the great salvation is brought near unto <hi>you,</hi> and will
<hi>ye</hi> send it <hi>away!</hi> Oh consider what <hi>ye</hi> are doing. And
to him that can perswade <hi>you</hi> to embrace the great
salvation, we desire to give praise.</p>
