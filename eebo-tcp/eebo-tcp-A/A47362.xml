            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat which induced me to publishthe insuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, at this time, is first, the consideration of the present Providence of the great God, under which we are exercised; wherein it may appear to all, that he hath with an out-stretched Arm, begun to deliver his people, and to plead the controversie of Sion, against his old and implacable Enemies, such a gracious dispensation as we have certainly never before seen, and what the issue or event of it will be, we cannot be ignorant, if we consult his word, <hi>Babylon must fall,</hi> that is evident, and that this Mystery <hi>Babylon</hi> is the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is fully cleared in this Treatise, which we hope may tend to convince such who have had any doubt upon their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits about it, and confirm others in the stedfast belief thereof; true 'tis not above 6 or 7 years, since we wrote something of the same nature, but that lying in a folio, a book that comes but into a few hands; Besides this is great part new, and many things of another nature insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on; I have been stirred up to make it publick in this small tract, hoping that such who read it will see some further cause <hi>to hate the Whore and all her off-spring</hi> who still retain her Persecuting Spirit, tho' blessed be God, this Nation and <hi>Scotland</hi> likewise, are stirred up of late, with just revenge against her, the Lord continue it, for there is much work still to be done both here and abroad, before that glorious state of the Church comes in, which we have so long waited for, as touching the time of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> final ruin and overthrow, something we have here said, and have also given the various Apprehensions of many learned and worthy Writers in respect of that, as

               </gap>ing the Slaying and Resurrection of the two Witnesses, together with their Ascention, which will have its further opening by the works and providence of God, so that our light, <hi>like the path of the Just, shall shine more and more to the perfect day;</hi> time will make manifest what is in the Womb of the present Providence. That which adds further incouragement, is, I perceive almost every where Gods people are much upon the search into the Prophesies of the Scripture, and Revelations of St. <hi>John about the time of the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have given some brief hints touching the seven Seals, Trumpets, and the seven Vials or last Plagues spoken of by St. <hi>John,</hi> which may, we hope, let in a little light into some mens understandings, and tend to the putting of them upon a further search, we conclude that the six first <hi>Seals</hi> spoken of, <hi>Rev. 6.</hi> open things that were to come to pass in the World, from the time that <hi>John</hi> received his Revelations until the years <hi>311</hi> or <hi>320,</hi> or there abouts, which produced, (1.) That fearful <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy</hi> from the Apostolical Faith, and true Christianity of the Gospel Church. (2.) The utter overthrow of the sixth Head of the Beast or <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperors Reign, and so put an end to the ten bloody Persecutions under them, for under the sixth Seal was effected or brought to pass their final ruin signified by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, <hi>Rev. 6.</hi> Which overthrow was first begun by <hi>Constantine the great,</hi> and fully compleated according to History by <hi>Theodosius</hi> about 379. under the 7 Seal there was silence in Heaven for half an hour, <hi>viz.</hi> A short time of rest for the Church and Saints of God, which began in Constantines dayes and lasted as some conceive till the troubles rose by the <hi>Arians</hi> which was, if I mistake not, about the latter end of his Reign, but others say it continued till <hi>Theodosius</hi> died, in the year 395. also under the Seventh Seal come in the Angels with their <hi>Seven Trumpets</hi> the 6 first Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ('tis concluded by most learned writers) brought
<pb facs="tcp:66447:3"/>
in those things that were effected or accomplished under the Papal power and <hi>Turkish Empire</hi> as also the death and Resurrection of the Witnesses, and so brings in the second woe.</p>
            <p>The seventh Trumpet, as I conceive, brings in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention of the Witnesses, and then comes out the seven Angels with the seven Vials and last Plagues; the first of which I cannot believe hath as yet been poured out, nor shall, till the Ascention of the Witnesses, which will be attended with that second Earthquake, <hi>Rev. 11.</hi> and from that very time I conclude the Kingdom of Christ will begin, which I know is quite contrary to what Dr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> Dr. <hi>More, Du Moulin,</hi> and of late <hi>Peter Jurie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> have written; the reasons why I am of this Opinion, you will find if you read the latter part of this Treatise. Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> if I mistake him not, says that <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> &amp;c. might be said to pour out the first Vial, and that two or three more of them have since been poured out by the Angels or Ministers of God out of the Temple, as they have been indued with more or lesser light, but we cannot think any of the Sackcloth Witnesses, who have lived under the time of the Beasts 42 months, can be said to pour out any of those Vials, because they are said to be clothed with pure white linnen, and to have Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Girdles about their breasts and for several other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which we have here given, 'tis indeed very strange to many wise men that Mr. <hi>Jurieu</hi> should so confidently affirm that all the Vials should be already poured out by Gods Ministers, and that they are still in their Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have so all along.</p>
            <p>Others there are who Judge that the Seven Vials shall none of them be poured out till the Seventh Trumpet shall begin to sound, which will effect her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter overthrow, and so bring in the third woe; of this opinion was that Worthy and Learned Divine, Mr. <hi>John Canne</hi> and some others, time will open these things more clearly, but I am perswaded whensoever those Vials
<pb facs="tcp:66447:4"/>
and last Plagues come to be poured out, Gods Judgments will be so manifest, that they will be discerned and known of all, and be quite different from all other Judgments that have fallen upon the Antichristian State and people from their first rise.</p>
            <p>But since we are in the Judgment of all Godly and Learned men, come towards the end of the wonders, let none be discouraged, for though there is very near a most dismal hour, yet it will doubtless fall upon the heads of the wicked, and such who are of <hi>Baby lons</hi> Race and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Godly shall see the Lord hath not forgotten them, nor the righteous Blood that has been shed, but will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear suddenly to plead <hi>Sion's</hi> controversie, and set up his own Kingdom; therefore let us be much in prayer, and cry mightily to God, and be ready to meet the Lord in his more glorious appearance, for we are very confident a very dreadful hour is near, and it will come upon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, secure, and all formal Protestants, nay, <hi>fear shall surprize the sinners in</hi> Sion, tho' it will be a glorious hour to all that are found faithful to Jesus Christ; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire all enquiring persons to weigh well what we have said in the latter part of this Treatise, and if it affords any further light to any of them, let them bless God, I am in hopes it will put many upon a further search into the Prophesies of the Scripture about the time of the end: However I sha'l at present say no more, but leave it to the blessing of the Lord, (till I see a little further what God is about to do) and at present take my leave of thee, and remain thy Servant in the Gospel,</p>

               <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Wherein the various Opinions concerning <hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> are discovered and all their Objections Answered, who deny by her is meant, the Papal Power, or present State and Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>'TIS evident to all who are men of any Reading, that most of our Eminent Protestant Writers, both Ancient and Modern, do affirm without the least doubt, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the great Whore spoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66447:6"/>
called, <hi>Mystery Babylon:</hi> yet we find that most worthy men, who have of latter times, so well defended the truths of the Gospel, in opposition to Popery, have not so much bent their Study this way; I mean directly to prove that which is our present task—as it hath been to detect divers or most of her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous principles, and detestable practices, which is rather to Lop off some of the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this Evil and Cursed Tree, than to Dig it up by the Root, for if it be clearly proved, that she is that great Whore; <hi>viz. Mystery Babylon the great, Mother of Harlots;</hi> down she goes at once; and if we have not done it so effectually as it may be desired, yet we are in hope wherein we have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, it may stir up some abler Pen, to perfect what we have anew undertaken;—But to proceed, for the more orderly management of our present work, it may not be amiss if we give you the various opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that have more or less presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the World, about who or what People this great Whore <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> is, which may be reduced to these seven follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. And first of all, as Reverent Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, some would have it to be the whole World of Wicked men.</item>

this <hi>Babylon</hi> to be old <hi>Chaldean Babylon.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. That it is <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and that for two Reasons:
<list>
                     <item>1. Because the man of Sin, or last Beast, that is to Head this <hi>Babylon,</hi> is set forth by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to sit in the Temple of God, shewing himself to be God.</item>
                     <item>2. Because this City where the Beast reigns, and -shall slay the Witnesses, is Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where our Lord was Crucified, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 8.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>4. That it is the <hi>Turkish Empire,</hi> or Power of the <hi>Saracens;</hi> which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> somewhat touches, and in a brief way most Learnedly argues against: in his third Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 644, 645.</item>
               <item>5. That it is indeed <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of the Fourth, or Last Empire; but <hi>Rome,</hi> in its Heathen state, under the Idolatrous and Persecuting Emperors: so the <hi>Rhemists</hi> would have it, if there be a necessity to fix upon <hi>Rome,</hi> to be this <hi>Apocalyptical,</hi> or <hi>Mystery Babylon.</hi> For this opinion the present <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> have no better Advocate than Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> who hath done very worthily at other turns; but here has doubtless greatly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken his way; see his Annotations upon the 17th Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. That it is the present power &amp; Church of <hi>Rome</hi> who under pretence of the most High
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66447:7"/>
and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, doth influence and govern the Secular Power and State of Kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Of this last opinion were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Waldenses</hi> who felt the bloody Power of of <hi>Rome,</hi> venting it self in most horrid and Barbarous Cruelties against them, and that for a long Series of time, as appears by our most Authentick, Ancient, and Modern Writers, who give a very ample account of the great Persecution of Christians for many hundred years last past, in all parts of the Christian World, where they have had Power. To which opinion of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> most of our Modern Protestant Divines agree, of which we shall mention only <hi>Cartwright, Fulk,</hi> the worthily Admired, and Learned <hi>Mede,</hi> not forgetting famous <hi>Du Moulin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as may be seen in their works at large.</item>
               <item>7. Some of the Papists who grant that by <hi>Babylon, Rome</hi> is meant, but would have it to be <hi>Rome</hi> towards the End of the World, when they say <hi>Rome</hi> shall apostatize from the Pope to Paganism again; and now, because we will not take things upon trust, nor refer the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to many Books and Quotations, it appears needful that we remove the Objections with as much brevity as we can.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And first, That Mystery <hi>Babylon</hi> cannot be fairly applyed unto the whole World of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, nor to old <hi>Chaldean Babylon,</hi> nor to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66447:7"/>
               <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> nor <hi>Saracens,</hi> nor termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the Heathenish State of <hi>Rome,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Rome</hi> towards the End of the World, when they say <hi>Rome</hi> shall Apostatize from the Pope to Paganism again.</p>
            <p>And that none else can be meant or intended by her but the Papal Power of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Mystery <hi>Babylon</hi> cannot be the whole world of wickedmen; for in opposition to this, 1. The Apostle <hi>John</hi> speaks here of a certain <hi>great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth, v.</hi> 18. This cannot be meant of the wicked world. 2. The World of wicked men, are <hi>those Inhabitants of the Earth,</hi> whom this Woman made drunk with the Wine of her fornication: Now she that made them drunk, and those that were made drunk, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the same. 3. This Woman, <hi>v.</hi> 9. sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on seven mountains, and so do not all the wicked of the World. 4. We are Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come out of this <hi>Babylon,</hi> but we are not obliged to go out of the World.</p>
            <p>2. If she were the old <hi>Chaldean Babylon</hi> then, (1.) Where is the mystery mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5. (2.) Mystery <hi>Babylon</hi> here mentioned is by all acknowledged to be the Seat of Antichrist; So was never old <hi>Chaldean,</hi> (3.) Besides it is generally agreed to by all, not without good grounds, that Literal <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66447:8"/>
was no more than the Type of her, which is all we will speak to it.</p>
            <p>3. It cannot be meant the City of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Because <hi>Jerusalem</hi> did not reign over the Kings of the Earth in St. <hi>John's</hi> time, when he saw this Vision, and wrote the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> which this City <hi>Babylon</hi> is expresly said to do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 18. <hi>And the Woman which thou sawest is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth. Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> having been not only under captivity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times before, but was then entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke, as the whole History of the Gospel doth confirm, and themselves do most plainly Confess; <hi>We have no King but</hi> Caesar.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was never in so high esteem with the Beast, as to be capable to ride as Queen Regent upon him, (as this Woman, Whore, or City is said to do) <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>And the Angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the Woman, and the Beast that carryeth her, which hath the seven heads, and ten horns, Rev.</hi> 17. 7. compared with verse 3. <hi>so he carryed me away in the Spirit into the Wilderness, and I saw a Woman sit upon a Scarlet Coloured Beast, full of Names of Blasphemy, having seven Heads, and ten Horns,</hi>—For by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66447:8"/>
Woman sitting, and the Beast carrying, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly signified, Influence, Power, and Dominion, which <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was far remote from, not only under the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, but also under the three Kingdoms that went before it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>Babylonian, Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Persian;</hi> as might be largely illustrated both out of Sacred and Humane History.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> did not sit upon many Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which is Interpreted to be People, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Tongues, that is, had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or dominion over them: as this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Whore, or City is said to have, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>And he saith, The Waters which thou sawest, where the Whore sitteth, are Peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations, and Tongues:</hi> The whole Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> being under Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the <hi>Roman</hi> Government at that time, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from</hi> Caesar Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus, <hi>that all the World should be taxed;</hi> and particularly <hi>Galilee, Nazareth, Judea,</hi> and the City of <hi>David</hi> called <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was not capable to Enchant and Bewitch all Nations round about her, either by her Religion and Doctrine, or by great Gifts and Rewards.</p>
            <p>1. Because the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, kept her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and much in awe, on the one hand, not owning nor subscribing to her Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:66447:9"/>2. The Christian Doctrine and Religion; Blocked up her way on the other hand, that she could not Extend her Influence to either Neighbouring, or Remote Nations, as this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Whore, or City is said to do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>For thy Merchants were the great Men of the Earth; for by thy Sorceries were all Nations deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> though she were guilty of much Blood, from the beginning of her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Glory in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Prophets, even all that were sent unto her, Murthered, <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and our Lord and Saviour, as also the blessed Martyr St. <hi>Stephen;</hi> yet in her could not be found that great Mass of Blood that was shed, and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads of Christian Saints that have been Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously Murthered, by Massacre, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Martyrdom, since they were ruined and destroyed by <hi>Titus Vespasian,</hi> which we find positively charged upon this City <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>And I saw the Woman Drunk with the Blood of Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jesus; and I wondred with great Admiration,</hi> as indeed well he might, (as shall be shewn:) <hi>And in her was found the Blood of Prophets, and of Saints, and of all that were slain upon the Earth, that is, since the</hi> Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. And Lastly; not to multiply more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66447:9"/>
this head, Though <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was fearfully destroyed, as the History of <hi>Josephus</hi> shews, yet shall she rise again, be Built upon her own Heap, be replenished with her own Children, which this City <hi>Babylon</hi> under Consideration shall never be, after this Catastrophe, which <hi>John</hi> saw visionally coming upon it; <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 21. <hi>And a mighty Angel took up a stone, like a great Milstone, and cast it into the Sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great City</hi> Babylon <hi>be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It cannot be the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> for two reasons offered by the Learned <hi>Mede, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 643.</p>
            <p>1. Because, though they did arise to great Power in the World, yet they had not their seat in that great City, which in St. <hi>Johns</hi> time, reigned over the Kings of the Earth, which this <hi>Babylon</hi> is Expresly said to have.</p>
            <p>2. That they did not rise by Apostacy, from the Christian Religion, which this <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> with her head (the Man of Sin) did; for, as this worthy Author saith, the <hi>Turk,</hi> (whatever he be) could be no Apostate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was of a Nation that never was Christian. To which we shall add somthing for the clearing of this head, that we may discharge that Debt we owe to God, to the Church, and the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:66447:10"/>3. It cannot be the <hi>Turks,</hi> because they are not strangely and wonderfully mysterious, which this <hi>Babylon</hi> is said to be, <hi>Rev. 17. 5. And upon her fore-head was a name written,</hi> MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And the Angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou Marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the Woman and the Beast which carryeth her, which hath the Seven Heads and Ten Horns.</p>
            <p>What special mystery hath shewed it self to the World from the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> more than from other common Empires or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, that is matter of admiration to the wisest of men? Is it matter of wonder, that the <hi>Turks</hi> do own but one true and most high God? Is it matter of wonder, that they do own Jesus Christ to be a Prophet and a good man? Is it matter of highest wonder that they prefer <hi>Mahomet</hi> above <hi>Jesus?</hi> Is it matter of wonder, that they appear true to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, in matters of Civil Commerce? Is it matter of highest wonder, for them to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep what Dominion they have, and to enlarge it, to make Slaves and Prizes of those profest Enemies they take Prisoners? We say, in none of these things is there any high Mystery, or matter of greatest Wonder, being things common to all Places and Kingdoms Invested with Power: For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:66447:10"/>1. Did not the great King of Literal <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> own the only true God, yet still held the Church in Captivity?</p>
            <p>2. Did not <hi>Israel</hi> own the same, and yet kept their Idols after their revolt from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Did not <hi>Judah</hi> prefer <hi>Moses</hi> above and before Christ, and at that time when Christ was personally among them working most Stupendious Miracles which did evince his Divine Mission? Nay, did they not prefer a Common and Notorious Villain before the Blessed Lord of Glory, when they desired a Murtherer to be freed, and pressed hard to have the good and Blessed Jesus the Saviour of the World, killed? And did not this wise Apostle know this to be true in fact, and to Equal, nay, outdo any thing that the <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Saracens</hi> ever did, or can be accused of? And if St. <hi>John</hi> was Transported with asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing wonder, at Matters much less than he had seen before, doth it not give good reason to suspect him of Weakness and Defect, that he should suffer himself to be surprised with the greatest wonder, at far less things than he had seen and known before; certainly therefore we must conclude there was something more of mystery in <hi>Johns</hi> Vision than what had been shewed to the world, by the great <hi>Turk,</hi> or any other Power; and indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66447:11"/>
the greatest Mystery that ever the World was acquainted with: For the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of <hi>Babylon</hi> must either be singular, that is, such as none have besides; or else they must be transcendent, to go far beyond what others had in a Lesser degree. Otherwise <hi>John</hi> might have kept the Description of <hi>Babylon</hi> to himself, there being no clear Distinctions, to render the wisest and most Discerning men able to make Judgment upon her; The mystery then, that is written upon this woman, <hi>Babylon,</hi> seems clearly to lye in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars following.</p>
            <list>
               <item>

               <item>Secondly, That under this monstrous Guilt, she is prodigiously Confident, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all regret, or show of shame, and most Impudently boasts of the highest Sanctity and Holiness in the World, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That she is Totally Pure, Infallibly Certain, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That this indeed is a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be wondered at, let it be Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</item>

            <p>1. That a Shepherd should be a Wolf, and devour that flock which he pretends to be an Overseer or Pastor of.</p>
            <p>2. That a professed Servant of Jesus Christ, and the meanest of Saints, should exalt himself
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66447:11"/>
above his Master, and not above his Master only, but above the God of his Master, and all other Deputed Gods, that are Vicegerents to the King of Heaven, by slighting and trampling upon the holy Scriptures and Laws both of God and Princes, dispensing with the breach of them, indulging the highest violation thereof, and setting up his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, Traditions and Decrees above them; insomuch that there is a thousand times less danger (in their esteem) in respect of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, and Corporal Punishments in this World, or of Damnation in the World to come, in breaking and violating the Laws of God and Princes, than there is in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or breach of the Inventions, Traditions and Decrees of Mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> and her Head.</p>
            <p>3. That one sitting in the Temple of God, pretending himself as a poor Apostle, Vicar, and Successor of Christ, nay, as the Successor of a poor Fisher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man, should wear the highest Ensigns of Imperial Dignity!</p>

to drive a Trade in Perjury, forswear every thing they are justly charged with, and is fully proved against them; Ninthly, To foment Wars and Broils in every Kingdom and Countrey where they have Power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the Ruine of Towns, Places, Cities, Countreys, and Kingdoms, by Fire, Sword, and most Cruel Devastations; Tenthly, To slaughter, kill, and barbarously murther both Men, Women and Children, even all that dare make a shew of Conscience and Religion, so far as to abhor and dissent from these Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: This is such a Scheme of Religion, and Systeme of Divinity to come from an Apostle, a Shepherd, a Vicar, and Successor of Christ, from a Church, Sheep, Saints, and the pretended followers of the Meek, Peaceable, and Innocent <hi>Jesus,</hi> who taught altogether otherwise by his Doctrine and Example, that it might well be wondred at, and is the strangest Mystery that ever appeared, of which we challenge the whole World to shew the like in the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens.</hi> For men to Swear, Lye, and to Forswear themselves, and yet be true Men; to contrive Rebellion, Murther, and Treason, and yet be as Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as the Child unborn: To be elevated to the highest Pinnacle of Pride, even above Emperours and Kings, above Jesus Christ, and God his Father, and yet be humble and

lowly: To commit gross Idolatry, and yet be the Servants of the Living God: To be filled with, and make a Trade of Excess and Drùn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, and yet be Patterns and Standards of Sobriety and Temperance: To cast down the Truth to the ground, deface the Laws of God, and burn the Scriptures, and yet be the true Witnesses of it: To forgive sins, and yet be the greatest Sinners themselves: To commit Fornication and Adultery, and yet be spotless and pure in heart: To foment Wars and Broils in every Kingdom and Countrey where they have power; to contrive the Ruine of Towns and Places Cities, Countreys and Kingdoms, by Fire, Sword, and cruel Devastations, and yet be as harmless as Doves to all mankind, the only Sons of Peace and Quietness: To slaughter, kill, and barbarously murther Men, Women and Children, that dare not be so wicked as themselves; and yet to be full of mercy, tender pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, an Apostle, Shepherd &amp; Vicar, Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of the Meek and Lamb-like Saviour.

            <p>From whence did proceed the Murthers, Massacres, and Martyrdoms, of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Professors of Christianity, that have died by violence in the Christian World, for the space of twelve hundred years last past? And from what people did proceed those hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Oaths, Blasphemies, and Execrations, that the World hath wofully been acquainted with, most horrid and strangely astonishing to repeat?</p>
            <p>Came these unparallel'd Degrees of Impiety
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66447:14"/>
from the <hi>Turks?</hi> from the <hi>Waldensians, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therians, Calvinists,</hi> or any <hi>Non-conforming Protestants?</hi> No, no; why whose Language then is it? Whose! Why, 'tis the Language of the Beast of the Bottomless Pit, and Bloody Whore, who bare these Blasphemous Sons of her own Body, daily nourishes them at her Breast, and strengthens them in their sinful courses, by accounting them the Sons, the precious Sons of <hi>Sion,</hi> the true Sons of the Catholick Church, the Darlings of Heaven, the beloved ones of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and gives them Pardons for these Bold and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven daring sins, as often as they commit them, and come to ask Pardon for them; so that Sin and Pardon is as constant and common with them, as Breathing and Eating. And these things are done to Seal and Confirm Lies, which is the more heavy, heinous, and prodigious; For if men may Lye by Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; may kill, and shed Innocent Blood, without controul of Conscience and Church censure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sons of the most high God: Then may we claim a Patent, and take a License to change the name of all things, and alter the Ideas of the minds of men; call and account <hi>Beelzebub</hi> a good God, and all his black Tribe, the pure Saints of the most High; call the lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Blackness and Darkness, to which he is confined, the Heaven of Glory and Eternal Light, of which things we ought in Justice to clear the <hi>Turks:</hi> until Witnesses of undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed credit shall come forth, and evidence that the <hi>Turkish</hi> State, is the Mother of as great Abominations as these are.</p>

And Lastly; The <hi>Turks</hi> cannot be <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery Babylon,</hi> because they never were made drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jesus; which this Woman <hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> is expresly said to be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>And I saw the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jesus: and I wondred with great admiration.</hi> Now let any man shew such blood-shed, Saints blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, by Massacres and Martyrdom, for the Professing of Christianity (which must be if the Text be answered in that clause, <hi>Blood of the Martyrs of Jesus,</hi>) by the <hi>Turks,</hi> either within their Dominions, or without, as hath been shed by a Generation, nearer home, and we shall become like the Man without the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66447:15"/>
Wedding Garment, wholly speechless, and say not a word more about <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Now that <hi>Babylon</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is Great <hi>Rome,</hi> that in former times Reigned, and in suture times shall be destroyed, is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some of the Papists themselves, and is asserted by all Protestants; the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them is brought to this narrow Point. The one wholly confines <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, and there totally to terminate; the other brings <hi>Babylon</hi> down lower, to <hi>Rome</hi> Antichristian, or Papal <hi>Rome.</hi> Now that this work may be to edification, and more full satisfaction in this great case, we shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the last and chief Secret that is to be opened and considered, namely, Whether all things in <hi>John</hi>'s Vision or Prophecy that are applied to Mystery <hi>Babylon</hi> did compleatly terminate in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, and came no further?</p>
            <p>In answer to this great Enquiry, we do with the body of Protestants in opposition to the Papists, conclude the negative; <hi>viz.</hi> That all things in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> applied to Mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> did not terminate in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen; the reasons of which Negative are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>1. Because the Beast, that Mystery <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> rides on, is the eighth Head, or last Ruling Power of that City that is seated upon seven
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66447:15"/>
Hills, which must be <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, because the whole Race of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen was gone off, before the eighth Head came up—The sixth Head was in <hi>John</hi>'s time; the seventh was to come and continue but a short space; <hi>The Beast that carries the Woman; (viz.)</hi> Babylon, <hi>is of the seventh, but is the eighth, and shall be the last; for he goeth into Perdition.</hi> This being so evident from the Letter of the Text, needs nothing more to confirm it. Now that <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen was not the last part of the Romish Power, is not only the full and joynt Consent of all Writers upon this subject, but is so evident to all the Christian World, that it would be vanity it self to make a shew of proof. The Conclusion then is this; If the very last part of the Roman Power carries the Woman <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that the Heathen State of <hi>Rome</hi> went off before, and was not the last; then <hi>Babylon</hi> could not terminate in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, but must come down to <hi>Rome</hi> Papal; see <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 3, 7, 9, 11.</p>
            <p>2. If <hi>Babylon</hi> be totally terminated in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, then the Book of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is of little use to the Latter ages of the Christian World? For if the whole. Transactions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Persecution of the Church and the slaughter and destruction of God's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, did end in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, then it served only to give a Characteristical account of a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66447:16"/>
Beast, and Whore that was grown old, and ready to go off the Stage; but hath wholly left us in the Dark, and given us no notice at all of that horrible Confusion and Bloody Persecutions, which have Reigned in the Christian World for more than a thousand years last past; which for length of time, Numbers of Murthers, and manner of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hath outdone all the wickedness of <hi>Rome</hi> in its Heathen State. Which is not at all likely, that a Vision should be given, and a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, and call'd so, about a State that was almost expired, and the most and great princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part wholly left out, and said nothing to. Who can Imagine, that a careful Saviour should be so full in his discoveries to the Jewish Church, concerning their sufferings, and the time under <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> Literal; and be so short and lean to his Gospel Church, to leave them altogether without any written Prospect, or extraordinary Prophet, to inform them what should come to pass in the world, from the going off of the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, to the end of all the Churches Troubles, which have already lasted above a thousand years? The Conceit of which is fit but for two Ranks of men to Receive, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Roman Catholicks and such Protestants as Look for Antichrist to come at the end of the World, after the Restauration of the Jews to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66447:16"/>
their own Land, and building a material Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> where Antichrist shall sit three days and an half, or years, to kill two men called the two witnesses.</p>
            <p>3. If this last <hi>Babylon</hi> was wholly to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, then there was no cause of wonderment and great admiration for a wise man, to see in a Vision an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish State, under a Diabolical Influence, to perform Actions suitable to their State, and not contrary to their Professions for what matter of Wonderment can it be to feel the Wind blow, to see the Sea foam and hear the Waves Rage and Roar, when the Winds oppose his Effluxion? And what cause of great wonderment and admiration for a wise man to see wicked Heathens oppose and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute Christianity when it is so suitable to their Spirit, and agreeable to their Profession so to do, we cannot yet understand, and we will diligently Listen to them who will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to inform us: For the thing is true, that a wise man did wonder at the sight he saw with great admiration, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>I saw the Woman drunk with the blood of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Jesus, and I wondred with great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Wondred!

            <p>4. This man of Sin, mystery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or head of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> State, is said to be let or hindred in his designs, <hi>He that now letteth, will let, until he be taken out of the way,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 7.

            <p>5.

one (<hi>viz.</hi>) the man of Sin, did evidently sit in the Church or Temple of God, and so fulfilled this Prophecy in the very Letter of it.</p>
            <p>6. He (that is, the man of Sin, or head of this <hi>Babylonish</hi> State,) was to rise by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy, or falling away from the Christian Religion, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>There shall come a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away first;</hi> exactly agreeing with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophecy to the same purpose, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Now the Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the Faith, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen did not rise by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy from the Christian Religion, or a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Faith, which they never profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as is Evident to the whole World: <hi>Ergo.

            <p>7. This man of Sin, or head of mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> lay hid in the Apostles time and was not revealed: but the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then did not then lye hid, or wanted to be revealed; for it stood visible and high, upon a Hill, even upon seven Hills according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet <hi>Ovid,</hi> (who lived about the very time of Christ's being on Earth) in <hi>Lib. de Tristibus.</hi>

But the rise of the <hi>Romish</hi> greatness and power, when Heathen, was not after the working of Satan, but was said by <hi>Daniel</hi> to be produced by the Providence of God, or the four winds of Heaven; And by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, to the <hi>Powers ordained of God, Rom.</hi> 13. 1.

            <p>10. This mystery of iniquity is not only

            <p>11. The wicked <hi>Babylonish</hi> State, comes forth with a great pretence of Miracles, which are but false Signs, and lying Wonders, to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66447:20"/>
deceive and cheat the People; and by this means they Conquer Nations, and carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Kings to their wicked Interest. This <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen did not do; for though the Heathenish Power of <hi>Rome</hi> did Conquer Nations, and Countrys, with their Kings; yet it was by State policy, and force of Arms, not by pretended Miracles, false Signs, and lying Wonders, therefore <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen cannot be this mystery of Iniquity, or Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish State.</p>
            <p>12. This wicked State, under considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is declared not only to depart from the Faith by a Palpable Apostacy, but to forbid Marriage, and Command a long Lent, and many other fast days, whereon some sorts of Meat are prohibited to be eaten; which doth so fully agree to the Papal State of <hi>Rome,</hi> that nothing can be more plain, unless the Spirit had expresly told us; this will be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, for these two things we have their Canons upon Record, the which if none can shew the like of the Heathen State of <hi>Rome,</hi> then <hi>Rome</hi> Papal shall carry the Title of this mystery of Iniquity, and Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish State.</p>

            <p>VII.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66447:24"/>
the Judgment of the Antients; besides, some of the Papists themselves reject it as improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and detestable, as our Annotators observe, for then Sr. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> passes by in utter silence, all the transactings that have been in the World, under Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> even ever since the seven head or Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Government went off of the Stage, which is near 1260 years which is ridiculous to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>Besides it cannot be understood of <hi>Rome</hi> in either of the other notions, as hath been proved.</p>
            <p>1. Because Antichrist is to <hi>sit in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, 2 Thes. 2. 4. as God,</hi> therefore not in a Pagan City.

            <p>2. Because there is nothing said of this <hi>great Whore</hi> or this <hi>Babylon,</hi> but admirably agreeth to <hi>Rome</hi> in its present state.</p>
            <p>We shall conclude with the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If by mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> is not meant the whole World of wicked men, nor old <hi>Chaldean Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> nor <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> nor <hi>Saracens,</hi> nor <hi>Rome</hi> in its Heathenish State, nor <hi>Rome</hi> after she shall desert the <hi>Pope,</hi> and turn again

to Paganism, then it must be Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Romish</hi> Church; But she is none of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer six we have proved: <hi>Ergo</hi> she is Papal <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>If all the marks and characters left us upon divine records, to know mystery <hi>Babylon</hi> by, do most aptly and directly agree to <hi>Rome</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, then <hi>Rome</hi> Papal is mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> But all the marks and characters left upon divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord do most aptly and directly agree to <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, or the present State and Church of <hi>Rome: Ergo Rome</hi> Papal is mystery <hi>Babylon.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Wherein is clearly proved that all the marks of mystery <hi>Babylon</hi> doth fully meet in, and agree to <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, or the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FIrst of all let it be considered, <hi>Babylon</hi> is set forth by a Woman, which Imports either a single Person ranked in the feminine Gender; or a body of People related to some Head, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or publick person, to whom she is joyned in Wedlock, by Covenant or Matrimonial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66447:25"/>
as <hi>Eve</hi> was related to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; therefore called woman; or as <hi>Judah</hi> &amp; <hi>Israel,</hi> who were Joyned in Covenant with God, and therefore called a woman, or as the true Church now Marryed or Joyned to Christ, and therefore called a Woman. A single Person as <hi>Eve</hi> was, she cannot be, because the Character given of her in respect of her State and Actions, doth no way Comport with it: she must therefore be a body of People, related to some Head, Husband, or Publick Person, as <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> of old was, who are often called by the Title of a Woman: and in like manner <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> before the Degeneracy, where a People, Joyned in Matrimonial Contract, by Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant and Profession to the Son of God.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Mystery</hi> Babylon (<hi>it appears from hence) Imports a body of people that were once united in a solemn Gospel Covenant to the Son of God and hence Metaphorically called a woman and I saw a woman set,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the woman was arayed in Purple and Scarlet,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parallel. Rome</hi> Papal or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a body, a great body of People, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their apostacy were a true Church, by Gospel Covenant and profession united to the Son of God as her publick head and husband, <hi>Rom. 1. 6. Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ. To all</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:66447:25"/>
               <hi>that be in</hi> Rome <hi>beloved of God called to be Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Mystery</hi> Babylon <hi>is a City, a very great Mystical City in a threefold respect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>In respect of power, Rev</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In respect of people, Rev.</hi> 18. 10. 16. 18, 19, 21.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>In respect of place, or Residence, where this power and people is seated, City being indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely taken for either of these, or comprehending all, as in these Instances, Psal. 121. Isa. 14. 31. Acts</hi> 19. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parallel.</hi> So likewise the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a City, a very great mystical City, and may be so called in a threefold considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>1. In respect of power, which is twosold; 1. Civil. 2. Ecclesiastical, signified by two horns like a Lamb.</p>
            <p>2. In respect of people, which are great, the fame of which people as a mystical City or Church was great before the power and chief dominion of the place was joyned with it as a Church which came in by the Apostasy, <hi>Rom. 1. 8. First I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole World.</hi> And since they adulterated from their primitive Purity, and become Antichristian, they have been and still are a great people, no united body calling
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66447:26"/>
themselves a Church of Christ in respect of number and for fame coming near them.</p>
            <p>3. Great in respect of place or chief resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence where this power and great people are seated, and by way of eminency, as a Mystical Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it may indeed well bear the Bell away. For what people have given further occasion to be spoken of in respect of power, people and place of chief residence throughout the whole world as <hi>Rome</hi> has, as will hereafter be made more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident.</p>

in the world, and under this verbal meekness and self-denial the greatest oppression, cruelty, superstition, covetousness, vain glory and love of the world that ever was manifest, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their pompous and glistering garbs, their cruel persecutions, and the vast sums of money brought in from all parts of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, by sleights, cunning and deceitful Cheats: Besides a meer hodg-podg of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, one Order or Fraternity professing that which another writes against, and cries down; which is the more strange to come from a Church infallible, and that cannot err.

               <hi>that they, tho they worshipped Idols, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, The Temple, the Temple of the Lord are we, and would by all means be accounted the Church of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paral.</hi> Even so in like manner <hi>Rome</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, or the Church of Rome, is not only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Woman; But according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture History, and notorious matter of Fact, she is a whore, having utterly adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated from what she was once, and so may justly bear that brand or black name, for in the Apostles time she joined her self to the Lord, to be his, by firm tyes of a Gospel covenant and profession, and as a renowned Spouse of Jesus Christ, owned and professed him in the time of heathenish <hi>Rome,</hi> and received the Apostles and Servants of God amongst them, and withstood the fury of the Emperors, suffering Persecution, and had their faith spoken of throughout the whole World; but yet after all this, like <hi>Israel of old,</hi> She left God, Jesus Christ, and almost all his Holy Laws, and Ordinances, and made Idols to her self of Saints, Angels, Reliques and Images, upon which she doted, and forsook the Son of God, upon the working and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the vile person or man of Sin, who exalted himself into the place of Christ; and became her head, by which means she is so far degenerated from what she once was,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66447:28"/>
that she retains nothing of what really apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to true godliness, but the bare names of God, Christ and Christian Religion, having corrupted the true worship of the Son of God, her first Husband, and notoriously abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience and subjection to him, taking this vile person the Pope to be her head, and chief guide, and setting him up in the place of, and in dignity above Christ, her first head and only guide of her youth, and yet (like <hi>Israel of old</hi>) still cryes, <hi>The true Church, the Holy Catholick Church, and Mother Church are we;</hi> having on her forehead a strange mystery written, <hi>i. e. God, Christ, Truth, Verity, Unity, Universality, Infallibility;</hi> And yet with that on her forehead, and in her heart too, is written, <hi>Devil, Pope, Lying, Blasphemy, Idolatry, Deceit, Perjury, Blood and Horrible Cruelty</hi> towards the best of men, professing Christ and Religion in uprightness and truth: for which her abominable Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and change of her first Head and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and setting up this vile Person with which she commits most horrid lewdness or Spiritual Whoredom, together with the Kings of the Earth, she is ranked by the Holy Ghost, amongst the worst of Women, and stil'd the great Whore, and as her type and predecessor of old, a well favoured Harlot, but since her Spiritual Adultery and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66447:28"/>
hath been so apparently proved upon her, by many worthy and eminent authors, or Protestant Writers, we shall conclude this black character with this following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and proceed to the next mark.</p>
            <p>If there be no body of professing People, in the Christian World, that have so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, declined, or adulterated from what they once were, deserting the holy headship, doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, example, and right government of Jesus Christ, having set up another visible, publick, and universal head of the Church, in room and stead of him; whose Power, Laws and Edicts, are preferred above and before the authority, laws and precepts of the Lord Jesus Christ, as <hi>Rome</hi> Papal or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done: then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the great Whore spoken of.</p>
            <p>But there is no body of professing people in the Christian World, nor throughout the Earth, who have so apparently declined, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated, and deserted the Holy Headship, Doctrine, Example and right Government of Jesus Christ, <hi>ut supra,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> Papal or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo Rome</hi> Papal or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is mystery <hi>Babylon</hi> the great Whore.</p>
            <p>If any should think this argument not weighty, let them shew if they can, that some other people different from the Church of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66447:29"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> have made as great or like change in point of Religion and Headship, and matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thereto pertaining, so as this black character of Whore, great Whore, may more fitly and fully be made to meet upon them, and we must confess our argument not weighty, but till then, we conclude it carries conviction in the Bowels of it.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Mystery</hi> Babylon <hi>is not only set forth by a Woman, City of Confusion and Whore, but also a great City, and great Whore, and the great City was divided, &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 16. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>And the Woman which thou sawest is that great City,</hi> Rev. 17. 18. <hi>I will shew thee the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great Whore,</hi> Rev. 17. 1. <hi>I think it necessary to reassume this character again, the Spirit of God noting this as a most eminent mark of her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paral:</hi> Now that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is not only a Whore and Mystical City but a very great City, and Whore, will yet appear more evident.</p>
            <p>1. She hath a great name; no name so great in the Christian World, as the name of <hi>Rome;</hi> she is called a Queen, and being join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Contract to her universal Head, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope or Man of Sin, she would seem to be far greater than Emperors, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes, and pretends a power to give them their Crowns, and set them upon their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66447:29"/>
Heads, and kick them off again at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>2. Great in Power. She gives Rules and Laws to Kingdoms, advances her Ecclesiastical Edicts above Temporal; she sets the Pope, and the chiefest of her Sons, above secular Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; makes them unacountable, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a power, to Absolve, to Bless and Curse at her pleasure, and without controversy the lesser is blessed of the greater.</p>
            <p>3. Great in multitude. There are no People besides, that are in a spiritual united Body, and visible community, professing Christianity, comparable to her, for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or the vast numbers of her Children.</p>
            <p>4. Great in actions, vile actions, such as deposing and poysoning Princes, fomenting jealousies, raising Wars, setting Nations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Ears, invading rights and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Nations and Kingdoms by subtile insnarements, and cunning stratagems, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tumults and uproars, contriving Mass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, burning Cities, and carrying on dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful devastations, where she is gain-said; and that which adds to her greatness, is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible confidence she hath, that all persons and things are made for her, and given to her, so that all things she doth are allowed as Legal and Just in Heaven, tho the actions are most vile and as unhumane as any can
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66447:30"/>
be, in the Judgment of any undeceived mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: from whence we shall frame this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> If there be no united Body of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or visible Community in the Christian World, that is so great in name, power, multitudes, and actions, vile actions, as <hi>Rome Papal</hi> or <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath been, and still is—then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is mystery <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is no united Body of People, or Community in the Christian World that is so great in name, power, multitude, and actions, vile actions, as <hi>Rome</hi> Papal or Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo Rome</hi> Papal is this great City, Whore or Mystery <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. <hi>Mystery Babylon is said to sit upon many Waters, which is expounded to be People, Multitudes, Nations and Tongues,</hi> Rev. 17. 1, 17. <hi>And he said unto me, the Waters which thou sawest, where the Whore sitteth, are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues, &amp;c.</hi> which according to the learned <hi>Mede, Peter Du Moulin,</hi> and other famous Protestant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is more than a third part of the ten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable parts, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy fell into, not long before the Pope that man of Sin, and Head of mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> assumed the imperial Seat and Throne, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66447:30"/>
became ten Kingdoms with Crowned Heads, assisting the Beast against the Lamb, and Persecuting of the Saints, distinguished into ten Kingdoms of the Empires, I. of <hi>Germany.</hi> II. <hi>France.</hi> III. <hi>England.</hi> IV. <hi>Scotland.</hi> V. <hi>Denmark.</hi> VI. <hi>Polonia.</hi> VII. The Kingdom of <hi>Spain.</hi> VIII. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Navarre.</hi> IX. The Kingdom of <hi>Hungary.</hi> X. The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which <hi>Rome</hi> Papal had in possession, as our <hi>French</hi> author saith, in the days of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paral.</hi> So then it appears evidently that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has directly this mark of <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> also, she sitting upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Waters, <hi>viz.</hi> people, multitudes, nations, and languages, that she sate upon, or ruled over, more than one third part of the ten, which was formerly under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, in its civil state, is evident, which<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

which Kingdoms, as <hi>King James the First,</hi> in his learned works makes out, took their rise with <hi>Rome Papal,</hi> upon the division or ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in its civil state, the body of which Kingdoms may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many waters, <hi>viz.</hi> people, multitudes, nations and tongues, or people of several lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which were as well known to have been under the Usurpation, and Jurisdiction of Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> as 'tis known there have been and still are Papists in the World, which doth fully answer to the very letter of the text, <hi>viz.

            <p>2. This is very evident yet further by her making all the <hi>European</hi> Kingdoms, and Merchants thereof Rich, that traffick by Sea, by the great expence of all commodities, which are swallowed up, by reason of her pride and bravery, which could never be effected, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less she had nations, and multitudes, under her jurisdiction to contribute to her great pride and luxury.</p>
            <p>3. A third Instance to confirm it is, the numberless number of good Christians she has prey'd upon and murdered, in most of these Kingdoms for no other cause, but for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing against her Idolatry and Usurpation, which shews what power she had over these nations, and tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:66447:32"/>4. And lastly, The vast sums of Money she has extorted and squeezed from these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Nations, to uphold her pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right, preheminency, and usurpation over them, which you have an account of by several worthy Writers, who fully witness to the truth of what we say upon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
            <p>And from the whole we shall draw this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> If there be no Body of people, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Church or State in the World (under any single denomination) that sits upon, <hi>i. e.</hi> commands, or bears rule over people, multitudes, nations, and tongues, as <hi>Rome Papal</hi> or <hi>Church of Rome</hi> doth; then <hi>Rome Papal</hi> or the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> is <hi>Mystery Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is no Body of people, professed Church or State (under any single denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) that sits upon, <hi>i. e.</hi> commands, or bears rule over people, multitudes, nations, and tongues, as <hi>Rome Papal</hi> or <hi>Church of Rome</hi> doth; <hi>Ergo Rome Papal,</hi> or <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> is <hi>Mystery Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the establishing this argument, let it be considered that the whole state of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World consists but of these two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> considered as Head and Body, and those who dissent from her,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66447:32"/>
who are so inconsiderable, whether the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Albingenses,</hi> Hugonots or other parties of Protestants, that no one party of, nay if we put them altogether, can be said to sit upon, <hi>i. e.</hi> command, or bear Rule over people, multitudes, nations, and tongues, to answer to this Character of <hi>Mystery Babylon;</hi> the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> and <hi>Hugonots,</hi> have been and still are a Persecuted People; the <hi>Lutherans</hi> never got up so high as to command many States, or Kingdoms, or people of many languages; <hi>Great Britain</hi> (tho a Protestant State or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,) comes not up to answer this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, much less the <hi>seven united Provinces</hi> that of late times revolted from the Crown of Spain; so that if <hi>Rome Papal</hi> hath done so, and no other people that dissent from her, have ever yet nor could do the like, then this proves <hi>Rome Papal</hi> that great Whore <hi>viz, My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery Babylon</hi> that sits upon many Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. The seventh mark or character of <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> is this, <hi>viz. She is such a Whore, that Kings and great men of the Earth, are said to commit Fornication with her; see the text</hi> Rev. 17. 2. <hi>With whom the Kings of the Earth have committed Fornication, i. e</hi> Spiritual Fornication<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Fornication in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, or after a mysterious manner, such as <hi>Jerusalem</hi> of old was charged with, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:66447:33"/>
22. 1. <hi>Isa.</hi> 16. 26. Which was a following like Idolatry that this Woman <hi>Babylon</hi> hath done, <hi>viz.</hi> corrupting the true worship of God, and adoring Idols, or making of Images and Representations of the true God, by which they pretended to worship him; and so great was her Fornication that 'tis said she did corrupt the Earth with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paral.</hi> Now that <hi>Rome Papal,</hi> or <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> hath this black mark and character upon her, is most evident, <hi>viz.</hi> such a Whore that the Kings of the Earth, have committed Fornication with her, she having corrupted the Earth with her filthy Fornications, they following her abominable Superstition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
            <p>1. For First, Hath she adored the Pope, as her Lord God, universal Head, and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bishop, setting him up above all Laws? The Kings of the Earth have been so intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, with the cup of her Fornication, that they likewise have done the same.</p>
            <p>2. Hath and doth she worship the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> Angels, and many departed Saints? Even so have and do many of the Kings of the Earth likewise.</p>
            <p>3. Hath she adored Images, the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix, the Host, and Pictures of pretended Saints? Even so she has caused the Kings of the Earth to do likewise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:66447:33"/>4. Hath she foolishly, and Idolatroully de based her self with the adoration of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of known and unknown Saints? So the very same has she caused the Kings and great men to do also.</p>
            <p>5. Hath she grosly, and superstitiously worshiped the true God, in a false manner? By crouding in an innumerous train of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable, and foolish fopperies into his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and pretended service, which he never ordained, as <hi>Candles, Candlesticks, Altars, Vestments, Spittle, Salt, Oyl, Holy Water, Beads,</hi> and a world of such like trumpery? So have the Kings and Noble ones of the Earth done and still do; as the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> Kings of <hi>France, Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> formerly and of late also; from whence we will draw this argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> If there be no Body of people in the Christian World, pretending to a Church State, that have set up Idolatry to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and with whom the Kings of the Earth have jointly agreed, and complied, as <hi>Rome Papal</hi> or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done, then <hi>Rome Papal</hi> or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is this myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Babylon</hi> spoken of.</p>
            <p>But there is no Body of people in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, pretending to a Church State, that hath set up Idolatry to such a degree, and with whom the Kings of the Earth have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66447:34"/>
complied, as <hi>Rome Papal, &amp;c.</hi> hath done, <hi>Ergo</hi> the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is Mystery <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To reinforce this argument, let any man that will become an advocate for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> shew that any people, differing and dissenting from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are guilty of like Idolatry, with whom the Kings of the Earth have complied, as aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we will reject this argument; but if this Character doth more fitly, nay directly meet in <hi>Papal Rome,</hi> our argument is good and unanswerable.</p>
            <p>VIII. Another Scripture Mark and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> is this, <hi>i. e. she doth not only cause the Kings of the Earth to commit Fornication with her, but she hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated the minds and hearts of multitudes, and corrupted great part of the World, with the Wine of her Fornication, even the common sort of people; see</hi> Rev. 17. 2. <hi>And the inhabitants of the Earth, have been made drunk with the Wine of her Fornication, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paral.</hi> That <hi>Rome Papal</hi> or <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath not only caused Kings of the Earth, and great men, to commit fornication with her, by dancing after her Pipes, in all her myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious allurements, and detestable errors, but hath also intoxicated the Minds and Hearts of multitudes, and miserably corrupted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ched great part of the World, or common
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66447:34"/>
sort of people, by her erroneous and wicked doctrine: O what a world of poor people hath she a long time deceived, and made to commit Spiritual Fornication with her, in <hi>Italy, Germany, Poland, France, Spain, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, Ireland,</hi> and lastly in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> too, besides many other Countreys!</p>
            <p>1. As first, Is it not a strange intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that such a multitude of the Inhabitants of the Earth, should believe, that a wicked man should be appointed of God to be the Vicar of Christ, as if God had no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Honour of his own Name, and the good of his Church, and Dignity of his Son, than to substitute a Child of the Devil, (as all wicked men are) to be Vice-gerent to the most holy Jesus, in the highest transactions that relate to Heaven and the Souls of Men? Surely if God shut <hi>Judas</hi> out of his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick for his wickedness, tho an Apostle, it can't stand consistent with his truth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to set up or allow of a wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Pope, got up to the highest pinacle of pride, and make him the Immediate Deputy, and successor of Christ, and to impose a Wolf as Shepherd upon the universal Church.</p>
            <p>2. One who saith that he is an infallible Judge, to determine Articles of Faith, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with power to Impose them, upon
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66447:35"/>
great Penalties; so that as a Lord he hath Dominion over Mens Faith, Consciences, and Souls too; which the Apostles disclaimed.</p>
            <p>3. Is it not a strange intoxication, that such a multitude of poor People should believe, that the Church cannot err, tho God and Thousands of good Men, see and fully know, there are not such abominable Errors in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, nor such villanous Enormities, cursed Actions, cruel and immoral Practices, in the World? Nay, such that Turks and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels do abhor. Yet this doctrine that the Church is infallible, and cannot err, the poor deluded multitude believes, and hate, nay kill, others that oppose it, and venture Body and Soul upon it.</p>
            <p>4. Is it not a strange intoxication, that such a multitude of the Inhabitants of the Earth, should believe, that the Pope tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so wicked, nay a priest (tho he be a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous villain, a contriver of Murther, and an abominable Adulterer) hath power to absolve his equals and fellow Sinners from all their Sins, tho directly committed against God; If he come to confession? tho the pretended penitent keeps his old evil habit, of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness still; contrary to what God and Jesus Christ in his blessed Word saith; where 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded that 'tis God alone that forgiveth Sins, and blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

man must be born again; <hi>i. e.</hi> the evil habits must be changed, and all wicked practices must be forsaken; or no forgiveness nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Kingdom of heaven, <hi>John</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p>5. Is it not a strange piece of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft and Intoxication, that such a multitude of the inhabitants of the Earth, should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a Purgatory, which is no part of Heaven nor Hell, and that men may be redeemed out of it with Money? tho God saith, <hi>The redemption of the Soul is precious, and ceaseth for ever, Psal.</hi> 49. <hi>i. e.</hi> After the offering of the Body of Jesus Christ once for all, and that 'tis only the Blood of Christ which purges and cleanses from all sin, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 9. and that we are not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, but with the precious Blood of Christ, as a Lamb without Blemish and without Spot.</p>
            <p>6. Is it not a strange Intoxication, and a clear demonstration that the Inhabitants of the Earth have drunk of the Wine of this Whores Fornication, that such a multitude of poor Souls should believe, that a filthy and wicked Priest, by speaking a few Words can not only make Bread and Wine sacred, but also turn and change the Bread into the real Body and Blood of the Son of God, and make whole Christ of a pittyful Wafer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cake,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66447:36"/>
by a charm of five Latin words, <hi>viz. Hoc est enim corpus meum;</hi> and this transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated Idol they fall down before, &amp; adore as their Maker, anathematizing and cursing all that shall deny this Idol of indignation, to be adored with the highest degree of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which is proper to God only, for she saith 'tis her God, as she singeth in her <hi>Roman</hi> Missal.</p>
            <p>

            <p>In this, as one observes, they out-do the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Heathens, who thought none was so witless, as to believe, that that which is eaten is a God, yet this God of theirs these Canibals devour, even Flesh, Blood and Bones in their conceit, the poor deluded mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude believieng contrary to their own natural Reason, and all their sences, that they eat real Flesh, when they eat that Wafer-cake, the substance nor quality being changed, the Form, Colour and Taste of Bread remaining after the Words of Consecration.</p>
            <p>7. Is it not a strange Intoxication, that such a multitude of people should believe, that evil and idle doctrine of hers, <hi>viz.</hi> that no person, how good and pious so ever he be, can be saved, out of the Pale of their polluted,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66447:36"/>
ungodly, and devilish Church, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'tis a great doubt and question whether any member of such a false Church can be saved, sith the Holy Scripture saith, <hi>that no Idolater hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of God;</hi> and again, that <hi>If any man worship the Beast, and his Image, and receive his mark in his Forehead, or in his Hand, the same shall drink of the Wine of the wrath of God, &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 14. 9, 10. <hi>And he shall be tormented with Fire and Brimstone, in the presence of the Holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lamb, &amp;c.</hi> Besides, considering the Scripture direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holdeth forth that all who are born again, or truly regenerate, shall be saved, let them be of what Church they will, provided they are sound in the essentials of the Christian Faith, and not guilty of Idolatry, for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the new birth comprehends, a change of all such erroneous principles, as well as of other evil and corrupt habits and wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>8. Is it not a strange kind of Spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication, that such a number of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth, should believe, that 'tis no Sin to Lie, Swear, and For-swear, to Kill, Slay, and Murther, such they call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks (tho never so Godly) if it be for the cause of Holy Church, with a thousand things of the like nature, which the people do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,

and dare not disown upon their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but boldly adventure to ingage at all opportunitys to Fight, and make War, burn Citys, lay waste Countries and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and destroy by Massacres, and all manner of Murthering ways, all Ranks, and Degrees of Men, who oppose the horrid prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of this vile Church, and cursed practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of these <hi>Sons of Belial.</hi> Nay they will go boldly to their own deaths, when convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and justly condemned for such like villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and deny to day what they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of yesterday, and tho never so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously guilty, yet will take it upon their Death, they are as innocent as the Child un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born; what can this be, tho they drink it down as sweet Wine, but an Infusion of the rankest and most deadly Poyson that the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est celler of the bottomless Pit can afford, the very Wine of the Whores Fornication, and the most dangerous Intoxication in the World?

And 'tis no wonder she thinks she may do any thing, having a dispensation from heaven (as she pretends.) which the Pope keeps the Keys of, fearing no power on Earth.</p>
            <p>And now that she hath the secular power to support her, upon which she sits or rides in great pomp, is evident, and that they are really distinct, for what of the secular power

is still left at <hi>Rome,</hi> is under the conduct and management of the Church, there being no civil administration of Justice or exercise of Laws, but what is authorized and allowed by the Pope, the Head of this Ecclesiastical State; to make this further evident, the Pope doth not only exercise a power of appointing seculars at <hi>Rome,</hi> and near to it, but he claims the like supremacy abroad in other Kingdoms; if the secular Princes fall off from him, or will not be reconciled to him, and own him as head of the Church, he will excommunicate and depose them, and takes away their Crown<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When the Virgin Mary, Angels, and Saints, are invocated with Prayers and Addresses, that only belong to the Divine Majesty, as if those creature were infinite, and could hear us at so great a distance as Earth is from Heaven, which they could not do if perpendicularly over us, much less from all parts of the World, over which they cannot be; whether this ascribing Infiniteness and Omnisciency, and Divine adoration to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is only due to the Creator, is not Blaspemy?</p>

Blood; but that this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty of nothing is more clear, which indeed gives cause to every good man in the World to abhor her. And that we may make this most evidently to appear,</p>

            <p>The poor <hi>Waldenses</hi> living in, and about the valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> about the year 1560 were most cruelly and barbarously murthered; to allay her excessive thirst, some were stript stark naked and whip'd to death with Rods of Iron, others drawn through the Streets
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66447:50"/>
and Burnt with fire brands, some thrown down an high Tower, and some cut in pieces with sharp Knives, fourscore persons had their Throats cut, as Butchers kill their Sheep, threescore Women were so cruelly rackt, that the Cords pierced their Arms and Legs to the Bones, and then being cast into Prison they all died except nine of them; young Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins were Ravished in a Barbarous manner until they died, Children were pull'd alive out of their Mothers Bellies, and the Breasts of many Women cut off, so that the Infants died of Famine; and many other strange kind of tortures, for many years together multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of those Godly <hi>Waldenses</hi> indured.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Albingenses</hi> who professed the same doctrine and principles, were all along in the like or worse sort and manner (if possible) butchered; in the City of <hi>Bezier,</hi> there were, saith my author, threescore thousand persons slain, the Priests and Fryers going about the Streets in the mean time with Crosses and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and singing, <hi>Te Deum Laudamus;</hi> in the year 1655 in the Valley of <hi>Lucerna</hi> and other places, this bloody Strumpet thirsting still af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Blood of the Saints, and like a filthy drunken wretch caused an Edict to be put forth, that such who would not turn Papists within three days, must take what would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and indeed that was bad enough, as you

            <p>WE having shewed and clearly evinced by an induction of fifteen particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that <hi>Rome</hi> Papal is <hi>Mystery</hi> Babylon <hi>the great, the Mother of Harlots and Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth,</hi> she having all the marks or characters directly meeting in her, that are by the holy Ghost given of that great Whore; we shall in the next place briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how the acts and progress of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church, do most fitly and fully comport with other Types, and Prophecies of her in the holy Scripture, and first with literal or <hi>Chaldean Babylon,</hi> from whence I find most writers conclude, she had the name <hi>Babylon,</hi> given to her, in respect of the growth, acts and deeds of that old <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, which we shall now open and run the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel in divers particulars as followeth.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Literal</hi> Babylon <hi>had a great Head or King ever her, called a Head of Gold, also Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer or Son of the morning.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:66447:57"/>So likewise <hi>Rome</hi> Papal hath a great Head or King over her, called the Universal Bishop, whose power is magnified above the powers of Emperors, and all Kings and Princes of the Earth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In like manner <hi>Rome</hi> Papal hath had domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over many Countries or Kingdoms, no less than the Territories or Jurisdictions of ten considerable Kingdoms, called ten Horns, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>III. <hi>Chaldean</hi> or Literal <hi>Babylon,</hi> fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a four-fold circumstance, in respect of her Supream Head, <hi>viz. Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> (1.) That <hi>he was,</hi> when in great Pride he insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly said, <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babylon <hi>that I have built by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Majesty.</hi> (2.) <hi>He was not,</hi> when by the Watchers, and the Holy Ones he was toss'd from his Throne, and made to eat Grass with Oxen till seven times past over him.

He went off fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, when God brought the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> against his Successor, into whose hands the Kingdom was translated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> is foretold by the Angel to fall under a four-fold circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

also, in respect of the Beast that is said to carry the Whore, and make War with the Saints; <hi>and the Beast which thou sawest was, is not, and yet is, and shall go into perdition,</hi> Rev. 17. 8. (1.) <hi>He was</hi> of old in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan state, triumphing in great glory and grandeur, but received a wound, yea a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound in one of his Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> in his sixth Head (which was the Pagan power) in <hi>Constantine's time,</hi> and so <hi>he was not.</hi> The Christian Emperors having the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarch; and to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose speak our late Annotators on the 13 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Rev. v.</hi> 3. and <hi>chap.</hi> 17. 8. It must, saith he, be the sixth Head, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pagan Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> who had that mortal wound, and that wound was the Conquering the Pagan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and the abolishing of <hi>Paganism</hi> and Idolatry, and putting an end or stop to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, which was done by the seventh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>viz.</hi> the Christian Emperors, <hi>He yet is, i. e.</hi> his wound was healed by the rising of the eighth Government which was of the seventh, who appeared in a new dress, <hi>viz. a beast with two horns like a lamb but spake like a dragon,</hi> which was the Antichristian power or <hi>Papal Rome,</hi> and more particularly the Pope; time (the best opener of these great Mysteries) has fully discovered these things to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>VI. <hi>Chaldean</hi> or <hi>Literal Babylon</hi> set up Images, and had Idols of Silver and Gold, Wood and Stone, to which they bowed and worshipped, which were also representations of the Gods and Saints whom they adored, to wit, of <hi>Bel</hi> (which was <hi>Jupiter</hi>) and <hi>Nebo</hi> and <hi>Succoth berioth,</hi> and the like, and such who would not bow down to her Images, she threatned to cast into the Fire, into the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiery Furnace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 30. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> - 9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 46. 1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome</hi> in this shews her self to be her Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type very plainly, for hath she not ordained to her self Temples, <hi>Images of Christ</hi> and the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and other <hi>Saints,</hi> nay; and not only these but the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> but especially the <hi>great Idol of the Mass?</hi> so that whosoever will not own that most ridiculous Idolatry of a piece of Bread consecrated by the foul Mouth and unhallowed Hands of their cursed Priests, to be their God and Saviour, must be burned at a Stake, these Idols they tell us ought to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66447:59"/>
have due honour given to them, because the honour which is given to them is referred to the Prototype whom they do represent, and these abominations she <hi>kisseth,</hi> as Idolaters of old were wont to kiss the Calves; lighteth Tapers before them as the <hi>Literal Babyloniam</hi> did Candles before their Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. <hi>Literal Babylon</hi> or <hi>Chaldea</hi> were not only a people of great Pomp, Pride and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, but had also great Riches and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. <hi>O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But she sits also upon many waters; <hi>to wit, People, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, Nations and Tongues.</hi> But is very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous as well as proud, and full of treasures, for besides the gifts she boasts were first given to her in the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, she hath made a prey upon the Nations thro' her fearful covetousness, and not only a prey upon Nations and Kingdoms, but a spoil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Saints and Holy Martyrs, and hath had the Gifts of Kings, and vast Revenues setled upon her Orders and Clergy; nay, and she has peeled the people by selling Pardons and

Indulgences, and raising <hi>Peter-pence,</hi> besides vast sums for praying poor Souls out of the <hi>scorching flames</hi> of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> nay, so horrid covetous is she, that she is not willing any should go to Heaven without great Gifts of Money to Holy Church; besides, much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney comes in by tolerating Whores and Whoredoms, (which thing is notoriously known to be done in many Cities of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) by which slights she is grown-so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich and full of treasure, that she can afford a Golden Cup to present her intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Wine in, to be cloth'd (as we said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) with Scarlet, deck'd with Gold, Pearl and precious Stones; yea, she maketh the Merchants of the Earth rich who Trade with her, she doth indeed as fully answer to the Type in this, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 10. stretching forth her hand upon all the pleasant things of those Countries and Kingdoms where she hath sate as a Queen.</p>

been guilty of that most horrid cruelty of forcing both Ministers and people from their dwellings, labouring to starve or famish both their Bodies and Souls too, and not contented to burn their Bodies to ashes, but has oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times burn'd their Houses, Towns and Cities, as <hi>Germany</hi> hath wofully experienced, and <hi>England</hi> also, witness the burning of the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City of London, Southwark,</hi> and its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent places; who knows how many Fires she hath kindled in the space of twenty eight years last past in this Island? And then for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing godly women and chast Virgins in a beastly manner, she hath imitated old <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> nay, far exceeded her, that she might shew to all she was her Antitype in these vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies.

            <p>X. There is one thing more in <hi>Chaldean Babylon</hi> in respect of her ruin, which I think not amiss here to add, <hi>viz.</hi> We find God by the Prophet speaks of her sudden destruction, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 8. <hi>Babylon is suddenly fallen,</hi> and that also she shall be destroyed by an Army out of the North Countreys, <hi>For lo I will raise and cause to come up against</hi> Babylon <hi>an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>

               <hi>of great Nations from the North Countrey, and they shall set themselves in array against her, from thence she shall be taken,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 9. From hence we may conclude as some, to judge that those people who shall be the Instruments in the Hand of God to destroy Mystery <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be the people in these Northern Countreys, as <hi>Brandenburgh, Sweed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Denmark,</hi> the United Provinces; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and it may be hoped the people of these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms, (some of which were always accounted as Horns of the Beasts) do already begin to hate her, and are preparing War against her, and that from hence her ruin shall suddenly come; and it may be a just and righteous thing with God thus to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter, since she hath such an Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable hatred of these Northern parts, because of that which she calls the Northern Heresie, and hath of late without all doubt, designed and secretly resolved utterly to destroy these Protestant Countries, and to make these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and States desolate, but God hath, and will put it into their Hearts to agree and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his will, <hi>i. e.

            <p>If the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> may be more fitly said to have Eyes like the Eyes of a Man, a Mouth speaking presumptuous things, and looks more stout than his fellows; to have made War with the Saints, to have prevailed against them, and worn them out, more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power that ever yet reigned; Then he is the little Horn, or vile person, under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>

The manner of his rise, (2.) His pretentions to power. (3.) In his progress to his height of dignity. (4.) In his management of the power he has usurped. (1.) He was small or little in his rise, but an ordinary Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, before he came to be a Temporal Prince. (2.) He pretends not to hold his Kingdom by Inheritance, or gift of the people, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings do, but by a special and divine Patent. (3.) In his progress to the height of his dignity, by leaving his fixed station,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66447:67"/>
as pastor of a Church, and by Deceit, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Violation of all Laws, mounts the Throne of imperial grandure. (4.) He rules by a supreme ecclesiastical power, as well as temporal; pretends to the Keys of Heaven, as well as the Sword of Justice on Earth, shewing himself to be the Beast that hath two Horns like a Lamb, spoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11.</p>
            <p>9. This little Horn hath so many marks upon him, that they are too numerous to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle distinctly after our usual methods; and therfore we shall put the remaining part into a General rank and conclude this subject. The Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath so many marks or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters upon him, that are too numerous to be handled distinctly in a little room; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall but touch upon them so far as they shew the Text made good, and form an Idea of truth in the minds of men.</p>
            <p>(1.) He must change times and laws, (2.) Continue a long a space of time. (3.) He is a vile person. (4.) Had not the honour he hath<note place="margin">Dan. 11. 21.</note> fairly given him, either by God or man, but gained it by flattery. (5.) Removed the proceeding by the Arms of a flood. (6.) He became strong by a small people. (7.)<note place="margin">ver. 22.</note> He shall have power over the

Shall do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Will, not accounting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tied to any Laws. (11.) He shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt himself above every God, and speak marvellous things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst<note place="margin">Dan. 11. 35.</note> the God of Gods. (12.) <hi>Shall not regard the God of his ancestors,</hi> (13.) Nor the desire of Wedlock. (14) <hi>Nor any God in</hi> a pious way. (15.) <hi>Shall give honour to them that have armed forces.</hi> (16.) Shall own a strange God with splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Ceremonies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 38.</p>
            <p>1. The Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath changed times and laws in two respects. 1. He hath set up and pluckt down Kings, which is called a <hi>Changing of times and seasons, Dan.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
            <p>2. He has made strange alterations of the Laws, Orders, and Institutions used in the Church, in respect of Officers, administrations of Sacraments, and celebration of days. 2. Hath continued above twelve hundred years. 3. He is as vile a person as any in the World, tolerates all kind of wickedness, by his Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, Pardons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. Had his exaltation neither by Inheritance, lawful conquest, nor
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66447:68"/>
rightful gift from rightful donators. 5. He had the help of <hi>Phocas,</hi> to kill the Emperor, <hi>Mauritius;</hi> and by the help of <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> enlarged his power. 6. Became strong by a small People, having only a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Church, and apostate Christians to assist him. 7. He hath power over <hi>Italy,</hi> which is reputed to be the Garden of <hi>Europe, &amp;c.</hi> 8. He accepted, entertained, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the people of any nation, that would turn wicked, and sacrifice all Prety and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to serve his Interest. 9. Under him the Saints have fallen, by flames, captivity, and spoil, many days. 10. He hath done according to his own will, and doth not look upon any Laws to be obligatory to him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God or men. 11. He (the Pope) hath exalted himself above every God, (that is, such that are so accounted amongst men, or Gods on Earth) by excommunicating, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, treading upon their Necks, and kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off their Crowns; by his Blasphemous Edicts and Injunctions he exalts himself above God himself, and his written Laws, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> 12. He doth not regard the God of his Ancestors, either the Idols of the Emperors, or the God of the good Bishops that went before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. He hath been remote from the desire of Women in a lawful way, nay, and frights his Clergy from it too, who are made uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66447:68"/>
of Spiritual promotion, and censured as heinous transgressors, if married. 14. He hath not regarded in a pious way any God; for tho' he doth name the true God often, and in words profess him, yet in works he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, and profane his holy name. 15. He gives honour to them who have armed Forces, and lends them assistance to carry on his black diabolical designs. 16. He hath own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a strange God; a mark compleatly made up in the Mass, which is adored with splendid Ceremonies. 17. The people of the Saints, 'tis said, shall take away his power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume and destroy it, to the end; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Lords people in their representatives, shall take away the Papal power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is it not done in part already here in <hi>England?</hi> upon all we may frame this Argument.</p>
            <p>If all these characters meet no where so clear and evident as upon the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> then the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is the little Horn, and vile person, set forth in the Book of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all the aforesaid characters meet no where so clear and evident, as upon the Pope of <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore the Pope is that little Horn.</p>

            </head>
            <p>FIrst, The Lord Jesus foretold that Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies should come in his name and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many, and that they should appear in Sheeps clothing, and under that Vizard hide their devouring Teeth; see his words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 15. <hi>Beware of false Prophets which come to you in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Wolves;</hi> that is, have a design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis most evident that the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their long Succession have thus (especially at first appeared) <hi>i e.</hi> in Sheeps clothing, covering their hellish designs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Christ, <hi>Vicar</hi> of Christ, an <hi>Apostolical Bishop,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>true Church, holy</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:66447:69"/>
               <hi>Church,</hi> and Christian Religion, but with an intent hereby to deceive, for all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Jesus Christ's being the truth, Christ hath been but as a Vizard to hide their wolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish nature and devouring teeth, for whilst they under the notion of Christianity hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they have carried on most pernicious and destructive designs, and that in these three respects following; <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) If there have appeared any Kings or Queens in the Christian World, that have been piously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, they have forth with endeavoured to pervert them by their Diabolical Doctrine, oft destroying them with their holy Poyson. (2.) If any Ministers, or Men of Parts and Piety have risen up to set forth Gods holy truth, and so bless the dark World with Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Light and Saving Doctrine, they have either choaked them with Gifts and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or affrighted them by dreadful fears, or by a ravenous thirsting after their Blood, and have most wickedly and treacherously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed their lives by cruel torments. (3.) If collective Bodies of pious Congregations of Saints or good Men, have sprung forth in the World, they have followed them like Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, and devouring <hi>Wolves,</hi> with Fire and Sword, fearful Massacres, Devastations, Murthers and Slaughters, till they have spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, torn in pieces, and devoured them:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66447:70"/>
Compleatly fulfilling the Prediction of Christ and that of the Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29, 30. <hi>For I know this, that after my departure, shall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Wolves enter in amongst you, not sparing the flock: Also of your own selves shall men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, speaking perverse things, to draw the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after them;</hi> who can this Prophecy so exactly agree to as the bloody Popes, who at first arose out of the Church, and acted the part of Wolves to purpose, as hath been hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>II. 'Tis also evident that all the marks of the Man of Sin spoken of by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Thes. 2. 3. do agree exactly to the Pope and the Romish Church.</p>
            <p>1. As first he was to rise after there came a falling away from the Primitive Faith; see his words,—<hi>That day shall not come except there come a falling away first, and that Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Sin be revealed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This cannot mean a particular falling away, (as our worthy Writers have shewed) but a general Apostacy of the Church, from the Holy and Apostolical Doctrine and Disciplin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Gospel, or such a falling away that should be obvious and visible to all; that should not fall out in a corner, or among<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a few private Christians, because 'tis laid dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as a general Rule, whereby the Saints in ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neral might know and judge of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66447:70"/>
of Antichrist, or Man of Sin. And now 'tis well known that there happened this fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away or general Apostacy three or four hundred years after Christ, out of which (and soon after which falling away) he Pope shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to be this Man of Sin, nor did he arise till that Apostacy happened in the World.</p>
            <p>2. Another mark he hath is this,—<hi>i. e. He shall exalt himself above all that is called God,</hi> &amp;c. viz. Magistrates and Rulers, as Kings and Emperors, for these are called Gods; <hi>I said, Ye are Gods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There are Gods many,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This mark meets directly in the Pope or Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> he exalts himself above all and every one of these who are called Gods. 1. He has assumed a Name above them. 2. greater power than they, in that he pretends to give them their Crowns, and not only so, but has power to excommunicate them, nay and depose and devest them of their Regal power as he pleases, and also in his disposing of Kingdoms, yea, making Emperors wait a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as a reason why the Pope would not come to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> lest if the Emperor should come thither, he should attempt to sit above him, so that by these two words in the Text, the Apostle describes him, both in his Enmity and Pride, Opposition and Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For observe first, he assumeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an higher power than those that are called Gods; theirs is Humane, his is Divine; theirs on the Bodies or Estates of Men, his over the Conscience; theirs to the living, his to Mens Souls after death.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Man of Sin,</hi> 'tis said by the Apostle, <hi>shall also exalt himself above all that's call'd God, or that is worshipped as God, sitting in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, shewing himself to be God,</hi> verse 4.</p>
            <p>Even so the Pope makes himself like God, and as God, as the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> of old said, <hi>I will be like the most High,</hi> Isa. 14. 14. And as Gods place of residence of old was said to be in the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so he as God sitteth in the Temple of God, not in the Material Temple, but in the Spiritual Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church of God which is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the Apostle speaks of him as a Bishop who had a Seat, and the Popish Writers give the Pope that, and such like Titles.</p>

               <hi>Dominus Deus noster Papa, idem est Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Dei &amp; Papa, tu es alter deus in terra.</hi>

Council Later. <hi>Sess.</hi> 4. Thou art another God on Earth. And as God he maketh Laws to bind the Conscience, and dispenses with Laws both Natural and Moral, and pardons sins as he pleases, past, present, and to come, can deliver Souls out of Purgatory, and translate them to Heaven; so that this Man of Sin is not to be looked for amongst the Turks, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans or Infidels, he sitteth in the Temple, the Church of God; not that it can be the true Church, where he sitteth and acteth, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Synagogue of Satan: But that which he calleth so, and which bears that name, and also was really so before the falling away, when he first got up. He also exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self above God, when he makes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to derive their Authority more from the Popes Canonizing than God himself, and without it no Man is bound to believe them, <hi>

                  </gap>it.</hi> 2. 23.

Besides he can forgive sins tho' the evil habits be not changed, what is all this then to make himself God, and to exalt himself above God? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The Man of Sin 'tis said could not get up until that which then, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Apostles days did let, was taken away. <hi>For the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>

            <p>This also shews the Pope to be <hi>the Man of Sin,</hi> for he rose to his glory and wicked gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur not till the sixth Head or Pagan power was gone or taken out of the way, for tho' the Mystery of iniquity did work gradually, and corruptions crept into the Church early, yet did he not appear till after the Christian Emperors had made way for him; hence he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Beast is to continue for the space of forty two Months, and the Witnesses are to Prophesie in Sackcloth for the space of 1260 days, which most Writers conclude to be one and the same term of time, and that by days is meant yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> all generally conclude; and the long continuance of the Beast and <hi>Papal power</hi> clearly shew, that to be the mind of Gods Spirit in those Mystical numbers Yet a late Worthy and Learned Writer hath said a great-deal to prove the forty two Months are to be reckoned by the Moon, and not by the Sun; and if so, then as he shews the time of the Witnesses wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sackcloth is thirty eight years longer than the forty two months, but yet are to terminate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he concluding the Witnesses put on their Sackcloth so many years before the beginning or Epoch of the forty two Months. See his Book inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The command of God to his people to come out if</hi> Babylon. Moreover he saith, the time, Epoch or beginning of the forty two Months must be fixed at the cessation of the seventh sort of Government, or Christian Emperors Reign, which, saith he, was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66447:73"/>
in the year 475. and the whole time of the Beasts Reign and Tyranny being but forty two Months, which by the Moon he accounts to be just 1222 years, the <hi>period</hi> of which will be, saith he, in 1697. And this we will say, he hath doubtless fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Epoch or beginning of the Beasts Kingdom more fairly than many Writers before him have done, because all along where the Reign of one Head or Government ended the other begun, as 'tis said, (you know) the King never dies. Take his own words, p. 25. </p>
            <q>
               <p>Thus far the matter is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined according to the Prophesie; <hi>i. e.</hi> Whenever the 7th King, asserted to be the Christian Emperors Government expir'd, <hi>viz.</hi> by a civil death, or the ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Imperial Name and Power, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the eighth King according to the Prophesie must succeed, and bear up the <hi>Roman</hi> City in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and whoever hath born up that City in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, since that time, must be according to Prophesie that eighth King, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Beast. Now I appeal to all the World what year that was when the Western Imperial Name fell, and it is known in all History to be the year of our Lord 475.</p>
               <p>— For in the wonderful disposes of God, no one hath claim'd a Title of Empire from that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty since that year, but the Pope.</p>
            </q>
            <p> I do commend the ingenious Reader to the Book it self.</p>
            <p>Now if this be true or can be granted we are very near the final ruin of the Papistry, nay, and from divers other authors, most or all that I have met with, agree it will be in this very age; <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> a wise and renowned French Authour, <hi>in his book intituled the accomplishment of the Prophecy,</hi> saith, from the year 1689.

feet, as I am strongly inclined to believe they are; and am more and more confirmed in my notion in that respect, and that so as they shall never more be flung upon their backs, then I may confidently affirm that it will not be long ere <hi>they shall hear a great voice from Heaven, saying unto them, Come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> And accordingly <hi>they shall ascend up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Cloud, their Enemies beholding them,</hi> in which ascent of theirs, they must be conformable to the resurrection and ascention of Christ himself.</p>
            <p>But whereas it is objected that if the witnesses are risen indeed, so as to be on their feet, in pursuance of that sacred prediction, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. there must needs have been some more than ordinary appearance, of the presence of God in the midst of his people, or at the least in a greater degree thereof than as yet we see.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I say no, it doth not therefore follow that it must be so: nor indeed it cann't rationally be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected till the time comes of their ascention, for this is an established rule with me, that there must and will be a signal proportion or resemblance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Death, Resurrection and Ascention of Christs witnesses, and that of Christ himself. Now as to what concerneth the resurrection of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himself in his own person, thus we are told, that he shewed himself alive after his passion by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny infallible proofs, being seen of his Disciples for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days, and speaking to them of the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Kingdom of God; yet for ought as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us, he appeared unto them in all that time, but as he did before, there was no discovery of any signal Majesty, or visible glory, upon him, more than they had seen upon him before his Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; neither indeed was the Spirit come down upon them. And the reason is expresly rendred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Jesus was not yet glorified, neither could
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66447:77"/>
the glorification of Christ be expected till his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the effusion of the Spirit till then—Wherefore, tho' it is true there is as yet no appear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ance of any signal glory upon Gods people, nor a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny considerable measure of the Holy Spirit th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> there was before, yet for as much as it is highly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to conceive that there must be, and will be as clear resemblance or proportion (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) betwixt what passed at the Resurrection of Christ and his Ascention, <hi>and that of the Witnesses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap> just ground to expect that abundant effusion of the Spirit which God hath promised (and we have been a waiting for) till we see the Witnesses upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:66447:81"/>First, That about that time (as the Doctor inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates) the Beast that rose out of the <hi>Bottomless Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, viz.</hi> the <hi>Papal power,</hi> would recover strength again in this Nation or that tenth part of the City called also a Street where the Witnesses should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ain and lie dead.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Make War against them with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable power, craft and policy that Hell could afford, endeavouring utterly to root out Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witnesses or Protestant Interest; now have not we seen these things which the Dr. hath upon this account writ? is it not evident that things in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have for many years last past been carryed on by the Papal Power, not only in the late Kings reign, but also before? have not we seen a strange Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual War managed by Popish councils, Priests and Jesuits, and had they not very far prevailed? Yea so far, as to the killing of Gods Witnesses, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Dr. saith is meant thereby) how much different hath the late times of trouble been to former days? What a base compliance with the Antichristian party have we seen? What a strange dispiriting of godly people, nay, and Ministers too? Never sure such a civil death in every respect, hath been seen nor known before this hour.</p>
            <p>Now as to the witnesses standing on their Fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, saith the Dr. <hi>p.</hi> 170. <q>First, As men erect, and taking Heart, their cause being just, tho' before condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Secondly, As ready to defend it, and as men able and resolved now to confront their Enemies, which strikes a mighty dread into their guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; <hi>great fear fell upon them that saw them,</hi> their Hearts begin to sink and die, at the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses first beginning to live,</q> and have not we seen somewhat much like this? what a strange Spirit do we see now, in all sorts of Protestants against the Whore or Antichristian party, both here and in <hi>Scotland</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:66447:81"/>
also? More especially, as touching the Ascention of the Witnesses, they shall hear a voice, <hi>Come up hither,</hi> it certainly signifies some more glorious Church State, and restoration of the Primitive Purity, that shall attend the Saints and Church of God, and when that comes to pass, may be such a measure of the spirit may be given, as to unite all Faithful and Godly Protestants into one Body and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and then <hi>the Spouse</hi> or Church of God <hi>will come forth out of the Wilderness, as terrible as an Army with banners, Cant.</hi> 6. 4.</p>

               </gap>e and ruin of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ and Mystery <hi>Babylon;</hi> together with the Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Resurrection and Ascention of the two Witnesses, which is left to you to receive or reject according to your own conceptions and understandings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66447:82"/>
to the Light and Knowledge God hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you of these great Mysteries;—There is one thing more I shall speak to, and a little further open, which is a matter of great Importance to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, in order to the finding out the final over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Papal Power and ruin of Antichrist, which is that of the seven Vials, and last Plagues spoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. It seems not a little strange to me, to see how exceedingly the learned and most renowned Expositors, differ about the time of the pouring out of the Vials, some concluding they are all already poured forth, others that there are only the first three poured out, and some others affirm there is not one of them as yet poured forth, but do believe they shall all be poured out under the seventh Trumpet, which contains the third wo, and will effect the utter overthrow of the Beasts Kingdom, and the setting up the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, we shall therefore give you some brief hints of what most of our late Interpreters have said, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of this matter; &amp; in order to the doing of this, it is not amiss to note unto you, the three several periods spoken of in the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which seems to me to be a Key to open most of those deep Mysteries contained in that wonderful Prophecy.</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Seven Seals.</hi> Second, The <hi>Seven Trumpets.</hi> The Third, The <hi>Seven Vials</hi> or seven last <hi>Plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Expositors generally all agree that the six first Seals contained those Judgments of God, execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Pagan Emperours,</hi> which fell out and was wholly accomplished in the space of three hundred, or three hundred and ten years or thereabouts after Christ, and so (as some conceive) brought in the first Wo.</p>
            <p>The seventh Seal (according to the late famous <hi>Peter Jurieu,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Writer, and some others) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66447:82"/>
or brought in the Seven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pet. Jurieu</hi> accom. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe. <hi>p.</hi> 37.</note> and brings the events e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the last Judgments, the first Trumpet not being sounded until the seventh Seal was opened, so that these Seven Seals, as he observes, <q>are like <hi>six Branches,</hi> that shoot forth from the Body of a Tree, with a seventh great Branch, which it self became a great Arm, and shoots forth into seven other <hi>Branches</hi> (which are the <hi>seven Trumpets</hi>).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The six first <hi>Trumpets</hi> contain the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon the World under the <hi>Arian Apostate</hi> Persecuters, and the bringing in the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi> state, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Beast or man of Sin, and <hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> with the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Monarchy, together with the death or slaying of the Witnesses of Christ, which lasteth for a long series of time, at least as some conceive 1300 and odd years and compleats the second Wo.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The seventh Trumpet, some wise and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding men of late do conclude, produces the seven Vials and seven last plagues, which they do not think any of them as yet are poured forth, but will gradually effect the utter overthrow of the <hi>Papal Church</hi> containing the intire Judgments or wrath of God upon the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the seven <hi>last Plagues,</hi> and so let in the Third Wo. Upon the Antichristian World, and brings in <hi>the glory of the latter day or Kingdom of Christ;</hi> if this may be admitted, we may very well say that the <hi>Seven Seals</hi> contained in them the whole events of things from the time that St. <hi>John</hi> received his Revelation to the end of all Gods Mysteries there spoken of; but then you must observe the rule we have noted, and this seems to me the clearest and best exposition, I can arrive to the knowledge of, who have laboured, according to that light and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66447:83"/>
God hath given me, to find out the Mysteries contained in this Book, for near 30 years last past, though I dare not be positive that none of the Vials are yet poured out knowing what has been said by our able expositers to the contrary; some of which I shall here mention, and their arguments upon which they build their conceptions; amongst those that say the three first Vials are poured forth, are these following.</p>
            <p>First, Mr. <hi>Joseph Mede,</hi> Dr. <hi>More, Du Moulin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Durham, De Launay,</hi> Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and many others; the first Vial, they say, was poured forth by the faithful Ministers of Christ, at the first reformation before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, and that <hi>grievous sore that fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Antichristian state,</hi> was the discovery of the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Idolatry of the <hi>Romish Clergy;</hi> together with that hatred of them, for their odious &amp; impure lives.</p>
            <p>The Second Vial some of them affirm, was poured forth by the Preaching of <hi>Luther,</hi> and those worthy Witnesses of Christ in his days.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third Vial</hi> was poured forth, according to their Judgments, by other worthy Ministers signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the third Angel, who rose up in the Church after <hi>Luthers</hi> time, who in some things had more light; and partly also by laws made against Popery in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, &amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and Dr. <hi>More</hi> seem to agree in this, as likewise do our late Annotators, read them on <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Vial, they, as well as Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> seem to hint we are under, which is said to be poured forth upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> which the Dr. concludes <hi>p.</hi> 99. to mean either the <hi>Emperor, or King of Spain,</hi> or both, they being of the same house of <hi>Austria,</hi> Mr. <hi>Parkins</hi> long before hinted that by the <hi>Sun,</hi> did mean some <hi>Protestant Prince</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> who should have some of this <hi>Vial</hi> poured forth upon him by the Popish party, but being provoked thereby after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66447:83"/>
he should rise again, and like the <hi>Sun scorch</hi> them with his heat, but the Dr. rather inclines to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and Dr. <hi>More.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, our late <hi>French</hi> Author <hi>Peter Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieu,</hi> positively affirms that six of the <hi>Vials</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready poured forth, and that we are under the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,</hi> which will effect the final ruin of the <hi>Papistry</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> (if I mistake him not) one reason why he doth thus believe, is because the <hi>Vials</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>seven periods of time,</hi> which ought to be distinguisht one from another, 2 part <hi>p.</hi> 68, 69. as the <hi>seven Seals</hi> and <hi>seven Trumpets</hi> did signify, <hi>seven periods,</hi> which succeeded one another; and he concludes that the periods described by every Vial, are each of them more than one age, so that, saith he, if there is but two or three of them yet to be poured out, we shall have four or five hundred years to come, before An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists Kingdom comes to an end, which I do not find him to give any convincing demonstration to make appear, tho' I cannot but say he seems to be a person of good understanding in many respects, touching these great Mysteries, contained in the Book of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> moreover he distinguishes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Vials and Plagues, <hi>viz.</hi> saying the Vial signifies the Period of time, the Plague signifying the Judgment of God, which falls out during the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,</hi> which if it be granted, yet why must every Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod contain a 100 years, or at least (as he intimates) 50 years, or<note place="margin">See his preface, advice to all Christians.</note> 70? the first Plague of the 7. he fixes to the 10 Century, in respect of the dismal corruption of the Popedom in that age, <hi>p.</hi> 79. the first Vial was pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, saith he, upon the Earth, <hi>i. e.</hi> 
               <q>upon the whole Globe, for Earth contains both dry and moist; the corruption of manners was spread over the Head and the Members, over the whole Papal seat, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66447:84"/>
all its subjects, but, saith he, the Second Vial is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out only upon the Waters, the Sea and Rivers, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the people of the Antichristian Empire, or upon the different Nations, Tribes and Languages,—<hi>the Waters of the Sea were turned into Blood, and every living Soul died.</hi> What more native and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly representation, saith he, could have been made of the rage of the <hi>Croisades?</hi> In all Languages and in all sorts of stile, a Sea of Blood, Rivers of Blood, streams of Blood, signify a very great slaughter. Now the proper character of the <hi>Croisades</hi> is slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Murther, which falls not upon the head of the Antichristian Empire, but upon the people, all was turned into Blood. Never was there such a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious effusion of Blood in the Sea, <hi>i. e.</hi> among the peoples, in the first <hi>Croisade,</hi> there died more than 2 Millions of men in 3 or 4 years; 'tis evident that God did lead these wretched creatures as it were to the shambles, that they should find the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their crimes: he took so great a quantity of Blood, that he might cure the Ulcers of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> for that he might purge it of that vast rabble, he permitted the Devil to inspire them, either with such sottish superstition, or an extravagant ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they must go and deliver the Holy-land, or go and conquer Kingdoms in the East, this Plague lighted only on the Sea, not at all on the dry land, upon the subjects of the <hi>Popedom,</hi> not at all upon the Popes. On the contrary, the Popes Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that evasion to greaten their power, to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whole Countreys, to make Generals of Armies, to act as soveraign Monarchs, and to lay a heavyer yoke upon Kings, whom they ordered to march, and sent them as their slaves into the East, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their absence plundered their Kingdoms.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>We must not, saith he, imagine that all the Plagues laid down by St. <hi>John,</hi> must tend to the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66447:84"/>
ruin of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to the diminution of its power; for some are to light upon the head of that Empire, to crush it, others upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to punish them, because they worship the Beast, the Plague of Blood and Slaughter is for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>This Plague of <hi>Croisades,</hi> saith he, is divided into two Plagues, because of its long duration, for it lasted 200 years, from the end of the eleventh age, until the end of the thirteenth, this he Judges the time of the 2d. Vial and Plague.</p>
               <p>The third Vial or Plague, fell upon the Rivers or lesser Waters, which he fixes upon some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar nations, as of <hi>France</hi> under the conduct of St. <hi>Lewis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Vial poured out on the Sun, 'tis known and confessed saith he, of all who know any thing of Prophecies, Dreams and Visions, that the Heavens, the Sun, the Constellations, and the Stars, are Emblems of Dignity and Grandeur on Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Sun does always signify the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, the Stars inferiors Magistrates, and so by the Sun under the 6th Seal, 'tis always understood the fall of the Pagan Empire; that the Antichristian Kingdom is treated of here saith he, is generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to: therefore it cannot be doubted that the Sun is the Soveraign of this Kingdom.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And he fixes upon the increase of Antichrists au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power, in the thirteenth and fourteenth Centuries to be meant hereby, when the Sun by his excessive &amp; scorching heat, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Pope by his usurpt authority tyrannized over Kings and Emperors, <hi>p.</hi> 89. deposing, and taking away their Crowns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth Vial and Plague poured on the feat of the Beast, he affirms with other Writers to mean the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> and when was it that this Vial of Gods wrath fell upon the seat of the Beast, <hi>i. e. Rome?</hi> it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66447:85"/>
was, saith he, when <hi>Rome</hi> lost its Sun (which is spoken of in the foregoing Plague) <hi>i. e.</hi> the Pope, the Papal Court, that like a Gulf or Whirl-pool, drew to it all the riches of the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe.</hi> In the year 1305. <hi>Clement</hi> the V. left <hi>Rome</hi> to go to <hi>Avignon,</hi> the City that was Mistress of the World then became desolate,—when its Masters kept their seat at <hi>Avignon, p.</hi> 94.</p>
            <p>The sixth Vial and Plague he affirms are the Turks who pass over the <hi>Bosphorus</hi> and invade the Greek and Latin Empires; at this I can't a little wonder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause most expositors conclude, and I think with good reason, that the rise and increase of the Turkish Monarchy began under the sixth Trumpet, and not only so, but because 'tis said the <hi>Angel poured forth his Vial upon the great River</hi> Euphrates, <hi>and</hi> (mark) <hi>the Water thereof was dryed up, &amp;c.</hi> which seems to intimate the decay and wasting of the Turkish pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and not the increase of it, but he would have us understand the Kings of the East, to mean the Turks, and not <hi>Euphrates, p.</hi> 200, 201. the time that this Vial was a pouring forth, he says, was about 125 or 130 years, <hi>viz.</hi> from 1390. until 1526. by this he must believe the Battel of <hi>Arma-geddon</hi> is long since past, which he runs into a mystery by shewing that <hi>Arma-geddon</hi> signifies a cutting off by a Curse or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which he applys to the Orders, Laws and false Oracles of the Popedom and the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian head,—there is, saith he, 'tis known, a Curse and a <hi>Arma-geddon</hi> at the end of every Canon. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial and Plague he affirms was by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Luther,</hi> and other reformers by which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church was divided into three parts, <hi>Papists, Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Reformed,</hi> I suppose he means the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists;</hi> 
               <q>the Voices, and Thunders, and Lightnings, that are said to be under the seventh Vial, mean, he says, the Voices of Preachers, who labour'd in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66447:85"/>
the reforming the Church, <hi>page</hi> 217.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The great City he affirms is the Antichristian Kingdom, and this City under the pouring forth of the seventh Vial, is said to be divided into three parts, this, he says, is exactly come to pass, <hi>i. e.</hi> one part remained with Antichrist, one part did sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from him, under the name of the <hi>Ausburge</hi> confession A third part did separate under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of those who are barely stiled the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Sweden, Denmark,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> make the second part, <hi>England,</hi> and the united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, the reformed part of <hi>France,</hi> and part of <hi>Germany,</hi> make the third part; these, saith he are the three grand parts, that divide the western Church which is the great City.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let this be attentively minded, saith he, for I affirm that this passage does as it were speak with a Tongue, &amp; is able alone to convince, that our Systeme of the seven Plagues is most undoubted truth; this division of the great City into three parts, so clearly points out the three communions of the Latin Church, that to deny it can proceed only from unreasonable passion, and opinionativeness. And if we have hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the truth in this point, we have done so in all; for if this character of the seventh Plague is true, and is already accomplisht, all other Plagues are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so accomplisht; and if they are accomplished, I do boldly affirm they cannot be applied to any other effects than those to which we have applied them.</p>
            <p>He further shews that <hi>England</hi> cannot make a fourth part, because in doctrine she agrees with other reformed communions, in which she differs from the <hi>Lutherans,—p.</hi> 220. who refuse such commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Thus (saith he) in truth there are but three grand parts, into which the Latin Church is divided, <hi>i. e. Papists, Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists</hi>—and this division is not her utter ruin, but after
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:66447:86"/>
she is thus divided, God will prepare to give her the last cup of his wrath which signifies, that the division of the Latin Church into three parts must continue until the compleat ruin of Popery.</p>

We need not longer wait for the accomplishment, either of all the 7 Plagues (as some of our interpreters say) or of some of the 7 Plagues as others say—<hi>it is done,</hi> all is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht, we are at the end of the seventh period.</p>
               <p>First, That in the whole explication of this 16th. chapter, there is not the least forced application; the Emblems which the Prophet makes use, do exactly resemble the events set down in Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Second, that in the Application of these seven Plagues unto the events, every thing does hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, no part of this <hi>System</hi> contradicts another; this being supposed, I do intreat them to consider, if chance may hit right in some points, but never does so in all, I say again, that we are at the end of the seventh period; for it ought to be well observed, that there is not one Vial, which is distinct and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from others, lasted 200 years,—this hath already lasted 170 years, it cannot last much longer, 'tis true, the Papal authority whose beams so scorched men under the fourth Vial, lasted above 200 years, but this was because it was inlayed or jointed in those that preceded, and those that followed. And its particular strict period must be

reckon'd to be only 108 years, which begun at the year 1270, when the <hi>Croisades</hi> ended, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until the <hi>grand Schism,</hi> which happened in the year 1378. for then began the diminishing of the <hi>Papal Authority,</hi> and the darkning of the Kingdom of the Beast.</p>
               <p>The <hi>seventh Vial</hi> hath lasted already longer than any of the rest, and 'tis probable, that it must last about 200 years, which none of the others hath done, but we shall see the reason of this, when we shew that this seventh Period, is it self di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three Periods, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Harvest, the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and the time that is betwixt the Harvest and the Vintage, the Harvest is already past, the time betwixt is almost expired, and we are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Vintage,—<hi>p.</hi> 223, 224.</p>
            </q>
            <p> He then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to explain what he understands by Harvest and Vintage; which the ingenious reader may guess at, I thought good to cite thus much of this Author for their sakes, who have not his book, it being grown scarce, and also because he is so much cryed up; and lastly because, what he speaks concerning the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als seems new, nor shall I passover this mans sentiments about the Vials, without some modest reflections, tho' he seems to write with great confidence, in which he differs from most worthy men before him.—</p>
            <p>1. It may be doubted whether he is in the right or no, in my Judgment, about the 7 Vials, because it appears to me very clear, that the Angels that are said to pour them out, are brought forth under the seventh Trumpet, to which I find some worthy men agree; which if this be granted, he is mistaken.</p>
            <p>2. Because the Angels that pour them forth, are said to come out of the Temple, clothed in Pure and White Linen, and have their Breasts girded with Golden Girdles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 6. which signifies doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a more Perfect and Pure State of the Church
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66447:87"/>
than was in any of those centurys he mentioneth, when divers of those Vials, he says, were poured cut, for till near the time of the coming forth of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet, the Saints and People of God are called Witnesses clothed in Sack-cloth, mourning as it were for the loss of the visibility, and glory of the Gospel Church state, according to the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical constitution; and are represented as a few or small number of scattered Christians, but under the latter part of the 6. Trumpet, <hi>the Tabernacle of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in Heaven was opened, Rev.</hi> 15. 4. signifying (as I conceive) the restoration of the Church to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer glory and purity in a great measure, and that the Witnesses had put off their Sack-cloth, being glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously and differently clothed, which will not be perfected till the ascention of the Witnesses which will be about the beginning of the seventh Trumpet, for the text says, when that begins to be sounded <hi>the Kingdoms of this World become the Kingdom of our Lord and his Christ, Rev.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
            <p>3. It should seem strange that all the Vials, (that contain in them the whole of the seven last Plagues to the utter overthrow of the Beasts Kingdom,) should be already poured out (save the remaining part of the seventh) and yet so little be done com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to the ruin of the Whore or Papistry, or that the 6. first Vials should be so long a time a pouring forth, and so little effected for the ruin of Antichrists Kingdom, and so much should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be done in so short a time (as this French Writer says) by the remaining part of the seventh.</p>
            <p>4. And why he should suppose if 2 or 3 of the Vials should not be yet poured out, that the Whore and Beasts Kingdom, must continue still at least 200 years, I know not, for if we should conclude with some worthy men, that none of the Vials should be poured forth to this day, yet why may not the ruin
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66447:87"/>
of the Papal Power, or end of the Beasts Kingdom be near, for tho' it be granted they may have their distinct Periods, yet they may be very short, since God positively intimates his Judgments, for the ruin and downfal of <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be swift and on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and as it were in one hour, which certainly signifies but a very short time; besides, he strangely confounds and mixeth the Vials with some of the Trumpets which I can't see any ground to believe, considering the method God uses in this Book.—Moreover at the resurrection or at the ascention of the Witnesses, which finishes the second Wo, &amp; brings the period of the 6. Trumpet, then the tenth part of the City falls &amp; this is all of the fall and ruin of the great Whore or great City, we read of, till the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet begins' to sound. And to conclude with this, I shall<note place="margin">Pools Annot on <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15.</note> say with what our late Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors intimate on <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. it seems that the seven Seals, the seven Trumpets, and the seven Vials, are all mentioned, in the same form of Speech, and therefore the seven Vials are not to be divided, some to one Trumpet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some to another.</p>
            <p>2. Because the seventh Trumpet, &amp; 7 Vials are one &amp; the same thing, nothing being revealed under the seven Vials, which doth not belong to the seventh Trumpet; they agree in their titles of Woes, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Revelations, in their objects, both the one &amp; in the other, declaring the ruin of Antichrist; both of them are mentioned as the last Plagues to come upon the World before the last day.</p>
            <p>3. All the Vials are of the same nature, declaring but the Judgments by which God setting up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jesus Christ would ruin Antichrist, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the degrees.</p>
            <p>4. The seventh Trumpet cannot declare the ruin of Antichrist unless the seven Vials be poured out
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:66447:88"/>
under it, for they shew the means by which he must be destroyed; and so bring in the third Wo.</p>
            <p>5. The seventh Trumpet sounded immediately upon the Slaying and Resurrection of the Witnesses, and contemporizeth with the whole course of their renewed liberty, and therefore the period by it must be before the fall of the Antichristian Kingdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the sixth Vial.</p>
            <p>6. The seventh Trumpet sounded immediately after the expiration of the 1260 days, before the end of which, I see no ground to conclude any of the 7 Vials were to be poured out.</p>
            <p>Now those who think that divers of the Vials were poured out (as he observes) or shall be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out before the sounding of the seventh Trumpet say,</p>
            <p>That the Beasts Kingdom beginning to fall under the sixth Trumpet, several of the Vials, declaring the degrees of his falling must belong to that; in answer to which we say, it appeareth by all we have in this <hi>chap. Rev.</hi> 11. 15. that <hi>Antichrists Kingdom</hi> was in a great measure weakned under the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, particularly from <hi>v.</hi> 11. to 13. And tho this we grant, yet they are but some previous preparations to the final ruin of Antichrist, during the period of the sixth Trumpet; but the seven Vials signify the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progress and perfection of his ruin, which falls under the seventh Trumpet; this being premised we proceed with the Text; It is, saith he, doubted whether these words, <hi>are become the Kingdom of the Lord and his Christ, v.</hi> 15 be to be understood as being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally so, or now beginning so to be; those who make the sense that they now actually were so, must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the time to be the last days, or near the coming of Christ,—but I rather take the words thus, <hi>i. e.</hi> are beginning to become the Kingdom of our Lord, or shall shortly be so; and if none of the seven
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:66447:88"/>
Vials are yet poured out, but do all belong to the seventh Trumpet, then when that begins to sound, <hi>the little Stone cut out of the Mountain without hands,</hi> spoken of by <hi>Daniel, shall begin to smite the Image up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its Feet,</hi> and Antichrist from that time shall reign no more, but gradually fall and be broken to pieces, and the Lords people take the Kingdom, and bear the only rule in the Earth but the beginning of this glorious Kingdom state will be small, and hardly discerned, as it is signified by the little Stone, and by other passages and places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Just as I had writ this, I met with a book that Mr. <hi>Canne</hi> had wrote some years ago, in which he gives very great arguments to prove none of the Vials are as yet poured out, notwithstanding what our French Author has with much confidence asserted; some of the reasons Mr. <hi>Canne</hi> gives to prove that none of the Vials are as yet poured out, I shall give you, being sorry I saw not the Book sooner, and that I am li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to a number of Sheets, else you should have had more of him; his first reason is taken from what Mr. <hi>Tilling hast</hi> and divers other learned men affirm concerning <hi>Rev. 14. 1. viz.</hi> that they are Gentile Saints, who stand upon <hi>Mount Sion with the Lamb,</hi> and is to come to pass after the rising of Witnesses, <q>this being so saith he, (and that is indeed so, he further saith he could give many reasons) then there is little reason to carry the beginning of the seven Vials any higher, for tho' it be the opinion of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and godly men, that some of the Vials are pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, yet so that they hold likewise that the 14440 have already stood with the Lamb on Mount Sion, and there is reason and weight in it, that where we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>gin the time of the 14440. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there we also take the beginning of the Vials. And the order of the matter seems to make this clear; the Holy Ghost having <hi>chap.</hi> 14. spoken of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66447:89"/>
Harvest and Vintage, that is, what Sore Plagues the Lord brings (first and last) upon <hi>Babylon</hi> and the followers of the Beast, comes presently in <hi>ch.</hi> 15, and 16. to shew how and by what means, <hi>the Earth shall be Reaped, and the Clusters gathered, and cast into the great Wine-Press of Gods wrath,</hi> namely, <hi>seven Angels shall come out of the Temple, having the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven last Plagues.</hi>—So then, to take the 14440. to be after the Witnesses are risen, and to begin the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Vials before they are risen, in my understanding, is very improper to the scope and drift of the Prophesy, and crosseth that excellent order which the Spirit seems to observe.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>2. I do not conceive how the pouring out of the Plagues, and Vials full of divine wrath in any good sense, and according to Scripture use, may be applyed to, and understood of the Preaching of the glad tidings of the Gospel; truly I think, that the publishing of the sweet and most precious Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saving truths of Jesus, all the time of the Beasts reign, even 42 months or 1260 years, is in another way, and by other words expressed, and not by the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als full of wrath;</hi> see <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 9, 10, 11. and therefore by the <hi>Seven last Plagues filled up with the wrath of God, Rev.</hi> 15. 1. I understand real and proper Plagues, and not the preaching of the Gospel, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Grosthead, Wickliff, Luther, Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. but rather such temporal Plagues as shall be poured out upon wicked men for despising and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the truth; <hi>In her was found the Blood of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Saints, Rev.</hi> 18. 24. It is not said that the effects of the Vials shall be wrath, or turn to wrath, <hi>for in the it is filled up the wrath of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Suppose it be granted there is a Vial of wrath poured out (which to me sounds harshly) and that <hi>Wickliff, Huss, Jeremy, Luther,</hi> &amp;c. were the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the question then is, who before them pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66447:89"/>
out their Vials upon the Earth; for it is said these seven Angels <hi>had the</hi> 7 <hi>last Plagues,</hi> signifying, that there were Plagues before, altho for time, persons, matter, and manner of proceeding, and other circumstances, unlike.</p>
               <p>4. I have (saith he) not seen any reason why so much time is allowed between the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Vials: Some allow 100 years, others 200, and some more, namely, from the pouring out of the first Vial, to the beginning of the second, and to all the rest not half the time.</p>
               <p>If those Vials and last Plagues have an allusion to the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (as it is generally held) then it is probable, when there is once a beginning, they will suddenly all be poured out. Some have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from History in <hi>Exodus,</hi> that within the space of 30 days the ten Plagues fell upon the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> now if (in the Antitype) we reckon a day for a year (as it is often in Prophetical Types) then the seven last Plagues will be finished in thirty years when begun; neither is it to be doubted, but a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 28. when those Vials begin to be poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, wherefore is <hi>Babylon</hi>'s fall set forth under the sign of <hi>a great Milstone cast into the Sea by a mighty Angel,</hi> not only to denote her irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable desolation, but also what speedy and quick dispatch the Lord will make, when he calls his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels out of the Temple, <hi>therefore shall her Plagues come upon her in one day,</hi> Rev. 18. 8. <hi>in one hour, v.</hi> 10, 17, 19. <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He further confirms this reason and answers Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which I have not room to insert.</p>
            <p>
               <q>5. I cannot conceive, saith he how any of those Persons to whom the first, second and third Angels are ordinarily applied, do fairly or fitly parallel and agree with what the Scriptures hold forth; certain it is, none of the Angels came out of the Temple, till John <hi>saw as it were a Sea of Glass min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Fire, and them that had gotten the Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Beast, and over his Image, and over his Mark, and over the number of his Name, standing on the Sea of Glass, having the Harps of God; and they sing the Song of</hi> Moses <hi>the Servant of God, and the Song of the Lamb, Rev.</hi> 15. 1, 2. All this well agrees with the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 14440. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1, 2. But to carry these things to <hi>Grostead, Armachan, Wickliff, Luther,</hi> &amp;c. if need were, I could shew by many reasons of the improbability of it; for tho' many of Gods people formerly received not the <hi>Mark of the Beast,</hi> nor <hi>his Name,</hi> yet to say any of them during the 42 Months got the Victory over the Beast, or over his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and number of his Name, I cannot assent unto, neither do I think their Opinion is well bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed who hold this Victory over the Beast, and <hi>singing the Song of</hi> Moses, and the <hi>Song of the Lamb</hi> to be before the <hi>rising of the Witnesses,</hi> which is the time of their prophesying in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> and whilst the woman is in the wilderness.</q>—'Tis strange indeed to think the witnesses wearing Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, or in a mourning condition, can be said to <hi>sing the Song of</hi> Moses, as having got Victory over their Enemies, and yet overcome by their Enemies for the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> 'tis well known to be that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>6. That none of the seven last Plagues or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are yet poured out, nor will be till after <hi>the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Witnesses,</hi> (does appear) for this reason, <hi>viz.</hi> because none of the seven Angels come forth with their <hi>Golden Vials,</hi> until <hi>the Tabernacle of the Testimony is opened in Heaven,</hi> Rev. 15. 5. but that part of the Tabernacle of the Testimony is to be shut all the time of the Witnesses prophesying in Sackcloth may be gathered from <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1. with <hi>v.</hi> 19. Hence this Argument might be framed, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Angel is to come forth with his Golden Vial, till the Tabernacle of the Testimony in Heaven is opened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Tabernacle of the Testimony is not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened till after the rising of the Witnesses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore no Angel with his Golden Vial is come forth till after the rising of the Witnesses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proof of this Argument are the Scriptures before, <hi>viz. Rev.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 19. Now if any do think that the four last Angels shall come forth from the Temple opened in Heaven, and not the first three such an Opinion is against the Text expresly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> saith <hi>the seven Angels come out of the Temple,</hi> verse 6. Neither do I know any ground they have, who think that the Angels pouring out the four last Vials shall have more

Light, Zeal, Faith, Holiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than the former three had—but certainly there is a vast difference between the state of the Church now, and that when they say the first Vial was poured out, nay, and the second or third too, and none can doubt but the opening of the Tabernacle of the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Heaven points to some greater Church glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that shall be then, or a different state of the Church than ever was before under the Beasts reign.</p>
               <p>7. Neither do I (saith he) think, that the effects of any of the Vials (which some suppose are pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out) make good what is said, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>For thy Judgments are made manifest,</hi> which holds forth to me much more than what followed the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Grostead, Wickliff, Huss, Luther, Melancthon, &amp;c.</hi> or the <hi>Switzers Wars,</hi> or of that of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for Gods Judgments, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding what hath been yet done, remain still more dark, doubtful and disputable, especially to the World, than shall be under the effects of the Vials.</p>
            </q>
            <p>For the <hi>followers of the Beast,</hi> as <hi>the</hi> Egyptians <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Plagues,</hi> tho' they are hardened and <hi>repent not, but blaspheme the God of Heaven, not giving glory to him,</hi> shall notwithstanding see the hand of God lifted up, <hi>and be ashamed for their envy at his people,</hi> Isa. 26. 11. So manifest at that time shall his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be, but hitherto no such things have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, notwithstanding all the Judgments of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, so dark and hidden, not manifested, have the actings of God been to his Enemies, nay, and not clear or plainly manifested to his own people neither, as it appears by their different apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and opinions about what hath been past, until these very days.</p>

               <q>The truth is, if we take not heed to distinguish between the <hi>Sack-cloth time of Mourning Saints,</hi> and the time in which <hi>they are clothed with White Linnen,</hi> &amp; having <hi>Golden Girdles</hi> that is, raised out of the dust <hi>and set with Princes, even with the Princes of his people, Psal.</hi> 113. 7, 8. but confound these times, which
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:66447:92"/>
ought to be kept distinct and apart, we shall want that excellent light to bring things to their proper places.</q> I would to God our <hi>French-man</hi> and others would consider this; for I find those that affirm <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mclancton, &amp;c.</hi> to be one or more of those Angels, that poured out one or two of the Vials, do hold that the Witnesses had put off their Sack-cloth, the time of the 1260 days being expired, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Jurieu</hi> denies this with many others, and yet says all the seven Angels have already come and poured out their Vials, and yet in their Sack cloth state; but I can see no reason to believe he speaks right.</p>
            <p>9. (Saith Mr. <hi>Canne</hi>) If what is spoken, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 21. <hi>of the mighty Angels taking up a great Milstone, and casting it into the Sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great City</hi> Babylon <hi>be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all,</hi> belongs to the Vials (as it seems most evident) then what is attributed to <hi>Grostead, Wickliff, Luther. &amp;c.</hi> is far from the works of the Angels, which shall pour forth the 7 last Plagues; <hi>Thus shall</hi> Babylon <hi>be thrown drown, &amp;c.</hi> A Milstone rises no more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus, that is, when any of the 7 Angels pour out their Vials, the work shall prosper in their hands, and not be hindered nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded by any power whatsoever. But hither by whatsoever hath been done us, yet upon <hi>Babylon</hi> she hath not so fallen,—but one while she seems to sink, and then rises again, many Judgments have been poured out upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> no doubt of that, nay, and some too soon after she got up, but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less none of the seven last Judgments hath she felt to this day, every Vial shall effectually do its work, where, or on whom it is poured out, it being full of the divine wrath of God.</p>
            <p>10. According to this notion that some of the Vials are poured out, he observes all the Vials may

            <p>Besides, how can we think the Harvest of the Earth, can be said to be ripe before the set time is come that God hath appointed for its cutting down, which is 42 months or 1260. years? <hi>The sin of the Amorite was not fully ripe;</hi> or that Harvest fit for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down till the 400 years were expired, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13. and yet shall <hi>Babylon</hi> be ripe, and the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest of wrath come so long before the set or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time of Harvest? this is a paradox. <hi>Jurieu</hi> saith <hi>p.</hi> 79. the first Vial and Plague, where (sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I) begins the Harvest, was in the tenth Century which is 600 years ago, and above so many years before the set time of Harvest; for that was before or about the time the Beast was in the height of his glory he seems to assert the Harvest came soon after the seed time; (tho' 'tis true he fixes it on the last Age) this cannot be thought, we must sure make the first Vials the time of the Harvest, and the latter the time of the Vintage; let this be considered, certainly none of of the former Judgments on <hi>Babylon</hi> belongs to the seven last Plagues, for the dominion of the Beast was not then ripe, nor the Harvest come, but now 'tis near, wo unto the Earth and Earthly Men, the gross body of the Antichristian professors, for they must have the dregs of this first Vial, 'tis pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon the Earth, those that partake with her in her sins must receive of her Plagues; many will
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66447:93"/>
be found in her, who little think of it. But again if the Vials be poured forth by the Witnesses Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel in the time of the Beasts reign and tyranny, why do they begin the Vials, no sooner? for there were faithful preachers who bore their testimony against the Beast from his first rise, and so downward all along, and it had much like effects with <hi>Waldo</hi>'s, <hi>Luthers,</hi> preachings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to conclude with what Mr. <hi>Canne</hi> hath said upon This account, it doth appear to me that he is right in respect of the seven Vials, not being yet poured out, because <hi>the Temple is said to be filled with smoak from the glory of God, and no man could enter in, until the seven Plagues of the seven Angels were fulfilled, Rev.</hi> 15. 8. If by the Temple being filled with smoak from the glory of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Spirit alludes to the History of the Tabernacle, and History of the <hi>dedication of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which was <hi>filled with the Cloud of the glory of God</hi> (as most agree to,) then here is signified a most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pouring forth of the holy Spirit upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who pour out the Vials,—and that they must tarry in the Temple (as the Disciples were to do at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) <hi>until endued with power from on high, Luk.</hi> 24. 59. and this may be expected at the <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Witnesses</hi> and not before, for as yet, we see not such a spirit given from the glory of God, and from his power, nor may we expect it until then, that the Church <hi>cometh out of the Wilderness as clear as the Sun, and as terrible as an Army with Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi> Cant. 6. 4. <hi>and like Pillars of smoak perfumed with Myrrh and Frankincese, Cart.</hi> 3. 6. 7. the Judgment of the 7 last Plagues for the ruin of the Enemy, will be the time of Glory and Salvation of the Church, and by the 14440 on Mount Sion with Harps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Singing the Song of <hi>Moses, &amp;c.</hi> are held forth (I am perswaded) the ministrations of the Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the seven Angels, with the seven Vials or seven

                  <hi>these words, when they shall have finisht their testimony,</hi> must (saith he) not be understood as if the holy Ghost would say, <hi>when the</hi> 1260 <hi>years shall be finisht,</hi> for after the 1260 years are run out there can be no Persecution, seeing the Beast shall have lost his power; so that this Persecution must begin and end within the 1260 years, but yet at the end of them, 'tis the ordinary custom, not only of Scripture, but of all men to say, that something comes to pass when this or that is finisht, because it happens when that thing is finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and very near its end, this is therefore the last Persecution of Antichrist against the Church; this Persecution hath its Characters.—1. 'Tis compared to a War; <hi>The Beast that comes up out of the Bottomless Pit, shall make War against them.</hi> 2. This War of Persecution must end in a victory over the two Witnesses, <hi>and shall overcome them;</hi> mark, God does not reckon the Death and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, which the faithful suffered for the truth, as a victory that the Devil gains over them,</q> (a very good note) for 'tis said, they, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Saints and Martyrs of Jesus overcome them, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Beast and his Emissaries, <hi>and they loved not their lives unto the death, Rev.</hi> 12. 11. <q>He speaks of martyrs, when he saith, He that overcometh I will make to sit down on my Throne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that when 'tis said, that <hi>the Beast shall overcome the Witnesses,</hi> this signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that he shall make them saint under their Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which thing ought to be well observed, that we discern the singular Character of this present

Persecution that hath conquered and overcome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Million of Souls, (he means the late and present Persecution in <hi>France.</hi>) 3.

During those 3 years and a half, the truth shall remain as it were dead, but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not buried: men shall not dare to make profession of it, notwithstanding it shall be visible the people who are neighbours of them, who shall have slain it, shall hinder it from perishing and putrefaction,—7. At the end of 3 years and a half, the faithful who are oppressed and whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession shall have been violently suppressed, shall rise again; after that shall ascend to Heaven, and shall be exalted,—8. At the same time, and after the exaltation of the faithful, there shall be an Earth quake, <hi>i. e.</hi> a great emotion and trouble in the World, and in Antichrists Kingdom. 9. In this emotion, a tenth part of the City shall fall, <hi>i. e.</hi> a tenth part of the Antichristian Kingdom, shall be taken away from it, and seven thousand men shall perish in this Earth-quake, and be buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ruin of this City; that this shall be brought about with some Blood she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, tho' not considerable.</q>—<q>Now when I search after the time, in which this Persecution must happen, I cannot doubt but
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66447:94"/>
this is that in which we now are; after this Persecution shall be over, God will begin to strike those sore blows to destroy the Antichristian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which must be destroyed with in 25 or 30 years.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That none may wonder, (saith he) that I speak so positively about a thing which seems to be as yet hid in futurity, I intreat all equitable minds to consider, that I have (as I think) with great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence proved, 1. That the Reign of the Popedom must last 1260 years. 2. That these 1260 years began about 450. or 455. and consequently they must end about 1710. or 1715. This being so, we are but 25 or 30 years from the end of the Popish Kingdom. And if this be so, the present persecution must needs be the last, since there is no probability, that this present persecution being ended, the calm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to the Church should leave room for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—For we must allow the space of at least 20 or 25 years, in which Popery shall be attacqued and not be the Aggressor and the Persecutor. And certainly a shorter time cannot serve for the utter destruction of so vast a Kingdom, for it shall not be destroyed in a way of violence, but in a way of perswasion.</q>—Yet he says (it shall not be done without blood and slaughter) I have, saith he, further proved that the fall of this Popish <hi>Babylonian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is divided into two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Harvest and the Vintage; that the Harvest is the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the last age, and the Vintage is the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that must be made in this present age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then proceeds to shew his apprehensions that <hi>France</hi> must be that Street of the great City in which the two witnesses should be slain and lye as dead, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 24<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <q>The bodies of the two witnesses, saith he, shall lye in the Street of the great City. 'Tis to be observed, that in the Text 'tis not in the Streets,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66447:95"/>
in the Plural, but 'tis in the Street in the Singular. And I cannot hinder my self from believing, that this hath a particular regard to <hi>France</hi> which at this day is certainly the most eminent Countrey which belongs to the Popish Kingdom, her King is called the Eldest Son of the Church the most Christian King, <hi>i. e.</hi> The most Popish according to the dialect of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have by their liberalities made the Popes great at this day; it is the most flourishing State of <hi>Europe,</hi> it is in the middle of the Popish Empire, between <hi>Spain, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, England,</hi> exactly as a Street or place of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is in the middle of a City; 'tis also four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>square, as such a Place or Street of a great City, <hi>i. e.</hi> almost as long as broad, and I believe, saith he, that 'tis particularly in <hi>France,</hi> that the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses must remain dead, <hi>i. e.</hi> That the profession of the true Religion must be utterly abolisht, this is already done by the revocation of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and by the enormous Cruelties of the Souldiers,—<hi>Pag.</hi> 254. saith he we are in my opinion certainly in this Persecution which must extinguish the true Religion for three years and a half; if we will reckon those 3 years &amp; a half from the abrogating of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> in the month of <hi>October,</hi> 1685. The deliverance of the Church will fall out in the year, 1689. And this is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the conjecture of <hi>Monsieur du Moulin</hi> in his accomplishment of the Prophesies, he hopes that the Persecution of the Church by the Antichristian party shall cease in the year 1689, </q>But in <hi>p.</hi> 255.

            <p>But they that read our great Writer Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> will soon, I am persuaded, see more ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Great Britain</hi> is that very <hi>Street</hi> of the great City in which the Witnesses of Christ were to be slain and lye dead, than any other, for, as my worthy Friend before cited intimates, God values not nor accounts of People and Nations from their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:66447:96"/>
Greatness or external Grandeur, but from their Light, Glory &amp; Excellency of their Spirits, &amp; Purity; now what Nation or Kingdom is so famous, or has been since the beginning of the Reformation, or hath obtained so great Light as this of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> It must be in one Street of the great City doubtless, where the Witnesses have finished their Testimony, in which they were to be slain, and lye as dead; and I question whether in any one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Europe</hi> the faithful Witnesses of Christ may be said to have finished their Testimony as here in this Nation, for by finishing their Testimony may be meant (as some observe) bearing Witness to Christ, not only in respect of every one of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but also in all his Ordinances. And that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Primitive purity of them, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think there has not been the like Testimony up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this respect born any where else; as also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of true Church Constitution and Discipline, and to true Magistracy and Ministry, and to Christ's absolute Authority as King of Saints, and King of Nations, and born in such a publick manner as it has been here formerly and of late; take the Doctors words, p. 165.</p>
            <q>
               <p>And if in this last Combate the Witnesses be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled out as one party, and by Witnesses be meant only such faithful Christians and Professors as do, in respect of their Godliness and Sincerity, hold forth an Eminent Testimony and Witness, above that which others of the croud of the common Professors do, and so not men of Learning, but of Holiness and Zeal, are they who are here said to be the real <hi>tormentors</hi> of these Enemies: Then surely in that part of the Reformed Churches, where such Witnesses are chiefly found, who do continue eminently to hold forth such a kind of powerful Testimony as holy men (for this is a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66447:97"/>
Testimony of Holiness, not of Learning.)—surely there especially will be the Seat of this War, and the field where this Combate is to be fought.</p>
               <p>Now then look generally over (almost) all the Reformed Churches, and how few of such Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, with difference from the common croud, do appear amongst them; the fire, the heat of those godly men, their first Reformers (which is the thing that should torment these Enemies at last) being gone, and the light only remaining, which gives but a faint, cold and dull Testimony, and which these Enemies do therefore despise. Only in the Witnesses of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> both the light and heat of Religion have been kept up and increased; and among them only hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the power of godliness been continued, with difference from the croud of common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors. (And according to what appears in view) more of such true Witnesses now in these last days (wherein this slaughter is to fall out) are to be found in it, and belonging to it, than in all the Reformed Churches besides; and that, according to the Testimony which they of those Churches (who in these times of scattering have come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for refuge) have and do give; and surely the place of this killing the Witnesses, must be where most Witnesses are. And so that, that Kingdom may be designed more than any other; as in which also more Eminent are found of those last sorts of <hi>Champions,</hi> for the Beast who <hi>receive</hi> only the <hi>number of his name,</hi> who yet shall be the chief Executioners<note place="margin">Our times in respect of the late King and his Confederates have sufficiently made this good which the Dr. so long ago hinted.—</note> of this last slaughter.—Add unto this, this conjecture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Daniel</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> which Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>v.</hi> 36. hath <hi>Graserus,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his Discourse

            <p> Now when he shall <hi>go forth</hi> in this last War in such fury and rage with a purpose utterly to destroy; the main event and issue of that expedition of his is made to be this; <hi>viz. That he shall plant the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his Palace between the Seas in the glorious holy Mountain: yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him, Dan.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> which the Dr. says he fears that these <hi>British</hi> Islands are here intended, in that they so eminently above all other places of the Churches Reformed, and with difference also from all others do stand <hi>between the Seas,</hi> even wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Seas (<hi>penitus toto divisos Orbe Britannos,</hi>) which Islands likewise God hath made the Eminent Seat of the Church in these latter days, and which he hath loved above all the Inhabitants of <hi>Jacob.</hi> 
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>And in that the Angel there calls this Mountain, in an high and transcendent phrase, yet of further difference, [the Mountain of delight of holiness] or as <hi>Junius</hi> turns it—[the Mountain of holy come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness] it seems in some way of peculiarity from others, even in that respect also, to note out a place, which for holiness should more eminently be Gods delight, and comely in his Eyes, where he should have a most holy people, and which he should make a <hi>Land of uprightness,</hi> where his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <hi>jesty</hi> and Glory should more eminently shine; which place notwithstanding, for the tryal of the Witnesses in it, God shall again give up unto the power of Antichrist, there to <hi>plant the Tabernacle of his Palace or Throne,</hi> (or his Clergy, as <hi>Graserus</hi> reads it) even as a sign <hi>Nebuchadhezzar</hi> did his Throne at <hi>Taph-hannes,</hi> when he had Conquered <hi>Egypt,</hi> as a sign of that his Victory; by the Conquest of which Kingdoms, and regaining them unto him, he shall seem so rooted in his ancient power, that

               <p>But this his sudden Victory is but as the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Tent or Tabernacle in a Field, not to stand past three years and a half, tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Party, and their Abettors, do in their hopes think they build for Eternity; but it being of mans, not Gods planting, it shall come to nothing.</p>
            </q>
            <p>I cannot but conclude what this great man hath said, that Great <hi>Britain</hi> is more like to be that Street of the great City in which the Witnesses should be slain, rather than <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> or any other Kingdom, and also am much persuaded the late times have accomplished what he so long ago fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. Methinks three years and a half sometimes since expired, looked just like the times he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; had not the Pope placed his Tents here again, and hoped to have had a setled Throne? and hath not also here been a dreadful slaughter of the true Witnesses of Christ, as we before have hinted? and doth there seem any ground to expect the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? So that either the time is past, or I hope the Dr. was mistaken, if it be to come it will be the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zingest providence and revolution that ever was in the World; I must conclude we are in a most happy hour, or else there is the most dismal hour near that ever the Godly knew or saw since the Reformation; a little time will shew us more. I can't but expect the <hi>ascention of the Witnesses</hi> to draw on apace, in which will first fall out that great <hi>Earthquake</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66447:98"/>
7000 men of name will be slain, who were the chief instruments in bringing that death and dismal hour upon the Witnesses of Christ, which the Dr. hath most excellently opened; moreover there is one thing more he hath shewed his thoughts upon, that I am affected with, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning <hi>Daniel</hi>'s 1290 days and 1335 days or years, the first he says begun from <hi>Julian</hi>'s time, which he concluded end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at 1650 or 1656, and that the other 45 years will bring in the Kingdom of Christ, which makes 1335, and that will expire about 1695 or 1701, between which time he prefixeth the Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and Ascention of the Witnesses and the Earthquake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are no doubt coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the wonders, and the Vials of Gods wrath will suddenly be poured forth upon the Enemies of the Church, neither can I think that <hi>Jurieu</hi> is in the right, who thinks the Papal power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will fall without or with little Blood, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though when the Harvest is ripe there may not fall so many as at the time of the Vintage, yet 'tis said of men of name shall be slain seven thousand; how many of other sorts who can tell? Besides, that is a certain number put for an uncertain; but when the <hi>Vintage time</hi> comes, the <hi>Blood shall come out of the Wine-press, even to the Horse Bridle,</hi> by which our Expositors generally say is intended a wonderful slaughter, and under the second Vial, which may take in the Harvest Hour. God gives them <hi>Blood to drink, they being worthy of it, because they have shed the Blood of the Saints. Babylon</hi> is to be rewarded as she hath rewarded the Lord's people, and must <hi>drink double of the same Cup she measured to them,</hi> and then what must she look for but Blood, Blood, Blood with a witness, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 5, 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 6. For what Rivers of Blood hath she caused to run down in every Street or Kingdom of this reat City.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:66447:99"/>There are two things more had I room I would speak to.</p>
            <p>1. To shew how all our Writers do agree that the rise of the Beast was between the year 410 and 455, but most fix upon 450, or near that time, for then the ten Horns appeared with Crowns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, who are said <hi>to receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast,</hi> Rev. 17. Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> saith, p. 63. that by the year 456 all the ten Kings were up. <hi>Brightman</hi> begins the Beasts Reign sooner by above 20 years; <hi>Jurieu</hi> saith, he began about the year 450, and will end totally about 1710.</p>
            <p>The second thing is to have shewed the nature &amp; glory of Christs Kingdom, which I judge will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the Ascention of the Witnesses, for then, as I conclude, the seventh Trumpet begins to sound, and the <hi>first Angel pours out his Vial,</hi> 'tis certain with the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> the glory of the latter days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and the little Stone then will begin to smite, &amp; will never cease till all the Image power is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces, and <hi>the little Stone becomes a great Mountain, and fills the whole Earth;</hi> the Saints must and shall take the Kingdom, <hi>and the knowledge of the glory of the Lord shall cover the Earth as the waters cover the Seas.</hi>—I am persuaded His present Majesty is raised up to do great things for Christ; and tho' some may strive to obstruct the work of God, and uphold an interest for the Beast, yet they shall be blasted in their designs, and come to shame and ruin in the end; for God is risen up, and his Enemies shall be scattered.</p>

and opened under <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> From hence he notes three things. (1.) That the Vials belong to this state of the Church, wherein Antichrist is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, and wherein there shineth a measure of light in the Church. (2.) That the Vials are all contained under the 7th Trumpet. (3.) The Temple is not only here represented open in order to give passage to the 7 Angels that pour out the Vials, but to give way for all Nations to enter in, according as it is said, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>That all Nations shall come and worship before God. The smoke that filled the Temple</hi> answereth to the Cloud <hi>that covered the Tabernacle of</hi> Moses, <hi>and the divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>—the Smoke was a Symbol <hi>of Gods gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences</hi> in the midst of <hi>Israel</hi>—and so signifieth <hi>Gods return to his Temple, or the glory of the Church;</hi>—'tis added, <hi>No man was able to enter into the Temple till the 7 Plagues of the 7 Angels were fulfilled,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth that tho' the time of the destruction of the Churches Enemies draweth near, and the time wherein the Gospel shall shine bright in the World, yet that the Gospel will not be universally received till after the subversion of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which will not be until the Vials have been poured out;—yet some are ready to think the fulfilling of the 7 <hi>Plagues,</hi> &amp;c. alludes to the fulfilling of the time of their first pouring out, and not till they are all poured out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the 7 Trumpets, 7 Thunders, and 3 Woes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the 7 <hi>Seals</hi> and 7 <hi>Trumpets,</hi> he much agrees with our Expositors, he concludes the first Woe fell out under the 4th and 5th Trumpets; take his own words. St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>c.</hi> 8. 13. that he heard <hi>an Angel flying through the midst of Heaven, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to the Inhabitants of the Earth, by reason of the Trumpets that are yet to sound.</hi> After the sounding of the 5th Trumpet St. <hi>John</hi> adds, <hi>One woe is past, and behold there come two more hereafter.</hi> One of these two woes fell undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66447:102"/>
out under the 6th Trumpet, under which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometanism and the Turkish Army destroyed the whole East, and therefore the third woe must come to pass under the seventh and last Trumpet.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That all the Vials, saith he, being contained under the 3d <hi>woe,</hi> they are yet to be poured out, foras much as we are this year 1687. still under the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and groaning under the pressure of the 2d woe.</p>
                  <p>So that here we have a new proof that all the Vials from the first to the last are yet to be poured out, for as much as the <hi>Vials</hi> are no other thing than the 7 <hi>Thunders</hi> which are spoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. and indeed the <hi>Thunders</hi> are 7 in number as well as the <hi>Vials</hi> are; and as the Thunders do signifie the Judgments of God against the Enemies of the Church, so the Vials do signifie the same, in that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by them the wrath of God is to be consummated. Moreover, the things threatned by the Thunders are delayed from being executed until the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 7th Trumpet and therefore were to be sealed up until <hi>the Mysteries of God should be finished,</hi> (which in my judgment means the whole of the Beasts 42 Months,) which agrees with what he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther says, p. 249. The <hi>Mysteries of God</hi> (saith he) is the bringing in of the Kingdom of Christ, and the uniting of all Christians, from whence that peace of the Church shall arise, and if there be any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the <hi>Vials</hi> and the <hi>Thunders,</hi> it consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only in this, <hi>viz.</hi> the Thunders are the denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the Judgments of God, and the Vials are the execution of them, for tho' the Thunders were heard by St. <hi>John</hi> under the 6th <hi>Trumpet,</hi> yet they were not to be executed till under the 7th, when all the <hi>Vials</hi> shall be poured out.</p>
               </q>
               <p>He then proceeds to speak his conjectures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the pouring out of all the 7 Vials.</p>
               <p>1. On the earth, which (he thinks) intends the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66447:103"/>
Joss of Church Revenues and so falls upon the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Carnal Interest of Antichristian men (let the Carnal Earthly and Self-seeking Prelates and Clergy look to it.)</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Vial upon the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. The Sea, he says, is the Papal Kingdom, (in this he agrees with reverend Mr. <hi>Knowles.</hi>) <q>In its uttermost extent, not only the Countrey where the Pope is Soveraign, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise all those Princes who acknowledge him, <hi>and this Empire shall become as the blood of a dead man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that every Soul which liveth in it shall die.</hi>
                  </q> That is (saith he,) the government of <hi>Popish Princes</hi> shall not be able to endure their Yoke, as fish cannot live in waters which are turned into blood.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Vial on Rivers,</hi> he concludes, means Popish Doctrines.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Vial on the Sun,</hi> in all likelyhood, saith he, is the <hi>Ottoman Emperor,</hi> as the <hi>4th Trumpet</hi> raised him, so the 4 <hi>Vial</hi> shall pull him down; I think it rather means the <hi>German</hi> Emperor.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Vial,</hi> on the Seat of the Beast, is meant the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> saith he, which is here threatned, and all agree with him in this.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Vial poured out on the great River</hi> Euphrates, <hi>and</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>the waters thereof were dryed up, that the way of the Kings of the East might be prepared,</hi>  &amp;c.</q>

                  <hi>The sixth Vial</hi> 
                  <q>destroyeth the <hi>Empire of the Turks</hi> and their Religion which the <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the highest pitch of its Grandeur for the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> does, saith he, undoubtedly signify the people of that part of the world, and its wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being dryed up denotes the end of that <hi>Empire</hi> and their Religion, after which there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder, either the Kings of the East who shall be enlightened and converted, or the Jews who are there dispersed in great numbers from marching into the West, to help to finish the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

               <head>Some brief hints of this <hi>French</hi> Ministers An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Mr. <hi>Jurieu,</hi> about the Vials.</head>
               <p>
                  <q>SAith he, Mr. <hi>Jurieu</hi> builds his commentary on <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. <hi>i. e.</hi> in that he considers the seven Vials, as seven Periods of time, making the first Vial to fall upon the 10th. age, and lasted 150 years <hi>p.</hi> 2. and the 6. <hi>Vial</hi> he affirms to have continued from the year 1429. till the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> at
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66447:104"/>
which time he begins the seventh. <hi>Vial.</hi>
                  </q> 
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This, saith he, is the great principle that Mr. <hi>Jurieu</hi> goes upon, <hi>i. e.</hi> the 7 <hi>Vials</hi> are certainly 7 Periods of time: and after this principle, saith he, he draws three conclusions. (1.) That there is a difference between the <hi>Vials</hi> and the Plagues, that the 7 Plagues are the Judgments of God, and the 7 <hi>Vials</hi> denote the 7 Periods of time, wherein those Judgments are to fall upon the <hi>Papal Empire.</hi> (2.) That all the Plagues are designed against the Papal Kingdom, and not so much as one of them against the Empire of the Turks, <hi>'tis certain, saith</hi> Jurieu, <hi>that the 7 Plagues are entirely intended against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Beast.</hi> (3.) That there are in all thirteen Plagues, whereof the 6 first have destroyed the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> as civil, &amp; these 6 Plagues fell under the 5 first Trumpets, and that the 6th. Trumpet which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 7 <hi>Vials,</hi> shall destroy the same <hi>Empire</hi> as <hi>Ecclesiastical and Papal,</hi> and that the <hi>Vials</hi> have been <hi>pouring out</hi> since the 10th. <hi>Century,</hi> that the 7th. is not yet wholly poured out, but that it begun at the time of <hi>Luthers reformation,</hi> and will end at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, saith this learned French Minister, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mr. <hi>Jurieu</hi>'s principle is, that the 7 <hi>Vials</hi> are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 7 <hi>Periods of time,</hi> this hath no evidence in it, being neither certain nor clear, to those that are versed in the reading the Prophets,—saith he, <hi>Jurieu affirms that the</hi> 7 Vials <hi>signifie an Hour-glass and not a cup; for a cup is of another form than a</hi> Vial, <hi>in that this hath a large Belly and a narrow Mouth,</hi>—<q>to which our Author saith it is not about the form of a Vial that we treat, but about the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, nor is there any Greek Author that ascribeth to the word Vial, the signification of an Hour-glass;—But by all Dictionaries it does appear that the term Vial signifies a Cup, a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66447:104"/>
                     <hi>Chalice,</hi> in a word, a vessel designed to drink in, so that Mr. <hi>Jurieu</hi>'s great principle is more than doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but then the use to which St. <hi>John</hi> applies this term Vial, does make us plainly see its falshood in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>The</hi> 24. <hi>Elders fall down before the Throne, having Golden</hi> Vials <hi>full of odour, which are the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Saints,</hi> where Hour-glasses used to <hi>offer Incense</hi> in, and to <hi>scatter perfumes</hi> in <hi>places of worship,</hi>—</q> 
                  <q>Again he saith, that the term <hi>Vial</hi> can have no other signification but this, <hi>i. e.</hi> in that the wrath of God whereof they are said to be full, <hi>chap.</hi> 16. the Vials are said to be full of the wrath of God, and are poured out, are (saith he) Hour-glasses said to be cast <hi>into the Air, on the Sun or Sea, &amp;c.</hi> Moreover he refutes <hi>Jurieu</hi> about the Trumpets, and that they rather signify Trumpets proclaiming War, than Trumpets whereby the Jubilees were published, and so shews his weakness in asserting the Trumpets to signify Periods of time: sith years of Jubilee were years of joy, but these Trumpets brought in woe and lamentation with them, so that it is not true, faith he, that the Trumpets of St. <hi>John,</hi> intimate Periods of time, by an allusion to the Trumpet which published the Jubiles, and it is yet less true that the <hi>Vials</hi> are Hour-glasses to mark these Periods by; Mr. <hi>Jurieu</hi>'s principle being false, saith he, all the conclusions which he draws from it, must necessarily be false also. (1.) 'Tis false that there is a difference between the 7 Plagues and the 7 <hi>Vials,</hi> seeing they are the same Judgments of God, against the Enemies of his Church. (2.) 'Tis false that the Plagues are designed only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Empire of the Beast, for, saith he, the Trumpets and <hi>Vials</hi> have in part for their object the <hi>Turkish Empire,</hi> and <hi>Mahometan Religion.</hi> (3.) 'Tis false that the 6th Trumpet is subdivided into the 7 <hi>Vials,</hi> and that the 7 <hi>Vials</hi> have been pouring
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66447:105"/>
out since the <hi>tenth Century,</hi> for 'tis the 7th Trumpet that is subdivided into the 7 <hi>Vials,</hi> because 'tis under the 7th Trumpet that the <hi>Vials</hi> shall be poured out; whosoever well considers what is to arrive under the 6th <hi>Vial,</hi> according as St. <hi>John</hi> has described it, and thereupon compares it with what is to come to pass under the 7th <hi>Trumpet,</hi> may from thence prove, that the Judgments of God represented by <hi>pouring forth of the Vials,</hi> agree admirably with the effects of the 7th Trumpet, and may from thence conclude, that the subdivision which Mr. <hi>Jurieu</hi> attributes to the 6th Trumpet, agrees only with the 7th, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He then proceeds to defend a former Book writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by himself, (as I suppose) against <hi>Jurieu</hi> about the <hi>Vials.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first foundation upon which he goes is, that the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is nothing but a continuation of the Prophetical History of <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning the 4th <hi>Monarchy</hi> which is the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of Jesus Christ.—</p>
               <p>The 2d is, that the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> predicteth 3 changes that were to befal the Roman Empire, by the first, <q>it was to pass from <hi>Paganism</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> by the second, it was to pass from <hi>Christianity</hi> to <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism</hi> and <hi>Mahometism,</hi> and by the 3d it is to return from <hi>Antichristianism</hi> and <hi>Mahometism,</hi> to Christianity purified by a general reformation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The 3d rule by which he goes is, that the first change fell out under the 6th seal, that the 2d came to pass under 6 of the Trumpets, and that the 3d shall arrive under the 7th Trumpet, that brings in the <hi>Vials.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The 4th is, that these three visions, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Seals,</hi> that of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and that of the <hi>Vials,</hi> are the three principal <hi>Visions,</hi> and do comprehend the whole Prophetical History concerning the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

                     <hi>Empire,</hi> and the Church of God, and that all the other <hi>Visions</hi> are but commentaries upon these three.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The 5th is, that none of the Vials are contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with any of the Trumpets, except the seventh Trumpet, and that there is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the time of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and that of the <hi>Vials,</hi> as there is between the time of building, and the time of destroying what is built, and that we are to see all that overthrown under the <hi>Vials,</hi> which was established under the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> this does evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, in that the <hi>Trumpets</hi> and the <hi>Vials</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play themselves towards the same subjects, and that the effects of the <hi>Vials,</hi> are different from those of the <hi>Trumpets.</hi> And this difference is so great, that whosoever considereth it carefully and without prejudice, will be convinced that whatsoever was produced and rais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For whereas under the <hi>1st Trumpet</hi> there fell <hi>upon the Earth, Hail mingled with Fire and Blood;</hi> instead of this under the first <hi>Vial</hi> there falls <hi>upon the same Earth, i. e.</hi> those who worship the Beast, <hi>&amp;c. a noisom and grievous sore.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>The 4th Trumpet,</hi> lays before us, <hi>the third part of the Sun,</hi> and of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and of the <hi>Stars,</hi> smitten, <hi>i. e.</hi> The 3d part of the <hi>Roman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Empire</hi> darkned by the pestilential Doctrine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and invaded by the Army of the <hi>Turks:</hi> But the <hi>4th Vial</hi> which is poured forth only upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> seems to threaten the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>

                  <p>The proof, saith he, which Mr. <hi>Jurieu</hi> grounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conformity of the first 4 <hi>Vials,</hi> with the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi> observable in the history of the <hi>Pagan Empire,</hi> is perfectly overthrown by considering the nature of the <hi>Vials</hi> themselves, for they are nothing else but the Judgments of God upon the <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> in order to destroy it, but the events which he will have to answer the 7 <hi>Vials,</hi> produced a quite contrary effect, <hi>i. e,</hi> They raised it, they increased it and brought the <hi>Papal Empire</hi> to its grandeur, the wonderful corruption of the <hi>tenth Age</hi> signified according to Mr. <hi>Jurieu</hi> by <hi>the noisom sore</hi> of the <hi>first Vial,</hi> served to diffuse the darkness of Error and Idolatry by which that Empire is supported, the <hi>Croisad</hi>'s, which he will have to be signified by the <hi>Sea</hi> &amp; <hi>Rivers</hi> under the <hi>2d and 3d Vials,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the <hi>Suns scorching men</hi> under the <hi>4th Vial,</hi> which he will have to prefigure the growth of the <hi>Papal Authority,</hi> did all contribute to the rendering the <hi>Empire</hi> stronger and more terrible.</p>
               </q>
               <p>How then could these <hi>Vials</hi> (which are the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, nay and the last plagues and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to finish the wrath of God upon the Beast and <hi>Babylon</hi>) be said to be poured out to increase and perfect the grandeur of the <hi>Papistry</hi> or <hi>Papal Empire.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jurieu</hi> to answer this difficulty would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>that some of the severe Judgments of God,</hi> nay and they must be some of the last Plagues or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too, <hi>the Popes are not the Subject, but the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, these plagues,</hi> saith <hi>Jurieu, fall upon those who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Beast and his Image, and not upon the Beast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and false Prophet.</hi>

Impossible that an <hi>Empire</hi> should be smitten with Plagues and Judgments of God, in order to its being weakned, and impaired, and that its head and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign should in the mean time no ways suffer (to which I might add but contrarywise great strength thereby) the union, saith he that is between the head and the members, is wholly inconsistent with any such a notion, whensoever the body is very sick, the head is in a very ill condition; and this holds more truly in reference to a <hi>Political body</hi> than to the <hi>body Natural,</hi> whereas 'tis a Spiritual Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>viz.</hi> Antichristianism, the Judgments that are to be executed upon it are to be Physical and Penal evils, which as punishments are to weaken and subvert it, the Judgments of God against an Empire whose criminalness from the very nature of it, lies in its Errors, <hi>i. e. Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Tyranny,</hi> &amp;c. which comprehends in them the corruption of manners, cannot consist in evils of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but the first 4 <hi>Vials</hi> according to <hi>Jurieu,</hi> import evils of crime, &amp; not of punishment, &amp; do strengthen and advance the <hi>Empire</hi> or <hi>Papistry</hi> in all that is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to it, instead of depressing and enfeebling it, for it never had so great power and Splendor as it enjoyed from the 10th to the 14th Century, and that is the time according to Mr. <hi>Jurieu,</hi> for the effusion of the <hi>1st</hi> 4 <hi>Vials,</hi> never man was certainly more mistaken; our author proceeds and confutes <hi>Jurieu</hi> as fully, in respect of what he affirms to be the effects of the other 3 <hi>Vials,</hi> which I have not room to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, <hi>p.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 24. our Author confesseth that <hi>Luthers</hi> refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was a Judgment of God upon the Papal Kingdom, (yet not the effects of the 5th <hi>Vial</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Jurieu,</hi> nor the 1st <hi>Vial</hi> according to some of our English Writers) for he withal says, that it was an effect of the 6th Trumpet, which continueth
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66447:107"/>
to represent the War of Antichrist against the Church of God: till then Antichrist had been always victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious against the Saints for more than a 1000 years, but then came to receive a disaster; now this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune befel the <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> saith he, under the sixth Trumpet, which being the last save one was the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the War was hastning to an end, and that the last Trumpet was about to sound under which this War will both <hi>actually end,</hi> and all the <hi>Vials</hi> come to be poured forth, but the damage which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation hath done the Papal Kingdom, tho' it hath dismembred it, is only a beginning of its sorrows, and is but an effect of the War which was to continue 42 months, during the time of all the six Trumpets, and which shall be finished thro' the effusion of the <hi>Vials</hi> under the 7th Trumpet; to which let me add, what greater reason have our English Writers to fix the pouring forth of the 1st Vial, about the time of <hi>Luther</hi>'s reformation wrought by his preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, who go as high as <hi>Waldo,</hi> nay, with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieu,</hi> to the tenth age, since there was some worthy men in every Century, that bare a brave testimony against the Papal Idolatry, and wounded the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry very sorely, tho' 'tis granted not to such a degree as in the last age? Besides, what reason is there to conclude the Harvest of Gods wrath is come, till 'tis fully ripe? and why should we conclude it will be fully ripe till the 42 months are expired, which seems to be the set time of cutting down? I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the slaying of the Witnesses of Christ quite fills up their measure, and so makes way for the 7th Trumpet and <hi>Harvest of Gods wrath,</hi>—when the measure of the Churches afflictions shall come to their height, and the Beast will have filled up his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and measure of wrath against Gods people, then will the time of Gods fury break forth, which will be as he observes when the 6 <hi>Trumpets</hi> cease
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66447:108"/>
                  <hi>sounding,</hi> and the seven Vials, which are the seven Plagues, shall arrive and begin to take place against the Papacy, and against Mahometism; 'tis, saith he, for this reason that 'tis said by the seven last Plagues (which are the <hi>Vials</hi>) the <hi>wrath of God is finished;</hi> from whence it followeth that the <hi>Vials</hi> are not contemporary with the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> and that it is not the <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> that is subdivided into the seven <hi>Vials,</hi> but that this subdivision is to be assigned to the <hi>seventh Trumpet;</hi> the <hi>sixth</hi> as well as the <hi>five</hi> preceding speaketh nothing save War against the Church of God; so long as it lasts <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> abates nothing of his fury, but constantly makes the same Efforts for the oppressing of the Truth, and such who do profess it: But as soon as the seventh Angel comes to sound, the case will be quite altered, the Wrath of God will break forth, and the Vials empty themselves. And this is the reason why the Vials are called the seven last Plagues by which the Wrath of God is fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Lastly, He shews us that the <hi>seven Vials</hi> or last <hi>Plagues</hi> do manifestly allude to the <hi>Plagues of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> because they are called Plagues as well as Vials, and are also poured out upon <hi>Spiritual Egypt;</hi> and seeing, saith he, the Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> did take up but a short space of time, we may not allot years; <q>nay, may be, saith he, not allow months, for the Execution of all the <hi>Egyptian Plagues,</hi> why then should it seem strange that all the <hi>Vials</hi> should be poured out within the  <hi>space of fifteen or eighteen years?</hi>
                  </q> The <hi>third woe cometh quickly</hi> under which all the <hi>seven last Plagues</hi> shall be poured out, which signifieth that all the Plagues shall be poured out, saith he, close upon one another; (in this he so agrees with what Mr. <hi>Canne</hi> hath written upon the same account directly) let us remember, that there is no <hi>natural Agent</hi> which acteth with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66447:108"/>
the <hi>rapidity</hi> that fire doth, <hi>our God is a consuming fire,</hi> and <hi>'tis a terrible thing to fall into his hands;</hi> the fire of Gods wrath will burn doubtless (when it begins to seize upon the combustible matter of the <hi>Antichristian state</hi>) with great <hi>fury God will make a short riddance of his Enemies; the second woe is past, and behold the third woe cometh quickly, Rev.</hi> 11. 14. <q>We are to observe (saith he,) that this is not said in prediction of the <hi>two first woes,</hi> all that is said of them <hi>they shall come;</hi> but this <hi>quickly</hi> is not added, save in the prediction of the third woe. When we may conclude, that the seventh Trumpet shall immediately follow the Resurrection of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, whose death, as it fell out in 1685, so their Resurrection shall ensue within three years and a half;</q> in this he agrees directly with <hi>Jurieu,</hi> it will be well if they do not both prove mistaken.</p>
               <p>However there is no doubt but we are near <hi>the time of the end,</hi> and I hope the <hi>Witnesses</hi> are risen, or suddenly (here in Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>) will rise. <hi>Bone</hi> (methinks) is <hi>coming to his Bone,</hi> or alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy have not we seen of late a day like that spoken of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 7, 8. <hi>A noise like that of shaking, and the Bones came together Bone to his Bone, and Sinews and Flesh coming upon them,</hi> and is not <hi>Breath come into them?</hi> and <hi>do they not begin</hi> to live? is not their hopes revived, and are they <hi>not up upon their feet?</hi>—They <hi>

            <p>GOD having given the Scriptures to his Church 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. for her use and benefit here on Earth; so the Times &amp; Numbers (part thereof) have, are and will be of use to her: Therefore the Angel <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 21.

            <p>The first number I shall begin with, is that great

number of 2300 days, (a day for a year, as is usual in Scripture,) <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 14. Which I conceive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the lesser in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelations,</hi> all of them being but parts of this; God in his wisdom having so divided this number according to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Circumstances of Providence the Church was to come under.</p>
            <p>I conceive this number of 2300 was headed, or doth take its beginning, from the year God trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the <hi>Babylonian Monarchy</hi> to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which was the third and last of <hi>Belshazzar</hi>'s Reign, who was also the last of the <hi>Babylonian Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Because I find no times set in Scripture to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin before they are given forth, tho' several a great while after.</p>
            <p>2. The Question, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 13. is, How long is the Vision to give both the Sanctuary and the Host to be trodden under foot? and the answer is, to 2300 days: So that time relates to the suffering of the Church then to come.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Daniel chap.</hi> 8. 1. dates it in the Third of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar, in the year</hi> he saw the Vision; tho' when he saw it, he was in <hi>Shushan,</hi> a chief City in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Elam,</hi> which is in <hi>Persia. Daniel</hi> was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> call'd to Expound the Hand-writing when the City was taken, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 13, 30. But when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the <hi>Median</hi> had taken <hi>Babylon,</hi> and had so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his Dominions by the <hi>Kingdom of Babylon,</hi> he, for the better Government of the whole, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 1, 2. set over the Affairs of the Kingdom 120 Princes, and three Presidents over them, of which he made <hi>Daniel</hi> chief; so that there is great reason why he should be in the Royal <hi>City Shushan.</hi> But this falling out in the third of <hi>Belshazzars</hi> Reign, that he lost his Kingdom, <hi>Daniel</hi> dates the Vision that year, tho' he was in <hi>Persia</hi> when he saw it. God (<hi>chap.</hi> 7. and in the first of <hi>Belshazzar</hi>'s Reign)

shewed in Vision unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> under the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>four Beasts</hi> the <hi>four Monarchies</hi> which should rule in those parts of the World, where his Church then was, and was to be in after times, during all her suffering state, till <hi>Christs Kingdom</hi> on Earth was to come, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27, 28. God having before shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Jeremiah, chap.</hi> 25. 11. the sufferings of his Church under the first of these for 70 years; The ending of that Monarchy, and the 70 years was to be together in the self-same year, which was also to fall out in the Reign of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27. 7. which was this <hi>Belshazzar.</hi> Now in the last of this <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> and the first of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> God shews to <hi>Daniel</hi> how long the Church was to suffer under the three that were to succeed, and 'twas to be for 2300 years longer, before the Churches deliverance was to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, and Peace and Righteousness established in the Earth, under the blessed and glorious Reign and Government of Christ and his Saints on Earth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28. with <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. the whole <hi>Psalm.</hi> Well might these heavy Tydings cause his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to change by the trouble of his mind about this matter, as the Repetition after <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. in the description of the 3 that were to Reign the 2300 years yet to come, as <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21,—26. caused him to faint, even to sickness for certain days, <hi>v.</hi>

               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:66447:111"/>The next thing is how to carry on this time of 2300 years, according to Scripture. And first I shall premise,</p>
            <p>1. That it is not so material to enquire what of this time is run out, in and under each of these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies (there being so much time alloted by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment for the whole) if we can but find the time carried on in Scripture, it is sufficient, for as God set the time then to come, of the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, in the 70 years of his Churches sufferings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, so he sets the whole time of the three that were to succeed in the 2300 years of his Churches sufferings then to come.</p>
            <p>2. That Histories do greatly differ, both as to number of <hi>Persons reigning,</hi> and the time that each reigned, that they rather confound than help in this matter, and is one reason why Expositors have so varied; each following him whom he liked best, and endeavouring to reconcile the Scriptures to them, when indeed we should reconcile them to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and if they speak not according to them, not to hear them. And therefore to prosecute my design, I find we may reckon up this account of 2300 years (so many of them as were past at Christs death) by Scripture thus.</p>

whose Heart was so ingaged for the good of the Church of God; besides, it hath been, that such as were to succeed in the Throne, have been in the management of the Government, before the death of him that preceded, as in the case of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> being 62 years old when he took <hi>Babylon,</hi> must be 81 when <hi>Cyrus</hi> came to the Government, if he managed these affairs the two last years of his life, as it's probable he did, and 83 when he died, being the third of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his being concerned in the Government, but the first of his absolute rule; and then he gives liberty to the People of God to return and build the Temple. Now this work after they entred upon it, did soon meet with interruptions in the time of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that made the Decree for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temple, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 4. 5, 24.

How many years this interruption continued; or how many years it was between the first Decree of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when they laid the Foundation of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, including the years of Preparation, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 8, 10. and the Decree of this <hi>Darius,</hi> in the sixth year of whose Reign it was finished, the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> gives us an account, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 12. to be seventy years, for the seventy years here intended, cannot be the seventy of their captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in which time they were to pray for the peace of the City, and of the place where they were carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; For God promised <hi>that in the Peace thereof they should have peace,</hi> till the time came of their return,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:66447:113"/>
according to divine appointment, they were to build Houses, to Plant and to Marry, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 5, 6, 7. without attempting to return to build the Temple, till the seventy years were out; therefore in that time to build Houses in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not God's House in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was no crime. But the great thing the Prophets <hi>Zechariah</hi> and <hi>Haggai</hi> reprove them for, was this,—consider (1.) The Prophets were contemporary, and prophesied in the second of <hi>Darius,</hi> the time that the Temple work is revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and finished. (2.) They tell the People, 1. That God was displeased with their Fathers, and now with them. 2. For what he was displeased, <hi>viz.</hi> For minding their own private things, as Houses and Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and letting the House of God lye waste. 3. The effects, in blasting all their labours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (3.) He promiseth them that upon their applying themselves to the work of finishing his House and the service of it, he would abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bless them; So that the Prophets applying it to that time, we have reason to judge, that it was no other but the interruption upon the work which was, as all apprehend, some considerable length of time, but are at great uncertainty how to reckon it, when the labour may be saved, and we at no loss in the thing, when the Holy Spirit hath reckoned it for us; now the Scripture tells us, that as the work was revived after seventy years Death upon it, in the second year of <hi>Darius,</hi> so it was finished in his sixth year, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 15. which sixth year was his last, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> succeeding him, in the seventh of whose Reign there is another decree to beautifie the House of God, and to provide it with Sacrifices, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 21, 22, 23, 24, 27. for this decree relates only to the House of God, and his worship there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; In the twentieth of whose Reign another Decree comes forth to Build the City, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 1.—

to the ninth, and here begins <hi>Daniel's</hi> seventy weeks of years; so that, if this account be right, we have a very plain and certain account of the time, adding the seventy weeks of years to the death of Christ. I know it is the Opinion of most, if not all, to reckon otherwise, and indeed they cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise do, that go by History, which tells of more Kings Reigning, and that some of these I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned did Reign longer, as that this <hi>Darius,</hi> in the sixth of whose Reign the Temple was finished, Reigned in all nineteen years, as <hi>Helvicus, Juni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, It's to be noted, for so it is in the Scriptures of Truth, That there was a threefold go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Captivity. The First, in the 3d year of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 24. 1. with <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 1, 2. which was the 1st year of the Reign of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Jer.</hi> 25. 1. In this <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet was carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and was but young, as <hi>v.</hi> 4. This <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> Reigned in all 11 years, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 5. Then <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> Bound him in Chains, and carried him to <hi>Babylon, v.</hi> 6. And made <hi>Jehoiachin</hi> King in his stead, who Reigned 3 Months and 10 Days, and then the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> carryed him and the rest of the Vessels of the house of God, and a great Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the People, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24. 10.—to 17. This was the second going into Captivity. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was made King by the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> and Reigned 11 years, as 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 24. 18. In the last of whose Reign and the 19 of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was taken, (as 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 25. 8. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 52. 4, 5, 6, 12, 13.) and burnt with the Temple. This is the third and last go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Captivity; between which and the first it evidently appears, there were 18 or 19 years, and the Temple was not destroy'd till the last: So that the ancient men spoken of in <hi>Ezra,</hi> might be of the last going into Captivity, and then there is no need of reckoning them older than 20 years when carried Captive, 51 years of the Captivity, 19 being gone before and 21 of <hi>Darius,</hi> in all 92 years; and it's very probable many might live to that Age. <hi>Obj.</hi> But how doth it appear that the 70 years doth begin in the 1st of these goings into Captivity? <hi>Ans.</hi> Very plainly; For in <hi>Jer.</hi> 28. 3. The false Prophet saith that the Yoak of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> should be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the Captivity should return in two years; In the 29th of <hi>Jer.</hi> the Lord tells them, that were then in Captivity, that they should build hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Plant Gardens, and take Wives in the Land of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:66447:116"/>
their Captivity, and pray for the peace of the place, for in the peace thereof they should have peace, and and in the tenth verse, that after seventy years were accomplished, they should return, and not before; so that it is evident that the seventy years in Gods appointment, did begin in their going into Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that were then in Captivity, and not in their Captivity that was yet to come, which was not till the last of <hi>Zedekiah's</hi> Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> who came out of Captivity, the Prince and Governour, did not only lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the house of God, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 8. But did also finish it, <hi>c.</hi> 5. 2. Now if the interruption was seventy years, he must be very old when he finished it, or very young to be chief when they first came up, and laid the Foundations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We know they were reckoned Princes, or Chiefs by their being Elder Brothers, or Families, whether Younger or Elder in years; and he might live (as doubtless he did) all the time of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and be twenty or thirty years old when he came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and be but ninety or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old, when the Temple was finished, and we read not of him afterward. For <hi>Ezra,</hi> who came up the seventh of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and <hi>Nebemiah</hi> who came the twentieth of his Reign, both Governed and set things in Order themselves, according to the Commissions they had. And what <hi>Ezra</hi> writes of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> is but Historical, of things past and done. But if this be not right, they that go by History, must be much more out, who make the time between <hi>Cyrus</hi> his decree, and the sixth of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his Reign, in which it was finished, to be at least a hundred twenty four or six, which is almost double seventy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. is about the one and twenty days, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 13. Some reckon it in the time of <hi>Cambyses</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:66447:116"/>
Reign, and so part of the time of the interruption upon the work after the Foundation was laid; but this could not be; For <hi>Daniel</hi> lived but to<note place="margin">Ans.</note> the first of <hi>Cyrus</hi> absolute Government. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. <hi>v. last.</hi> He prospered all the Reign of <hi>Darius, Dan.</hi> 6. 28. and in the Reign of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that is, to the first of his absolute Government, and then dies: For he came not out of Captivity, which doubtless he had done, if he had lived, being a man, whose heart was set upon the work of God, and the good of his Church. Others take it to be the one and twenty natural days of <hi>Daniels</hi> fasting, as <hi>v.</hi> 2. But<note place="margin">Ans.</note> this cannot be, because the holy Spirit, that we might not be misled, reckons them twice by weeks of daies, as <hi>v.</hi> 2. 3. That we might not take them for the time after <hi>v.</hi> 13. Of one and twenty days as usual in Scripture, a day for a year. And in what sense can we suppose that the Prince of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> could withstand an answer from God, of <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer, when the Angel tells him, that from the first day he set his heart to understand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he was heard, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Therefore to conclude, what Persons Histories say did Reign, which the Scripture knows nothing of, or the time they say they did Reign, is nothing to me; For I cannot think that God in his Word would have been so distinct, and particular in the persons Reigning, and their time, had it not been for a guide to us to calculate by. Therefore let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers go by what Rule they please, I desire to abide by that word, which I know is a sure word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy, and cannot deceive any that have the mind of God in it.</p>

            <head>An Essay towards the understanding the Time set in the Scriptures respecting the Witnesses, left in the Word for the Use and Benefit of the Church.</head>
            <p>AND First, why two Witnesses? First, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because the Scriptures tell us, That in the Mouth of two or three Witnesses e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing shall be established. Two are sufficient, and less cannot; holding forth this truth to us; That let God's faithful Servants be never so much reduced as to their number, yet he hath not left himself without sufficient Witness in this World. Or, Secondly, To signifie unto us the greatness of that Apostacy that should be from the truth, of which the false Church should be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the whole Earth wondring after the Beast, and that but few comparatively should be found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the time of the Holy Cities being trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der footby the Gentiles. Or, Thirdly, Signifying to us, That as the Church at the time of Christ's coming was but one National Church, therefore represented by one Candlestick, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 2. Now under the Gospel the true Church of God, the Mystical Body of Christ her Head, consists of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66447:117"/>
visible Churches, and therefore is represented by two Candlesticks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Who those Witnesses are? <hi>Ans.</hi> Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to their own thoughts, who take them to be either the two Testaments, or Magistracy and Ministry, or two particular Persons, I conceive them to be the faithful people of God, that have obtained Grace to hold the truth of Christ in all Ages, in a faithful adherence to him, under all the Apostacies that have been made from them, and Oppositions that have been made by them that have Apostatized from them that have not loved their Lives unto the death, for the Love they have had to Christ and his Gospel.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The time of their Prophesie is set down, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 3. and is 1260 days, that is, so many years, which time is contemporary with the Gentiles tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under foot the Holy City for forty two Months. Now although in forty two full Months there are more days by about eighteen than 1260, yet the Text seems to give us to understand that these times shall begin and end together, though thus differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reckoned, the one by the Sun, the other by the Moon, as may more fully appear in the next consideration of their work.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Their work is implied in the name given them; they are called Witnesses. To make a Person a true Witness, he must have a full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what he says or testifies, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. Therefore they are Gods Children here intended, that have experienced the things they testifie unto; so the matter of their Testimony is that <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 8. to testifie to Christ his Person and Offices the alone Mediator, as revealed, opened and held forth in the Gospel, which is that upon which the true Church of God is Built, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And which is the Temple not given to the Gentiles,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:66447:118"/>
whilst the Court and Holy City is given to them to tread under foot forty two Months, all which time the Witnesses here intended are to Prophesie and Testifie to those truths, that others under a name and profession of Christ Apostatized from, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded their false Doctrines and Corruptions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the truths and true worship of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28, 29, 30. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 12. &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. the whole chapter, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. the whole chapter, the Epistle of <hi>Jude,</hi> all are Prophetical of great Apostacies that would be from the Truths and Purity of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Now, I say, the work of the Witnesses is, to stand up for the defence of the Gospel, and they shall do so for 1260 years together, and then they are slain and lye dead for three days and a half, that is, three years and a half, then the Spirit of life from God shall come upon them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Their finishing their Testimony, this must either respect their Testimony it self, or the time allotted to them, that is, the 1260 years; I conceive the first is intended, for after or when they are upon the finishing it, there is a fresh War made upon them, in which, they that make the War upon them prevail, so as to overcome them, and kill them, and then they lye dead for three years and ½, now how long time this shall take up, is not said. And if the holy Spirit who had been so exact, in setting down the time of 1260 years of their Prophesy, and the three days and ½ of their lying dead, had omitted a time between both, the Church of God had been at as great uncertainty, as if no time had been set almost. Therefore if we take the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing their Testimony to respect their work, then it is our concernment to consider wherein this finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part doth lye; And that I conceive to be in a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66447:118"/>
witness to the Kingly Office of Christ. His Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and Priestly Offices were first Witnessed to; And this hath been lastly contested for, even to blood, in the last Wars in <hi>England,</hi> as the other had been upon which this last War hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced. The Testimony being further confirmed in the Martyrdom of many of those concerned in the finishing of this Testimony. The sufferings of the Church in these late years has been carried on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her otherwise than in former ages, in other Methods, and under other names, and pretences, all bespeaking that the time of finishing the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is come, and the War commenced, and it may be an overcoming, if not killing also.</p>
            <p>Sixthly where this shall be? <hi>Ans.</hi> It will be there where this finishing part of the witness to Christ is born, for there the last War is (which is the last effort which Antichrist shall make against the Church of God) and overcoming, and killing will be: And where they shall lye dead, and where they shall rise? when the Spirit of life from God comes upon them; Now where shall all these things be? The Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit tells us, it shall be in the Street of the great City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 8. Not in all the Ten, but in one Street, and upon their resurrection the tenth part of the City falleth, not the whole City at once, <hi>v</hi> 13. So that in the Street, or Kingdom where the Testimony hath been finished, there all the rest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and there the deliverance of the Church shall begin, to an utter overthrow of all her Persecutors and Mortal Enemies.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, When this shall be? <hi>Ans.</hi> To know the beginning and end of these times and things, there are two ways of calculating. The one is beginning at the Head of a number, so reckoning forward to its end; The other is back-wards, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. beginning our reckoning at
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66447:119"/>
the end of the number, and so reckoning to the beginning; Now by one of these two ways, in Gods time we shall infallibly know. But to the Question, I suppose both ways may be a help to us now, and Scripture numbers have a dependance one upon the other, and there lies the harmony of them, when that is understood. The great number, which includes all the rest, throughout the sufferings of the Church of God, under the three last of <hi>Daniels</hi> four Monarchies, is that of 2300 years, which I have indeavoured to carry on by Scripture to the end of it, within forty five or forty four years, from this year of our Lord 1686. There are two other great numbers in <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 12. one of 1290. the other 1335. which is forty five more than the other; so that altho' they both begin together, they do not both end together, by 45 years. That they begin together is evident, for the 45th is the addition of so many to the 1290. therefore blessed is he that lives to the forty five longer than the 1290. for altho' the Churches deliverance shall begin at the 1290. it shall not be compleated till forty five more; Therefore blessed is he that lives till that time: so that when ever these 1335. years begin, they end with the 2300 years also. Again, the 1290. is thirty more than 1260. in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. therefore tho' they may end to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet they cannot begin together. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of this, expositors have generally judged, that the 1290. in <hi>Daniel</hi> relate to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the 1260 to the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church, but by what reason I cannot be satisfied. Hence they head this 1290. at <hi>Julians</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to rebuild the Temple; The reason of which was this, he had apostatized from Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and restored the <hi>Gentile</hi> Worship and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and as an affront to Christians, put the <hi>Jews</hi> upon Sacrificing also, who told him that it was not lawful for them, but in the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:66447:119"/>
therefore he orders them to build it, which they attempted to do, but could but attempt, for God by his immediate power prevented them. This <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> began his Reign in 365. and Reigned but three years, so that this opinion time hath confuted; For add 1290 to 368, it makes but 1658. at which time they reckon'd the <hi>Jews</hi> would be called; but no such thing hath been: Therefore they expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all these places, which we read Sacrifices, with a supplement, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8 12. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 31. <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 11. to intend the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish worship, which <hi>Julian</hi> attempted to set up in confront to Christianity, to be the abomination that makes desolate, for all or any of which I see no reason. It is properly translated Sacrifice in one place, as <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 26, 27. And this doth relate to the taking away of the Sacrifices then in being, of Gods own appointment, which accordingly were taken away, as Christ himself also admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 15. by <hi>Titus—&amp;c.</hi>

               <item ana="#role_TOTAL">1658</item>
            </list>
            <p>But the abomination which makes desolate, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is some corruption in the Gospel worship, the true worship of God; And therefore seeing we, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, find the Apostle concerned so much in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning the Church by a Spirit of Prophesie, of what had also been expresly foretold by the Spirit of God; If it was expresly foretold, it must be written some where or other: and take the Apostles own expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. Why may we not rather reckon this to be the abomination, to astonishment foretold by <hi>Daniel,</hi> and this came in in the 383. year, when <hi>Syricius</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued 15 years; in his time Marriage was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Priests, and in the 425. year <hi>Caelestinus</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and continued eight years; He assumed the temporal power, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 4, 5.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66447:120"/>
and why we may not head these numbers here, I would be glad to understand. In the last of which I conceive Antichrist did make his first visible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the World: so that add the 1260 to 425 it makes 1685, and you bring it to the end of 2300 days within forty five years, or a year or two, which time I conceive is alloted to pour out the Vials, and to accomplish the great revolutions in, that shall come upon the Earth, in order to the possessing of the Kingdom, that shall be given to the Saints of the most high, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 26, 27, 28. There is time expressed by time, times, and dividing of time, three times in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25. 12. 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14. I find time thus expressed but in one place more, and that is, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 23. where it's certainly taken for years, and by what rule we will construe it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in other places I see not. And that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11. seems plainly to relate to a special time of the Enemies accomplishing to scatter the power of the Holy People, then all shall be finished, (<hi>i e.</hi>) the sufferings of the Church, or deliverance shall thence begin, and bear date from the end of this three years and ½ In <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25. He tells who shall act this last part, compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14. how God even in that time will provide for his Church, when the Devil pours out his last wrath upon her, knowing his time is short, and what time this should be, except the three years and ½ of the Witnesses lying dead; I cannot see the time when <hi>Babylon</hi> shall say in her Heart, she sits a Queen, shall see no sorrow, Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-hood, or loss of Children any more, having accomplished what she had been 1260. days la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

For I conceive the Witnesses cannot be said to Prophesy when dead, therefore this time follows immediatly upon the end of the 1260 days of their Prophecies; which ending in 1685 according to the preceding compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; at which time Popery came to be inthron'd in this Nation, accomplished the slaughter and death of the Witnesses; the time of whose lying dead, which was to be three years and an half, being add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 1685, amounts to 1688 and an half, which was the very time of Gods lifting up his hand by his present Providence to save these distressed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
