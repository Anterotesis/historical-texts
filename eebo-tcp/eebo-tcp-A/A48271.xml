            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Irelands Sad Lamentation: Diſcovering its Preſent DANGER, in Some Remarkable Paſſages Which have happened ſince the Diſcovery of the Horrid POPISH PLOT. In a Letter from a Perſon of Honour to his Friend in <hi>London,</hi> upon the Diſſolution of the Late Parliament.</head>
            <p>MY Pen is not able to repreſent to your view the Dusky Scene, which the Diſſolution of the Parliament hath drawn on the Hearts and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of all Loyal Proteſtants in this Kingdom; from this great Seſſions, we hoped ſome Commiſeration would have been had of us, conſidering the great and eminent dangers we now lie under: But theſe hopeful Joys being fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and expecting neither Redreſs from or by the aſſiſtance of our preſent Governor, nor any other part of the Government here, we do, as Men in a General Wreck, give up our ſelves to the Protection of God Almighty, and the Mercy of thoſe inceſſant Billows that threaten us with Death.</p>
            <p>We have <hi>little hopes,</hi> if at all <hi>any,</hi> of being ſecured from that Popiſh Cruelty which moſt of us have felt in this Age. You of <hi>England</hi> may object, <hi>Your Danger is equal to ours, that our Governor and other Magiſtracy are all Proteſtants, the Arms ours, (or at leaſt ought to be ſo) and all other ſtrengths.</hi> This indeed, were it ſo, might abate our Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, but I ſhall make a Collection of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Paſſages, ſuch as at preſent will occur to my Memory, and then I leave you to be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judge.</p>
            <p>In the year 1677. at the height of the Plot, the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> by the intereſt of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> received his Commiſſion to ſuperſede the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in the Government of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and accordingly, on the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the ſame year, made his Entrance with great Solemnity.</p>
            <p>The next Spring (being a time when the grand Conſults were held for putting an end to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Deſigns) he takes a Progreſs over the whole Kingdom, to ſee in what poſture the ſame lay, (for what deſign I know not;) in which Journey he was much attended by Popiſh Gentry, freely conferring (I will not ſay to make Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes) the Honour of Knighthood on many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving Perſons, as he paſſed through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>The Plot being diſcovered in <hi>September</hi> 1678, there was little or no notice taken of it here at Court, though it was proved thoſe of the Plot of <hi>England</hi> held a Correſpondency with ſome in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that many <hi>Black Bills,</hi> &amp;c. were, or was to be ſent over for the Maſſacre intended, yet no means were uſed by the Lord Lieutenant, with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Council, for the ſecurity of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or prevention of that Horrid Deſign; but the vigorous Proteſtant Magiſtracy of this City raiſed their Militia, both Foot and Horſe, part of whom were ordered to guard every night in their turns, but in the outward part of the Town, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable was the uſage we received, they would not ſuffer our Companies to guard in the City, (which muſt be the refuge in time of extremity) alledging the King's Guards were appointed to defend the ſame; ſo that upon any Attempt, our Voluntier Inhabitants muſt certainly have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before the King's Soldiery, who receives Pay, had enter'd into any dangerous Engagement. Of this City the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> Son to the Duke, is Governor.</p>
            <p>Thus were we all expoſed every man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his own Safety: the firſt vapor of Popiſh Venom which might give us occaſion not to doubt what they intended for us, was this, The Lord Mayor went in perſon, with ſome of his Brethren, to demoliſh the Maſs-Houſes of this City, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Altars, and other Idols, locking up the Doors, and committing the Keys to the Church-Wardens of the reſpective Pariſhes: It happened that at one of thoſe obnoxious Houſes an Officer of the Mayors, a waggiſh Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, taking ſome of their Popiſh Trumpery, (and in deriſion of that Superſtitious Religion) began to act the Prieſt; then taking their Holy-water, and ſprinkling part of it on ſome of his Fellows, the reſt on the Floor, like a Shopkeeper's Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to lay the Duſt, he was told by one who ſtood by, <hi>He ſhould dearly repent thoſe direful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> And that very Night going to his own houſe,
<pb facs="tcp:104206:2"/>
about Ten a clock was ſet upon by four or five perſons, who ſtifling him, threw him down, then wounded him in ſeveral places, crying, <hi>Kill the Rogue, Kill the Rogue;</hi> which they had certainly done, had he not had Armor on, which he always wore for his own ſafety in the execution of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: Yet this Aſſaſſination had no more effect at Court, than a ſport to laugh at, how the poor <hi>Catchpole</hi> was ſerved in his kind.</p>
            <p>When the Duke received a Command to ſeize Colonel <hi>Talbot,</hi> the Colonel was Revelling at the Duke's Table, ſitting with him at Dinner; and moſt people think if he had not been there at the Duke's receipt of the Commands, he had not been Apprehended. The Reaſons which induced them to that Opinion, is, when the Colonel attained his Liberty upon Surety, the aforeſaid Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> was his Bail.</p>
            <p>Not long after the Diſcovery, upon ſeveral Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the Proteſtants againſt the Inſolence of the Popiſh Clergy and their Aſſemblies, the Lord Lieutenant and Council iſſue forth a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, For the Apprehenſion of Prieſts and Jeſuites; therein inſerting a Reward of Five Pounds for a Prieſt, and Ten Pounds for a Jeſuite.</p>
            <p>In Obedience to which, a Captain of the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned-Bands, took ſeveral in one <hi>Saints Eve,</hi> private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Celebrating Maſs in their Popiſh Veſtments, and the next morning brought them before the Duke; where, upon Examination, ſome of them produced the Duke's own Protection, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by Colonel <hi>Fitz-Patrick,</hi> and other Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Popiſh Gentry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In fine,</hi> They were all diſmiſſed, as well thoſe who were Protected, as thoſe who were not, as was all who were afterwards taken, the Apprehenders being gratified with no other than a Reproof for their too much diligence, by which means the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have found no diſcouragement nor obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Proceedings; and I do believe their Hopes are raiſed to as great an Extaſie as ever, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo much influence on the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot broke forth, and <hi>Bourke</hi> Accuſed the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> all Endeavors poſſible were uſed for the Vindication of the Earl; but when he was cleared at <hi>Waterford,</hi> and <hi>Bourke</hi> did not appear, then had the Papiſts got Cock-a-hoop again, and no man durſt ſay within the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> (or anywhere elſe, if it came to the Duke's Ear) <hi>That there was any ſuch thing then on foot, or lately deſigned, as a Plot to invade this Kingdom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the Proteſtant Religion, and ſubvert the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof.</hi> I ſay, no man under pain of gaining the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s diſpleaſure, durſt ſpeak his Apprehenſion of ſuch a thing as a Plot in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Inclinations of the Duke hath been more viſible of late, by the Actings of his Son, (who, without doubt, did nothing without his Fathers permiſſion) in the Tryal of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> baſely pledging his Honour, to Acquit that moſt Culpable and Undeniable Traytor; which hath given ſo great a wound to his Reputation, that the Name of the <hi>Butlers</hi> is grown a Load to almoſt the Generality of this Nation.</p>
            <p>When Complaint was made againſt the Duke in <hi>England</hi> for his Misbehavior in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he applied himſelf to the Council for a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, <hi>That he had Acted nothing <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt in his Station:</hi> But 'twas refuſed by ſeveral Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, who are good and juſt men, valuing the Proteſtant Intereſt, and Abhorring all Foreign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction or Authority from or under the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay little of our Chancellor, who, by the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Intereſt, was made Primate alſo of this Kingdom, the two onely Places that can ſway the Government, and, without doubt, will not be ſo ungrateful to his Promoter, but, when occaſion ſhall ſerve, he may command his Service either as to Eccleſiaſtical or Civil Matters, or what elſe will beſt tend to his advantage; part of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice hath already appeared before His Majeſty in Council, which would ſeem but a Grain or Drachm, were it weigh'd with his other inſulting Oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>By this you may ſee the tender Care that hath been taken of us; what ſtrength the Proteſtants can have in a Conſcientious War, I mean, againſt the Papists or Foreign Enemies; when we can judge no leſs but our Leader is our Oppoſite; when we cannot enjoy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Dread Soveraign to awe thoſe Rebels who daily combine againſt us. We want an <hi>Eſſex</hi> again, whoſe Judgments and Juſtice were ſo equally Ballanc'd, that even his worſt of Enemies without ſhame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot calumniate his Honourable Proceedings. I muſt tell you again, we want an <hi>Eſſex,</hi> a <hi>Shaftsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that is to ſay, A Good and Zealous Proteſtant that will ſtand up for us in this time of Eminent and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-to-be-avoided Danger. I can aſſure you, here's no man harbours an evil thought of his King, no man doubts of his Excellency and Compaſſion towards us; but rather are given to think He is under the ſame misfortune of ſome of His Predeceſſors, lead by evil Counſellors, which God of his mercy grant may not prove fatal: We onely, with ſufficient cauſe, reflect on his Miniſters and Officers here, and unanimouſly ſay, with the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, His Watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they are dumb Dogs that cannot bark, ſleeping, lying down, loving to ſlumber; yea, they are greedy Dogs that can never have enough; they are Shepherds that will not underſtand; they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter.</hi> And now that His Majeſty, with the Aſſistance of his great Council of Parliament, would purge the Officers of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and thoſe who ſhall be found defiled and unclean, to caſt out; and thoſe who are pure and clean, prone to the advancement of His Honour, to Eſtabliſh, ought to be the Prayers of you and all good Proteſtants, as 'tis of,</p>
