            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable the LORD MARQUESSE of HARTFORD.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may seem strange unto your Lordship to see a name sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to this <hi>Dedication,</hi> which neither hath an <hi>Interesse</hi> in your Noble and illustrious Family, nor any <hi>relations</hi> to your Person. But when I have acquainted you with the <hi>reasons</hi> of it, I hope those <hi>reasons</hi> will not only justifie, but indear my <hi>Confidence.</hi> My large <hi>Cosmography</hi> having been Dedicated in the first <hi>Delineations</hi> and <hi>Essay</hi> thereof, to one of the greatest <hi>Princes</hi> in the <hi>Christian</hi> world; could not descend, with any Fitnesse, to a lower <hi>Patronage,</hi> after so many Additions, and so great <hi>Improvements.</hi> And for such other Books of mine as have seen the <hi>light,</hi> they were in <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>congruity,</hi> to be Inscribed to him alone, or to some of His, by whose <hi>Appointment</hi> they were written, and from whose <hi>service</hi> I was fain to borrow the greatest part of the time which I spent about them. But being now (unhappily) at my own disposing, and left unto the <hi>liberty</hi> of presenting
<pb facs="tcp:59300:3"/>
the ensuing work, as my own <hi>Genius</hi> should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me; I look upon your Lordship as a Person fitted with the best <hi>Capacities</hi> to receive this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> at my hands. The Eminent zeal wherewith your Lordship stood so firmely, for the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Devotions</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when there appeared so great a readinesse in too-many others to give them up as an Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Peace-offering for their own security; in the first place, <hi>Entituleth</hi> you to the best performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which the <hi>Orthodoxies</hi> of that Church and the Conformity thereof, to the antient patterns, are declared and vindicated. To this as Seconds, may come in, your Lordships <hi>Interesse</hi> in that <hi>Vniversity</hi> where I had my breeding, and more particularly in that <hi>Colledge,</hi> whereof I had the happinesse to be once a <hi>Member</hi>; your <hi>studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi> in the wayes of learning; the faire esteem you hold of those which pretend unto it; and the <hi>Incouragements</hi> you have given to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good letters, in forwarding with a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and liberall hand the new <hi>Impression</hi> of the holy Bible in so many Languages; A work of such transcendent profit, and so many advantages above all others of that kind, as will not only redound to the honour of the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers,</hi> but to the glory of the Furtherers and Promoters of it.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>motives</hi> which on your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships part have prompted me to this <hi>Dedication</hi>; and there are <hi>reasons</hi> for it on my own part also. Your Lordship cannot but remember what great
<pb facs="tcp:59300:3"/>
cries were made At, and before the beginning of the late long <hi>Parliament,</hi> concerning a <hi>designe</hi> to bring in <hi>Popery</hi>; the <hi>Bishops</hi> generally defamed as the chief <hi>Contrivers</hi>; the regular and established <hi>Clergy</hi> (my self as much if not more, then any of my rank and quality) traduced in publick <hi>Pamphlets</hi> as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>survient <hi>Instruments.</hi> And this was <hi>unicum eorum crimen qui crimine vacabant,</hi> in the words of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>; the only <hi>Crimination</hi> laid upon those men, who hitherto have been <hi>convicted</hi> of no <hi>crime</hi> at all How wrongfully accused even in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, time which brings all things unto light, hath now clearly evidenced. For which is there of all the <hi>Bishops,</hi> how few of all the <hi>Sequestred</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auctorated Clergy, who notwithstanding all the <hi>provocations</hi> of want and scorn (greater then which were never laid on <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>ingenuous</hi> Spirits) have fallen off to <hi>Popery?</hi> So few in all (to the Eternall honour of both <hi>Orders</hi> be it spoken here) that were the rekoning or account to be made in <hi>Greek,</hi> it hardly would amount to a <hi>plurall</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And for my self, how free I am, and have been alwayes, from any Inclinations of that kind; in my <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Reader</hi> I have shewn at large, and manifested more particularly in this present work. It had been else too great a <hi>folly</hi> (or a <hi>frensie</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to present any thing of mine to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships sight, of whose <hi>sincerity</hi> in the true <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion here by Law established, neither the <hi>jealousie</hi> nor <hi>malice</hi> of these last and worst times, hath raised any suspicion. And this I hope will be a full <hi>acquitment</hi> to me from all future cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
<pb facs="tcp:59300:4"/>
for where a Person of such eminent and known <hi>Integrity</hi> makes good the <hi>Entrance,</hi> who dares suspect that any thing <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Profane,</hi> is either harborred in the work, or the Author of it? And if I gain this point, I have gained my <hi>purpose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are (my Lord) the principall <hi>Impulsions</hi> which have put me upon this <hi>Adventure.</hi> And these I hope will be of so great <hi>prevalency</hi> with your Lordship also, as to procure a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Entertainment to the following work; that others may afford it the like fair Reception, when they shall find it <hi>Owned</hi> and <hi>Countenanced</hi> by your Lordships name. Which honour if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship shall vouchsafe unto It, the work shall have a <hi>sublunary Immortality</hi> beyond the Author; who whatsoever he is now, or shall be hereafter, is and shall be at all times, and on all occasions, redeuable to your Lordship for so great a <hi>favour,</hi> as best becomes</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND now Reader I am come to thee, who mayest perhaps wonder (and I cannot blame thee) to see me so soon again in <hi>Print,</hi> and that too in a Volume of so large a bulke. 'Tis like enough thou mayest conceive me guilty of that <hi>vanity,</hi> which a devout Author finds in some sort of men <hi>who desire knowledge only that they may be known</hi>; possibly of that <hi>vanity of vanities</hi> which the <hi>Wiseman</hi> speaks of, consisting in <hi>the writing of many books,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 12.12.</note> of which <hi>there was no end</hi> to be expected as he there informes us. And if this <hi>vanity</hi> were so strong in the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> when the art of Writing was not vulgar, the art of <hi>Printing</hi> not invented, and that there wanted many helps which we now enjoy; it cannot be but that the <hi>humour</hi> must be more predominant in these latter dayes, wherein there are so many advantages for publishing our own conceptions to the view of others, as were not granted unto those of the elder ages. And we may say more truly then the Poet did, (by how much more we have those helps and opportunities which they had not then) <hi>Scriptorum plus est hodie quam muscarum olim cum caletur maxime,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>I condemn my self</hi> in doing <hi>the same things</hi> which I judge them for; and so am rendred <hi>inexcusable</hi> for so great a folly. And though it cannot be denyed, but that I have been as great a <hi>Scribler,</hi> as almost any other of my age and time: yet thus much I must say in my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that except the first <hi>Essay</hi> and draught of my <hi>Geography,</hi> digested for my private pleasure, and Printed probably out of ambition and vain glory; I never published any thing with or without my mane subscribed unto it, but what was either by the strong hand of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity extorted from me; or else imposed by the appointment and command of the noblest power under which I lived. Had I been
<pb facs="tcp:59300:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
troubled as some are, with an itch of Printing, or carryed on by a desire of being in action; I could have offered to thy view some <hi>Pieces</hi> long before this time (and those, it may be, not unworthy of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration) which hitherto I have kept by me, and possibly shall do so still, untill they may be found subsequent to the <hi>publick peace.</hi> For that there is <hi>a time to keep silence,</hi>

            <p>But the truth is, I never <hi>voluntarily</hi> ingaged my self in any of those <hi>publick quarrels,</hi> by which the unity and order of the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath been so miserably distracted in these latter times. Nor have I ever loved to run before, or against <hi>Authority</hi>; but always took the just <hi>counsels</hi> and <hi>commands</hi> thereof for my ground and warrant: which when I had received, I could not think that there was any thing left on my part but <hi>obsequii gloria,</hi>

And in this part of my <hi>obedience</hi> it was my lot to be most commonly imployed in the <hi>Puritane</hi> controversies: in managing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of although I used all <hi>Equanimity</hi> and temper which reasonably could be expected (the argument and persons against whom I writ being well considered); yet I did thereby so exasperate that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing party, that I became the greatest object of their spleen and fury. Hardly a <hi>libell</hi> in those times, which exercised the patience of the State for so long together, in which my <hi>reputation</hi> was not blasted, my good name traduced, my <hi>Religion</hi> questioned; and whether I would or not I must be a <hi>Papist,</hi> or at the least an <hi>Under-factor</hi> for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the best was, I had the honour of <hi>good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> which made the burden pleasing to me: not only the <hi>Bishops</hi> generally, but some Particulars amongst them of most eminent note, being traduced in the same <hi>Pasquils</hi> for carrying on a designe to bring in <hi>Popery</hi>; the King himself given out (witnesse the <hi>Popish royall Favorite,</hi> amongst other <hi>Pamplets</hi>) to be that way biassed. And if they <hi>call the Master of the house</hi> by the name of <hi>Belzebub,</hi> the <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> must not look to finde better language. And though I took all honest and ingenuous courses to wipe off this stain, yet when the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny</hi> once was up, <hi>necesse est ut aliquid haereat,</hi> it was impossible for me (in a manner) so to purge my self, as not to suffer under the injustice of the <hi>imputation.</hi> Concerning which I shall make bold to tell thee a remarkable passage, which is briefly this: It was about the time that my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had published his learned and laborious work against <hi>Fisher</hi> the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> when I had preached some <hi>Sermons</hi> before the King upon the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Tares</hi> (which Parable I had chosen for the constant argument of my Sermons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Court): of which some moderate and judicious men were pleased to say, that in those Sermons <hi>I had pulled up</hi> Popery <hi>by the very roots, and subverted the foundations of it:</hi> to which it was replyed by some of those <hi>bitter</hi> spirits (whether with more uncharitablenesse or imprudent zeal, it is hard to say) that the

               <hi>Arch-bishop might Print, and Dr.</hi> Heylyn <hi>might Preach what they would against</hi> Popery, <hi>but they should never believe them to be any thing the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sse</hi> Papists <hi>for all that.</hi> A censure of a very strange nature, and so little savoring of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that I believe it is not easie to be parrallel'd in the worst of times. But from the <hi>envie, hatred, malice, and uncharitablenesse</hi> of such kind of men, no lesse then from <hi>plague, pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and famine,</hi> good Lord deliver us.</p>
            <p>I could add much more not much short of this, did I love to rub up these old sores, as indeed I do not: the clamour not being made lesse, if it went not higher in the sitting of the late long <hi>Parliament</hi>; though no complaint or information was made against me; or if it were, was thought considerable enough to be enquired into, or took notice of. Nor indeed had I said thus much but in compliance to the grave counsell of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> whose saying it was, <hi>In suspicione hareseos se nolle quenquam fore patientem</hi>; that for a man to keep silence when accused of <hi>Heresie,</hi> was a <hi>selfe-conviction.</hi> And yet I cannot choose but note the great and unprofitable paines, which hath been taken by the Author of that <hi>Voluminous nothing,</hi> entituled <hi>Canterburies Doom,</hi> to finde me guilty of some points of supposed <hi>Popery</hi>: only because in some particulars not determined by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I had adhered unto the words and <hi>tendries</hi> of the Antient Fathers; or bound my self in matters publickly resolved on, to vindicate this Church to her <hi>genuine</hi> tenents. And to say truth, the least endevour of this kinde was cause enough for any <hi>clamor</hi> or <hi>reproches</hi> which the tongues and pens of those <hi>bitter</hi> men could impose on them who did not stand as strongly in defence of <hi>Out-landish</hi> fancies, as of the true and natural doctrines of the Church their mother. Witnesse the fearfull outcry made against B. <hi>Bilson</hi> for preaching otherwise of <hi>Christs descending into hell</hi>; and the great <hi>hubbub</hi> raised against <hi>Peter Baro</hi> for writing otherwise in the points of <hi>Predestination,</hi> then had been taught by some of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Doctors; though neither the one had Preached, nor the other Printed, but what was consonant to the Doctrine of approved Antiquity, and to the true intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the book of <hi>Articles</hi> here by Law established. <hi>Private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> especially if countenanced by some eminent name, were looked on as the <hi>publick Resolutions</hi> of the <hi>Anglican</hi> Church, and the poor Church condemned for teaching those opinions, which by the artifice of some men had been fastened on her. So that it was not without some ground that the Archbishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> being gone from hence, did upbraid this Church in his <hi>Consilium redeundi,</hi> for taking into her confession (which he acknowledges of its self to be sound and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable) <hi>multa Calvini &amp; Lutheri dogmata,</hi> many strange Doctrines broached by <hi>Luther,</hi> and held forth by <hi>Calvin.</hi> To which when Dr. <hi>Crackanthorp</hi> was commanded to make an <hi>Answer,</hi> he thought it neither safe nor seasonable to deny the charge, or plead <hi>not guilty</hi> to the bill: and therefore though he called his book <hi>Defensio Ecclesiae Anglicanae,</hi> yet he chose rather to defend those <hi>Dogmata</hi> which had been charged upon this Church in the Bishops Pamphlet; then
<pb facs="tcp:59300:6"/>
to <hi>assert</hi> this Church to her <hi>genuine</hi> Doctrines. They that went other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to work were like to speed no better in it, or otherwise requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their honest zeal, then to be presently exposed to the <hi>publick envie,</hi> and made the common subject of reproach and danger. So that I must needs look upon it as a <hi>bold attempt</hi> (though a most <hi>necessary</hi> piece of service) as the times then were, in B. <hi>Montague</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> in his answer to the <hi>Popish Gagger</hi> and the two <hi>Appellants</hi> to lay the saddle on the right horse, as the saying is, I mean to sever or discriminate the <hi>opinions</hi> of particular men from the received and authorized Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; to leave the one to be maintained by their private <hi>fautors,</hi> and only to defend and maintain the other. And certainly had he not been a man of a mighty spirit, and one that easily could contemne the cries and clamors which were raised against him for so doing, he could not but have sunk remedilesly under the burden of disgrace, and the feares of ruin, which that performance drew upon him. To such an <hi>absolute authority</hi> were the names and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of some men advanced by their diligent followers, that not to yeeld obedience to their <hi>Ipse dixits,</hi> was a crime unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable.</p>
            <p>It is true, King <hi>Iames</hi> observed the <hi>inconvenience,</hi> and prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a <hi>remedy,</hi> sending <hi>instructions</hi> to the <hi>Universities</hi> bearing date <hi>Ian.</hi> 18. <hi>Ann.</hi> 1616. (which was eight years or thereabout, before the coming out of the Bishops <hi>Gag</hi>) wherein it was directed amongst other things, that <hi>young students in Divinity should be excited to study such books as were most agreable in doctrine and discipline too the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and to bestow their time in the Fathers and Councels, Schoolmen, Histories and Controversies, and not to insist to long upon</hi> Compendiums <hi>and Abbreviators, making them the grounds of their study.</hi> And I conceive that from that time forwards the names and reputations of some leading men of the <hi>forain Churches,</hi> which till then carryed all before them, did begin to lessen: <hi>Divines</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every day more willing to free themselves from that servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and <hi>Vassalage,</hi> to which the authority of those names had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved their judgements: But so, that no man had the <hi>courage</hi> to make such a <hi>general assault</hi> against the late received opinions as the Bishop did; though many when the ice was broken, followed gladly after him. About those times it was, that I began my studies in <hi>Divinity,</hi> and thought no course so proper and expedient for me, as the <hi>way</hi> commended by King <hi>Iames,</hi> and opened at the <hi>charges</hi> of B. <hi>Montague,</hi> though not then a Bishop. For though I had a good respect both to the memory of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the name of <hi>Calvin</hi>; as those whose writings had awakened all these parts of <hi>Europe</hi> out of the ignorance and superstition under which they suffered; yet I alwayes took them to be men: Men as obnoxious unto error, as subject unto humane frailty, and as indulgent too to their own opinions, as any others what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. The little knowledge I had gained in the course of <hi>Stories,</hi> had preacquainted me with the <hi>fiery spirit</hi> of the one, and the <hi>busie</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59300:6"/>
humour of the other: thought thereupon unfit by Archbishop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and others the chief <hi>agents</hi> in the <hi>reformation</hi> of this Church, to be employed as instruments in that weighty businesse. Nor was I ignorant how much they differed from us in their <hi>Doctrinals</hi> and <hi>formes</hi> of Government. And I was apt enough to thinke, that they were no fit <hi>guides</hi> to direct my judgement, in order to the <hi>Discipline and Doctrine of the</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi>; to the establishing whereof they were held unusefull: and who both by their <hi>practises,</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> had declared themselves to be friends to neither. Yet give me leave to say withall, that I was never master of so little manners, as to speak reproachfully of either; or to detract from those just honours which they had acquired: though it hath pleased the <hi>namelesse</hi> Author of the <hi>reply</hi> to my Lord of <hi>Canterburies</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Book against <hi>Fisher</hi> the <hi>Iesuit,</hi> to tax me for giving unto <hi>Calvin</hi> in a book licenced by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority the opprobrious name of <hi>schismaticall Heretick.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 350.</note> Had he told either the parties name by whom it was licenced, or named the Book it self in which those ill words escaped me; I must have been necessitated to disprove, or confesse the action. But being as it is, a bare denyall is enough for a groundlesse slander. And so I leave my <hi>namelesse Author</hi> (a <hi>Scot</hi> as I have been informed) with these words of <hi>Cicero, Quid minus est non dico Oratoris sed hominis, quam id objicere Adversario, quod si ille verbo negabit, longius progredi non possis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pardon me Reader I beseech thee, for laying my naked soul before thee, for taking this present opportunity to acquit my self from those imputations which the uncharitablenesse of some men had aspersed me with. I have long suffered under the reproaches of the <hi>publick Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleters</hi>; not only charged with <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Heterodoxies</hi> in the point of <hi>faith,</hi> but also (as thou seest) with <hi>incivilities</hi> in point of <hi>manners</hi>; and I was much disquieted and perplexed in minde till I had given the world in thee, a <hi>verball satisfaction</hi> at the least to these <hi>verball Calumnies.</hi> How far I am <hi>really</hi> free from these <hi>criminations,</hi> I hope this following work will shew thee. So will the <hi>Sermons</hi> on the <hi>Tears,</hi> preached in a time when the inclinations unto <hi>Popery</hi> were thought (but falsely thought) to be most predominant both in <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi>; if ever I shall be perswaded to present them to the open view. In the mean time take here such testimonies both of my <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxie</hi> and <hi>Candour,</hi> as this work affords thee. In which I have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly pretermitted no just occasion of vindicating the Antient and <hi>Apostolical</hi> Religion, established and maintained in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> against Opponents of all sorts; without respect to private persons, or particular Churches. And as old <hi>Pacian</hi> used to say, <hi>Christianus mihi nomen est,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pacian in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blioth. Patr.</hi>

               <hi>Catholicus cognomen</hi>; so I desire it may be also said of me, that <hi>Christian</hi> is my name, and <hi>Catholick</hi> my sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name. A <hi>Catholick</hi> in that sense I am, and shall desire by Gods grace to be alwayes such a true <hi>English Catholick.</hi> And <hi>English Catholick</hi> I am sure is as good in <hi>Grammar,</hi> and far more proper in the right meaning of the word, then that of <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> is, or can be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
<pb facs="tcp:59300:7"/>
in any of the <hi>Popish</hi> party. And as an <hi>English Catholick</hi> I have kept my selfe unto the <hi>Doctrines, Rites,</hi> and formes of <hi>Government</hi> established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it was <hi>constituted</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the best Authority which the Laws could give it, when I began to set my self to this imployment, and had brought it in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> manner to a full conclusion. And though some alterations have since happened in the face of this Church, and those so great, as make no small matter of astonishment to the <hi>Christian</hi> world, yet being there is no establishment of any other <hi>Doctrine, Discipline,</hi> or <hi>new forme</hi> of Government, and that God knows how soon the <hi>prudence</hi> of this <hi>State</hi> may think it fitting (if not necessary) to revive the <hi>old</hi>; I look upon it now as in the same condition and constitution in which it shined and flourished with the greatest beauty, that any <hi>National</hi> Church in <hi>Christendome</hi> could justly boast of. In all such points (which come within the compasse of this discourse) wherein the Church hath <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> declared her judgement, I keep my self to her <hi>determinations</hi> and <hi>decisions,</hi> according to the <hi>literal</hi> sense and <hi>Grammatical meaning of the words</hi> (as was required in the <hi>Declaration</hi> to the book of Articles) <hi>not putting my own sense upon them, nor drawing them aside</hi> to propagate and defend any <hi>foraine Doctrines,</hi> by what great name soever proposed and countenanced. But in such points as come before me, in which I finde that the <hi>Church</hi> hath not <hi>publickly</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I shall conceive my self to be left at <hi>liberty</hi> to follow the <hi>dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of my own <hi>genius,</hi> but so that I shall <hi>regulate</hi> that liberty by the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Church, and the unanimous consent of the Antient <hi>Fathers</hi>; though in so doing I shall differ from many of the common and received opinions, which are now on foot. For why should I deny my self that <hi>liberty</hi> which the times allow me, in which not only <hi>Libertas opinandi,</hi> but <hi>Libertas prophetandi,</hi> (the <hi>liberty of Prophecying</hi> tis I mean) hath found so many advocates and so much indulgence? <hi>Common opinions</hi> many times are but <hi>common errors,</hi> and we may truely say of them as <hi>Calderinas</hi> did (in <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi>) when he went to Masse,<note place="margin">

            <p>As for the <hi>book</hi> which is now before thee, I must confesse that there was nothing lesse in my first intention then to write a <hi>Comment on the Creed</hi>: my purpose being only to informe my self in that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which concernes <hi>Christs sufferings,</hi> especially his <hi>descending into

hell</hi>: a question at that time very hotly agitated. For having gotten the late Kings leave to retire to <hi>Winchester</hi> about the beginning of <hi>May, An.</hi> 1645. I met there with the learned and laborious work of B. <hi>Bilsons,</hi> entituled, <hi>A Survey of Christs suffering for mans redemption,</hi> &amp;c. which finding very copious and intermixed with many things not pertinent to the present subject (though otherwise of great use and judgement) I was resolved to extract out of it all such proofs and arguments as concerned the <hi>locall descent of Christ into hell,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o reduce them to a clearer Method, and to add to them such conceptions and considerations which my own reading with the help of some other books could supply me with. Which having finished, and finding many things interspersed in the Bishops book touching the sufferings of Christ; I thought it not amisse to collect out of him whatsoever did concerne that argument, in the same manner as before: and then to add to it such considerations and discourses upon the <hi>crucifixion, death</hi> and <hi>burial</hi> of our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> as might make the story of his <hi>Passion</hi> from the beginning of his <hi>sufferings under Pontius Pilate</hi> to his victorious triumph over <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate and perfect. And then considering with my self, that not that <hi>Article</hi> alone of Christs descending into hell, but the <hi>authority</hi> of the whole <hi>Creed</hi> had been lately quarrelled; (the opinion that it was not written by the holy <hi>Apostles</hi> being more openly maintained and more indulgently approved of, then I could imagine) I thought it of as great importance to vindicate the whole <hi>Creed,</hi> as assert one part; and then, and not till then did I first entertain the thoughts of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole worke to that forme and order, in which now thou feest it. For though I knew it was an Argument much vexed, and that many <hi>Commentaries</hi> and <hi>Expositions</hi> had been writ upon it; yet I conceived, that I was able, by interweaving some <hi>Polemical</hi> Disputes, and <hi>Philological</hi> Discourses, to give it somewhat more then a new <hi>dresse</hi> only; and that what other censure soever might be laid upon it, that of <hi>Nil dictum est quod non dictum fuit prius,</hi> should finde no place here. But I had scarce gone through with the <hi>general Preface,</hi> when the surrounding of <hi>Winchester</hi> by the forces of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> made me leave that City; and with that City, the thoughts and <hi>opportunities</hi> of proceeding forwards; save that I made some entry on the <hi>first Article,</hi> at a private friends house in a Parish of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> where I found some few <hi>tooles</hi> to begin the work with. The miserable condition of the King my most gracious Master, the impendent ruine of the Church my most pretious Mother, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setledness of my own affaires, and the dangers which every way did seem to threaten me, were a sufficient <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to all matter of study; even in the University it self (to which I was again returned not without some difficulties): where the war began to look more terrible, then it had done formerly.

            <p>I am now drawing towards an end (good Reader) and shall only tell thee, that I had entertained a <hi>Project</hi> of an higher nature, such as hath not been ventured on (for ought I can learne) by any other whosoever: which if God had pleased to continue me in those abilities of minde and body, which he hath formerly vouchsafed me, would more conduce to the advancement of good letters, then any or all the rest of my undertakings. But I have found of late (God helpe me) such great and sensible decay of sight, that I may say too truely in the <hi>wisemans</hi> words, <hi>Tenebrescunt videntes per foramina, &amp; claudunt ostia in platea</hi>; that is to say, <hi>those that look out of the window be darkned, and the doors are shut in the streets,</hi> as our <hi>English</hi> reads it. And for my part, I never had the facultie (as some men have) of studying by another mans eyes, or turning over my books by anothers hand; but have been fain to work out my performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by my proper strength without the least help or co-operation to assist me in them. If by thy prayers for good successe on such <hi>Physical</hi> means, as I submit my self unto, it shall please God to make my sight so usefull to me as to inable me to goe through with the undertakings, I shall with joy and cheerfulnesse imploy the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my time to compleat that work, which I have digested in my thoughts: but so that it lies still within me, like an unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and unperfect <hi>Embryo</hi> in the Mothers womb: the <hi>children</hi> being <hi>come to the birth</hi> but <hi>wanting strength</hi> to be delivered. In the mean time, I render all humble and hearty thankes to the Lord my God, for giving me such a measure of his holy assistance, as to bring this work to a conclusion: which if it may redound to his glory, the benefit of this Church, and thy particular contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is all I aime at: And that thou mayest receive herein the more full contentment, I have drawn up the heads and <hi>summe</hi> of all the <hi>Chapters,</hi> which I refer to thy perusall; and gathered an <hi>Errata</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>immortality</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> asserted by the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi>; denyed by some <hi>Heretical</hi> Christians, abetted and defended <hi>generally</hi> by the learned <hi>Gentiles.</hi> That the world shall have an end, and that it shall have an end by <hi>fire,</hi> proved by the old <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Philosophers.</hi> A place of <hi>everlasting</hi> rest and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse designed by the learned both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> for the <hi>souls</hi> of just and <hi>vertuous</hi> men to inhabit in; with a <hi>description</hi> of the place so by them designed. That the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and other <hi>holy men</hi> of God were nourished in the hopes of <hi>eternal life,</hi> maintained by the Church of <hi>England</hi> and by the plain Texts of holy Scripture; denyed by <hi>Servetus</hi> the whole Sect of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and by some of our great <hi>Masters</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome. Eternal life</hi> frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the <hi>new Testament,</hi> to the true <hi>believer</hi>; the severall <hi>names</hi> by which it is presented to us, and the glories of it. That the Saints shall have a full <hi>knowledge</hi> of one another, in the state of glory, proved by clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scripture. Severall estates of glory and <hi>degrees</hi> of happinesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Saints</hi>; proved by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>Fathers.</hi> The <hi>consideration</hi> of those <hi>glories</hi> of what great power and efficacy on a <hi>pious</hi> soul. <hi>Hell paines</hi> designed for the ungodly. Of <hi>Hades, Abyssus, Tartarus,</hi> and <hi>Gehenna</hi> (by which names both the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>names</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> are represented in the new Testament): and what they do amount to being laid together. That the <hi>Scriptures</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning <hi>hell fire,</hi> are <hi>literally</hi> not <hi>Metaphorically</hi> to be understood, proved by the word it self, by the authority of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the light of <hi>Reason.</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the same <hi>topicks,</hi> to prove the <hi>pains</hi> of <hi>hell</hi> to be <hi>everlasting</hi>; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the fancies of latter <hi>Hereticks.</hi> The end of all.</p>

            <p>—May believe in others. Nor doth it any way disagree with the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, or the proceedings in <hi>like cases,</hi> that it should be so; that the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of the Faith made by the sureties or <hi>sponsores</hi> (the Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers as we call them now) in the <hi>Infants</hi> name, should be accepted by the Lord to the best advantage of the <hi>Infant,</hi> for whom they <hi>stipulate.</hi> Not to the <hi>Analogie</hi> of the faith; for finde we not in the 7. Chapter of St. <hi>Luke</hi> that the <hi>Centurions sick</hi> Servant was healed by <hi>Christ</hi> of his bodily diseases, upon the <hi>faith</hi> of his Master only? And is it not expresly said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.2. that <hi>Christ</hi> pronounced the <hi>forgivenesse of sins</hi> to the <hi>sick of the Palsie,</hi> upon the <hi>faith of them that brought him</hi>? which story we finde more at large <hi>Marke</hi> 2.3. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.18. but all concentring on this truth, that it was not the faith of the <hi>sickman,</hi> but of them <hi>that brought him,</hi> which did procure the sentence of <hi>Absolution,</hi> or <hi>Remission of sins,</hi> from the hands of <hi>Christ.</hi> Not with <hi>proceedings</hi> in <hi>like cases</hi>; for by the Laws,

the <hi>Stipulation</hi> made by <hi>Sureties,</hi> or such as have the charge of <hi>Guardianship</hi> of <hi>Infants,</hi> made in their name and to their advantage, in the improvement or esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of their Estates, is taken for as good and valid, as if it had been made by himself in his <hi>riper</hi> years. And of this we have a fair example in King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the first Monarch of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who was crowned King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and received for such, upon the <hi>Oath</hi> of some Noble men, swearing and promising in <hi>his Name</hi> that he <hi>should govern that</hi> Realm <hi>and</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>according to the Laws established</hi>: which I finde urged by that King in the <hi>conference</hi> at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> in justification of the <hi>Interrogatories</hi> proposed to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> in their <hi>Baptism,</hi> and of the <hi>Answers</hi> made thereto by the mouth of their <hi>Sureties.</hi> And to say truth, there is the same reason for them both; the <hi>Infant</hi> in the one case (which is that of <hi>Baptism,</hi>) being bound in <hi>conscience</hi> to perform that, when he comes unto riper years, which his God-fathers and God-mothers did <hi>vow and promise in his Name.</hi> And in the other case (which is that of civill contract or <hi>stipulation</hi>) he is bound by <hi>law</hi> to make that good, which in his name and for his benefit and advantage his Guardians or <hi>Curators</hi> had so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.</p>

            <p>I know the age we live in hath produced some men (and those of special eminence in the wayes of learning) who seem to bid defiance unto all antiquity; and will have neither <hi>Creeds</hi> nor <hi>Fathers,</hi> no nor antient <hi>Councels,</hi> to bear a stroke in any thing which concerns Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. It is not long since that the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> hath been out of credit, as neither <hi>theirs,</hi> nor antiently received by the <hi>Christian</hi> Church in that forme we have it: but none have taken more unhappy pains in this fruitlesse quarrel, then one <hi>Downe</hi> of <hi>Devonshire. Vossius</hi> hath lately writ a book <hi>De Tribus Symbolis,</hi> wherein he hath not only derogated
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59300:23"/>
from this of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which others had quarrelled to his hand; but very unfortunately endevours to prove, that that ascribed to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and so long taken to be his by the chief lights for piety and learning in the Church of Christ, was not writ by him. Nor is he pleased with that form set forth and recommended to the Churches by the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi>; for fear there should be any obligation laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens consciences to <hi>believe</hi> otherwise then they list. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was thought till these subtiller times, that the most certain way to interpret Scripture, was by the <hi>Catholick</hi> consent and commentaries of the antient <hi>Fathers,</hi> so much renowned both in their own times and all ages since: they are now made so inconsiderable, such <hi>poor-spirited</hi> men; that truth will shortly fare the worse, because they delivered it. Our <hi>Downe,</hi> and after him one <hi>Dalie</hi> a <hi>French-man,</hi> had not else beat their brains, and consumed their time, and stretched their wits unto the utmost, to make them of no use or credit, either in points of faith or controversie, as they both have done. The next thing that we have to do, is to cry down the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Scripture also: and as we have vilifyed the <hi>Creeds, Councels,</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> to make the fairer room for our own <hi>right reason,</hi> which is both <hi>Fathers, Creeds,</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi> to our now great wits; so to reject the <hi>Scriptures</hi> also (as some do already) to make the clearer way for <hi>new revelations,</hi> which is the <hi>Paraclet,</hi> or the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> of our present <hi>Montanists.</hi> To meet with this strange pride and predominant humour, I have most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally applyed my self at this time of leasure; wherein (God help) it is not lawfull for me to attend that charge in which God had placed me, to restore this antient and <hi>Apostolick Creed</hi> to its former credit; and to expound the same, as it stands <hi>in terminis,</hi> according to the sense and meaning of those <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> writers, which have successively flowrished in the <hi>Christian</hi> world, and were the greatest ornaments of the age they lived in. For being free from <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>prepossessions,</hi> which do too often blind the eyes of the wisest men; and no way interessed in the quarrels which are now on foot, to the great disturbance of the <hi>Church</hi> and peace of <hi>Christendome</hi>: what men more fit then they to decide those <hi>Controversies</hi> which have been raised about the meaning of those <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> faith, which are comprised in it, or deduced from it? So doing, I shall satisfie my self, though I please not others: and have good cause to thanke this retreat from businesse, for giving me such opportunities to consult <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and thereby to informe my own understanding. For my part I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been one of those <hi>qui docendo discunt,</hi> who never more benefit my self then by teaching others.

<q>Our Ancestors (saith he) have delivered to us by tradition, that when <hi>fiery tongues</hi> had fallen upon all the <hi>Apostles</hi> after <hi>CHRISTS</hi> Ascension, by the coming of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> so that they could speak in several languages, and that there was no tongue so barbarous, which they understood not, they received commandement from above to travell every one into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nations, for the preaching and promulgating of the Gospell. Being therefore forthwith to depart from one another, they did agree upon a certain <hi>form of words,</hi> to be the <hi>rule</hi> and square of their future preachings, lest being separated far asunder, any the the least difference should appear amongst them in those things,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59300:24"/>
which were to be communicated unto them whom they invited to the knowledge of eternal life. <hi>Omnes igitur in uno positi, &amp; sancto Spiritu repleti, &amp;c.</hi> To this end being all together with one accord, and all filled with the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> they drew up a short <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>form,</hi> whereby to regulate their doctrine (as before was said) which they composed by casting in every one his part, (as in a common shot or reckoning) and so agreed to give it for a <hi>rule</hi> unto all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.

And to the same intent and purpose they thought it best not to commit the same to writing, but only to imprint it in the hearts of the true <hi>beleevers</hi>; (lest otherwise it might haply fall into the hands of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers) that no man might pretend to have learned it otherwise, but only <hi>ex traditione Apostolorum,</hi> from the <hi>Tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi>

               <q>That, saith he, which is called <hi>Symbolum</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> is called <hi>Collatio</hi> in the <hi>Latine,</hi> that is to say, a <hi>contribution</hi> or casting in of many things together to make up one, by reason that the sum and substance of the whole <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> is contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; <hi>every Apostle casting in his Article</hi> in this manner following.</q>
Or is it, that it was intended for a mark or <hi>character</hi> by which to know an <hi>Heretick</hi> from a true Believer? Remember what was said out of <hi>Austin</hi> formerly, that whosoever contradicted that which was there delivered, <hi>Aut haereticus, aut a Christi fide alienus</hi>

So that we have as much authority as the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church, the consent of <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the succession of all times can give us, to prove this <hi>Creed</hi> to have been writ by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> by them commended to the Churches of their several plantations, and so transmitted to our selves without interruption.

And as to the <hi>conclusion</hi> which is thence inferred, I answer that not every thing which was writ by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or by any of them, was <hi>ipso facto</hi> to be called <hi>canonical Scripture,</hi> because writ by them: but only that which they committed unto writing, by the <hi>dictamen</hi> and direction of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> with an intent that

It is objected secondly, that in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times it had not any <hi>exact forme at all,</hi> but that the <hi>Fathers</hi> varied in the repetition of the heads thereof <note n="(t)" place="margin">B <hi>Bilsons</hi> Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 664.</note>: and to this end, <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and others of the antients are brought in as witnesses; but prove no such thing. All that can be collected from those <hi>antient</hi> writers, is no more then this, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, the <hi>Fathers</hi> as learned men and great <hi>discoursers</hi> use to do, <hi>inlarge</hi> the words and syllables of the <hi>Creed,</hi> as they saw occasion, the better to deliver the true meaning of it: and sometimes they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> into fewer words the whole summe thereof, as thinking it not pertinent to the present purpose, to tie themselves unto the words. Which appears plainly by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who doth acknowledge that there was but one only <hi>Creed,</hi> or set <hi>rule of faith,</hi> affirmed by him to be <hi>unalterable</hi> and <hi>unchangeable:</hi> yet having three occasions to repeat the heads thereof, doth vary every time in the words and phrases. And yet it cannot be inferred upon these variations, that at the first, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, the <hi>Creed</hi> had no <hi>exrct forme</hi> at all, or not the same in which it is retained now in the <hi>Christian</hi> Church: no more then any man can say, that there was never any <hi>exact forme</hi> of the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> commended by that Councell to the use of the <hi>Church</hi>; because that in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and in the works of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> and St. <hi>Basil,</hi> it is presented to us with some difference of the words and phrases.

                  <hi>Perk.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Creed.</note>: and for the proof of this they instance in these two particulars, first in our Saviours <hi>descent into hell,</hi> which words they say are not to be found in all the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Scriptures; and secondly in that of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which was a word or phrase not used, till the <hi>Apostles</hi> had dispersed the Gospell over all the world. And first in answer to the first we need say but this, that though these words of <hi>Christ descended into hell,</hi> be not <hi>in terminis</hi> in the Scriptures,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59300:28"/>
yet the Doctrine is: which we shall very evidently evince and prove, when we are come unto the handling of <hi>that Article.</hi> And if we finde the doctrine in the book of God, I hope it will conclude no more against the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>antiquity</hi> of the <hi>Creed</hi> we speak of, then that the word <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousion</hi> in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> did or might do against the authority of that <hi>Creed</hi> or <hi>Symbole,</hi> because that word could not be found in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as was objected by the <hi>Arians</hi> in the former times. And for the second instance in the word <hi>Catholica,</hi> there is less ground of truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then in that before. But yet because it hath a little shew of learning, and doth pretend unto <hi>antiquity,</hi> we will take some more pains then needed, to manifest and discover the condition of it. Know then that the <hi>Apostles</hi> might bestow upon the <hi>Church</hi> the adjunct of <hi>Catholick,</hi> before they went abroad into several Countries to preach the <hi>Gospel</hi>; not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it was <hi>actually</hi> diffused over all the world, according as it hath bin since in these later Ages: but in regard that so it was <hi>potentially,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will and pleasure of their Lord and Saviour, by whom the bar was broken down which formerly had made a separation between <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and the Commission given <note n="(y)" place="margin">Mar. 16.15.</note> of <hi>Ite &amp; praedicate,</hi> to go and preach the Gospel <hi>unto every creature. Catholick</hi> is no more then <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal.</hi> The smallest smatterer in the <hi>Greek</hi> can assure us that. And <hi>universal</hi> questionless the Church was then, at least <hi>intentionaliter, &amp; potentialiter,</hi> when the <hi>Apostles</hi> knew from the Lords own mouth, that it should no longer be imprisoned within the narrow limits of the land of <hi>Iewry,</hi> but that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should be called to eternal life. Without this limitation of the word I can hardly see how the <hi>Church</hi> should be called <hi>Catholick</hi> in her largest circuit: there being many Nations, and large Dominions, which are not <hi>actually</hi> comprehended within the <hi>Pale of the Church,</hi> to this very day.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59300:29"/>
points of controversie, which principally occasioned both the <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> and the <hi>Nicene Creeds.</hi> For though I thank God I can say it with a very good conscience, that I believe the doctrine of the <hi>holy Trinity,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> of the Church of <hi>CHRIST:</hi> yet I confess with all, (such is the want and weakness of my understanding) that I am utterly unable, (as indeed who is not?) to look into the depths of so great a <hi>mystery</hi>; and cannot but cry out <gap reason="foreign">

Such lofty <hi>speculations</hi> and <hi>subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> of so high a nature, I leave to be discussed and agitated by men of larger <hi>comprehensions</hi> and more piercing judgements then I dare chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to my self: resting contented with those mediocrities, which God who gives to every one his several <hi>Talent,</hi> hath graciously vouchsafed to bestow upon me. In other points I shall make use sometimes of such <hi>explications,</hi> as the <hi>Athanasian</hi> or the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creeds do present unto me: which I shall handle rather in a <hi>Scholastical,</hi> and if occasion be presented in a <hi>Philological</hi> way also, then a way meerly <hi>Catechetical,</hi> or directly <hi>practical,</hi> wherein I see so many have took pains already: taking along the stating and debating of such points of <hi>Controversies,</hi> as either naturally do arise from the words themselves, or may be very easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from thence, on good and <hi>logical</hi> deductions. And in such points of <hi>Controversie</hi> as shall here be handled, as also in such Observations as shall be here amassed together; I chiefly shall rely on the Antient <hi>Fathers,</hi> whose reputation and <hi>authority</hi> is most precious with me: but so that I shall now and then make bold, as I see occasion, to <hi>spoyl the Egyptians</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of their choicest <hi>Iewels,</hi> for the adorning of this body of <hi>Divinity,</hi> which I had brought into the <hi>forge</hi> since my first <hi>retreat,</hi> and is now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the Anvil.

            <p>I know that <hi>Downe, Dalie,</hi> and others of great parts and wit have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to disclaim them as incompetent Judges, not to be trusted in a business of such main concernment, as the determination of the <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies</hi> in the Church of <hi>Christ</hi>; out of an high conceit of their own great worth, which is not willing to acknowledge a superiour eminence.

<q>Hitherto I have followed the order of the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> because whereas it comprehendeth shortly in few words the chief <hi>Articles</hi> of our Redemption, it may serve us for a Table, wherein we do distinctly and severally see those things that are in <hi>Christ</hi> worthy to be taken heed unto. I call it the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> not over carefully regarding who were the <hi>Authors</hi> of the same. It is verily by great consent of old Writers ascribed to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> either because they thought it was by common travail written and set out by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or for that they judged that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59300:31"/>
this <hi>Abridgement</hi> being faithfully gathered out of the doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the hands of the <hi>Apostles</hi> was worthy to be confirmed by such a Title. And I take it to be out of doubt, that from whence soever it proceeded at the first, it hath even from the first beginning of the Church, and from the very time of the <hi>Apostles</hi> been used as a publick <hi>Confession,</hi> and received by the consent of all men.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> thus defined, differeth not only from <hi>experience, knowledge,</hi> and <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> all which do come within the compass of <hi>Assents,</hi> in general; but from all other things whatsoever, which come within the compass of our belief. When we <hi>assent</hi> unto the truth of such things, or matters as are discernible by <hi>sense,</hi> we may call it <hi>perception</hi> or experience: as when a man assents to this proposition, that <hi>ice is cold,</hi> or that <hi>fire is hot,</hi> because he feels it to be so by his outward senses. If our <hi>assent</hi> be weak, unsetled, or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59300:34"/>
grounded only upon <hi>probabilities,</hi> we then call it <hi>opinion</hi>: in matters of which nature men are for the most part left at <hi>liberty,</hi> their understandings being neither convinced by the power of a <hi>superior truth,</hi> nor setled and confirmed by <hi>demonstrative</hi> proofs. This though it be an <hi>assent,</hi> is no <hi>firm assent</hi>; and therefore nothing less then <hi>Faith.</hi> If our <hi>assent</hi> be grounded on <hi>demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> proofs, and built upon the knowledge of natural causes, it is then tearmed <hi>Science,</hi> or knowledge, properly so called: for, <hi>Scire est per causas scire</hi>

St. <hi>Pauls</hi> description notwithstanding, to be <hi>a firm assent to supernatural truths revealed:</hi> which doth most fully manifest the true nature of <hi>faith,</hi> and no way crosseth that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> delivereth.

                     <p>The second was, that howsoever <hi>Credere in Deum</hi> in some texts of Scripture may possibly admit that explication which is made thereof; yet can it not be possisibly admitted in this place of the <hi>Creed.</hi> My reason is, because all <hi>Novices</hi> or <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> which were to be admitted into the Church, by the dore of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>; all children formerly baptized, which either came or were brought before the Bishop for <hi>Confirmation</hi>; were first to give an account of their <hi>faith,</hi> to make a publick profession or confession of it in the <hi>face of the Church,</hi> according to the very words and Articles of this common <hi>Creed.</hi> For which see proof sufficient in the former chapter.

                     <p>But against this there may be some objections made, which must first be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, before we come unto the further explication of this <hi>Article.</hi> For if <hi>Faith</hi> be no other then a <hi>firm assent to supernatural truths revealed</hi>; the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> (as they call them) may be said to have <hi>faith,</hi> which yet is reckoned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a peculiar gift of God unto his <hi>Elect,</hi> which is therefore called <hi>Fides electorum,</hi> or the <hi>Faith of the Elect, Tit.</hi> 1.1. 2. If to <hi>believe in God the Father Almighty,</hi> and in <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> his <hi>only Son,</hi> &amp;c. be only to believe that there is a God, and that all those things are most undoubtedly true and certain which be affirmed of <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> in the holy Scripture; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil may be reckoned for a true believer, S. <hi>Iames</hi> assuring us of this, that the <hi>Devils do believe and tremble, Iam.</hi> 2.19.

This is the sum of those objections, which I conceive most likely to be made against me; but such as may be answered without very great difficulty. For that the <hi>Reprobate</hi> (as they call them) may have <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> is evident by many instances and texts of Scripture.

The answer unto this is easie. St. <hi>Iames</hi> assures us of the <hi>Devils</hi> that they <hi>believe there is one God,</hi> but doth withall assure us this that this <hi>belief</hi> of theirs confirms them in the certainty and foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their everlasting damnation; the apprehension of the which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth nothing in them but fear and horrour. The Devils do <hi>believe that there is a God,</hi> and that this God is just in all his actions, and righteous in all his ways; unchangeable in his Decrees; <hi>Yesterday, and to day, and the same for ever.</hi> What other comfort can they reap from this <hi>faith</hi> of theirs, but that being once condemned by God to eternal fire, they <hi>are reserved in everlasting chains under darkness,</hi> to <hi>the judgement of the great and terrible day</hi>

For knowing that the judgements of the Lord are just, and his doom unchangeable; they must needs know withall the certainty of their own damnation, or else they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be affirmed to <hi>believe</hi> this truth, that <hi>there is a God.</hi> And as they do <hi>believe</hi> that there is a God, so they believe also that he is the <hi>Maker of heaven and earth.</hi> For being at the first created by Almighty God with so great perspicacity and clearness of the understanding, they could not choose but know the hand that made them, and consequently believe that he made all those things which are ascribed to God in the holy Scripture. Though by their fall, they lost the favour of the Lord, their first estate in which they were created by Almighty God, the grace by which they stood, and the glories which they did possess: yet lost they not that quickness and agility of motion, that perspicacity and clearness of the understanding, wherewith they were endowed by God at their first Creation. But what makes this unto their comfort, when the same know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or <hi>belief</hi> (call it which you will) by which they are assured that God made the Heavens and the Earth, and all the things therein contained; will keep them always in remembrance of this most sad truth, that he also made an <hi>Hell of fire,</hi> where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, <hi>prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and his Angels</hi>

Because they knew full well, no mere Creature better, that <hi>CHRIST took not on him the nature of</hi> Angels, <hi>but that he took on him the seed of</hi> Abraham <note n="(n)" place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note>. And if he took not on him the nature of <hi>Angels,</hi> as they knew he did not, he could not be a <hi>Mediator</hi> between them and God: and if no <hi>Mediator</hi> between them and God, they have no interest in his <hi>merits,</hi> nor can claim any profit by his death and passion; but must continue in that state wherein God hath plunged them for their sins, without hope of remedy. The Devils then <hi>believe,</hi> but withall they <hi>tremble</hi>; and good reason for it: that <hi>belief</hi> making them assured that their case is desperate, and that there is no mercy for them in Gods <hi>heavenly Treasury</hi>: Besides, admit the <hi>Devil</hi> did <hi>believe</hi> all those sacred truths, which are affirmed of <hi>CHRIST</hi> in the Book of God; what will this avail them? For must they not then <hi>believe</hi> this truth amongst the rest, that <hi>without true repentance there can be no entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>? and if they do believe that truth, must they not conclude, that there can be no place for them in the heavenly glories, because the dore of <hi>repentance</hi> is shut against them, and that the <hi>Baptism</hi> of Repentance is a way to Heaven, whereof their nature is not capable?

                           <hi>To believe in God</hi> hath gone currant so long for so much as to <hi>put trust or confidence in him,</hi> that now to make it go for less will perhaps be an usurpation of authority more then <hi>critical,</hi> and much greater then befits us. Notwithstanding if on Gods behalf we may plead what Lawyers do in cases of the Crown, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> that the Antient of days may not be prejudiced by antiquity of custom or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, especially whose Orignal is erroneous; the case is clear, That <hi>to believe in God</hi> in their intention, who first composed this <hi>Creed,</hi> is no more then to believe <hi>there is a God,</hi> or to give credence to his <hi>Word.</hi> For justifying this Assertion, I must appeal from the <hi>English Dialect</hi> in which the manner of speech is proper and natural, if it were consonant unto the meaning of the Original: as also from the <hi>Latine</hi> in which the <hi>phrase</hi> being forain and uncouth, is to be valued by the <hi>Greek,</hi> whose stamp and character it heareth.

Or if besides the evident Records of the antient Copies personal witnesses be required amongst the Antients, I know few, amongst Modern Writers none more competent, then those that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly for us, as <hi>Beza, Mercer, Drusius,</hi> unto whom we may adde <hi>Ribera</hi> &amp; <hi>Lorinus</hi> also. Now as to use the benefit of a truth known and testified is always lawful; so to us in this case it is most expedient, almost necessary. For either I did not rightly apprehend whilest I read it, or at least now remember not how the <hi>Schoolman</hi> removes the stumbling block, which he had placed in the very entry to this <hi>Creed.</hi> [If to <hi>believe in God,</hi> be as much as to <hi>put trust or confidence in him,</hi> by exacting a profession of this <hi>Creed</hi> at all mens mouths, we shall inforce a great many to profess a ly.] For of such as not only out of ordinary charity, but upon particular probabilities, we may safely <hi>acquit</hi> from actual <hi>Atheism,</hi> or contradicting infidelity, a great number do not put their trust or confidence in God; this being the mark at which the <hi>belief</hi> of <hi>Novices</hi> must aim, not the first step they are to make in this progress.</q>
And not long after he makes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer unto this Objection, touching the <hi>belief</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> or of wicked Angels: of whom we cannot say (say some) that they do <hi>believe in God,</hi> though they believe his being more firmly then we can do, and know his Word as clearly. For as he handsomely illustrates;
<q>If the Kings Majesty should proclaim a general pardon to a number of known <hi>Rebels,</hi> and vow execution of judgement without mercy upon some principal offenders, which had maliciously and cunningly seduced their simplicity: I suppose his will and pleasure equally manifested unto both, and so believed, would as much dishearten the one, as incourage the other to relye upon his clemency. Such notwithstanding altogether is the case between <hi>men</hi> and wicked <hi>angels.</hi> The one believes <hi>CHRIST</hi> took the <hi>Womans seed,</hi> and therefore cannot without such wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mistrust of the promise of life, as was in his first Parents to Gods threats of death, despair of Redemption by the eternal Sacrifice. The other as firmly believe, or rather evidently know, that <hi>CHRIST</hi> in no wise <hi>took the Angelical</hi> nature; and without this ground the better they believe his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> the less are their hopes of their own <hi>Redemption.</hi>

                     <p>As for the third and last Objection touching the overthrow of the distinction of Faith, into <hi>Historical, Temporary,</hi> saving or <hi>justifying</hi> faith, and the <hi>faith of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> so generally <hi>received and countenanced</hi> in the <hi>Protestant</hi> Schools; it works no

effect at all in me: who am resolved not to hazard the loss of a <hi>truth,</hi> to save the credit of a <hi>distinction.</hi> Nor are the <hi>membra dividentia,</hi> as <hi>Logicians</hi> call them, so well choyced and stated, as either to require such care of their preservation, or not to bring them into question. For all <hi>faith</hi> is <hi>Historical,</hi> there's no doubt of that; and the other members of the distinction either are coincident, or but degrees only of the same one <hi>faith. Vrsinus,</hi> the Divinity Reader in <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> though he both useth &amp; approveth this distinction, yet to my seeming, takes not the tearms to be so different as the members of a good Division ought to be by the rules of <hi>Logick</hi>; and indeed so confounds them one with another, that we can hardly see where the difference lyeth. For he confesseth in plain tearms, <note n="(p)" place="margin">

<q>That our Faith is not to be counted unsound or <hi>non salvifical,</hi> because <hi>Historical,</hi> but rather oft-times therefore insufficient to some because not so fully <hi>Historical</hi> as it might be; or in that our apprehension of divers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters related in Sacred stories is not so great, so lively and sound, as to equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the utmost limits of some <hi>belief,</hi> which yet may be fully comprehended under <hi>Historical assent:</hi> there being no assent which can exceed the measure of that <hi>belief</hi> or <hi>credence</hi> which is due unto sacred Writers. Which if it be on our parts as it ought to be, to Gods general promises, it will more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly, more truly and naturally apply them to us in particular, then we our selves can possibly do, by beginning our <hi>faith</hi> at that particular application where indeed it must end.</q>
For <hi>temporary faith</hi> they define that next, <note n="(s)" place="margin">

Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech. part.</hi> 2. <hi>qu.</hi> 21.. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</note> to be an <hi>Assent unto the Doctrine</hi> of the Gospel <hi>accompanyed with joy and gladness, and the outward profession of the same, but such as lasteth but for a season, and fades in time of persecution and affliction.</hi> And this they ground upon that passage in our Saviours <hi>parable,</hi> where it is said, <note n="(t)" place="margin">Matth. 13.20, 21.</note> that <hi>He which receiveth the seed in stony places, the same is he that receiveth the Word, and anon with joy receiveth it; yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a season: For when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the Word, by and by he is offended.</hi> But for my part I could never see any reason to perswade me yet, that our Saviour in that <hi>Parable</hi> did purpose to represent unto our view the several kindes of <hi>Believers,</hi> but the several kindes of <hi>hearers</hi> only; many of which do <hi>hear the Word</hi> with divers ends and different purposes, but only they which do so <hi>hear</hi> the Word of God, as to bring forth the <hi>fruit of good living,</hi> shall like the <hi>good grain</hi> in the following <hi>Parable,</hi> be laid up at the last day in <hi>the barn</hi> of the Heavenly husbandman. Or granting that they build this definition on a ground well laid, yet I see nothing to the contrary, but that the <hi>temporary faith</hi> which is there defined may be a true and lively faith, and justifie the man that hath it in the sight of God; though failing in the course of his <hi>Christian race,</hi> he do not get the <hi>prize</hi> proposed unto them that <hi>win,</hi> and hold out to the very end. A <hi>temporary faith</hi> may justifie for the present time, and bring forth many fruits of holiness and newness of life; but it is faith with <hi>perseverance</hi> in the works of Piety, which shall receive the <hi>Crown</hi> in the day of Judgement. And if this <hi>Temporary faith</hi> be not <hi>saving</hi> also, it is not in regard of it self, that it wants any of those signs and tokens by which a <hi>saving faith</hi> is to be discerned; but that the man that is endued or invested with it, hath not

the gift of <hi>perseverance,</hi> but out of worldly fear, or on by-respects makes <hi>ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of his faith,</hi> or casts it over-board in the storm as a thing unprofitable. So that the difference between <hi>Temporary</hi> and <hi>Salvifical</hi> faith, is not in any thing <hi>essential</hi> to the true nature of <hi>faith</hi>; but only in duration, which is <hi>accidental,</hi> and extrinsical: which make it no more a distinct <hi>species</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> or to fall short in any thing which <hi>true faith</hi> should have, then that a man who dyeth in the flower of his youth, wants any thing of being as compleat and perfect a man, as he that lives unto the age of <hi>Methusalem.</hi> That <hi>magis &amp; minus</hi> do not <hi>differre specie,</hi> is an old rule in <hi>Logick.</hi> And so <hi>Bucanus</hi> doth conclude to the point in hand, though as professed and rigid a <hi>Calvinian</hi> as any other whatsoever, affirming plainly <note n="(u)" place="margin">

For <hi>CHRIST</hi> our Saviour reckoneth it as the <hi>effect</hi> of a powerful <hi>faith,</hi> saying to his Disciples, when they seemed to complain, because they could not cast the <hi>Devil</hi> out of a man who was brought before them <note n="(y)" place="margin">Mat. 17.20.</note>, that it was <hi>propter incredulitatem ipsorum,</hi> by reason of their <hi>unbelief,</hi> as our <hi>English</hi> reads it, that it to say, because their <hi>faith</hi> was yet but weak and newly planted, not strong nor spiritful enough to effect such wonders. And the <hi>Apostle</hi> reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning up those gifts and graces of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> which God bestowed upon his Church in her first plantations, gives us this punctual list or catalogue of them, saying, that <hi>unto one is given by the</hi> Spirit the <hi>Word of Wisdom,</hi> to <hi>another the Word of knowledge by the same</hi> Spirit; to <hi>another is given</hi> Faith <hi>by the same</hi> Spirit; to <hi>another the gift of healing by the same</hi> Spirit <note n="(z)" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.8, 9, 10.</note>; to <hi>another</hi> power to do miracles; to <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prophecy</hi>; to <hi>another the discerning of</hi> spirits; to <hi>another diverse kindes of tongues,</hi> &amp;c. Where plainly <hi>Faith,</hi> the gift of healing, Prophecying, and the <hi>power of working Miracles,</hi> are counted for distinct graces of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>; by consequence, <hi>the power of working Miracles</hi> is no <hi>species</hi> of faith, but rather something extraordinary super-added to it as before I said. So that we need not stand so much upon this distinction, as in regard thereof to recede from the Exposition before delivered, wherein it was affirmed that <hi>in Deum credere,</hi> to believe in God, is only to <hi>believe</hi> that <hi>there is one Immortal</hi> and Eternal Spirit, of great both Majesty and Power, which we call <hi>GOD</hi>: and that this God is the <hi>Father Almighty,</hi> who as he made all things by his mighty power, so he doth still preserve them by his divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and preserve them by his infinite wisdome. And this Interpretation of the phrase <hi>in Deum credere,</hi> or <hi>in Christum credere,</hi> doth hold best correspondence with the definition of <hi>faith</hi> before laid down. For if <hi>Faith</hi> be no other then a <hi>firm assent to supernatural truths revealed:</hi> then to include no more in these forms of speech, then that there is a God, an Almighty God the maker of all things, and that his only Son <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> our Lord both did and suffered all these things which are affirmed of him in the holy Scriptures, and briefly laid together in the present <hi>Creed</hi>; must needs be most agreeable to the nature of <hi>faith</hi>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>Heaven</hi> it self, of what a vast circumference, and how swiftly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, bespangled in the night with stars, illustrated in the day time with the beams of the Sun; and thou mayst know by that, the wonderful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine disposure of its Supreme Governour. Observe the <hi>year,</hi> how it ends the circular motion of the Sun; the moneth distinguished by the increase and wane of the Moon; the mutual succession of light and darkness, that rest and labour may by turns succeed one another. Let us relinquish to <hi>Astronomers</hi> a more exact discourse of the Stars and Planets; whether they serve to direct the course of Navigation, or usher in the seasons of seed and harvest: which as they were not made, created, nor disposed of, without a Supreme Workman of most perfect wisdome, so could they not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and made intelligible, but by great art and understanding.

Besides how great an argument is it of an <hi>heavenly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> to interpose the temperament of the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumn,</hi> lest if it were all <hi>Winter</hi> it should freeze us with cold; or if it were all <hi>Summer,</hi> it should scorch us with heat, that so one part of the year might fall into the other, without producing any sensible or dangerous alteration in the state of things? Behold the <hi>Sea,</hi> how it is bounded with the shore, which it may not pass: the <hi>Earth,</hi> how it is fructified with trees which it self produceth: the <hi>Ocean,</hi> how it is divided between ebbs and flouds; the <hi>Fountains,</hi> how they flow with continual streams; the <hi>Rivers,</hi> how they pass away with perpetual waters. What need I speak of the perpendicular height of Mountains; or the declivities of the hils, or the extension of the fields? What need we speak of that variety of weapons, wherewith brute beasts are armed for their own defence; some fortified with horns, others palisadoed with teeth; some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with hoofs, some provided of stings; and others having means to preserve themselves either by the nimbleness of their feet, or the help of their wings? Especially consider the comeliness and beauty of our own <hi>bodies,</hi> made of an upright structure, an erected countenance, the eyes advanced as <hi>Sentinels</hi> in the Keep or <hi>Watch-tower,</hi> and all the rest of the senses placed in the Fort or <hi>Capital</hi>: and will not that acknowledge <hi>GOD</hi> for its sole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer?

And which is yet more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful then all the rest, though there be the same structure of all, yet hath every man his several and proper lineaments, by which though we are all alike, yet are we also so unlike as to be easily discerned from one another. The manner of our birth, and the desire of procreation, is it not given by <hi>GOD</hi> alone? That the <hi>dugs</hi> spring with milk when the Babe doth ripen, and that the Infant groweth up by that milky dew, proceeds it not from the same Author?

Look also how it is in the <hi>Oeconomie</hi> of Nature, one King amongst the Bees, one Supreme Captain over the flock, and in the heards of Cattel one more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Ruler. And canst thou think the Government of that Heavenly Monarchy can be dismembred or divided? It being so manifest and apparent that God, who is the Father of all things, hath neither beginning nor ending; that to all creatures giveth a beeing, to himself <hi>Eternity</hi>; who was a <hi>world</hi> unto himself when no World was made, and by his Word commandeth, by his wisdom disposeth, by his virtue protecteth, what thing soever is to be found in the whole World. This <hi>GOD</hi> we cannot <hi>see,</hi> he is too bright for our eyes; nor <hi>touch,</hi> he is too pure for our unclean hands; nor <hi>apprehend,</hi> he is above the reach of our understanding; being infinite, incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and known how great he is to himself alone. Shall I speak freely what I think? He that conceiveth that he can comprehend the Majesty of God, doth under value him, and he who would not undervalue him, must profess he cannot comprehend him. Nor need we be inquisitive to know his name, his name is <hi>GOD</hi>: there being no use of proper names, but where a multitude is to be distinguished by their particular appellations. <hi>GOD</hi> therefore being but one, hath no name but <hi>GOD.</hi> And to this truth I have the general consent of all men. For when the common people lift their hands to Heaven, they then make mention but of <hi>one God</hi> only; using to say, (as their occasions do require) that <hi>God is great,</hi> and that <hi>God is true,</hi> and if <hi>God permit.</hi> Which whether it be the natural expression of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, or the <hi>Confession</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> saying his <hi>Belief,</hi> it is hard to guesse.</q>

                     <p>Hitherto have we traced the footsteps of the antient <hi>Poets,</hi> and all the several sects of the old <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and found a general consent amongst them that there is a <hi>GOD,</hi> and that there is but <hi>one God,</hi> who takes care of all things:

Whom, if they call sometimes by the name of <hi>Fate</hi> or <hi>Providence,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> as sometimes they do, we must still understand them of that <hi>one God</hi> in whom we <hi>Christians</hi> do profess that we do believe.

the mysterie of <hi>water and the Spirit</hi> being more sublime, then to be understood by the sons of men. <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> and after him <hi>Apolloniates Diogenes</hi> make him to be the <hi>Air,</hi> because both <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>immensurable. Anaxagoras</hi> his opinion was, that <hi>GOD</hi> was an <hi>infinite understanding; Pythagoras,</hi> that he was that <hi>Soul,</hi> which <hi>dwelling in the whole frame of</hi> Nature, <hi>did give life</hi> to all things. <hi>Xenophanes</hi> did use to say, that <hi>every infinite with understanding,</hi> might be called <hi>GOD. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisthenes,</hi> that there were <hi>many popular Gods,</hi> and but <hi>one natural one,</hi> or <hi>one God</hi> of Nature; <hi>Speusippus,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> was that <hi>natural and animal power,</hi> by which all things are governed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Democritus,</hi> though the first inventor of that absurd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the <hi>World</hi> was made of several <hi>Atoms,</hi> joyned by chance together; yet for the most part he puts <hi>Nature</hi> in the place of <hi>GOD,</hi> as also did <hi>Straton</hi> and the <hi>Epicureans:</hi> And <hi>Aristotle</hi> though inconstant and of many mindes, yet other whiles he makes him be that <hi>Soul or understanding</hi> which presides over the World. <hi>Heraclides Ponticus</hi> will have him also to be a <hi>Divine soul or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>; and thereunto inclined <hi>Theophrastus, Cleanthes, Zeno,</hi> and <hi>Chrysippus</hi>; save that they sometimes call him by the name of <hi>Fate.

And <hi>Plato</hi> finally not only doth affirm of God, that he is the <hi>Parent of the World,</hi> the Maker of all <hi>Celestial</hi> and <hi>Terrestrial</hi> creatures; but by reason of his eminent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible power, it was a difficult thing to finde what he was, and having found it an impossible matter to express it rightly. And of all these <hi>Minutius</hi> noteth, that they are <hi>Eadem fere quae nostra,</hi> the same almost with that which was affirmed of <hi>GOD</hi> in the schools of <hi>CHRIST</hi>: Insomuch, saith he, that one might very justly think, that the modern <hi>Christians were Philosophers,</hi> or <hi>that the old Philosophers had indeed been</hi> Christians. <hi>Lactantius</hi> also doth affirm that they did vail the same truth under divers notions; and that whether they called him <hi>Nature, Reason, Vnderstanding, Fatal necessity,</hi> the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> or in what phrase soever they did use to speak him; <hi>idem est quod anobis</hi> Deus <hi>dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>

                     <p>Nor can it but seeme strange to a knowing man, who looks with an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eye upon the antient <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and some present <hi>Christians</hi>; that either those in times of such an <hi>Epidemical</hi> and general darkness, should have so much of the <hi>Christian</hi> in them, or that they which live under the light of <hi>Christs</hi> glorious Gospel, should have so much in them of the <hi>Heathen.</hi> The learned <hi>Gentiles</hi> though they did acknowledg but one Supreme power, whom they called <hi>Deum naturalem,</hi> or the God of Nature: yet they allowed of many <hi>National</hi> and <hi>Topical Gods,</hi> as before I told you out of <hi>Varro.</hi> And finde we not that though the <hi>Pontificians</hi> publickly profess but <hi>one</hi> Soveraign <hi>God,</hi> yet the poor <hi>Christians</hi> every where in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are taught to place their confidence in more <hi>local Saints,</hi> then ever <hi>Heathen-Rome</hi> did muster of its <hi>Topical Gods?</hi> Which whether it grew upon that Church by the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of barbarous Nations; or that the late converted <hi>Paynims,</hi> before their hearts were throughly cleansed from their former <hi>leaven,</hi> did share the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and honours of the <hi>Heathen Gods</hi> amongst such <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> as they most affected, I will not take upon me to determine here.

and speaking less <hi>divinely</hi> of the things of <hi>GOD,</hi> then any of the other Sects of <hi>Philosophie.</hi> Then had he severally recourse unto the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> and the <hi>Platonist,</hi> who were most eminent in those times for the <hi>contemplative</hi> parts of learning, <gap reason="foreign">

The last we meet with in this kinde, (for still we are upon those <hi>Names</hi> or <hi>Attributes</hi> which are both <hi>absolute</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Essential</hi> to him) is that of <hi>Adonai,</hi> or <hi>my Lord.</hi> A name, as it is noted in the <hi>Mazoreth,</hi> found of it self no more then 134 times in all the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> but substituted by the Modern superstitious <hi>Iews,</hi> in the place of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> as often as they meet that word in the course of the Text.

Simplicitas,</hi> or the <hi>simple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> if we may so call it, is that whereby he is void of all <hi>composition,</hi> either of matter and forme, or parts and accidents compounding, whether they be sensible or intelligible only. For whereas all <hi>corporall</hi> substances are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> and the <hi>angelicall</hi> natures of a <hi>potentia</hi> and an <hi>actus,</hi> as the <hi>School-men</hi> phrase it: <hi>GOD</hi> being <hi>incorporeal</hi> hath no matter of forme; and being wholly <hi>existing,</hi> all at once together, must be <hi>purus actus,</hi> not having any thing <hi>in potentia,</hi> which at first he had not. For if <hi>GOD</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> there must be some pre-existent <hi>matter</hi> out of which he was made; and if he be compounded of <hi>potentia</hi> and <hi>actus,</hi> he must and may be somewhat which at first he was not: both which are so destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the nature of <hi>GOD,</hi> as being once admitted, he is <hi>God</hi> no longer. And therefore in my minde the judicious <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath very well determined of it, in these following words, <note n="(c)" place="margin">

God</hi> only is a <hi>simple</hi> uncompounded essence, in whom there is nothing <hi>in potentia,</hi> but all things <hi>in act:</hi> he being a <hi>pure act</hi> himself, and the first, intervenient, and last <hi>act</hi> of all. <hi>God</hi> then is in the first place a <hi>simple,</hi> or uncompounded <hi>essence,</hi> without parts or accidents: his <hi>attributes</hi> not differing from his <hi>essence</hi> at all, but being of his very <hi>essence,</hi> (for <hi>in Deo non est nisi Deus,</hi> as the old rule was); nor differing <hi>essentially</hi> from one another, but only in regard of our weak understanding: which being not able to know or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the earthly things by one single act, must of necessity have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny distinct acts and notions, to comprehend the nature of the <hi>incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible God.</hi> And being such a <hi>simple</hi> uncompounded <hi>essence</hi> without parts or accidents, he is both great without quantity, and good without quality, mercifull without passion, every where without motion, in heaven without a place or <hi>ubi.</hi>

                     <p>The second <hi>Attribute</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which before we spake of, is that of <hi>Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> by which <hi>God</hi> is absolutely and actually <hi>infinite</hi> in his <hi>acts</hi> and essence. And this <hi>infinite</hi> or infinitenesse, is defined to be that without which nothing is or can be. <hi>Infinitum est extra quod nihil est,</hi> said the old Philosophers: so that it is impossible for any thing to be without or besides that, before or after that, in which all possible being is comprehended. And this <hi>infinity</hi> doth branch it self into these four <hi>species,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Infinity</hi> in regard of <hi>dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which we call <hi>Eternity.</hi> 2. <hi>Infinity</hi> in regard of <hi>dimensions,</hi> which we call <hi>Immensity.</hi> 3. <hi>Infinity</hi> in regard of <hi>comprehensions,</hi> by which we say that God is of <hi>infinite wisdome,</hi> and of <hi>infinite knowledge.</hi> And last of all, <hi>Infinity</hi> in regard of <hi>power,</hi> which we call <hi>Omnipotence.</hi> And first, <hi>Infinity</hi> in regard of <hi>duration,</hi> which we call <hi>Eternity,</hi> is that attribute of the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> by which he is without beginning or end; without beginning of dayes, or end of time; without succession or precession, if I may so speak. Or else we may define it with <hi>Boetius</hi> to be the <hi>entire or totall possession of interminable life, all at once toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>: or otherwise thus, to be <hi>a circular</hi> duration, <hi>whose instants are alwayes,</hi> and <hi>whose terminations of extremities never were nor shall be,</hi> which are the words of <hi>Trismegistus</hi> with some little change.

Which two, though two distinct <hi>acts</hi> and <hi>attributes</hi> in our apprehension, yet differ not in <hi>GOD,</hi> as before was said, nor perhaps very much in themselves at all. For <hi>wisdome</hi> is but the excellency of <hi>knowledge,</hi> consisting either in the dignity or usefulnesse of the matter known, or the more perfect manner of discerning what they truely are. And of this <hi>wisdome</hi> or more usefull kind of <hi>knowledge,</hi> there are these two <hi>offices,</hi> the one stedfastly to propose a right end; the other to present a right choice of means for effecting thereof. But being it is equally consonant to Gods <hi>infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and not a whit derogatory to his <hi>infinite power,</hi> that some things should be as truely <hi>contingent,</hi> as other are really and truely <hi>necessary:</hi> therefore hath <hi>God</hi> been pleased as well to decree <hi>contingency,</hi> as to decree or fore-determine of <hi>necessity.</hi> Hereupon it will follow by good rules of <hi>Logick,</hi> that though there be an <hi>immutability</hi> in the counsails of <hi>God,</hi> arising from the <hi>infiniteness</hi> of his <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>wisdome</hi>; yet that there are some things which might not have been, and that some things are not which yet might have been, or might have been far otherwise then now they are. For neither is the <hi>prescience</hi> or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of almighty God (for by that name his <hi>infinite knowledge</hi> may be styled) the necessary and adaequate cause that things shall fall out as they do, not otherwise; but rather because things shall in time so fall out, therefore <hi>GOD fore-knowes</hi> them. Nor doth his <hi>infinite wisdome</hi> in pursuit of the <hi>means</hi> conducing to the <hi>end</hi> proposed, so fetter and intangle his most <hi>infinite power,</hi> but that he is still <hi>liberum agens,</hi> and is at liberty to produce his <hi>end</hi> by things plainly <hi>contingent,</hi> as well as by such whereon he hath imposed an everlasting <hi>necessity</hi>; or to suspend the execution of some former <hi>edict,</hi> according as he seeth just occasion for it, which <hi>liberty</hi> in the <hi>holy one</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> is an high per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For as his <hi>eternal knowledge</hi> of all things doth not make all things which he knoweth to be <hi>eternal</hi>: so neither doth the <hi>immutability</hi> of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees make every thing which he decrees to be <hi>immutable</hi>; there being many temporal and mutable things which he eternally both knew and decreed accordingly. So that for <hi>GOD</hi> to alter his proceedings with men, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they stand or fall in the acts of piety, now punishing where he lately rewarded, and presently rewarding where before he punished, argueth no <hi>mutability</hi> in the counsails of <hi>GOD,</hi> but rather an unmovable constancy to the <hi>immutable rule of justice,</hi> which being alwayes one and the same without variation, must needs afford different measure unto different deserts, and sit contrary dispositions with contrary recompences. And on the other side to make this conclusion, that because God <hi>fore-knoweth</hi> by his infinite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and by his <hi>infinite wisdome</hi> hath decreed of all things even from all <hi>eternity</hi>; therefore it is as impossible for any thing to be otherwise then it is, or otherwise then it hath been or will be hereafter, as to recall again that which is past already: were either to make <hi>GOD</hi> an impertinent <hi>agent</hi> in the continuall governance of humane affaires, or that he hath nothing else to do but to behold the issue of his former counsails. For plainly they which so

To this, the former part of this Chapter served but as a preamble, or a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry introduction to bring us to the knowledge of this part of the <hi>Article, viz.</hi> That <hi>GOD</hi> is not only a <hi>Father,</hi> but a <hi>Father Almighty</hi>: which could not otherwise have been fully cleered and made known unto us, then by a serious looking on him in his <hi>names</hi> and <hi>attributes.</hi> For finding in the name <hi>IEHOVAH</hi> that he is <hi>existing</hi> of himself, and that from him all things that are receive their <hi>being</hi>; his mighty <hi>strength</hi> in the name of <hi>El,</hi> his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>power</hi> in that of <hi>Adonai</hi> or Lord; that he is God <hi>most high</hi> in <hi>Helion,</hi> and a Judge in <hi>Elohim</hi>: and then concluding out of these, that being such, he must be of an uncompounded, and most <hi>simple</hi> essence; by consequence, eternal, and incomprehensible, of infinite knowledge to foresee, and wisdome to effect what he meaneth to do; we may from all together come to this <hi>result,</hi> that he can be no other then the <hi>Father Almighty.</hi> And this was the <hi>result</hi> which was made of old by the most learned of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>: who having made a muster of his severall <hi>Attributes,</hi> resolved all into this at last, that he was the <hi>general Father</hi> both of God and Men, the Parent of the Universe, both of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; and therefore without question an <hi>Almighty Father.

                     <p>First, <hi>GOD</hi> is said to be our <hi>Father</hi> in the right of <hi>Creation,</hi> by which as all the World, and all things in the same contained, may be called the <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of his hands</hi>; so may all <hi>mankinde</hi> be called his <hi>children</hi>: not only those which trust and <hi>believe</hi> in him, but also those which know him not, nor ever read so much of him as the <hi>Book of nature</hi>; those which yet live as out-lawes from the rule of reason, and barbarous and savage people of both the <hi>Indies.</hi> Thus <hi>Malachi,</hi> the last Prophet of the <hi>Iewes, Have we not all one</hi> Father, <hi>hath not</hi> God <hi>created us</hi>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Luke</hi> when he had made the <hi>Genealogie</hi> of our Saviour <hi>CHRIST</hi> in the way of ascent, doth conclude it thus, which <hi>was the son of</hi> Seth, <hi>which was the son of</hi> Adam, <hi>which was the Son of God</hi>

Secondly, <hi>GOD</hi> is called our <hi>Father,</hi> because he hath implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our Parents the vertue <hi>Generative,</hi> moulded and fashioned us in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret closets of the Womb. <hi>Thy hands have made me and fashioned me</hi>

But if the <hi>Father</hi> do his office, if that no <hi>care</hi> be wanting on his part to instruct his children, if he admonish and advice them when they do amiss, and they continue still to afflict his heart, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by neglecting that imployment in which he hath placed them, or wasting his estate in riotous and licentious courses: is the poor <hi>Father</hi> left without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy, then what may be had upon complaint from the <hi>Civil</hi> Magistrate?

The like we also finde in the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, The Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>is the</hi> true God, <hi>he is the</hi> living God <hi>and an everlasting King, and the Nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.

he manifested in the <hi>Method</hi> of the worlds creat on, in that he did produce what effects he pleased without the help of <hi>natural</hi> causes, in giving light unto the World before he had created the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> making the <hi>earth fruitfull,</hi> and to bring forth plants, without the motion or influence of the Heavenly bodies.

This <hi>Moses</hi> calleth <hi>principium,</hi> a <hi>beginning</hi> simple: <hi>In</hi> principio <hi>creavit Deus Coelum et Terram</hi>

So that whether we do expound those words that the <hi>Heaven and Earth had a beginning,</hi> or that <hi>Moses</hi> by those words did mean that out of that which he calleth the <hi>Heaven and the Earth</hi> as out of the <hi>beginning</hi> or <hi>first matter</hi> all things were created, it comes all to one: because it is acknowledged that that <hi>first matter</hi> was created by God, and therefore of necessity was to have a <hi>beginning.</hi> Nor doth the Scripture only tell us that the World had a <hi>beginning,</hi> but by the help of Scripture and the works of some Learned men, we are able to point out the <hi>time</hi> when it did <hi>begin,</hi> or to compute how many years it is precisely from the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, without any notable difference in the <hi>Calculation.</hi> For though it be most truly said, <hi>Citius inter Horologia quam Chronologia,</hi> that <hi>clocks</hi> may sooner be agreed then <hi>Chronologers</hi>; yet most <hi>Chronologers</hi> in this point come so near one another, that the difference is scarce observable. From the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of the World to the birth of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the account of <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> are 3928. years; 3945. in the computation of the <hi>Genevians</hi>; 3960. in the esteem of <hi>Luther</hi>; and 3963. in the calculation of <hi>Melanchthon</hi>: between whom and <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> being the least and the greatest, there is but 35. years difference; which in so long a tract of time can be no great matter. Now if unto the calculation made by <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> which I conceive to be the truest, we add 1646. since the birth of <hi>CHRIST</hi>; the totall of the time since the <hi>Worlds Creation</hi> will be 5576. years, neither more nor lesse. And to this truth that the <hi>World had a beginning</hi> whensoever it was, and was not of <hi>eternal being</hi> or a self-existency, most of the old <hi>Philosophers</hi> did consent unanimously; guided thereto by this impossibility in <hi>nature,</hi> that any visible work either <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>artificial,</hi> should either give it self a <hi>being,</hi> or have that <hi>being</hi> which it hath from no cause precedent. For from that <hi>principle, Tully</hi> argueth very rightly, that as a man coming into a goodly house in which he found nothing but <hi>rats</hi> and <hi>mice,</hi> could not conceive that either the house had built it self, or had no other maker but those <hi>rats</hi> and <hi>mice</hi> which were nested in it: so neither can it be imagined, that either this <hi>World</hi> should be eternal, of a <hi>self-existency,</hi> or was composed by any <hi>natural agent</hi> of what power soever <note n="(x)" place="margin">

                           <hi>Valles. de sacr. Phil. c.</hi> 1.</note>; the distinction of six days being made by <hi>Moses,</hi> the better to complie with our incapacities. For question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there cannot be a better reason, why <hi>God</hi> should passe no approbation on the <hi>second days</hi> work, and double it upon the <hi>third</hi>: but that the <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Waters</hi> not being fully perfected till the said <hi>third day,</hi> required one special approbation from the mouth of <hi>God</hi>; as the production of the earth and the fruits thereof, which was the work of that day also, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire another.

Which lest it might be <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> he proves it by the story of the generall <hi>Deluge</hi> in which the waters being said to prevail at least 15. <hi>cubits above</hi> the top of the highest mountains, must needs have more time then 40. days, and 40. nights for their falling down, according to the course of nature, unlesse there had been some supply from this <hi>great Abysse</hi>; and that <hi>God</hi> by an high hand had forced down those waters, which he had laid up there as in a <hi>store-house.</hi> And that there was such a supplie from this infinite and inexhaustible <hi>store-house,</hi> he shewes out of those words of the 7. of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where it is said that <hi>the fountains of the great deep</hi> or (as the <hi>Angell</hi> calleth them in the Book of <hi>Esdras</hi>) the <hi>springs above the firmament,</hi> were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up: which on the abatement of the <hi>waters</hi> are said to have been stopped or shut up again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.2. A thing, saith he, not to be understood of any <hi>subterraneous Abysse,</hi> without an open defiance to the common <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>nature.</hi> Besides it doth appear from the Text it self, that at the first <hi>God had</hi> not caused <hi>it to rain on the earth</hi> at all (perhaps not till those times of <hi>Noah</hi>); but that a <hi>moysture went up and watered the whole</hi> face <hi>of the ground, Gen.</hi> 2.5.6. as still it is observed of the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And that it did continue thus till the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> may be collected from the <hi>bow</hi> which God set <hi>in the Clouds</hi>; which otherwise, as <hi>Porphyrie</hi> did shrewdly gather, had been there before: and if no <hi>clouds</hi> nor <hi>rain</hi> in the times before, the <hi>Cataracts of heaven</hi> spoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 11. &amp; 8.2. must have some other exposition then they have had formerly. Nay he collects (and indeed probably enough from his former <hi>principles</hi>) that this aboundance of waters falling then from those <hi>heavenly treasuries,</hi> and sunke into the secret receptacles of the <hi>earth</hi>; have been the matter of those <hi>clouds</hi> which are and have been since occasioned and called forth by the heat and influence of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and others of the stars and celestiall bodies. These are the principall reasons he insists upon. And unto those me thinks the <hi>Philosophical</hi> tradition of a <hi>Crystalline heaven,</hi> the <hi>watery Firmament</hi> we may call it, doth seem to add some strength or moment: which hath been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore interposed between the eighth sphere and the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> that by the natural coolness and complexion of it, it might repress and moderate the fervour of the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> which otherwise by its violent and rapid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might suddenly put all the world in a <hi>conflagration.</hi> For though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there may be no such thing in <hi>nature</hi> as this <hi>Crystalline heaven,</hi> yet I am very apt to perswade my self, that the opinion was first grounded on this Text of <hi>Moses,</hi> where we are told of <hi>Waters above the Firmament</hi>; but whether rightly understood I determine not. But I desire to be excused for this <hi>excursion,</hi> though pertinent enough to the point in hand; which was to shew the power and wisdome of <hi>Almighty God</hi> in ordering the whole work of the <hi>Worlds Creation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To proceed therefore where we left. As we are told in holy Scripture that <hi>God made the World,</hi> and of the time when, and the manner how he did first <hi>create</hi> it; so finde we there the speciall motions which induced him to it. Of these the chief and ultimate is the <hi>glory of God,</hi> which not only Men and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> do dayly celebrate, but all the Creatures else set forth in their severall kindes. <hi>The Heavens declare the</hi> glory of God, <hi>and the Firmament sheweth his handy work,</hi> saith the royall <hi>Psalmist</hi> 
                        <note n="(u)" place="margin">Psal. 19.1.</note>. And, <hi>Benedicite domino opera ejus,</hi> O <hi>blesse</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>all ye works of his, Psal.</hi> 103.22. The second was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59300:61"/>
to manifest his great <hi>power</hi> and <hi>wisdome,</hi> which doth most clearly shew it self in the works of his hands: there being no creature in the world, no not the most contemptible and inconsiderable, of all the rest, in making or preserving which we do not finde a <hi>character</hi> of Gods <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodness.</hi> For not the <hi>Angels</hi> only, and the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> nor <hi>Dragons</hi> only, and the Beasts of more noble nature; but even the very <hi>worms</hi> are called on to extol Gods name <note n="(x)" place="margin">Psal. 148.10.</note>. All come within the compass of <hi>laudate Dominum</hi>; and that upon this reason only, He <hi>spake the word, and they were</hi> made, <hi>he commanded, and they were created.</hi> In the third place comes in the Creation of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> that as the inanimate and irrational creatures do afford sufficient matter to set forth <hi>Gods goodness</hi>: so there might be some <hi>creatures</hi> of more excellent nature, which might take all occasions to express the same; who therefore are more frequently and more especially required to perform this duty. <hi>Benedicite</hi> Domino <hi>omnes</hi> Angeli <hi>ejus,</hi> O <hi>praise the Lord all ye</hi> Angels <hi>of his,</hi> ye <hi>that excel in strength,</hi> ye <hi>that fulfil his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements</hi> (for the <hi>Angels</hi> are but <hi>ministring spirits, Psal.</hi> 104.4.) and <hi>hearken to the voyce of his words</hi> 
                        <note n="(y)" place="margin">Psa. 103.20.</note>. And as for <hi>men,</hi> he cals upon them four times in one only <hi>Psalm,</hi> to discharge this <hi>Office,</hi> which sheweth how earnestly he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it from them. <hi>O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his</hi> goodness, <hi>and declare the wonders which he doth to the children of men</hi> 
                        <note n="(z)" place="margin">Psal. 107.8, 15, &amp;c.</note>. Then follows his selecting of some <hi>men</hi> out of all the rest, into that sacred body which we call the <hi>Church</hi>: whom he hath therefore saved from the hands of their enemies, <hi>that</hi> they <hi>might serve him without fear, in righteousness and holiness all the days of their lives</hi> 
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Luk. 74, 75.</note>. And therefore <hi>David</hi> doth not only call upon mankinde generally to set forth the <hi>goodness</hi> of the Lord; but particularly on the <hi>Church. Praise the Lord</hi> O Hierusalem, <hi>Praise thy God O Sion</hi> 
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Psa. 147.12.</note>. And that not only with and amongst the rest, but more then any other of the sons of men. How so? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, <hi>he sheweth his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his statutes and his Ordinances unto</hi> Israel. A favour not vouchsafed to <hi>other Nations,</hi> nor <hi>have the</hi> Heathen <hi>knowledge of his laws</hi>; for so it followeth in that <hi>Psalm,</hi> v. 19, 20. The <hi>Church</hi> then because most obliged is most bound to <hi>praise</hi> him; according to that divine rule of eternal justice, that <hi>unto whomsoever more is given, of him the more shall be required.</hi> And last of all, the <hi>Lord</hi> did therefore in the time when it seemed best to him, accomplish this great work of the <hi>Worlds Creation</hi>: that as his <hi>infinite power</hi> was manifested in the very <hi>making,</hi> so he might exercise his <hi>Providence,</hi> and shew his most incomprehensible <hi>wisdome,</hi> in the continual preservation and support thereof.</p>
                     <p>And certainly it is not easie to determine whether his <hi>Power</hi> were greater in the first Creation, or his <hi>Providence</hi> more wonderful and of greater consequence, in the continual goverance of the <hi>World</hi> so made: which questionless had long before this time relapsed to its primitive <hi>nothing,</hi> had he not hitherto supported it by his mighty hand. For not alone these sublunary creatures which we daily see, nor yet the heavenly bodies which we look on with such admiration; but even the <hi>Heaven of Heavens,</hi> and the Hosts thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Archangels, Angels, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, Powers,</hi> or by what name soever they are called in Scripture, enjoy their <hi>actual existence</hi> and continual beeing, not from their own nature, or their proper <hi>Essence,</hi> but from the <hi>goodness</hi> of their <hi>Maker.</hi> For he it is (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us in the <hi>Acts</hi>) who hath not only <hi>made the World</hi> and all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but still <hi>gives life and breath unto every creature</hi>

And so much <hi>Seneca, Pauls</hi> dear friend (if there be any truth in those letters which do bear their names) hath affirmed also. <hi>Manent cuncta, non quia</hi> aeterna <hi>sunt, sed quia defenduntur cura Regentis.

<q>All things (saith he) continue in beeing as at first they were, not because they are <hi>eternal</hi> in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but because they be defended by the <hi>Providence</hi> of their <hi>Governour.</hi> Things in themselves Immortal have no need of a <hi>guardian.</hi> But those things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by the <hi>power</hi> of their <hi>Maker,</hi> which over-ruleth the weakness of the

So that it seems by the <hi>Philosophie</hi> of this learned man, that the creature is preserved from perishing, not by any <hi>power</hi> which it hath in it self, but by the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> of its <hi>Heavenly Maker.</hi> And this no less true in the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the holy Scriptures.

                     <p>And yet I would not have it gathered out of this discourse, that because <hi>GODS justice</hi> in these cares hath been quick and sudden, and followed close on the offence, it must be always so on the like occasions; or else that question may be made, whether he hath forgotten to be just and gracious, or that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence</hi> be asleep and regards us not. The <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in ordering humane affairs is no less eminent in suffering <hi>wicked men</hi> to prosper, and sin to scape unpunished in the present world: then if the <hi>Divine vengeanee</hi> of <hi>Almighty God</hi> followed them close upon the heels. <hi>God</hi> useth the exorbitant lusts and passions of the <hi>wicked man,</hi> as the wise <hi>Physitians</hi> do <hi>poysons</hi> in the course of <hi>Physick,</hi> thereby to purge some hurtful and predominant humor out of the bodies of his <hi>Saints:</hi> which otherwise might grow too corrupt and rank, and draw them into such <hi>diseases</hi> as were irrecoverable. For though <hi>God</hi> hath no need of the <hi>wicked man</hi> for the manifestation of his <hi>glory,</hi> who can by other means effect what himself best pleaseth: yet since men will be wicked and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to <hi>sin, God</hi> may and will effect by them what he hath a minde to, <hi>Aut nescientibus iis aut nolentibus,</hi> either against their wils, or besides their purposes. <hi>God</hi> neither doth <hi>incline</hi> them, nor <hi>excite</hi> them to those works of wickedness, (whatsoever some are pleased to say unto the contrary) no nor so much as to permit them, but in this sense only, as <hi>he affordeth them not such a measure of grace by which they must have been restrained from the acts of sin.</hi> Only he makes this use of their lewd affections, their cruelty, ambition, or such other lusts, as he findes most predominant in them; that they become fit <hi>instruments</hi> to set forth his <hi>glory,</hi> and execute his <hi>vengeance</hi> when he seeth occasion. <hi>Non operando in malis quod ei displicet, sed operando per malos quod ei placet</hi>

                     <p>OF the <hi>Creation</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> we have spoken before; and are now come to speak of the <hi>creation</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> as the more noble parts thereof. These, though included in those words of <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> according as they stand in the <hi>Creed,</hi> are more significantly expressed by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers: who to those words of <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> have added as by way of <hi>Glosse</hi> or Commentary, and <hi>of all things visible and invisible.</hi> That under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>things visible</hi> they intended <hi>Man,</hi> as well as any other <hi>visible work</hi> of the whole Creation, is a thing past question. And that by things <hi>invisible</hi> they did mean the <hi>Angels,</hi> will prove to be as clear as that, and testifyed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> expressely, saying, that <hi>By him all things were</hi> created, <hi>whether in</hi> Heaven <hi>or</hi> Earth, <hi>visible or invisible; whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, all things were</hi> created <hi>by him, and for him</hi>

In which we have not only the Apostles testimony, that by the <hi>things invisible</hi> are meant the <hi>Angels</hi>; but an enumeration of the severall rankes and <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> which were <hi>created</hi> by the power of the Lord our God. Of these <hi>degrees</hi> and ranks we shall speak anon; having prepared our way unto that discourse, by taking first a short survey of the <hi>angelical</hi> nature. For the <hi>quid nominis,</hi> to begin first with that, it is meerly <hi>Greek</hi>; and <hi>English</hi> word <hi>Angel,</hi> and the <hi>Latine Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> being the same in sound and sense, with the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>nuntio,</hi> which is to carry a message, or to go of an errand. <hi>Angelus</hi> then is no more then <hi>nuncius,</hi> an <hi>Angel</hi> but a messenger in our <hi>English</hi> language. And so it it expressed by <hi>Lactantius,</hi> saying, <hi>Habe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

This as it notifyeth their name, and the reason of it, so doth it signifie their <hi>office</hi>; for <hi>Angelus nomen est officii non naturae,</hi> (as the <hi>Fathers</hi> tell us) which is to be the <hi>messengers</hi> from God to Man, as oft as there is any important businesse which requires it of them; to be the <hi>Nuncios</hi> as it were, from Gods supreme <hi>holiness,</hi> to manage his affaires with the sons of men. And unto this the Apostle also doth agree, telling us that they are <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

We have their nature in the word <hi>Spirits,</hi> which sheweth them to be pure <hi>incorporeal</hi> substances, not made of any corrupt matter as the bodies of men, and so not having any internall <hi>principle</hi> of being, they can have none neither of <hi>dissolution</hi>: and yet as Creatures made by the hand of God they are reducible to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59300:65"/>
                        <hi>nothing</hi> by the hand that made them, although they have not in themselves any <hi>passive principle,</hi> to make them naturally moral. It is the priviledge or prerogative of <hi>Almighty God</hi> to be purely <hi>Simple,</hi> without composition, parts, or passion. The <hi>Angels</hi> though they come most near him, yet fall short of this. Who though they are not made of a <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> and so not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally subject to the law of <hi>corruption</hi>: yet are they made up or compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> (or <hi>Actus</hi> aud <hi>Potentia,</hi> in the <hi>School-mens</hi> language) an <hi>Act</hi> by which they are, a <hi>Power</hi> into which they may be reduced. And being so made up of an <hi>Act</hi> of being, and a <hi>Power</hi> of not being, (though probably that <hi>Power</hi> shall never be reduced into <hi>Act</hi>) they fall exceeding short of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>GOD,</hi> whose name is, <hi>I AM,</hi> and is so, that it is impossible that he should not be, or be any other then he is; <hi>God</hi> being as uncapable of change, as of composition. Nay, so great is the difference betwixt their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the nature of God, so infinitely do they fall short of his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible and unspeakable <hi>Purity,</hi> that though in comparison of <hi>Men</hi> (as well as in themselves) they are truly <hi>Spirits</hi>; yet in comparison of <hi>GOD</hi> we may call them <hi>bodies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But whatsoever their condition and ingredients be, they owe not only unto <hi>God</hi> their continuall being, by whom they are so made as to be free from corruption; but unto him they are indebted for their first <hi>original,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they had not been at all. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we see, doth reckon them amongst things <hi>created</hi>; and so doth <hi>David</hi> too in the Book of <hi>Psalmes.</hi> Where calling upon all the <hi>Creatures</hi> to set forth <hi>Gods praises,</hi> he first brings in the <hi>Angels</hi> to performe that office, and then descends unto the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the other <hi>Creatures.

For neither were the <hi>Iews</hi> so untaught a people, as not to have been told of those <hi>Ministring Spirits,</hi> which did so frequently appear to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> And if they were so prone unto <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> as they say they were, I cannot see but that the pretermission of the <hi>Creation of Angels,</hi> might rather give them some occasion to commit <hi>Idolatry,</hi> then any way divert them from it. For when they found by reading in the book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> that not only <hi>Lot bowed himself down before the Angels</hi> which appeared unto him <note n="(n)" place="margin">Gen. 19.1.</note>, but that the same reverence or worship (call it which we will) had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto them by their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">Gen. 18.2.</note>; and yet could not meet with nothing touching their <hi>creation</hi>: might not they probably conclude, that sure the <hi>Angels</hi> were no <hi>creatures,</hi> but rather a nature so <hi>divine</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent that it were no impiety to <hi>worship</hi> them with <hi>religious worship.</hi> There must be therefore somewhat else which did occasion this omission, whatsoever it was. And why that reason may not be, because it did not fall within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the <hi>six days work</hi> (which <hi>Moses</hi> only undertook to lay down before us) I must confesse for my part I can see no reason. That they were made before the fourth day, is most plain in Scripture. <hi>Where wast thou when I laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth,</hi> said <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Iob, when the morning stars sung together, and all the</hi> Sons of God <hi>shouted for joy</hi>

Before the <hi>fourth day</hi> then, that's clear. And I am apt enough to think, till I see better evidence to the contrary, that they were made before the <hi>first.</hi> Certain I am the <hi>Tenor</hi> of the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> went this way confessedly: whose testimonies I would here produce to make good the <hi>assertion,</hi> but that I have <hi>confitentem reum.</hi> For <hi>Estius</hi> himself doth confesse ingenuously, <hi>Quod multi Patres</hi> Graeci <hi>tradunt</hi> Angelos <hi>aliquandiu</hi> creatos <hi>ante Mundum corporeum</hi>

that many of the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> were of opinion, that the <hi>Angels</hi> were created for some space of time before this visible and <hi>corporeal World.</hi> And <hi>Estius</hi> himself, for ought I can see, is of the same opinion also, who telleth it for a manifest truth in another place, that the <hi>Angels</hi> did not fall from the love of God, in the first moment, as it were, of their Creation: <hi>Sed aliquanto tempore in justitia stetisse</hi>

Assuredly had they been <hi>created</hi> in the <hi>six days work,</hi> their continuance in the <hi>state of Grace</hi> had been so short, that it could hardly have been called <hi>Aliquantum temporis.</hi> But whether <hi>Estius</hi> might so mean, I determine not. The <hi>Greek Fathers,</hi> as he saith, for the most part did; and so did many of the <hi>Latines.

That in the 18. of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> is this saying of <hi>CHRIST, Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones, for</hi> I <hi>say unto you that in Heaven their</hi> Angels <hi>do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> Touching which text, first it is generally agreed by all sorts of writers, that by the name of <hi>Parvuli,</hi> he meanes not <hi>little children</hi> in age or stature; but rather the <hi>just and righteous man</hi>: which howsoever he be <hi>great</hi> in the eye of God, is little in esteem of the wicked World, and lesse in the opinion which he hath of himself. And secondly, it is as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agreed on by all ancient writers, that by <hi>their Angels</hi> are meant those who had the charge or custody of their severall persons. The saying of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> is well known in this, <hi>Parum est fecisse</hi> Angelos <hi>tuos, fecisti et</hi> custodes <hi>parvulorum tuorum.</hi> It did not seem enough to God to have made the <hi>Angels,</hi> but that he made them also to be <hi>guardians</hi> of his <hi>little ones.</hi> The same, or to the same effect say almost all the antient writers which expound this text. That in the <hi>Acts,</hi> is the result of a discourse amongst the <hi>Disciples</hi> about St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whom they conceived to be in prison. But when a <hi>Danosel</hi> of the house did affirme for certain, that she left him standing at the door, they then resolved with one consent that it <hi>was his Angel, v.</hi> 15. that is to say, his <hi>angel-keeper, Qui</hi> Petro <hi>ab ortu nativitatis datus est in custodiam</hi>

And that it was his <hi>angel-keeper</hi> of which <hi>Iacob</hi> spake, saying, <hi>The Angel which redeemed me from all evill, blesse these lads</hi> 
                        <note n="(r)" place="margin">Gen. 46.16.</note>; is the opinion of <hi>Tostatus,</hi> and many learned men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Schooles. And hitherto I think the point is so clear and evident, that we may safely say with <hi>Vasquez, Sine gravi temeritatis nota negare non licet,</hi> it cannot be denied without very great rashnesse: especially considering that this <hi>tenet</hi> of <hi>Angel-gardians,</hi> findes testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie also from the penne of <hi>Plato,</hi> and others of the antient and more learned <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but darkened and mistaken by them under the notion of such <hi>Daemons</hi> whom they blindly worshipped. For <hi>Apuleius</hi> speaking of two sorts of <hi>Daemons,</hi> the one superiour to the other, then addeth. <hi>Ex hac sublimiori</hi> Daemonum <hi>copia autumat</hi> Plato <hi>singulis hominibus in vita agenda testes et</hi> custodes <hi>singulos additos,</hi> that out of the highest rank of <hi>Daemons, Plato</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that there was a several <hi>guardian</hi> to each severall man. That <hi>Socrates</hi> in particular had his <hi>Daemonium</hi> as they called it, (but his <hi>angel-gardian</hi> as I take it) was affirmed often by himself, of which I shall speak more anon. But that each man whatsoever he was, should have the like assistance as <hi>Socrates</hi> had without relation to the piety of his conversation, or the soundness of his judgment in coelestial matters; was a meer error of <hi>Platos</hi> (were it his originally) and never countenanced by the Church of the Primitive times,

                     <p>Suffice it that each <hi>Christian</hi> man hath his <hi>Angel-keeper,</hi> appointed by the will and command of <hi>God</hi> to take the charge and care of his <hi>preservation</hi>; and to give <hi>God</hi> accompt when he shall be called to it, how faithfully he hath performed the trust committed to him. Which as it is a special Act of Gods favour to us, so all the honour of it doth belong to him: and to him therefore must we sue and address our prayers, as often as we stand in need of his help and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, either in stirring up the diligence of our own <hi>proper Angels,</hi> or sending us such for their succour as the case requireth.

Not unto them, because we know no warrant for it in the holy Scripture; nor any means (might it be done without such warrant) to acquaint them <hi>ordinarily</hi> with our present need, by which they may take notice of our distresses, and come in to help us.

                     <p>But so it is not with the <hi>Devil,</hi> or the <hi>Angels of darkness,</hi> who do not only accept of those <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>offerings</hi> which are made unto them by that miserable and infatuated people, whom they have captivated in the chains of sin and ignorance; but they look for it at their hands, and threaten most severe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments if it be neglected. <hi>The Devil</hi> is still sick of his old disease, of being <hi>like to God</hi> both in power and greatness.

It was the pride and vanity of this glorious humor, which made them unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of long stay in <hi>Heaven</hi>; and hath since plunged them in the depths of disconsolation.

So witnesseth the holy Scripture both old and new. <hi>Behold, he put no trust in his servants, and his angels he hath charged with folly</hi>

By both it is as clear as day that the <hi>Angels sinned,</hi> and that the punishment due unto their transgression, was inflicted on them: but what the <hi>particular sin</hi> was which they did commit, and in what <hi>state</hi> they stand in regard of the <hi>punishment</hi>; we shall crave leave to look into with some further search, as being necessary to be known in reference to the <hi>fall</hi> of man, the <hi>incarnation</hi> of our Lord and Saviour, and his last coming unto <hi>Iudgement.</hi> For being <hi>fallen</hi> themselves from the <hi>love of God,</hi> they have practised ever since on <hi>Adam</hi> and his whole posterity, to make them also liable to the same damnation. <hi>In solati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um calamitatis suae non desinunt perditi jam perdere,</hi> saith <hi>Minutius Felix.</hi> And this <hi>calamity</hi> of man induced the ever gracious and most merciful God, to <hi>send</hi> his onely <hi>begotten Son</hi> into the World <note n="(i)" place="margin">Gal. 4.4, 5.</note>, to <hi>redeem such as were under the law of sin,</hi> that so they <hi>might receive the adoption of sons.</hi>

                     <p>First for their <hi>sin,</hi> the general opinion of the Church hath been, that it was an <hi>ambitious pride</hi> to be equal with God. For being made by <hi>God</hi> of so pure a substance, of such an excellent comprehension and so rare abilities, they thought themselves too glorious and sublime an <hi>essence</hi> to obey a superiour; and that it was sufficient honour to the <hi>Lord their God,</hi> if they admitted him for an <hi>equal,</hi>

expound them, there are other reasons to evince. For first the <hi>Devil,</hi> being still tainted with this plague of <hi>pride,</hi> went the same way to work in seducing <hi>Adam.</hi> To tempt him with the <hi>beauty</hi> of a glorious Apple, had been a bait too much below those most rare endowments, wherewith God had invested him at his first <hi>Creation.</hi> But to inflame him with an hope of being <hi>like unto God,</hi> to tell him <hi>Eritis sicut Dii</hi>

First, because the <hi>Angels</hi> fell of themselves, but man at the suggestion or perswasion of others, <hi>Et levius est alienamente peccaffe quam propria,</hi> as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath it. 2. The <hi>Angels</hi> in the height of their <hi>pride</hi> fought to be <hi>like God</hi> in <hi>Omnipotencie,</hi> which is an incommunicable property of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and cannot be imparted unto any other: but man desired to be <hi>like</hi> him only in <hi>Omniscience,</hi> or in the general knowledge of things created, which may be communicated to a <hi>creature,</hi> as to the humane <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oul of <hi>Christ.</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>Angels</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, intellectual <hi>Spirits,</hi> inhabiting in the presence of God and the <hi>light of his countenance,</hi> and therefore could not <hi>sin</hi> by errour or misperswasion; but with an high hand and <hi>affected malice,</hi> which comes neerest to the <hi>sin against the holy Ghost,</hi> and so irremissible: but <hi>man</hi> was placed by God in a place remote, left to the frailty of his own will, and wanted many of those opportunities for persisting in <hi>Grace,</hi> which the others had. Fourthly, because the <hi>Angels</hi> are not by <hi>propagation</hi> from one another, but were <hi>created</hi> all at once, so that of <hi>Angels</hi> some might fall, and others might stand; and that though many did <hi>apostate,</hi> yet still innumerable of them held their <hi>first estate</hi>: but men descend by <hi>generation</hi> from one stock or root, and therefore the <hi>first man</hi> falling and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting

his nature, derived the same corruption upon all his race; so that if <hi>God</hi> had not appointed a <hi>Redemption</hi> for man, he had utterly lost one of the most excellent creatures that ever he made. Fiftly, the <hi>Angels</hi> have the fulness of intellectual light, and when they take view of any thing they see all which doth pertain unto it, and thereupon go on with such resolution, that they neither alter nor repent: but <hi>man</hi> who findeth one thing after another, and one thing out of another, dislikes upon consideration what before he liked, and so repents him of the evil which he had committed. Sixthly, because there is a time prefixt both to <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> after which there is no possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of bettering their estate, and altering their condition whether good or bad: which is the hour of death in man, and unto <hi>Angels</hi> was the first deliberate action either good or evil, after which declaration of themselves, unto them that fell, there was no hope of grace or of restitution. For <hi>hoc est Angelis</hi> Casus <hi>quod hominibus mors</hi>; that which in man is <hi>death,</hi> was this <hi>fall</hi> to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> as most truly <hi>Damascene</hi>

Finally, the <hi>Angels</hi> had all advantages of nature, condition, place, abilities, and were most readily prepared and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their immediate and everlasting <hi>glorification:</hi> whereas man was to pass through many uncertainties to tarry a long life here in this present World, and after to expect till the general Judgement, before he was to be admitted to <hi>eternal Glories.</hi> In some or all of these respects, <hi>Christ did not take upon him the nature of Angels</hi> 
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note>, nor effect any thing at all towards their <hi>Redemption,</hi> but he took on him the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> that so the heirs of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith might be made heirs also of the <hi>Promises of eternal life.</hi> So that these <hi>Angels</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate of their own Salvation, and stomaching that a creature made of dust and ashes should be adopted to those glories from which they fell, have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured ever since to seduce poor man to the like <hi>apostasie,</hi> and plunge him in the gulf of the same <hi>perdition.

A thing of principal moment, if considered rightly, not only to the <hi>beeing,</hi> but <hi>well being</hi> of man; who is hereby instructed by the <hi>Lord his God,</hi> that in the setling of his desires and affections he should take counsell of his making; so to advance his <hi>meditations</hi> as God doth his head: and not by fastning both his looks and thoughts on the things below him, to disgrace as much as in him is, the dignity of his creation, and consequently merit to have had the <hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> even of those very beasts whose minde he carryeth.

                        <note n="(y)" place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note>, whereby he became a <hi>living soul.</hi> And though I will not enter here upon that dispute, whether the <hi>rational soul</hi> of man be a thing <hi>ex traduce,</hi> whether <hi>begotten</hi> by his Parents, or <hi>infused</hi> by God: yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that the very <hi>order</hi> which <hi>God</hi> used in mans creation, is of it self suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make clear that point, and to evince thus much, that the <hi>soul of man</hi> is of a more noble extraction then the <hi>souls of beasts</hi>; and not as theirs, <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> in the seed of their generation.

Of this last sort are they who place this <hi>Image of God</hi> in that <hi>dominion</hi> which God gave him over all the Creatures. For so it followes in the Text, <hi>Let us make Man in</hi> our image, <hi>after our likenesse, and let them have</hi> dominion <hi>over the fish of the sea,</hi> and <hi>over the fowles of the aire,</hi> and <hi>over the Cattel, and over all the earth</hi>

The first consisteth in the <hi>largeness</hi> of the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> faculties of understanding and will, not limited to the apprehension or desire of some certain things only, but extended to all the conditions of being and goodness, whose principall object is <hi>God</hi>; so that they never rest satisfyed with any other thing, but the seeing and enjoying of his <hi>blessed vision.</hi> And this is that which is more briefly couched in those words of <hi>Augustines, Fecisti nos ad te, et</hi> irrequietum <hi>est cor nostrum donec</hi> requiescat <hi>in te</hi>

For being that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> and those holy men of God that lived after him till the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> had not so clear and explicite a knowledge of the particulars of the <hi>Creed</hi> which concern our <hi>Saviour,</hi> or the condition of the <hi>holy Catholick Church</hi> and the Members of it; as hath been since revealed in the writings of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi>: it cannot be supposed that they should have universally the same <hi>object</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> which we <hi>Christians</hi> have, or were bound to <hi>believe</hi> all those things <hi>distinctly</hi> touching <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour, and the benefits by him redounding to the sons of men, which all <hi>Christians</hi> must <hi>believe</hi> if they will be saved. And then considering that there is almost nothing contained in Scripture touching <hi>God the Father,</hi> his Divine Power and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, the making and government of the World, and all things therein, which was to be <hi>believed</hi> by those of the line of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but what hath been avowed and testified by the learned <hi>Gentiles:</hi> it will not be unworthy of our disquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to see wherein the differences and advantages lay, which the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and those of <hi>Iudah</hi> had above the <hi>Nations</hi>; or whether the same <hi>light</hi> of truth did not shine on both through divers <hi>Mediums,</hi> for the better fitting and preparing of both people to receive the <hi>Gospel.</hi> In sifting and discussing of which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal points, we shall consider what it is in <hi>faith</hi> it self, which is said to <hi>justifie:</hi> of what effect the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> both before and under the <hi>Law</hi> were, to the satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods wrath and <hi>expiating</hi> of the sins of the people, by whom they were offered to the <hi>Lord</hi>; and the relation which they had to the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world</hi>: and finally what is to be conceived of those eminent men amongst the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who not extinguishing that <hi>light of nature</hi> which was planted in them, but regulating all their actions by the <hi>beams</hi> thereof, came to be very eminent in all kindes of learning, and in the exercise of <hi>Iustice, Temperance, Mercy, Fortitude,</hi> and other Acts of <hi>Moral</hi> vertue. Some other things will fall in incidently on the by, which need not be presented in this general view. And the mature consideration of all these particulars I have reserved unto this place, that being situate in the midst, between the <hi>Faith</hi> we have in <hi>God the Father Almighty,</hi> and the <hi>belief</hi> required of us in his <hi>Son Christ Iesus:</hi> it may either serve for an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part, or a <hi>Preamble</hi> to the second; or be in stead of a bond or <hi>ligament</hi> for knitting all the joints of this body together, in the stronger coherence of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

A pregnant argument whereof I think is offered to us in the errour of our Grandam <hi>Eve</hi>: who on the birth of <hi>Cain,</hi> her first-born but most wicked son, conceived that he should be the man in whom the <hi>promise</hi> made by God was to be fulfilled: and therefore said, I <hi>have gotten a</hi> man <hi>from the Lord</hi>

The like may be affirmed in general of the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> till <hi>God</hi> was pleased to speak more plainly and significantly to them by the mouth of his <hi>Prophets,</hi> then he had done unto their Fathers in <hi>dreams and visions.</hi> For having nothing further <hi>revealed</hi> unto them touching <hi>Christ to come,</hi> then what was intimated first in generals to our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> and more particularly specified to their Father <hi>Abraham</hi>: the primary and principal Object of their <hi>faith</hi> was <hi>God alone</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me still of <hi>God the Father Almighty</hi>) in whom they looked for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of those gracious promises which he had made unto their <hi>Fathers</hi>: though of the time when, the manner how, and other the material points which the <hi>Creed</hi> contains, they were utterly ignorant, and consequently could not ground any <hi>faith</hi> upon them.</p>

                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59300:77"/>In after times, as <hi>GOD</hi> imparted clearer light to the house of <hi>Iacob,</hi> (for the neerer we are to the <hi>Sun-rising,</hi> the more day appeareth) so were they bound to give <hi>belief</hi> to such <hi>Revelations</hi> (or <hi>supernatural truths revealed,</hi> call them which you will) which he vouchsafed to make unto them by his <hi>holy Prophets.</hi> Which howsoever they contained in them a sufficient <hi>light</hi> to guide them to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many particular points and circumstances, which were to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in the time and place of <hi>Christs Nativity</hi>; his course of life, and sufferings, and most shameful death, which every one could see when they came to pass, that whatsoever had been done by, or concerning him, did come to pass ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as had been sore-signified in the holy Scriptures: yet this great <hi>light</hi> of prophesie which did shine amongst them, was but like a <hi>Candle</hi> in a <hi>dark Lanthorn,</hi> or hid under a bushel, and rather served to convince them of <hi>incredulity</hi> when he was <hi>ascended,</hi> then to prepare them to <hi>receive</hi> him when he came unto them. <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not</hi>

And for the <hi>Prophets</hi> themselves, 'tis true that they have in them many positive and plain <hi>predictions,</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation, Nativity,</hi> and <hi>Circumcision</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> of his <hi>Passion, Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi>; as also of the most remarkable passages and occurrences in the whole course of his life. And yet a question hath been made amongst learned men, whether they did always distinctly foresee, or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely believe</hi> whatsoever they did <hi>fore-tell</hi> or fore-signifie concerning <hi>Christ.</hi> Nor can I finde but that this question is resolved to this effect, that <hi>though they had a right</hi> apprehension <hi>of the</hi> truths <hi>by them delivered, and a</hi> foresight <hi>of all those</hi> future events <hi>of which they prophesied,</hi> according to the accomplishment and sense thereof, by themselves intended: yet that this <hi>foresight</hi> of theirs extended not to all branches of <hi>divine truth</hi> contained in their writings, or to that use and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which was after made of them by <hi>CHRIST</hi> himself and his <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> with this mark of reference, that such and such things came to pass that the <hi>sayings of the Prophets might be fulfilled.</hi> For many things are extant in the <hi>Prophetical</hi> writings, either by way of <hi>Typical prefigurations,</hi> or positive and plain <hi>predictions,</hi> applyable to the life and actions of our <hi>Lord and Saviour,</hi> and the success and fortunes of his holy Church; which in all probability was never so intended by those sacred Pen-men. For who can reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that <hi>Moses</hi> in the story of the commanded offering up of <hi>Isaac,</hi> the only son of his Father, intended to <hi>typifie</hi> or <hi>fore-shadow</hi> the real offering up of <hi>CHRIST</hi> the <hi>only begotten Son of God,</hi> neer the self same place: or that this <hi>Ceremony</hi> in the ordering of the <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi>

And yet it may be questioned upon very good reason, whether he understood those <hi>Prophesies</hi> which himself delivered, of a <hi>spiritual Kingdome</hi> in the souls of men, such as our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> erected in his holy Church: in whom the said <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> were accomplished, and of whom intended: and not rather of the flourishing and continuance of his <hi>temporal Kingdome</hi>; the Royal seat whereof was by him setled on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and the renown of his magnificence and personal valour had made so formidable to the Nations which were round about him. And may it not be questioned also (if not out of question) whether that famous Prophesie, <hi>Behold, a Virgin shall conceive,</hi> had any reference in the intention of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and the birth of <hi>Christ?</hi> But of this more hereafter in another place.

if our Saviour <hi>CHRIST</hi> himself had not already put it beyond all disputes: when he thus said to his Disciples, that <hi>many Kings and</hi> Prophets <hi>have desired to see the things which ye see and have not seen them,</hi> and to <hi>hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them</hi> 
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">Luk. 10.24.</note>; upon which words we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> being bound to teach no other things in the Church of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> then what had been foretold by <hi>Moses</hi> and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Prophets</hi>; both <hi>knew</hi> and taught others also to <hi>believe</hi> many things of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> which the <hi>Prophets,</hi> no not <hi>David</hi> himself the <hi>Kingly Prophet,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they very <hi>much desired it,</hi> did not see, nor hear of: and therefore that they did not distinctly apprehend the meaning of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> in all those things which he was pleased to utter by their mouths, or express by their pens, touching <hi>CHRIST</hi> to come. For otherwise they must have <hi>seen</hi> all that the <hi>Evangelists</hi> saw, and have <hi>known</hi> all the mysteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, which the <hi>Apostles</hi> after our Saviours <hi>resurrection</hi> either knew or taught: which is directly contradictory to our Saviours words, and to the truth of his assertion: When therefore it is said so often in the holy <hi>Gospel</hi> that some things were either done or suffered that the <hi>sayings of the Prophets might be fulfilled</hi>; we must not understand it in that sense alone whereof the <hi>Prophets</hi> did intend it, or of that natural, proper, and immediate end to which the <hi>Prophets</hi> did direct it: but of some further <hi>mystical</hi> or mysterious meaning, reserved in the intention of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>; and in the <hi>fulness of time</hi> accomplished by our <hi>Lord and Saviour</hi> according unto that intention; though no such meaning was imparted to the <hi>Prophets</hi> themselves, whose mouths he made the <hi>pen of a ready writer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then perhaps, it will be said, that if the <hi>Prophets</hi> had not a distinct and <hi>explicite</hi> apprehension of every thing by them delivered in the way of <hi>Prophesie,</hi> but either knew not what they spake, or spake what they did not understand: they differed little, if at all, from the <hi>Heathen Sooth-sayers,</hi> who foretold many things which did come to pass, but without any apprehension of the truth thereof. For satisfying of which scruple we may please to know, that when the <hi>evil spirit</hi> did intend to foresignifie any thing to come by the mouth of the <hi>Sooth-sayers</hi> or <hi>Diviners</hi> amongst the <hi>Heathens:</hi> he used to cast them into a trance or <hi>extasie,</hi> so that they used to rave, or speak in those sudden fits, that which they neither understood at the time they spake it, nor could remember when they came to their sense again.

For if a generous young Prince that sees his negligences pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished on the back of another, according to the usage of former times, doth thereby both grow more industrious in his course of studies, and more conform and regular in his course of life: why may we not conceive so favourably of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> that seeing the <hi>brute beasts punished</hi> for mans offences, they might <hi>repent</hi> with shame and sorrow of their former wickednesses, and cry out passionately and afflictedly in the words of <hi>DAVID,</hi> It <hi>is I that have sinned and done wickedly, but what have these</hi> sheep done <note n="(c)" place="margin">2 Sam. 24.17.</note>, <hi>that they should be</hi> slaughtered? <hi>Me, me, adsum qui feci, in me convertile ferrum</hi>

                     <p>But then admitting that those <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were ordained but as <hi>types</hi> and figures of that which <hi>Christ</hi> was in the <hi>fulnesse of time</hi> to make for the sins of mankind: yet is this to be understood of <hi>Gods minde</hi> and purpose, and not of any such respect which the people had of them. For that the people when they brought their <hi>sacrifices</hi> before the <hi>Altar,</hi> had any such relation to the death of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> as to conceive the same to be represented in the slaughter of beasts: is no where to be found, I dare boldly say it, in all the Volume and context of the book of God.

But then perhaps it may be said, (if one would undertake the part of an <hi>Advocate</hi> in it) that God hath furnished them with some other means for the supplying of this want: which wrought as powerfully on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the <hi>learned Gentiles,</hi> as did the letter of the law on the <hi>Vulgar Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi> To this head I refer their <hi>Politick laws</hi> and constitutions for punishing all violent and unlawful actions; but principally the study of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> by which they were not only restrained from all <hi>Criminal actions,</hi> which came within the compass of their <hi>positive laws</hi>: but had their affections so composed, and their lusts so bridled, as to advance them to an eminencie in all sorts of virtues; not only doing all that their laws required, but at some times more.

And so doth <hi>Maldonate</hi> resolve it in his Commentaries on St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel, though otherwise a great assertor of the <hi>eternal generation</hi> of the Son of God: whose words I shal put down at large for the greater certainty <note n="(p)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Id.</hi> in Luk. 1.35.</note>: <hi>Etiamsi</hi> Christus <hi>Deus non fuisset, illo tamen modo genitus quo genitus fuit, merito</hi> Dei Filius <hi>vocatus fuisset, non solum ut</hi> caeteri viri sancti, <hi>sed singulari quadam ratione, quod non alium quam</hi> Deum <hi>haberet patrem, neo ab alio quam ab eo generatus.</hi> So he, <hi>I</hi> think exceeding rightly to the point in hand. His instance or exemplification in the case of <hi>Adam,</hi> who is called the <hi>Son of God</hi> by the same St. <hi>Luke</hi> 
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Luk. 3.38.</note>, <hi>quia non a viro sed a Deo genitus erat,</hi> because he was begotten by God and not by Man, I cannot by any means approve of: the production of our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> not being to be reckoned as a <hi>generation,</hi> but to be esteemed of as a work of <hi>Creation</hi> only. But to proceed, as <hi>Christ</hi> is properly and truly the <hi>Son of God,</hi> by this his generation in the womb of his Virgin-mother: so in the same respect is he called in Scripture, the <hi>only,</hi> and the <hi>only begotten</hi> Son of God the Father. I know that generally the style or attribute of the <hi>only begotten Son</hi> of God, is used for an argument or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing reason to prove that <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour is the Son of God by an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall generation</hi> long before all worlds. But by their favours I conceive, that he is called Gods <hi>only begotten</hi> Son, either in reference to this his generation in the womb of the Virgin, because the <hi>only Son of God</hi> which was so <hi>begotten</hi>; or else because he was most <hi>dearly loved</hi> of his heavenly Father, as commonly an <hi>only Son</hi> is best and most affectionately beloved of an earthly Parent. To the first sense I have the testimony of <hi>Vrsinus,</hi> a Divine of the <hi>reformed</hi> Churches, who though he hold that <hi>CHRIST</hi> is principally called the <hi>only begotten Son</hi> of God, <hi>secundum divinitatem suam,</hi> according to his <hi>Divine</hi> nature: yet he concludes that <hi>aliquatenus,</hi> after a sort he may be called so in his <hi>humane</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note n="(r)" place="margin">

And to the second sense I have that of <hi>Maldonate,</hi> who on these

words, <hi>Hic est filius meus dilectus,</hi> in the 3. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> observes that <hi>filius di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus</hi> and <hi>filius unigenitus,</hi> are termes <hi>reciprocal</hi>

                     <p>Lesse question is there to be made, or indeed no question, but that according to the same <hi>humane nature,</hi> and in relation to his being <hi>begotten in the fulness of time,</hi> he is entituled in the Scriptures the <hi>first born of every Creature</hi>

The reason why our Saviour is there called by the Apostle <hi>Primogenitus omnis Creaturae,</hi> or the <hi>first born of every Creature,</hi> is neither to give him the precedency of all <hi>Creatures</hi> else, or to rank his whole Person in the list of <hi>created</hi> substances: but either to entitle him to the rights of <hi>Primogeniture,</hi> which were great amongst the <hi>sons</hi> of men, or to denote that he supplyed the place of the <hi>first begotten,</hi> and was the general ransome or redemption for them. Concerning which we may take notice that by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> the <hi>first that opened the matrix of all living Creatures,</hi> were holy and cousecrated to the Lord <note n="(b)" place="margin">Exod. 13.1, &amp;c, &amp; v. 11, 12.</note>: if of <hi>clean beasts,</hi> then to be <hi>offered</hi> up in kind to the Lord their God, but if of <hi>men</hi> or <hi>unclean Creatures,</hi> then either to be redeemed for a piece of money, or some <hi>clean beast</hi> was to be brought unto the Lord in exchange for it; as in the case of the first male child, a <hi>pair of Turtle doves, or two small Pigeons.</hi> The reason was, because the Lord having slain the <hi>first born</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> both of man and beast,had spared all the <hi>first born</hi> of the house of <hi>Israel</hi>; and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>the first male</hi> of every Creature to be offered to him in sacrifice, that so the whole off-spring might be sanctifyed and made useful to them. But being the <hi>offering</hi> of a dumb Creature was really and of it self no sufficient price for the redemption of the <hi>first male child</hi> which opened the <hi>Matrix</hi> nor able to sanctifie both male and female in every family to the Lord their God (for he that <hi>sanctifyeth and they that are sanctifyed must be all of one</hi> 
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Heb. 2.11.</note>, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth infer): therefore did <hi>CHRIST</hi> take upon himself the place of stead of the <hi>first born,</hi> that being <hi>offered</hi> unto God, the <hi>clean for the unclean,</hi> he might <hi>sanctifie</hi> all things unto God, and make them acceptable in the sight of their Lord and maker, which were of a nature capable of such <hi>sanctification</hi> and acceptance as the Lord requireth in his creature. Now as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59300:95"/>
the ransome of the <hi>first born</hi> was discharged by him; so was it just that all the rites of <hi>Primogeniture</hi> should belong unto him; which were the <hi>Principality,</hi> the <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> and the <hi>double portion.</hi> Those <hi>Reuben</hi> having forfeited by his great offence, were so distributed amongst his Brethren, that the <hi>Priesthood</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on <hi>Levi,</hi> the <hi>Principality</hi> on <hi>Iudah,</hi> the <hi>double portion</hi> upon <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who thereupon was branched into the two tribes of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasses.</hi> But they were all again united in the person of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> that being thus made <hi>the first born of every Creature, he might in all things have the preheminence.</hi> The <hi>Principality</hi> he had, for the Lord gave unto <hi>him the throne of his Father Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

The answer to this doubt is easie. For though those mentioned in both Testaments were for a time raised from death to life; yet were they <hi>raised to die again,</hi> as in fine they did. But to be <hi>primogenitus ex mortuis,</hi> the <hi>first born</hi> or <hi>first begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the</hi> powers of death, includes an everlasting freedome from the jaws thereof: in which regard the Scripture saith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of <hi>Christ</hi> alone, that <hi>being risen from the dead he now dyeth not, death hath no more power or</hi> domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>over him</hi>

The <hi>high Priest</hi> finding no sufficient testimony for his <hi>condemnation</hi> resolved to put him to the oath of <hi>ex officio,</hi> and therefore did <hi>adjure him</hi> by the <hi>living God,</hi> to tell them whether <hi>he were</hi> the Christ <hi>the Son of God</hi>;<note n="(t)" place="margin">Mat. 26.63.</note> to which our Saviour answered, saying, <hi>Thou hast said.</hi> Which though it be equivalent to an <hi>affirmation,</hi> yet to make sure work of it and put it out of doubt, St. <hi>Marke</hi> hath given his answer in these positive termes, <hi>Iesus said I am</hi>

In which it is to be observed, that when the <hi>high Priests</hi> put our Saviour to this dangerous question, he spake not of the <hi>Son of God</hi> in that vulgar sense, in which the just and righteous persons were called his <hi>sons,</hi> but of the <hi>Son of God</hi> in the natural sense, in which he could not verifie himself for the <hi>Son of God,</hi> without including necessarily that he was also <hi>God.</hi> As in the 5. Chap. of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> where our Saviour having said, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I also work</hi> 
                        <note n="(x)" place="margin">Joh: 5.17, 18.</note>; the incensed <hi>Iews</hi> intended him some present mischief, not only because he had <hi>broken the Sabbath,</hi> but had said also that <hi>God was his Father, making himself equal with</hi> God. And this appears yet further by the following words, where it is said, that the <hi>high Priest rent his clothes, saying, he hath spoken blasphemy</hi> 
                        <note n="(y)" place="margin">Mat. 26.65, 66.</note>; and thereupon pronounced him to be <hi>guilty of death</hi>: which <hi>vote,</hi> they after prosecuted before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he <hi>ought to die by the Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> because <hi>he had made himself the Son of God</hi> 
                        <note n="(z)" place="margin">Joh. 19.7.</note>. Assuredly their meaning was, that he had made himself the <hi>true and natural</hi> Son of God, and not the Son of God by <hi>especial grace</hi>: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they had not <hi>voted</hi> him to be <hi>guilty of death.</hi> Nor had the <hi>high Priest rent his clothes,</hi> if he had only taken upon himself the name of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> or of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> because that could not come within the compasse of <hi>Blasphemy.</hi> For they knew well that the <hi>Messiah</hi> or the <hi>Christ</hi> was to come in the <hi>forme of man</hi>; though with more outward pomp and glory (as they supposed) then our <hi>Saviour</hi> did: and therefore though they might have condemned him of <hi>folly,</hi> in that being a man of no reputation he had taken on himself the name of

                        <hi>CHRIST</hi>; they had no reason in the world to accuse him of <hi>Blaspheming</hi> the name of God.

                           <hi>Fagius</hi> in Gen. 4.</note>. The like conceit possessed the Parents of <hi>Noah,</hi> as many good Authours do conceive; upon which ground they said, when they gave him that name, <hi>this same</hi> (that is, this son of ours) <hi>shall comfort us concerning our work</hi>

                     <p>So then the quarrel which the <hi>Iewes</hi> had against our Saviour was, that he called himself the <hi>Son of God</hi> in the <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> signification of the word.

                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Joh. 5.1.</note>; but by a solemn conference which they had on the like occasion. In which our Saviour did not only own himself to be the <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and to claim <hi>God to be his Father</hi> in the proper sense of the word <hi>Father</hi> 
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Joh. 10.24, 25. &amp; 29.30.33.</note>, but added fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an expression more unpleasing to them, saying, I <hi>and my</hi> Father <hi>are one.</hi> For which when the <hi>Iews</hi> took up stones <hi>to stone him,</hi> and were demanded for which of his <hi>many good workes</hi> they were so resolved; they answered thus, <hi>For a good worke we stone thee not, but for blasphemy,</hi> because <hi>thou being a</hi> man <hi>makest thy selfe God.</hi> It seems the <hi>Iewes</hi> were of opinion that none could properly and naturally be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> or so call himself, but he must make himself to be <hi>also God</hi>: or else their <hi>accusation</hi> had been falsly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

the dust of the earth, seduced by <hi>Satan,</hi> and beguiled under faire pretences; and <hi>Peace</hi> endevoured to take off the edge of Gods displeasure, and <hi>reconcile</hi> the creature unto his Creatour. When God had heard the contrary desires and <hi>pleas</hi> of those excellent <hi>Orators,</hi> there was a councell called of the <hi>blessed Trinity,</hi> in which it was finally resolved that the <hi>Word should be made flesh,</hi> and take unto himself the nature of Man, that he might partake of his <hi>infirmities,</hi> be subject to the <hi>punishments</hi> which man had deserved, and so become the <hi>propitiation</hi> for the sins of the world. By this means the desires of all parties were fully satisfyed. For <hi>man</hi> was <hi>punished</hi> according as <hi>Iustice</hi> urged; the <hi>punishment</hi> threatned on mans disobedience inflicted, as <hi>Truth</hi> required; the <hi>offender</hi> pitied and <hi>relieved,</hi> as <hi>Mercy</hi> intreated; and God was <hi>reconciled</hi> to man, as <hi>Peace</hi> had desired.

Nor wanted there especial reason (if at least any reasons may be given in matters of so high a nature) why this miraculous <hi>Conception</hi> was committed rather to the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> then either acted by the sole power of <hi>God the Father,</hi> or by the sole vertue of the <hi>Word,</hi> who was aboundantly able to have wrought his own <hi>Incarnation.</hi> For as the <hi>Word</hi> was pleased to offer himself to take <hi>humane flesh,</hi> the better to accomplish the great work of the <hi>Worlds redemption</hi>: and as God <hi>the Father</hi> knowing how unable poor man must be to <hi>work out his own salvation</hi> otherwise then by such a <hi>Saviour,</hi> was graciously pleased to accept the offer: so it seemed requisite that <hi>God the holy Ghost</hi> should prepare that <hi>flesh</hi> in which the <hi>Word</hi> of God was to be <hi>incarnate.</hi> Besides the power of <hi>quickning</hi> and conferring fruitfulness, is generally ascribed to the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Book of God: who therefore in the <hi>Nicene</hi> (or rather the <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitane</hi> Creed) is called the <hi>Lord and giver of life.</hi> For thus saith <hi>David</hi> for the Old Testament, <hi>Thou sendest forth thy</hi> Spirit, <hi>and they are created</hi>

For before this <hi>Maher-shalal-hash-baz</hi> so conceived and born, was able to distinguish of meats, or know his <hi>Father and Mother</hi> from other people; was the <hi>word ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> which God had spoken by the Prophet touching their deliverance: <hi>Pekah</hi> being slain by <hi>Hoseah</hi> the son of <hi>Elah,</hi> and <hi>Rezin</hi> by <hi>Tiglath-Pilesar</hi> the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> within two or three years after the said signe was given.

And thus we say in common speech, that Queen <hi>Iane Seymour</hi> dyed of her <hi>first childe,</hi> and that King <hi>Edward</hi> the fift was murdered in the <hi>first year</hi> of his reign: where past all doubt neither <hi>Iane Seymour</hi> had more children, nor King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> reigned more years then the <hi>first</hi> alone.

And unto this most of the great <hi>Rabbins</hi> of that Church do full wel agree. Assuredly these men with a little help might in time come to be of the <hi>Turkes</hi> opinion: who out of a Reverent esteem which they have of <hi>Christ</hi> will not conceive him to be <hi>born</hi> or <hi>begotten,</hi> according to the course of nature: but that the <hi>Virgin did conceive him by the</hi> smell <hi>of a</hi> Rose, and <hi>after bare him at her brests.</hi> But herein they run crosse to the antient Writers, who though they constantly maintained the <hi>perpetual Virginity</hi> of the Mother of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet such a corporal integrity in the act of <hi>Child-birth,</hi> as these men idly dream of, did they never hold. <hi>Tertullian</hi> very aptly noteth, that she was <hi>Virgo a viro, non virgo a partu</hi>

According to the judgment of which antient writers (for those which followed them in time varyed somewhat from them) it is the common resolution of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Schooles, that though <hi>Christ</hi> when he was born of his <hi>Virgin Mother,</hi> opened the passages of her womb, as all children do, yet she continued <hi>still a Virgin,</hi> because her mind was free from the thoughts of lust, and that she had <hi>conceived of the holy Ghost</hi>: nay that he may more properly be said to have opened the womb of <hi>Mary</hi> his mother, then any other <hi>first born</hi> do, because he found it shut at the time of his <hi>birth,</hi> which the <hi>first born</hi> of the sons of men do not. And being it is confessed by the greatest <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> that there may be an <hi>opening of the womb,</hi> without the losse of <hi>Virginity,</hi> as in the cure of some diseases, or on such an accident of which St. <hi>Augustine</hi> speakes in his first book <hi>De Civit. dei. c.</hi> 18. I should much wonder at the stiffenesse of the <hi>Papists</hi> in it, but that I know they lay it for a ground work of their doctrine of <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> and the <hi>local being</hi> of his body in more places at a time then one, by taking from it all the properties of a <hi>naturall body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to say truth, they well may free <hi>Christs body</hi> from the <hi>bands of nature,</hi> when they have freed his mother from the <hi>bands of sin</hi>: not from the <hi>sins</hi> only of an higher nature, but even from slight and <hi>veniall sins,</hi> as they use to call them; nor yet from <hi>actual</hi> sins only, but <hi>original</hi> also. To what this great <hi>exemption</hi> tends, we shall see anon. In the mean time we may take notice that this <hi>exemption</hi> from the guilt of <hi>original</hi> sin, is but a new opinion taken up of late, and not yet generally agreed on amongst them: there having been great conflicts about this priviledge, between <hi>Scotus</hi> and the <hi>Franciscans</hi>

on the one side, <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> on the other. But in the end, the devotions of the common people being strongly bent unto the service of <hi>our Lady,</hi> the <hi>Franciscans</hi> carryed it. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4. who had been formerly of that <hi>Order,</hi> not only ratifying by his <hi>Buls</hi> their doctrine of her <hi>immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, Ann.</hi> 1476.

After when as the doctrine of <hi>original sin</hi> was agitated and debated in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> this Controversie was as hotly followed, as if the Pope had never determined it.

                     <p>Now for the <hi>sufferings</hi> of our Saviour they may be principally divided into <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external</hi>; the inward or internal being either <hi>temptations</hi> or <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,</hi> the outward or external, either <hi>shame</hi> or <hi>corporal punishments</hi>: and these again may be considered either as being inflicted on him before his <hi>crucifying,</hi> or in the act of <hi>crucifixion.</hi> Of these the first were those <hi>temptations</hi> which were laid before him by the <hi>Devil,</hi> immediately upon his <hi>Baptism,</hi> at the performance of which ceremony he was acknowledged by <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to be the <hi>Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world</hi>

                     <p>Now in this story of the <hi>temptations</hi> of our Saviour, there are these three parts to be considered, the <hi>place,</hi> the <hi>preparation,</hi> and the <hi>temptation</hi> it self. The <hi>place</hi> or scene of this great action was the <hi>Wilderness</hi> of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> as before we said: not the inhabited parts thereof (for there were many villages interspersed therein, as commonly there are in al great <hi>Forrests</hi>) but those which were the furthest and the most remote from humane society.

And this was done on great and weighty considerations. First, he was led into the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> the better to comply with the <hi>type</hi> or figure of the <hi>Levitical Scape-goat,</hi> 
                        <note n="(z)" place="margin">Levit. 16. v. 10.21, 22.</note>, of which it is thus said in Scripture, that the <hi>Goat on which the lot fell to be the</hi> Scape-goat, <hi>shall be presented alive before the</hi> Lord, <hi>to make an</hi> atonement <hi>with him: And</hi> Aaron <hi>shall lay both his hands upon his head,</hi> and <hi>confess over him all the iniquities of the</hi> children <hi>of</hi> Israel, <hi>and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the</hi> head of the Goat, <hi>and shall send him away by the hands of a fit man into the</hi> Wilderness; <hi>And the</hi> Goat <hi>shall bear upon him all their</hi> iniquities <hi>unto a land not inhabited,</hi> and <hi>he shall let go the</hi> Goat <hi>in the</hi> Wilderness. A <hi>Type</hi> or Figure most punctually agreeing with the <hi>Antitype,</hi> with our Redeemers going into the Desert, to a <hi>land not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited.</hi> No sooner had he been declared by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> to be <hi>the Lamb of God which taketh</hi> away <hi>the sins of the world</hi>; no sooner was the <hi>burden</hi> of our <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi> laid upon his <hi>head</hi>; but presently he is <hi>led by the</hi> holy Spirit, as by the hands of <hi>a fit man,</hi> into the midst of the <hi>Wilderness.</hi> And though some of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient writers, as <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>

                     <p>A second cause of <hi>leading</hi> our Saviour into the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and to the parts thereof most retired from company, was to the end (as the same <hi>Calvin</hi> is of opinion) that he might undertake the Office of a <hi>publick Teacher,</hi> and an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour</hi> from heaven with the more authority, <note n="(d)" place="margin">

                        </note>; so that the loneliness of the place, seemed to concur with other circumstances, (especially his beginning to be hungry after so long and great a fast) to animate the old <hi>Tempter</hi> to give the onset, and to befool himself with the hopes of Victory. But here the <hi>Devil</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his expectation, and gave himself the overthrow by his too much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness; falling into the hands of that <hi>promised seed,</hi>

But <note n="(h)" place="margin">Luk. 4.1, 2, 3.</note> St. <hi>Luke</hi> thus, <hi>He was led by the Spirit into the</hi> Wilderness, <hi>being forty days</hi> tempted <hi>of the Devil,</hi> and <hi>in those days he did eat nothing,</hi> and <hi>when they were ended he afterwards hungred; and the</hi> Devil <hi>said unto him,</hi> &amp;c.

Which different narration of these three Evangelists hath produced a doubt amongst the learned touching the very moment and point of time, when the <hi>Devil</hi> first began his onset (whereof more anon) but they do all well agree in this, that he <hi>fasted forty days, and forty nights,</hi> being the whole time that he continued in the <hi>Wilderness.</hi> And herein divers things are to be considered; First, why our Saviour chose <hi>this time</hi> for so great a work. Secondly, Why he <hi>fasted forty days and forty nights,</hi> neither more nor less; And thirdly, what was after done by the <hi>Church</hi> of God in reference to this great <hi>example.</hi> And first it may be thought that he chose <hi>this time,</hi> because he then began to set himself in more special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the great work of our <hi>Redemption</hi>; which was not to be wrought but by <hi>humbling</hi> of himself for us, under the mighty hand of his heavenly Father; and <hi>fasting</hi> is a special act of <hi>humiliation</hi>: in which respect the Church hath taught us thus to pray in her publick Liturgies; <hi>O Lord which for our sakes did fast forty days and forty nights,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="(k)" place="margin">Collection on the first sunday of Lent.</note>, Secondly we may think that he chose <hi>this time,</hi> that by this exercise of <hi>fasting</hi> he might prepare and fit himself for the discharge of the <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office, the function of the holy <hi>Ministery,</hi> which he was pleased to take upon him.

Which Precedent as we finde it followed in the <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and other <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church, in the best and <hi>Apostolical</hi> times <note n="(m)" place="margin">Act. 13.3. &amp;c. 14 v. 23.</note>: so

gave it a fair hint to the times succeeding, to institute four solemn times of publick fasting, (which they called <hi>jejunia quatuor temporum,</hi> we the <hi>Ember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeks</hi> to be the set and solemn times of <hi>giving Orders,</hi> in the Church, and calling men unto the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the same; to the end that all the people might by <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>fasting</hi> apply themselves unto the Lord; humbly beseeching him to direct the <hi>Fathers of the Church</hi> to make choyce of fit and able <hi>labourers</hi> to attend his <hi>harvest,</hi> as also to <hi>enable</hi> those who are called unto it, and give them gifts and graces fitting for so great a business.

                     <p>In the mean time we may consider what might be the reason, why he fasted <hi>forty days and forty nights,</hi> neither more nor less.

For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they fasted longer then the <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> could endure; it must needs be that they were both assisted by the <hi>God of nature,</hi> whose service and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were called unto. And though perhaps a longer and more wonderful <hi>fasting</hi> might have been expected from our Saviour considering both who he was, and of how much a better and more glorious <hi>Ministery</hi> he was to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Lord his God: yet he resolved not to <hi>exceed</hi> the former number, nor to make use of that assistance which he might easily have had of those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Angels,</hi> who as St. <hi>Mark</hi> saith, <hi>ministred unto him</hi>

                              <hi>Field</hi> of the Church, <hi>l.</hi> 3.19.</note>, (as a learned man of this Church very well observes) that there be a solemn time at least once in the year, wherein men may call themselves to an account for their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, repent them of all their evil doings, and with prayers, fasting, and mourning turn unto the Lord: <hi>this time</hi> was thought to be the fittest, both because that herein we remember the <hi>sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> for our sins, which is the strongest and most prevailing motive that may be to make us hate sin, and with tears of repentant sorrow to bewail it; as also for that after this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the <hi>sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and conforming of our selves unto them, his joyful <hi>Resurrection</hi> for our <hi>justification</hi> doth immediately present it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in the days insuing, in the solemnities whereof men were wont with great devotion to approach the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> and they which were not yet <hi>baptized</hi> were by <hi>Baptism</hi> admitted into the Church. Thus then it was not without great confideration, that men made choyce of <hi>this time</hi> wherein to recount all their negligences, sins, and transgressions, and to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by this solemn act of <hi>fasting,</hi> both for the better performance of their own duties in those following days of joyful solemnity, as also to obtain at the hands of God the gracious acceptance of those whom they offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to be entred into his holy <hi>Covenant</hi>; it being the use and manner of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, never to present any unto <hi>Baptism,</hi> unless it were in case of danger and necessity, but only in the <hi>Feasts</hi> of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide.</hi> Which being the reasons moving them to institute a set and solemn time of fasting, and to appoint it at <hi>this time</hi> of the year rather then another; they had an eye, as for the <hi>limitation</hi> of the number of days to our Saviours fast of <hi>forty days,</hi> in the dedicating of the new <hi>Covenant</hi>; not as precisely tyed to that time at all by the <hi>intent</hi> and <hi>purpose of the Lords example,</hi> but rather that by keeping the same number of days, we may the better keep in <hi>remembrance</hi> his <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>humiliation</hi> for the sake of man, and thereby learn the better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our duty and affections to him.</q>
Some other reasons are alleadged for this yearly fast, of which some are <hi>Political</hi> 
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mason</hi> of fasting, <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note>, for the increase of Cattel in the Common-wealth, that being as we know full well, the great time of breed; some <hi>Physical,</hi> for qualifying of the bloud by a slender diet of fish, hearbs and roots, the bloud beginning at that time of the year to increase and boyl; and some <hi>Spiritual,</hi> shewing the use and necessity of <hi>mortification</hi> at that time of the year, in which the bloud beginning to be hot and stirring as before was said, is most easily inflamed with the heats of lust. And on these great and weighty reasons as the <hi>Church</hi> did institute, and all the States of <hi>Christendome</hi> confirm the strict keeping of it: so hath it hitherto been retained in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> as far as the condition of the times would bear: in which there is a solemn and <hi>set form</hi> of service for the <hi>first day</hi> of <hi>Lent,</hi> which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients called by the name of <hi>Caput jejunii,</hi> as also for every <hi>Sunday</hi> of it, and for each several day of the last week of it, (the <hi>holy week,</hi> as commonly our <hi>Fathers</hi> called it) and abstinence from <hi>flesh</hi> injoyned from the first day thereof till the very last, according to the usage of the purest times; and all this countenanced
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59300:115"/>
and confirmed by as good authority as the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> of the Realm can give unto it. Which <hi>holy time,</hi> had it been as carefully and conscionably observed by all sorts of people, as it was prudently and piously ordained at first; we had no doubt escaped many of those grievous plagues, with which the Lord of late hath scourged us, and even consumed us unto nothing by our own licentiousness.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed to the third general point contained in the story of the Lords <hi>temptation,</hi> in which there is a doubt as before was said, touching the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and point of time, which the old <hi>Tempter</hi> took to give the onset; occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the different narrations of the three <hi>Evangelists</hi>: that is to say, whether the <hi>Devil tempted</hi> him all those <hi>forty days,</hi> and then gave him over; or that he did not trouble him, and begin the business, until the <hi>forty days</hi> were past, and his <hi>fast</hi> was ended. St. <hi>Matthews</hi> words do seem to intimate, nay to say ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that the <hi>Tempter</hi> did not come unto him till his <hi>fast was ended,</hi> and that <hi>afterwards</hi> he <hi>was an hungred:</hi> and this more <hi>literally</hi> agrees with the particulars of the following story. But on the other side it is said in <hi>Luke,</hi> that <hi>he was led into the</hi> Wilderness, <hi>being forty days tempted by the Devil,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, as the <hi>Greek</hi> text reads it: and then how could the <hi>Devil</hi> set him upon one of the <hi>Pinnacles of the Temple</hi> if he were all the time of his <hi>Temptation</hi> within the bowels of that Desert?

So then, the nick and point of time in which the <hi>Devil</hi> did apply himself most close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the work intended, was <hi>cum esuriret,</hi> when he <hi>began to be an hungry.</hi> As long as our Redeemer kept himself unto <hi>prayer and fasting,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> either did not trouble him, or it was either with such trivial and light <hi>temptations</hi> as made no impression, and neither interrupted him in his holy course, nor caused him to intermit the business he was then upon, by making any necessary replies to his lewd suggestions. But when he <hi>began to be an hungry,</hi> when his minde seemed to be upon his belly (if I may so say) then did the <hi>Devil</hi> think it was time to work him. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>This difficulty thus passed over, we shall next look on the particular <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> which those Gospels speak of.

For that the <hi>Devil</hi> could do nothing against him, without, much less against his will,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59300:116"/>
is a truth past questioning. But then there is a greater difficulty occurring in the story of the second <hi>temptation</hi>; where it is said (which seems impossible to be comprehended, that having taken <hi>Christ</hi> unto the <hi>top of the mountain,</hi> he shewed him <hi>all the Kingdomes of the world,</hi>

<q>There was say they, a double apprehension of <hi>reason</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> the one termed the <hi>supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,</hi> which looketh into things with all incident circumstances; the other the <hi>inferior,</hi> which presenteth to the minde some circumstances, but not all. Then they declare that in <hi>Christ</hi> every faculty, power and part was suffered (notwithstanding the perfection found in some other) to do that which properly pertained to it. And thereupon infer that thence it is easie to discern how it came to passe, that he should desire and pray for that which <hi>he knew would never be granted,</hi> as namely that the <hi>Cup of death might passe from him.</hi> For the <hi>sense</hi> (say they) of nature and <hi>inferior reason</hi> presented death and the ignominie of the <hi>Crosse</hi> unto him as they were <hi>evill in themselves,</hi> without any consideration of <hi>the good to follow,</hi> and so caused a desire to decline them, which he expresseth in that prayer. But <hi>superior reason</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering them with all the circumstances, and knowing Gods resolution to be such that the world <hi>by that means should be saved,</hi> and by no other means whatsoever, perswaded to a willing acceptance of them: so that between these desires and resolutions there was a <hi>diversity</hi> but no <hi>contrariety,</hi> a subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination but no <hi>repugnance.</hi> There was no <hi>contrariety,</hi> because they were not in respect of the <hi>same circumstances</hi>; for death as death is to be avoided: neither did the <hi>superior reason</hi> ever dislike this judgment of the <hi>inferior fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> but shewed further and higher considerations, whereon it was to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59300:119"/>
be accepted and embraced. And there was no <hi>repugnance</hi> nor resistance, because the one yeilded to the other. For even as a man that is <hi>sick,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the <hi>potion</hi> of the <hi>Physitian</hi> to be unpleasant to his tast, declines it whiles he stayes within the bounds and confines of that consideration; but when he is shewed by the <hi>Physitian</hi> the happy <hi>operation</hi> of it, and the good that is in it, doth receive it willingly, in that it is <hi>beneficial</hi> to him in the way of his <hi>health</hi>: So <hi>CHRIST</hi> considering <hi>death,</hi> as in it self it is <hi>evill,</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> to the nature of all mankinde, shunned and declined it whilest he staid within the bounds of that consideration; and yet did joyfully accept it as the only means of <hi>mans salvation,</hi> embracing what he had refused, and refusing what he had embraced. Again, There is a thing (saith <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi>) which is <hi>bonum in se,</hi> good in it self, and the good of every other thing: there are somethings <hi>good in themselves,</hi> and yet good but to certain purposes only; and some there are which being <hi>evill in themselves,</hi> are to some purposes <hi>good.</hi> Of these the two first sorts are to be desired simply and absolutely for themselves; the other in respect only unto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ends. And of this kind (saith he) was the <hi>death of the Crosse,</hi> with all the wofull torments concurring with it: which simply <hi>Christ</hi> shunned and declined, but <hi>respectively</hi> to the end proposed, did embrace it cheerfully.</q>

fears,</hi> or the fears incident to nature, we will once more repair unto the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and enquire of them, both what his <hi>natural fear</hi> was, and in what <hi>respect</hi> it was he feared, as also how this <hi>fear of his</hi> may be reconciled both with the <hi>will of God</hi> and his knowledg of it.
<q>First then they say <note n="(r)" place="margin">
                              <hi>Feild</hi> of the Church. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 18</note> that <hi>natural fear</hi> ariseth in these three respects, that is to say, first in respect of things that cannot be avoided neither by <hi>resistance</hi> and incounter, nor by <hi>flying from them</hi>; secondly, in respect of such things as <hi>may be escaped</hi> or overcome with a kind of uncertainty of event, and danger of the issue; thirdly, in respect of such as may be <hi>escaped</hi> or <hi>overcome</hi> without any uncertainty of the event or issue, but not without <hi>great conflict</hi> and extremity of labour. Then they declare what things they were which <hi>Christ</hi> did <hi>fear,</hi> and in what sort he <hi>feared</hi> them. For first (say they) he <hi>feared death,</hi> and the stroke of the <hi>justice</hi> of God his Father sitting on his <hi>tribunal</hi> or judgment seat to punish the <hi>sins of men,</hi> for which he stood forth that day to answer; and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he <hi>feared</hi> also that <hi>everlasting destruction,</hi> which was due to mankind for those sins. And finally, they resolve it thus, that the former of these two he <hi>feared</hi> as things <hi>impossible to be escaped</hi> in respect of the resolution and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of his heavenly Father, which was, that by his <hi>satisfactory death</hi> and sufferings, and no other way, man should be ransomed and delivered from the power of <hi>Satan</hi>: and that he <hi>feared</hi> the latter, that is to say, declined it as a thing he knew he should escape without all doubt or uncertainty of the event, though not without <hi>conflicting</hi> with the <hi>temptations</hi> of the Devil, and the enduring of many bitter and grievous pangs which in that conflict might befall him.</q>
Which resolution of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> not only shews the reasons of <hi>CHRISTS natural</hi> fear; but addes withall another reason, why he was so <hi>amazed</hi> and sorrowfull; and also why he prayed so long and with so great fervencie, that <hi>the cup</hi> which was prepared for him, might have <hi>passed over him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to say truth, it must be somewhat more then the consideration and apprehension of a <hi>bodily death,</hi> which could so much work upon our Saviour, considering with how much <hi>gallantrie</hi> so many of the <hi>primitive Martyrs</hi> have defyed their torments, and mounted on the <hi>scaffold</hi> with so clear a confidence as if they had not been to have <hi>suffered death,</hi> but behold a <hi>Triumph.</hi> And therefore first it may be said, that besides the <hi>natural fear</hi> of death which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the <hi>Saints of God</hi> (however gallantly resolved to contemn the force of it by the assistance and support of the holy Spirit) which he could not avoid; and the <hi>avoidable fear</hi> of everlasting destruction, which might be for a season presented to him: he was to undergoe the <hi>whole wrath</hi> of God for the sins of mankind. A <hi>wrath</hi> so infinite and just, so far exceeding the strength and reach of mans nature to endure; that our earthly <hi>infirmity</hi> to which for our sakes he submitted himself, cannot conceive nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the greatnesse of it, nor think upon the power thereof without fear and horror.
<q>
                           <hi>CHRIST,</hi> saith a reverend and learned Prelate of this Church <note n="(s)" place="margin">
                              <hi>B. Bilson. p.</hi> 376.</note>, was not only to <hi>suffer</hi> that which in his <hi>Person</hi> should be thought <hi>sufficient</hi> in the righteous judgment of God to appease <hi>his anger,</hi> and purge our sins, but he was further to see and behold from what he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us, even from the <hi>wrath to come.</hi> For how should the price and force of his <hi>death</hi> be known unto him, if he were ignorant what dreadfull and terrible <hi>vengeance</hi> was prepared for sin, should he not redeeme us?</q>
Since therefore he was at this time to bear the <hi>burden of our sins</hi> in his body, and to have the <hi>chastisement of our peace</hi> laid upon him, and did withall behold the fiercenesse of <hi>Gods wrath</hi> against sinfull man, how could he choose but <hi>fear the effects thereof,</hi> and pray against them? For though he were assured that this <hi>wrath of God</hi> would not proceed against him unto <hi>condemnation</hi>; yet he knew well that God had infinite means to presse and punish <hi>humane nature</hi> above that which it was able to bear. And therefore he addressed himself to his heavenly Father, being sure that God at his most earnest and fervent prayer
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59300:120"/>
would <hi>proportion the pain</hi> he was to suffer according to the <hi>weaknesse of that flesh</hi> which he bare about him, that neither his <hi>obedience</hi> might be staggered, nor <hi>patience</hi> overwhelmed and swallowed up in despair. Besides there might be somewhat else in the <hi>cup</hi> provided for him, then the <hi>wrath of God</hi> with all the <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>terrors</hi> which depend upon it: which might make him so unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to tast thereof, so earnestly desirous to decline the same. For many of the <hi>Fathers</hi> think, that <hi>Christ</hi> did pray more vehemently to have that <hi>cup passe from him,</hi> because he saw the <hi>Iews</hi> so eagerly inclined to force it on him; and knew that if he <hi>drank</hi> thereof, and took it from their murderous and bloudy hands, it could not but draw down upon them such most grievous <hi>punishments</hi> as the dispersing of their nation, and the <hi>rejection</hi> of them from the Covenant and grace of God.

<q>For if he so much pitied the ruine of the City and desolation of their land by the hands of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he <hi>wept</hi> upon the thought thereof; what sorrow and <hi>discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation</hi> shall we think he took to thinke of the perpertual destruction of so many thousands and their posterities for ever, thorow their own mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in thirsting after his bloud? What grief and anguish must it be unto him to foresee the <hi>rejection</hi> of that people from the favour of God, by their rash and wicked desire to have <hi>his bloud upon them and upon their children</hi> at his arraignment before <hi>Pilate?</hi> For if <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> so vehemently grieved at the fall of their Brethren according to the flesh, that for their sakes the one wished to be <hi>wiped out of the book of God,</hi> the other most sacredly protested the <hi>great heavinesse</hi> and continual anguish which he <hi>felt for them in his heart</hi>: how much more might it grieve the Saviour of the world, who much exceeded both the other in <hi>compassion</hi> and mercy, to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self who came to blesse them and to save them, to be the rock and <hi>stone of offence</hi> that should stumble them and their children, striking them with perpetual blindnesse, and bruising them with everlasting perdition, through their <hi>unbelief</hi>?</q>

The word in the <hi>Original</hi> will bear both <hi>constructions,</hi> both being of especial use in the present businesse.

But which soever of the two it was, certain it is, that the appearance of the <hi>Angel</hi> had some special end. God doth not use to send about those <hi>heavenly messengers,</hi> but on businesses of great importance. And though there be no <hi>constat</hi> in the book of God, what this businesse was, on which the <hi>Angel</hi> was sent down by the Lords appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet we may probably conceive, that it was to give him this assurance that his <hi>prayers were heard</hi>; whether they tended to the mitigation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sorrows, or the accepting of his death and passion, as a <hi>full, perfect and sufficient satisfaction</hi> for the sinnes of the world.

And this we may the rather think to be the <hi>message</hi> which the <hi>Angel</hi> brought, in regard that after this we finde no more mention of those <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>sorrows</hi> which formerly had seized upon him; but that he <hi>cheerfully</hi> prepared himself for the stroke of death, and called up his <hi>Disciples</hi> to go forth to meet it.

he was pleased with that zeal, constancy, which he had manifested in his greatest and most fiery trials. In which regard no sooner had he driven away the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> in that great <hi>temptation</hi> which at first he suffered in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> but <hi>behold the</hi> Angels <hi>came and ministred unto him</hi> 
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Mat 4.11.</note>; as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> telleth us.

                     <p>But then perhaps it will be said, If on the coming of the <hi>Angel</hi> he received such <hi>comforts,</hi> what then could bring him to that <hi>Agony</hi> which the Gospel speaks of, and speaks of in the very next words to those of the appearance of the <hi>holy Angel</hi>: an <hi>agony</hi> so sharp and piercing, that his <hi>sweat was as it were great drops of bloud</hi>

                     <p>Now for the clearer exposition of this text of Scripture we will lay these grounds, 1. That <hi>dereliction</hi> and forsaking do no where throughout Gods book, import <hi>damnation,</hi> but are applyed always to the judgements of this present life. 2. That in wicked and udgodly men, it argueth <hi>reprobation</hi> from grace, and <hi>despair</hi> of glory, which to imagine of <hi>CHRIST</hi> were rather a most fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>blasphemy</hi> then an erroneous folly. 3. That in the godly, (as in <hi>David</hi> whose words they were) they either note <hi>destitution</hi> of help, or diminution of comfort; but neither in <hi>David</hi> nor in <hi>Christ</hi> the true pains of <hi>the damned:</hi> and 4. That no <hi>construction</hi> must be made of these words which may decrease in <hi>Christ</hi> the fulness of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> which never wanted in his soul, or draw him within the compass of mistaking or mistrusting Gods favour towards him. For how could he be tainted with any <hi>distrust</hi> of Gods mercy and purpose to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, who with such confidence commended his pure <hi>Spirit</hi> into <hi>the hands</hi> of his Father <note n="(s)" place="margin">Luk. 22.46.</note>; who in the midst of his extremities did promise to invest the penitent Thief in the joys of <hi>Paradise</hi> 
                        <note n="(t)" place="margin">Vers. 43.</note>; and finally, who in the height of his <hi>afflictions,</hi> when he spake these words, had such an interest in God as to call him his own God. <hi>My God, my God,</hi> and not God only, as the text informs us. Which grounds so laid, we may the better understand the meaning of the words before us, and what construction they will bear, agreeable and conform to the rule of <hi>faith.</hi> And first I know that many of the antient <hi>Fathers</hi> were of opinion, that as <hi>Christ</hi> took upon him at this time the person of all mankinde, so he made this complaint not in behalf of himself, but of his <hi>members</hi>; as when he said to <hi>Saul</hi> in another case, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me</hi> 
                        <note n="(u)" place="margin">Act. 9.4.</note>, he did not mean it of his <hi>person</hi> which was then in heaven, but of his <hi>Church militant</hi> here on earth.

through his bloud,</hi> Ephes. 1.7. <hi>By his own</hi> bloud <hi>hath he entred into the holy place, having obtained</hi> eternal redemption <hi>for us. Heb.</hi> 9.12.

Finally, thus the Elders say unto the <hi>Lamb</hi> in the <hi>Revelation, Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God,</hi> by thy bloud, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 5 9.

                        <hi>death</hi> which first found entrance by a <hi>Garden.</hi> So that the labour was not much to take down his body, and carry it to the next spot of ground, and there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomb it.

And this was done after the custom of the <hi>Iews,</hi> whose manner it was to bestow that charge upon their <hi>dead</hi>; in sign of their <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> unto life eternal: not out of any thought they had of his so speedy a <hi>Resurrection</hi> at the <hi>three days</hi> end, though he had often told them that he would so do. So far were they from looking to behold him again on the <hi>first day of the week</hi> then following, that they did all they could to lay him up fast enough till the day of judgement: and to that end not only wrapped him up in <hi>sear-cloaths,</hi> (for such the <hi>linnen clothes</hi> were which they wrapped him in, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.40.) but <hi>rolled a great stone to the dore of the sepulchre</hi> 
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 27.60.</note>, to make sure work with him.

Our Saviour had not <hi>overcome death,</hi> if he had not <hi>dyed</hi>; nor got the victory of the <hi>grave,</hi> had he not been <hi>buryed.</hi> His being restored unto life within <hi>three days</hi> of his death, was a very great and signal <hi>miracle</hi>; but not so great, as that which had been acted before on <hi>Lazarus</hi>

We must next look upon his <hi>exaltation,</hi> the first degree or step to which, was his <hi>descent into hell.</hi> But this perhaps may seem to some to be a very strange kind of <hi>preferment,</hi> a point so far from being any part of his <hi>exaltation,</hi> that it may worthily be accounted his very <hi>lowest degree</hi> of <hi>humiliation,</hi> a fall farre lower then the <hi>Grave.</hi> And so it had been out of doubt, had he <hi>descended</hi> down to <hi>hell</hi> to have felt the <hi>paines</hi> of it, or to have been <hi>tormented</hi> though but for a moment in the <hi>flames</hi> thereof.

                     <p>These things premised we shall the better be inabled to discern what the meaning is of <hi>Christs descent into hell,</hi> whether the words import any <hi>local descent</hi> or only something <hi>analogical</hi> and proportionable to it. That the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists</hi> did first commit the sacred monuments of the <hi>faith</hi> which they left behind them, to the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, as being then of an extent more universall then that of the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Iews,</hi> is a thing past question: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse perhaps St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel was first written in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> language, as St. <hi>Ierome</hi>

                        </note>, and some other learned men have been of opinion. And therefore it is more then probable, that they delivered this brief <hi>Abstract</hi> of the <hi>Christian faith,</hi> which we call the <hi>Creed,</hi> in the same tongue also, in which they did communicate those <hi>Oracles</hi> of eternal life. Which granted, as I think no question will be made thereof, what else can follow thereupon, but that the word <hi>Hades</hi> in the <hi>Creed,</hi> must be taken in the self-same sense, in which we finde it generally used (not one place excepted) in the <hi>whole new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: those very men, whose writings make up a great part of the said <hi>new Testament,</hi> contributing their severall <hi>Articles</hi> to make up the <hi>Creed</hi>? And then what else can be supposed to be the meaning of <hi>Christs descent into hell,</hi> but that he <hi>locally went down,</hi> which is the ordinary meaning of the word <hi>descend</hi>; and went down to the <hi>place of torments,</hi> which in the common course of speech is generally designed by the name of <hi>hell</hi>? Or if the <hi>Creed</hi> were first compiled and published in the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, the same conclusion must needs follow from the former premisses: the Latine <hi>inferi</hi> or <hi>infernus,</hi> (as before was proved) signifying the very same with the <hi>Greek</hi> word <hi>Hades,</hi> and that imparting nothing else, (according to the <hi>Ecclesiastical notion</hi>) but the English, <hi>Hell.</hi> Besides the <hi>Apostles</hi> purposely intended this (and whosoever else we shall please to think were the Authors of it, did intend the same) to lay down <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>methodically,</hi> according to the understanding of the <hi>vulgar</hi> sort, that which they thought most fitting to comprise in this short <hi>Compendium.</hi> Nor can it enter into the belief of any man endued with ordinary sense and reason, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> having before made use of those <hi>vulgar</hi> phrases, <hi>was crucifyed, dead, and buried,</hi> in the <hi>literal sense,</hi> which every Artizan, and Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nay even women and children could not but understand at the first hearing: should then come in with a <hi>descent into hell,</hi> not to be understood in a <hi>literal</hi> sense, as the words usually import in common speech; but in a meaning too <hi>abstruse</hi> and difficult for all <hi>vulgar</hi> wits, beyond the reach of ordinary apprehensions. Assuredly it was never the Apostles meaning that they for whose use principally they compiled the <hi>Creed,</hi> and in whose language it was written (which soever it was) should not be able to conceive the <hi>true sense</hi> of their words, without the help of a <hi>Lexicon,</hi> or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diligent recourse unto the <hi>Criticks</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi> of their severall Languages.</p>
                     <p>But because Arguments of this nature may perhaps be said not to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative,</hi> and that men will not readily let goe their hold-fast upon <hi>probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> we will proceed another way, and setch the truth of this assertion that <hi>Christ descended into hell,</hi> in a <hi>literal</hi> sense, from the authority and text of holy <hi>Scripture.</hi> Most sure it is that there is nothing comprehended in the <hi>Creed,</hi> but what is to be found in the book of God, either in <hi>termes expresse,</hi> (as the greatest part of them are) or else by <hi>necessary</hi> and undeniable <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> And both these wayes we doubt not but we shall be able to assert this <hi>Article.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, in the way of <hi>necessary</hi> undeniable <hi>consequence</hi> it may be pleaded from that place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> 
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Rom. 10.6, 7.</note>, where it is said, <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse which is of</hi> faith <hi>speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall

ascend</hi> up into heaven? <hi>that is to bring</hi> Christ <hi>down from above; Or who shall</hi> descend into the deep? <hi>that is to bring up</hi> Christ <hi>again from the dead</hi>; For the expounding of which words we first take notice, that the two <hi>interrogatives</hi> are equivalent to these general negatives, <hi>none can ascend up into heaven; none can descend into the deep.</hi> And then the meaning will be this, that if <hi>none can ascend to heaven, nor descend down into the deep, then not</hi> Christ <hi>himself: which to affirme, were plainly and directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the</hi> righteousnesse <hi>of faith.</hi> So that it is a main ground of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith,</hi> that <hi>Christ descended into the deep,</hi> and into such a <hi>deep</hi> as hath some proportion to his <hi>ascension into heaven</hi>; which possibly can be no other then the <hi>deeps of hell.</hi> And hereunto agree <hi>Interpreters</hi> both old and new. For thus <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophylact,</hi> Stagger not saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor cast this doubtingly in thy mind, <hi>how Christ descended from heaven,</hi> or how after death <hi>he arose from the deep again</hi>

                              <hi>Bucer</hi> in Rom. 10.</note>. It is evident that <hi>the deep</hi> is taken <hi>pro infernis, Hell,</hi> and in this sense the Apostle seemeth to use this word the <hi>deep</hi>; for he addeth, that is <hi>to bring back</hi> Christ <hi>from the dead,</hi> to wit, to account <hi>his descent to hell to be void,</hi> and his victory over death, and <hi>hell, (Gehenna)</hi> of none effect.</q>
So then the meaning of this text will be briefly this, that according to the <hi>Christian faith,</hi> these actions which to men seemed so impossible, those namely <hi>ascending up into heaven, and descending down into the deeps of hell,</hi> were performed for us in the person of <hi>Christ:</hi> and therefore now to <hi>doubt of either,</hi> were nothing else but to enervate and <hi>weaken the power of Christ,</hi> who most perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath accomplished both, to save us from the one, and bring us to the other. Besides the Reader may take notice, that that which our <hi>Translatours</hi> have rendred by these words <hi>the deep,</hi> is called in the <hi>Greek Original</hi> by the name of <hi>Abyssus</hi> which signifieth a <hi>bottomlesse pit,</hi> and is so taken and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Chap. 9.2. &amp; 11.7. where it can probably meant of no place but <hi>hell.</hi> In the next place we meet with that of the <hi>Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 
                        <note n="(i)" place="margin">Eph. 4.8, 9, 10.</note>, where it is said, <hi>When</hi> he ascended <hi>up on high he led captivitie captive, and gave gifts unto men. Now that he</hi> ascended, <hi>what is it but that he also</hi> descended first <hi>into the lowest</hi> parts <hi>of the earth? He that</hi> descended <hi>is the same also that</hi> ascended <hi>up far above all heavens, that he might fil all things.</hi> Now in these words we may observe;</p>
                     <p>First, that before <hi>Christs ascending</hi> by way of relation the Apostle putteth <hi>Christs descending.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that because <hi>descending</hi> and <hi>ascending</hi> must have contrary extremes, from which and to which the motion is made; therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> opposeth the <hi>lowest parts</hi> of the earth to which <hi>Christ</hi> first <hi>descended,</hi> unto the <hi>highest heavens</hi> of all above which he <hi>ascended.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that these <hi>lowest parts</hi> of the earth could not be the <hi>grave,</hi> (as some men would have it) which is seldome two yards deep, in the ground, and so not opposite (in that respect) to the <hi>height of the heavens,</hi> according to the words and inference of the <hi>Apostle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Fourthly, that the end of his <hi>descending</hi> was to <hi>lead captivity captive,</hi> to beat them from the place of their chiefest strength; even as the end of his ascending after he had led <hi>captivitie captive,</hi> was to <hi>give gifts to men.</hi> For what place fitter for the <hi>scene</hi> of so great an action, as the full conquest of <hi>death, sin,</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> the <hi>final dissolution</hi> of the kingdome of darknesse, then the chief seat and fortresse of their whole empire, which is <hi>hell</hi> it self, situate in the <hi>lowest parts</hi> of the earth, as before was shewn. And hereunto agreeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the antient Fathers. St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> citing these very words of the Apostle, that <hi>Christ descended into the lower parts of the Earth,</hi> makes them <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi> with those words of <hi>David</hi> concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> viz. <hi>thou shalt not leave

                     <p>There is another part of this Text of Scripture touching the <hi>leading</hi> of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity Captive,</hi> of which we have said nothing from the <hi>antient Writers,</hi> because I purposed to consider it with another Text, neer of kin unto it; where it is said, <note n="(t)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15.</note> that <hi>having spoyled principalities and powers,</hi> he made a shew of them open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>triumphing over them.</hi> In both which texts we must distinguish between the taking of <hi>Captivity captive,</hi> and the <hi>leading</hi> of them as in <hi>triumph,</hi> being once so taken; between the <hi>spoyling</hi> of those <hi>principalities and powers</hi> the Apostle speaketh of, and the <hi>open shew</hi> or <hi>triumph</hi> which was made upon it. The first was only the great work of <hi>Christs descent into Hell</hi>; the other the chief pomp and glory of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension.</hi> For clearing of which point we may please to know, that the <hi>Devil</hi> since the fall of man laid a claim to mankinde, and held him like a <hi>captive</hi> in the <hi>bonds of sin</hi>: by means whereof as he drew many after him into the <hi>pit of torments,</hi> so he presumed to have the like advantages over all the rest.

                     <p>Thus have we seen the suffrages of the <hi>antient</hi> Writers in their times and ages, touching the <hi>descent of Christ into hell,</hi> with such a <hi>general consent</hi> and <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> that a greater is not to be found in all or any of the Articles of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith.</hi> And we have also seen the reasons which (as they thought) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced our Saviour unto that <hi>descent,</hi> the benefits which did accrew to the Church thereby. Now these being principally three, that is to say, the <hi>vanquishing of the powers of hell.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>securing of his faithful servants</hi> from coming under the dominion thereof: And thirdly, the <hi>deliverie of the souls of those righteous men,</hi> which lived under the law, and were held <hi>captive</hi> for a time by the <hi>powers of darkness,</hi> till he <hi>released</hi> them by his coming: two of the three, I hold to be undoubtedly true; and the other I consider as a matter <hi>questionable.</hi>

                     <p>And first I take it for a truth, an undoubted truth, that our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> by his <hi>descent into hell,</hi> did utterly suddue and overthrow the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> and gave him his last blow in his own Dominions, and that thereby

                           <hi>The powers, principalities, and rulers of the world,</hi> (which the Apostle speaks of there) <hi>none other could</hi> conquer and <hi>carry into the Deserts of</hi> hell, <hi>but only he who said,</hi> Be of good hope, for I have overcome the world. Therefore it was necessary that our Lord and Saviour should not only be <hi>born a man</hi> amongst men, but also should <hi>descend to hell,</hi> that he might carry into the <hi>Wilderness of hell,</hi> the <hi>Goat</hi> which was to be led away; and returning thence, (that work performed) might <hi>ascend</hi> to his Father.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I do also hold for a truth undoubted, that <hi>Christ</hi> by his <hi>descent into hell,</hi> hath <hi>secured</hi> all his faithful servants since that time from coming under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and dominion of it.

                           <hi>Vid. Ch.</hi> 6.</note>. Thus then <hi>Ruffinus</hi> did not mean, and indeed he could not, that this <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>descent into hell,</hi> was not accounted for an <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> either by those of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches. No such matter veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Nor doth <hi>Ruffinus</hi> say, if we marke him well, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denied this clause to be part of the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> (which he must either say or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which will do them good) but that it was not <hi>in Ecclesiae Romanae Symbolo,</hi> in the <hi>Creed</hi> or <hi>Symbol,</hi> made for the use of the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for some particular occasion; such as was that of <hi>Damasus</hi> in St. <hi>Hieromes</hi> works, where indeed it is not. So that the omitting of this <hi>Article</hi> in the <hi>Creeds</hi> of those <hi>particular</hi> Churches, which <hi>Ruffinus</hi> speaks of, shewes rather that it was received in all parts of <hi>Christendome</hi> with such a <hi>general consent</hi> and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that it was needlesse to insert it in those <hi>Creeds,</hi> because no <hi>controversie</hi> or debate had been raised about it. For otherwise it must needs follow by
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59300:146"/>
this Argument, that being there is no mention of <hi>Christs death</hi> in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> nor of his <hi>burial</hi> in the <hi>Creed</hi> of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> nor of the <hi>Communion of the Saints</hi> in the <hi>Constantinopolitan,</hi> nor of many of the last <hi>Articles</hi> in the <hi>Creed</hi> of <hi>Damasus</hi> (not to descend to more particulars) therefore those <hi>Articles</hi> and clauses were not to be found in such <hi>copies</hi> of the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> as were commended to the use of Gods people, within the <hi>Patriarchates</hi> of <hi>Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria,</hi> or the City of <hi>Nice,</hi> or any of those numerous Churches over all the world, where those <hi>particular Creeds</hi> were received and welcomed.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>project</hi> therefore failing, as we see it doth, the <hi>Devils</hi> next great care hath been to <hi>dispute</hi> down the <hi>authority</hi> and effect thereof, such a <hi>descent</hi> as is delivered and maintained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> being neither <hi>possible nor pertinent,</hi> as is objected.

Because say they <note n="(f)" place="margin">Luk. 23.43.</note>, our Saviour promised the penitent <hi>Theef,</hi> that the <hi>same day his soul should be with him in Paradise.</hi> What then? Therefore <hi>Christs soul</hi> being to goe that day to <hi>Paradise,</hi> could neither goe <hi>to hell</hi> that day, nor the two days after.

Three speciall <hi>motives</hi> which induced our Saviour unto this <hi>descent,</hi> we shewed you from the Fathers in the former Chapter; that is to say, the <hi>full and finall overthrow</hi> of the powers of <hi>Satan,</hi> the <hi>bringing thence</hi> the Antient <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and others which dyed before the preaching of our Saviours Gospel: and finally the <hi>delivering us</hi> from the holds thereof that we goe not thither. And do they think that none of these are any matter of <hi>certain benefit</hi> to the <hi>godly</hi> man? Or do they think the publishing of salvation to the <hi>souls in hell,</hi> the making of our Saviour to be <hi>Lord over quick and dead,</hi> the spoyling of <hi>hell,</hi> and the preparing of a way for man to <hi>return to life,</hi> which we finde in <hi>Nyssen,</hi> administreth no <hi>use of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation</hi> to the godly minde? Besides there were some other ends of <hi>Christs descent into hell,</hi> then the procuring of some <hi>certain benefits</hi> to the <hi>godly only:</hi> which if they should deny, as perhaps they may, they will condemn therein the best <hi>Protestant</hi> writers. <hi>Aretius,</hi> one of name and credit in the <hi>reformed</hi> Churches, gives us <hi>three reasons</hi> of the Lords <hi>descent into hell,</hi> whereof there is but one which concerns the <hi>godly</hi>

heard, but neglected it with great contempt. The second is, that <hi>Satan</hi> might assuredly know that this <hi>Christ</hi> whom he had <hi>tempted</hi> in the desert, and delivered unto death by the hand of the <hi>Iews,</hi> was the very <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the <hi>seed promised</hi> to the woman. And the third was in reference to the <hi>Elect,</hi> that <hi>Satan</hi> might see he had now no right, no not so much as to their <hi>bodies,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> hereafter would be pleased to restore to life. Mr. <hi>Nowel,</hi> as before we saw, gives three other reasons, that is to say <note n="(t)" place="margin">

                        </note>, First, that the <hi>souls</hi> of the <hi>faithlesse</hi> might perceive the <hi>condemnation</hi> of their <hi>unbelief</hi> to be just and righteous. Secondly, that <hi>Satan</hi> the chief Prince of <hi>hell,</hi> might see all the <hi>power</hi> of his tyranny, to be weakned and broken, nay utterly ruined.

And secondly, that though the <hi>victory</hi> against <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> was perfected upon the <hi>Crosse,</hi> yet the <hi>manifestation</hi> of the same to the <hi>souls of the damned,</hi> and the <hi>triumph</hi> which was due upon it, over <hi>Satan</hi> and all the powers of darknesse, was not, and could not be performed but in <hi>hell alone.</hi> We shewed you this before from <hi>Zanchius,</hi> a moderate and learned man, where he affirmeth <note n="(x)" place="margin">

                     <p>And first the Reader may take notice that all the out-works to this <hi>Citadel,</hi> esteemed so invincible and <hi>inexpugnable,</hi> have by us been taken in already in the two former chapters: where we have proved that neither the extreme <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>sorrow</hi> which did seize upon him in the <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Gethsemane,</hi> nor any of his <hi>fervent prayers</hi> either there or on the <hi>Cross</hi> it self, no nor the <hi>Agony</hi> it self, nor the <hi>bloudy sweat,</hi> were any signs or arguments of those <hi>hellish pains,</hi> which they have fancied to themselves in our Saviours <hi>soul.</hi> And we have also proved in the last chapter of all, not only that our Saviour did not die <hi>the death of the soul,</hi> (as these men <hi>blasphemously</hi> pretend) but that the work of our <hi>Redemption</hi> was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fully, by that <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>bloudy sacrifice</hi> which he made of himself upon the <hi>Cross.</hi> So that there now remains no more but to prove this point (which is indeed the main of all) namely, that <hi>Christ</hi> neither did nor ought to <hi>suffer the pains</hi> belonging to the <hi>damned,</hi> or endured so much as for a moment the <hi>torments of hell.</hi> And for the proof of this it is fit we know both what those <hi>pains and torments</hi> are which the <hi>damned</hi> do suffer, and of what nature are those <hi>fires</hi> which the Scriptures declare to be in <hi>hell</hi>; what punishments belong to the <hi>soul</hi> alone, and what unto the <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> being joyned together. And first of all the <hi>torments</hi> which the <hi>damned</hi> suffer in their <hi>souls only,</hi> though infinite and unexpressible in themselves, may be reduced to these three heads: 1 <hi>remorse of conscience,</hi> 2 a sense of <hi>their rejection</hi> from the favour of God, and 3 a <hi>despair</hi> of ever being eased of that consuming misery which is fallen upon them. <hi>Remorse of conscience,</hi> that's the first, and one of the most heavy <hi>torments</hi> suffered by those wretched souls who in their life time wholly renounced the Lord their God to enjoy their pleasures, by which they are kept in a <hi>continual remembrance</hi> of that madness and folly wherewith they rebelled against the Lord, and of the contumacy wherewithall they refused his mercies: God punishing the souls of such wicked men with the evidence and <hi>conscience</hi> of their own uncleanness, and with the sight and most infallible assurance of their now everlasting wretchedness. Whether or not this be the <hi>Worm</hi> our Saviour speaks of <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mark 9.44.</note>, and of which he telleth us in his Gospel, that it <hi>never dyeth,</hi> we shall speak more at large hereafter.

Nothing can then be left but the <hi>fires of hell,</hi> and they could work no further then upon his <hi>body,</hi> or the <hi>outside</hi> only of his <hi>soul,</hi> if I may so call it; the <hi>inward</hi> man being senseless of the heats thereof, since it was neither subject to <hi>rejection</hi> or <hi>remorse</hi> at all: though to say truth, he suffered not the <hi>fires of hell,</hi> neither in <hi>body,</hi> nor in <hi>soul,</hi> nor in both united. Not in his <hi>Person</hi> in this life, nor his <hi>soul</hi> singly by it self whilest he lived amongst us. For <hi>hell fire</hi> is not to be found but in <hi>hell</hi> it self, and neither soul nor body were in <hi>hell,</hi> when he was alive.

He that is punished for his own faults hath <hi>remorse of conscience,</hi> condemning himself of drawing such <hi>guilt</hi> upon his <hi>soul,</hi> and with that <hi>guilt</hi> such miseries both on soul and body: but he that suffereth for the fault of another man, of which he is no cause at all, either by perswasion, help, consent, or example; hath no such <hi>remorse.</hi> Now our Redeemer

suffered for the sins of other men, and not for any of his own; and consequently was not touched with <hi>remorse of conscience,</hi> though it be generally found in all men at one time or another, and be neither sin, nor inducement to sin. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, these punishments which are <hi>punishments only,</hi> and not sin, such as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the whole nature of man, and suffered for the faults of another man, are of two sorts also: either the <hi>punishments</hi> of sin <hi>eternally remaining</hi> in stain or guilt; or <hi>ceasing,</hi> at the least broken off by unfaigned <hi>repentance.</hi> Those of the first sort according to the rules of <hi>Divine justice,</hi> must be <hi>eternal</hi> in regard of dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by consequence accompanyed with <hi>desperation,</hi> which is always found where there is an impossibility of ever coming to enjoy a better estate: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is not any way necessary, nor doth the justice of God require it, that the punishments of sin which is <hi>repented</hi> of, <hi>ceasing</hi> and forsaken, should be either everlasting, or joyned with <hi>despair.</hi> For as in every act of sin, on the <hi>aversion</hi> from God who is <hi>objectively</hi> infinite and incommutably good, there followeth <hi>poena damni,</hi> or the loss of God, which is an <hi>infinite</hi> loss; and as to the <hi>inordinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> of the sinner to things transitory, which must needs be <hi>finite,</hi> there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth <hi>poena sensus,</hi> which though violent and bitter for a time, is yet <hi>finite</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: so to the eternity of sin <hi>remaining everlastingly</hi> in s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that though every sinner sinneth <hi>in suo aeterno,</hi> as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh <note n="(u)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Gregor. in Iob. l.</hi> 34. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note>, in that he would <hi>sin ever might he live for ever</hi>: and thereby casts himself into an <hi>impossibility</hi> of giving off in himself, and consequently into an <hi>eternity</hi> of punishment which is due to him for the same: yet if he make such use of the grace of God as to <hi>cease from sin,</hi> and turn from his iniquities to the living Lord, Gods justice may require <hi>extremity</hi> of punishment proportionable to the sin committed, but the <hi>eternity</hi> of punishment it requireth not. And therefore seeing our Saviour suffered for such sins (and for such alone) as might be broken off by grace and the benefit of true repentance, it was no way necessary to the satisfaction of the Divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God, that he should endure eternal punishment. Which being sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med together make a perfect answer to the question formerly proposed, that is to say, <hi>Whether</hi> Christ <hi>ought to suffer all those punishments</hi> for the redemption of man, <hi>which man himself must needs have suffered</hi> had not <hi>Christ</hi> come to redeem him. The summe of which is briefly this, that <hi>Christ</hi> suffered the whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral punishment of sin, that onely excepted which is sin, or consequent on the <hi>inherence</hi> and <hi>eternity</hi> of it, as <hi>remorse of conscience</hi> and <hi>despair</hi>: and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he did not suffer the <hi>pains of Hell,</hi> or any punishment of the <hi>damned,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in specie,</hi> or in <hi>loco</hi>: yet did he undergo some punishments conformable and answerable to them in <hi>extremity,</hi> as the apprehension of the wrath and anger of the Lord avenging himself upon the sinner, but neither <hi>infinite</hi> nor <hi>eternal,</hi> as the <hi>rejection</hi> of a sinner from the sight of God.</p>
                     <p>Against this truth thus stated and determined by us, there remain only two objections: the one relating generally to the doctrine of <hi>Christs descent into hell,</hi> the other to it as it stands established in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And first as to the Doctrine generally it is thus objected, that if there were no more in the <hi>sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> then the submitting of himself to a <hi>bodily death,</hi> and to the anger of the Lord for so short a season; it could not possibly occasion such a <hi>consternation,</hi> such a <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>horrour,</hi> as he expressed both in the <hi>Garden</hi> and upon the <hi>Cross:</hi> or if he did, how infinitely short must he fall of that <hi>magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,</hi> which is found in ordinary <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59300:152"/>
and punctual answer. And first we say for <hi>Malefactors,</hi> that God doth many times give them over to a <hi>reprobate sense,</hi> so that they carelessely seeme to contemn Gods judgements in this present world, and so prepare themselves more fully for the judgments of the world to come. As for the <hi>Martyrs</hi> they know well that the wrath of God towards them is appeased by <hi>Christ</hi>; that they shall feel no more but the hands of men; and that as the <hi>cruelty</hi> of men increaseth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, so God doth give them <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> to undergo what ever shall be laid upon them: whereas <hi>CHRIST</hi> was to satisfie Gods wrath for the <hi>sins of mankinde,</hi> to undergo the punishment which was due unto them (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>limitations</hi> before laid down) and not alone to fall into the hands of <hi>men,</hi> but to endure a bitter conflict with the powers of <hi>hell,</hi> which did on every side assault him; which never any <hi>Martyr</hi> was markt out to do. Next in relation to this doctrine as now it stands established in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it is objected, that howsoever the <hi>Articles</hi> of Religion in King <hi>Edwards</hi> days, might seem to intimate a <hi>local descent</hi> into <hi>hell,</hi> according to the sense of the Antient <hi>Fathers</hi>: yet no such thing could be inferred from the present <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi> established in the form and manner declared before. Their reason is, because that allegation of St. <hi>Peters</hi> words touching <hi>Christs preaching to the spirits in prison,</hi> which was contained in the Book of King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, to shew what manner of <hi>descent</hi> it was they meant, is totally left out in the present <hi>Article</hi> established in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>

                        </note>. This they conceive to be an <hi>evident decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> that the Church doth not now <hi>understand</hi> that <hi>Article,</hi> as at first it did: and therefore since it doth not mean such a <hi>local descent,</hi> as hath been hitherto main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this discourse, it may be construed in that sense which they put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. To which we need but answer this, that the words alleadged from St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the former <hi>Article,</hi> were omitted by the <hi>Synod</hi> in the late Queenes times, not because they did not so <hi>understand the Article,</hi> as both their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors and the <hi>Fathers</hi> did: but either because <hi>Christs preaching to the spirits in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> seemed to be set down for the sole reason of his <hi>descent into hell</hi>: or that they thought not fit to impose that for the meaning of St. <hi>Peters</hi> words, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived of necessity by all good people in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> As for the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their <hi>own sense</hi> upon it (as indeed they do) I will but adde this <hi>declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Injunction</hi> of his Sacred Majesty; that is to say, that <hi>no man shall hereafter either print or preach to draw the</hi> Articles aside any way, <hi>but shall submit unto it in</hi> the plain and full meaning <hi>thereof: and shall not</hi> put his own sense <hi>or comment to be the meaning of the</hi> Article, <hi>but shall take it in the</hi> literal <hi>and Grammatical sense.</hi> With which expression I conclude this long <hi>dissertation.</hi>

So that the <hi>high Priest</hi> did not prophecie amisse when he said this of him, <hi>It is expedient that</hi> one man do die <hi>for the people</hi>

And so accordingly it was done, Gods wrath thereby appeased, poor mankinde saved: and <hi>Christ,</hi> like <hi>Ionas,</hi> having lain <hi>three days and three</hi> nights in the <hi>heart of the earth,</hi> did on the <hi>third day</hi> rise again; and by so doing vanquished <hi>death,</hi> and swallowed up the <hi>grave</hi> in <hi>victory.</hi> But this particular we shall hereafter meet with, and more fully speak of when we are come unto the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>; of which this of the time the <hi>third day,</hi> is the most materiall. I add this only for the present in respect of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who being by <hi>Christ</hi> foretold of his <hi>resurrection,</hi> and in so evident a <hi>type</hi> thereof as this <hi>Signum Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetae,</hi> this <hi>signe of the Prophet Ionas,</hi> as himself entitles it, could look with an <hi>Historical faith</hi> on the <hi>resurrection</hi> of the Prophet out of the <hi>belly of the Whale,</hi> and yet give no <hi>belief</hi> unto that of <hi>Christ</hi> out of the <hi>bowels of the earth</hi>; though testifyed and confirmed unto them by such pregnant evidence. And yet I shall crave leave to add, that if <hi>Ionah</hi> was the Widow of <hi>Sereptas</hi> son, he whom <hi>Elias</hi> raised from <hi>death to life,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. as many of the <hi>Iewish Doctors</hi> do affirme he was: the <hi>parallel</hi> will yet come closer then before it did. For <hi>Ionas</hi> in the <hi>Whales belly</hi> was but dead <hi>putative,</hi> in the esteem and eye of men; but in the <hi>Widowes Chamber</hi> he was dead <hi>realiter,</hi> and so more perfectly resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him whose <hi>signe</hi> he was.</p>
                     <p>This leads me on to the next way of evidence in regard of the <hi>Iew,</hi> which is that of <hi>example.</hi> Themselves had read in holy Scripture, and <hi>believed</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, that <hi>Elias</hi> 
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">1 Kings 17.</note> had restored from death to life the son of the <hi>Sareptan</hi> woman, whosoever he was: and that <hi>Elisha</hi> did not only work the like wonder on the dead child of the <hi>Shunamite</hi> 
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">2 King. 4.34, &amp;c.</note>, but that his <hi>dead body</hi> did revive a man, and raised him also from the grave <note n="(i)" place="margin">2 King. 13.21.</note>. And to this head we may reduce the more then wonderfull deliverance of <hi>Daniel</hi> from the <hi>Lyons den,</hi> and the three <hi>Hebrew Salamanders</hi> from the <hi>fierie furnace</hi>; all of them <hi>putative</hi> dead, all of them ransomed by the Lord from the mercilesse furie of the <hi>grave</hi> and jawes of <hi>death</hi>; and that miraculous deliverance no lesse to be esteemed then a <hi>Resurrection.</hi> To each of these the <hi>Iews</hi> most readily give assent. How then can
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59300:155"/>
they deny it unto this of <hi>Christ</hi>? Assuredly it was as possible to God to <hi>raise</hi> our Saviour <hi>from the dead</hi> (if we consider him no further then a <hi>mortall man</hi>) as to <hi>raise</hi> dead bodies by the prayers of the Prophets, and by the dead carkasse of <hi>Elisha</hi>; or as it had been to reprieve <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>three children</hi> from the hands of death. Why then do they denie it unto this of <hi>Christ</hi>? Not because they did not think it <hi>possible,</hi> but because they would not have it <hi>believed.</hi> It stood not with their <hi>interesse</hi> and private ends to have it passe for currant with the common people. Our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> had been too di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, as they thought, in the discharge of his great office, in the discovery and <hi>anatomizing</hi> of their corruptions and impieties: and they were loath to have his <hi>doctrine justifyed</hi> by so great a <hi>miracle.</hi> Rather then so, to save their <hi>superstitions</hi> they will lose themselves, <hi>Non tam de suis Religionibus bene meriti, quam de se male</hi>

improved into a <hi>Faith.</hi> The business is how to accommodate the time of his being in the grave to the <hi>three days and three nights</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Ionah,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the intimation which himself had made; how to finde out those <hi>three days</hi> which the Scripture speaks of. For being that our Saviour was interred on the <hi>sixt day</hi> (or <hi>Friday</hi>) about Sun-setting, and rose again the first day (<hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>) about the rising of the Sun or a little before it: the longest time of his <hi>imprisonment</hi> in the grave can be but thirty six or thrice twelve <hi>houres,</hi> which comes exceeding short of <hi>three days and nights.</hi> To salve this sore there hath been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny several <hi>plasters</hi> made by the learned Writers and <hi>Interpreters</hi> of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: every one thinking best of that which himself prescribeth, and finding some exceptions against those, which have, perhaps, as happily been devised by others. Some do conceive our Saviours lying in the womb of the earth may be most clearly resolved by that construction, which <hi>Lawyers</hi> sometimes make in <hi>Favorabilibus,</hi> for the <hi>greater part</hi> of three days and nights: so that if he continued in the heart of the earth but an hour or less, above the six and thirty houres before accounted, he then made good the <hi>sign</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Ionah,</hi> according to the <hi>Legal construction</hi> of it. And some there be (and those indeed the most in number) which think they have resolved the doubt by that <hi>Synecdoche</hi> which is allowed in <hi>common cases,</hi> where the part is reckoned for the whole: as if a man should make an <hi>Affidavit</hi> (as we use to call it) that he had <hi>attended in the Court three days</hi> together, it could not be intended nor interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he attended three <hi>whole days</hi> from morning to evening, but only at such competent hours in every day, as my <hi>Lords the Iudges</hi> use to sit. The reason of which <hi>Legal allowances</hi> and Rhetorical <hi>Synecdoches</hi> is grounded upon this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable rule of <hi>Logick,</hi> i. e. <hi>Ad veritatem</hi> indefinitae <hi>Propositionis astruendam sufficit veritas unius</hi> vel <hi>alterius particularis.</hi> And then according unto this <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche</hi> or just allowance, our Saviour both in a <hi>Logical</hi> and a <hi>Legal</hi> constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be truly said to be <hi>three days</hi> and <hi>three nights</hi> in the bowels of the earth, that is to say, some part of <hi>Friday,</hi> all <hi>Saturday,</hi> and some part of <hi>Sunday.</hi> And this hath generally been entertained for the clearest and most expedite <hi>solution</hi> of the present difficultie <note n="(p)" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>But against this it is objected, not without good reason, that this <hi>solution</hi> of the doubt without some further ground first laid, comes not home enough, but leaves it as unsatisfied as before it was. For though this may be good as unto the <hi>days</hi> in which our Saviours blessed body was interred in the grave, yet neither by a <hi>Logical</hi> nor a <hi>Legal</hi> allowance can it reach at all unto <hi>three nights</hi>: he being in the grave <hi>two whole nights</hi> indeed; but not the least part of any <hi>third night,</hi> as is plain in Scripture. Therefore to bring the business home, they who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the former <hi>Exposition,</hi> do it on this reason, that contrary to the account and computation of the antient <hi>Iews,</hi> the night is distinguished from the day; whereas indeed according to their <hi>Calculation,</hi> the night is but a part of the day ensuing, (<hi>And the evening and the morning were the first day, Et sic de caeteris</hi>) both of them making up together but one <hi>natural day.</hi> So that when <hi>Christ</hi> said unto the <hi>Iews,</hi> that the Son of man should be <hi>three days and three nights</hi> in the heart of the earth; he only meant <hi>three natural days,</hi> reckoning according as the <hi>Iews</hi> did, unto whom he spake, who began their <hi>natural day</hi> at the Sun-setting. Which ground so laid, the former <hi>Legal</hi> allowance or <hi>Synecdoche</hi> serves exceeding fitly, our Saviour being in the grave part of the sixt evening and morning, or the sixt night and day conjunct, which was the <hi>Friday,</hi> or the day whereupon he suffered; the whole seventh evening and morning, or the seventh night and day which was the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> or <hi>Saturday</hi>; and the

                     <p>Some other ways have been found out to salve this doubt, and such as <hi>seem</hi> more handsomely to decide the <hi>Controversie,</hi> then any of the three before deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. But whether they do so <hi>indeed,</hi> or rather doe not leave the matter more perplext and difficult, I will not take upon me to determine in it; but leave the matter wholly to the Readers judgement. But amongst these I must profess that I can by no means reckon that of <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> (be it spoken with due reverence to that holy man) who to make up the <hi>three days</hi> and the <hi>three nights</hi> which our Saviour speaks of, makes that to be the <hi>first night</hi> in which he kept the <hi>Passeover</hi> with his Disciples, and in the instituting of his holy Supper, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>offered himselfe in</hi> sacrifice <hi>for the sins of man.</hi> The <hi>second night</hi> he makes to be that terrible <hi>darkness,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from the <hi>sixt houre</hi> unto the <hi>ninth,</hi> and divided that day into two, the first begining at Sun-rising, and ending at the sixt hour when that <hi>darkness</hi> began; the other beginning at that <hi>ninth</hi> hour (about three of the clock in the afternoon) and holding on untill Sun-set. The <hi>third night</hi> which was indeed the very first) he makes to be the night which preceded the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (or <hi>Friday night</hi> in our account:) and so conceives that he hath found <hi>three days</hi> and <hi>three nights</hi> which our Saviour rested in the <hi>grave,</hi> fixing his <hi>Resurrection</hi> in the <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, which after their Calculation was the beginning of the <hi>first day of the week,</hi> by us called Sunday. So he iu his Oration <hi>de Christi Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrectione.</hi> Which <hi>resolution</hi> of the doubt, (if I may so call it) the good <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> doth not offer as a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> but leaves it to the Readers judgement, (<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>) and so do I. The first of those I shall first lay down is Dr. <hi>Alabasters,</hi> who with a great deal of good <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> had many whimseys in his Brain, as may appear to any one who hath read the book, which he entituled <hi>Ecce Sponsus venit.</hi> And his opinion is, that the <hi>three days and three nights</hi> which our Saviour speaks of, are to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted <hi>Secundum universas Coeli plagas</hi>

From six of the clock on <hi>Friday</hi> night (upon our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) till six of the clock on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, it was night in all the land of <hi>Iewrie,</hi> and day with their <hi>Antipodes</hi> in the other <hi>Hemisphere,</hi> which makes the first night and the first day. From six of the clock on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, till six that night, was night with the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and day in <hi>Iewrie</hi>; which makes

the second day and the second night; and then from six of the clock on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> night till six next morning, which was about the time of our Saviours rising, it was night again amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> and day again with their <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> which makes the third night, and the third day. This if you take for a <hi>Capricio,</hi> as indeed the Doctor hath too many throughout that Book; Let us next look on that of <hi>Paulus Semproniensis,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Friuli,</hi> according as by him laid down in his Book, <hi>de Die Passionis Domini,</hi> where he states it thus; <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Paulina Pauli, &amp;c. l</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note>
                        <q>The <hi>Iews</hi> (saith he) being spoiled and <hi>plundered</hi> of their books, during the <hi>Babylonian Captivity,</hi> and thereby disabled from finding out the true course of the <hi>Moon,</hi> otherwise then by such <hi>conjectures</hi> as the Eye and their observations did afford them; and consequently failing oftentimes in celebrating of the <hi>Passeover</hi> at the time appointed by the Law; ordained that that <hi>festival</hi> should be kept <hi>two whole days</hi> together, that if they chanced to erre in the one, they might hit right in the other. And these <hi>two dayes</hi> they reckoned but for one alone, as do the <hi>Romans</hi> at this time in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Bissextile</hi> or <hi>Leap-year,</hi> (as we use to call it) who according to the Calculation of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> reckon the two days of the <hi>Bissextile</hi> but for one alone, (and so 'tis also in the estimate of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> to this very day).</q>
Insomuch that <hi>February</hi> for that year, by the decree of the said <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> is to have no more then 28 days, (as in other years) because the day added unto that moneth, (or the <hi>dies intercalaris,</hi> as the learned call it) is to be reckoned for the same day with the day before, both of them being called the <hi>sixt of the Calender of March,</hi> in which respect the name of <hi>Dies Bissextilis</hi> was first given unto it. And on this ground it was resolved by <hi>Celsus</hi> that famous Lawyer, that if a man was born on the sixt of the <hi>Calends of March,</hi> (which is our 24. of <hi>February</hi>) it mattered not whether he were born on the first or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of the two (that year) <hi>because both days were counted</hi> in the Law <hi>for one.</hi> So saith he, in like manner did the <hi>Iews</hi> reckon those two days in which they solemnized the <hi>Passeover,</hi> but for <hi>one day</hi> only, both of them passing in their <hi>computation</hi> for the <hi>fifteenth</hi> day of the month, in which that <hi>feast</hi> was to be celebrated by the law of <hi>Moses.</hi> This he confirms not only by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the modern <hi>Iews,</hi> who for the most part hold themselves to this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, fathering it on <hi>Ezra</hi> the <hi>Scribe</hi> as ordained by him; but also by the testimony of <hi>Rabbi Rava,</hi> one of the most famous Doctors of that Nation, for the times he lived in, advising them <hi>Ne deserant consuetudinem a</hi> Patribus <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatam,</hi> not to forsake the old Tradition left them by their Ancestors of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great festivals <hi>two whole days</hi> together, according as <hi>Ezra</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. And this they also did (saith he) if the <hi>Passeover</hi> fell upon the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> in which case at the instance and perswasion of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a man both learned in the laws, and skilful in <hi>Astrological</hi> supputations, they did not only double or re-iterate the feast of the <hi>Passeover,</hi> but that of the <hi>weekly Sabbath</hi> also. Which gave (saith he) occasion to that phrase of speech used by S. <hi>Mark</hi> where he cals the first day of the week <hi>una Sabbatorum,</hi> that is to say the first day after <hi>both the Sabbaths.</hi> He addes as in the way of <hi>super-aboundance,</hi> that it was affirmed in the writing of <hi>Theophilus Caesariensis</hi> (a man exceedingly well skilled in the <hi>Paschal</hi> Cycles) that our Redeemer suffered on the <hi>eleventh of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of April,</hi> (which is to us the 22. day of <hi>March</hi>) and rose again <hi>March</hi> 25. being the 8. <hi>day</hi> of the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>April</hi>; which make up <hi>three days</hi> and <hi>three nights</hi> in all): but that his words were altered by <hi>Beda,</hi> in his <hi>Translation</hi> of that piece, to make it more conformable to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is the sum of his discourse, with which I must confess my self to be much delighted. And were I aswell satisfied in the <hi>Allegation</hi> of <hi>Theophilus Caesariensis,</hi> and the alteration made by <hi>Beda,</hi> as I am in the residue of the proofs by him produced, I might perhaps prefer this way before any other.

So that the <hi>Earthquake</hi> of it self being great and terrible, and made more terrible by the <hi>rising</hi> of so many <hi>dead men</hi> from the bonds of death; no marvell if the <hi>Souldiers</hi> of the guard were amazed and terrifyed, and in that fright betook themselves unto their heels, and forsook their charge. At first indeed the affright and astonishment was so great upon them, that they <hi>seemed even as dead men,</hi> as the text informes us <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 28.4.</note>. But the first terrors being over, we finde them presently in the City with the <hi>chief Priests</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> declaring the sad news of their ill successe, and publishing the glorious wonder of the <hi>resurrection.</hi> So wonderfull was the providence of Almighty God, that those means which were projected for an <hi>hinderance</hi> of the resurrection, should add unto the fame and glory of so great a miracle; and that those very <hi>Souldiers</hi> which were hired to guard the <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> should be the first <hi>Evangelists</hi> (if I may so call them) by whom that <hi>miracle</hi> was signifyed to that stubborn nation. And yet God had a further end then this in the great hast made by the affrighted Souldiers to the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi>; which was by their departure from the holy Sepulchre, to give the safer opportunity to his <hi>Disciples</hi> (who were to be the <hi>witnesses of his</hi> resurrection <hi>both to Iew and Gentile</hi>) to satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the truth thereof. For though the <hi>women</hi> might presume on the <hi>Souldiers gentlenesse,</hi> (who commonly are faire conditioned to that sex) yet for the <hi>Apostles</hi> to adventure thither till the <hi>Souldiers</hi> of the guard were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from thence, had been to run themselves in the mouth of danger, and make themselves obnoxious to the <hi>accusation</hi> of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Pharisees.</hi> And this was a remote cause of the honour which befell <hi>that sex,</hi> in being first acquainted with the <hi>news</hi> of the <hi>resurrection</hi>; and is another of the <hi>circumstances</hi> which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the action. God certainly had so disposed it in his heavenly wisdome, that as a <hi>woman</hi> was first made the <hi>Devils instrument</hi> to perswade man to <hi>sin,</hi> and consequently unto <hi>death</hi>: so the <hi>same sex</hi> also should become the <hi>instruments</hi> of publishing this glad news that the <hi>Lord was risen</hi>; and the assurance thereby given of a <hi>resurrection</hi> to all mankinde from the hands of death. Withall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>power</hi> of Almighty God, never so clearly manifested in the sight of men as in the <hi>weaknesse</hi> of his iustruments: and that although it was a work sufficient for the ablest <hi>Prophet</hi> to foretell the <hi>resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> yet was it so easie when accomplished, that ignorant and <hi>silly women,</hi> and more then so, that <hi>women laden with sins,</hi> should be the first that did proclaime it. And there was somewhat in that too, that <hi>Christ</hi> first shewed himself unto <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> 
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh. 20.16.</note>, a woman so infamous for her former life, that she is branded in Scripture by the name of <hi>Peccatrix</hi>

kinde as <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> For this he did (no doubt) to let mankind know, that there is no <hi>sinner so great</hi> whosoever he be, to whom (if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of his former sinnes) the <hi>fruit</hi> and benefit of <hi>Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> ought not to be <hi>extended</hi> and applyed: though some <hi>restraine</hi> the same to some <hi>certain Quidams,</hi> men more of their election, then Almighty Gods. Whereas the Scriptures plainly tell us, that as <hi>in Adam all dyed,</hi> so by <hi>Christ all men shall be restored to life</hi> 
                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.19, 20.</note>; who being <hi>risen from the dead</hi> is become the <hi>first fruits of all them that slept.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here perhaps it will be said, How can our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> be called the <hi>first fruits of them that sleep,</hi> considering how many severall persons had been <hi>raised from the dead</hi> before, both in the old Testament and in the new? The answer unto this is easie and the difference great between them and <hi>Christ,</hi> their being raised from the dead, and his resurrection. For first, our Saviour rose again from the dead, <hi>virtute propria,</hi> by his ownproper power and virtue, but they were raised again to life, <hi>virtute aliena,</hi> by the power and ministry of some other. In which regard, we read notin the story of his <hi>resurrection,</hi> that he <hi>was raised</hi> from the dead, as if he had been wholly <hi>passive</hi> in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and did contribute no more to it then did the <hi>Shunamites</hi> child or the daughter of <hi>Iairus</hi>: but <hi>resurrexit</hi> he was <hi>risen,</hi> or had <hi>raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> which sheweth him to have been the principall <hi>Agent.</hi> Nor let it stumble any one that in some places of the holy Scripture the <hi>Father</hi> is said to <hi>raise him,</hi> as in <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <note n="(f)" place="margin">V. 25.</note> Both will stand well enough together. For by the <hi>same power</hi> that the <hi>Father</hi> is said to have done it, by the same was it done also by the <hi>Son.</hi> I and my <hi>Father are one</hi> 
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Joh. 10.30.</note>, but <hi>one power</hi> of both; and therefore whether it were done by both or by either of them, it comes all to one. Secondly, <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour did so rise from the dead, as to <hi>die no more,</hi> to have an everlasting freedome from the power of death; whereas others have been raised from death to life, but to <hi>die again.</hi> Christ <hi>being raised from the dead</hi> (saith the great Apostle) <hi>dyeth no more; death hath no more</hi> dominion <hi>over him</hi> 
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Rom. 6.9.</note>. He is not only free from death, or the <hi>act</hi> of dying, but from the <hi>pains,</hi> perils, and the <hi>fears</hi> of death, and all those sicknesses and sorrows which make way unto it. But so it was not with the son of the widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> or of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Naim,</hi> no nor with <hi>Lazarus</hi> his most dear friend neither, who though they were restored again to this <hi>mortal life,</hi> yet it was still a <hi>mortal life</hi> when it was at best; and that <hi>mortality</hi> was to them as the <hi>Prisoners chain,</hi> by which he is pulled back again though he chance to scape. He only did <hi>so rise again</hi> as by his <hi>rising</hi> to destroy death, and to cloath himself with <hi>immortality.</hi> Thirdly, though some were raised before under both <hi>Testaments,</hi> yet that was but a <hi>private benefit</hi> to themselves alone, or perhaps unto their Parents or some few of their friends; yet the fruit and benefit thereof did extend no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But by the <hi>resurrection</hi> of our Lord and Saviour, there came a signall benefit unto all the world, which else had been fast bound for ever in the bonds of <hi>death,</hi> without any hope of <hi>rising</hi> to a better life. For being <hi>risen</hi> in our nature, then <hi>our nature</hi> is ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <note n="(i)" place="margin">Rom. 6.4.</note>, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us) so <hi>graffed</hi> into one another, that he is part of us, and we part of him. And therefore very well said <hi>Bernard, Resurrexit solus, sed non totus.</hi> Though he be <hi>only risen,</hi> by his own proper power, yet as yet he is not <hi>risen wholly,</hi> nor will be untill we be raised together with him. He is but <hi>risen in part</hi> by this resurrection; and that he may rise <hi>all of him,</hi> he must <hi>raise tis</hi> also. In this respect our Saviour is entituled <hi>Primogenitus omnis Creaturae</hi> 
                        <note n="(l)" place="margin">Col. 1.15.</note>, the first born or <hi>first begotten</hi> of <hi>every creature: viz.</hi> first in the <hi>order of time,</hi> he being the first that was ever raised from death unto life immortall; and first also in the <hi>order of causality,</hi> all others which have been, or shall be raised or <hi>begotten</hi> to immortall life, being so raised and begotten by vertue of his <hi>resurrection.</hi> And in the same respect he is called <hi>Primitiae dormientium,</hi> or the <hi>first fruits of them that sleep</hi>; because his <hi>rising</hi> is not only the pledge and earnest of our <hi>rising</hi>
                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:59300:161"/>
also, but that we shall be raised to the same state of happinesse and eternall glory, which he hath attained since his rising. The offering of the <hi>first fruits</hi> drew a blessing upon all the rest. For if the <hi>first fruits</hi> be <hi>holy, the lumpe</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is also holy</hi> 
                        <note n="(m)" place="margin">Rom. 11.16.</note>. If then the <hi>first fruits</hi> of the <hi>dead</hi> be offered to Almighty God, in <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour; no question but the <hi>after-fruits,</hi> or the whole increase will be very acceptable, and <hi>laid up in the barn</hi> of that heavenly husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note n="(n)" place="margin">Mat. 13.30.</note>, according to the scope of our Saviours Parable. And yet perhaps St. <hi>Paul</hi> might have a further aime in calling our Saviour the <hi>first-fruits of them that sleep,</hi> then hath yet been spoke of: it hapning so by the sweet disposition of Gods <hi>special providence,</hi> that the day of his glorious <hi>resurrection</hi> did fall that year upon the second day of the <hi>feast</hi> of <hi>unleavened bread,</hi> or the morrow after the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of that great solemnity: upon which day, the <hi>first-fruits</hi> were to be offered unto God by his own appointment. Of which see <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.10, 11.</p>
                     <p>Here then we have the principall effect and fruit of <hi>Christs resurrection,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of our <hi>own bodies</hi> from the power of death, the resurrection both of <hi>soul and body</hi> to eternall life. And yet there are some other <hi>intermediate</hi> benefits which redound to us, some other motives and inducements which relate to him. For his part first, had he not <hi>risen from the dead,</hi> he had still lain under the guilt of that <hi>imposture</hi> 
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">Mat. 27.63.</note>, wherewith the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> charged him, when he was interred. And who would then have preached his Gospel, or embraced his doctrine, or yeelded belief to any thing he had said before? For if <hi>Christ be not risen from the dead again,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> reasoneth very strongly) then were <hi>our faith in vain</hi>; and their <hi>preaching vain</hi> 
                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.14.</note>. Had he not <hi>risen from the</hi> dead, and manifested it by such signes and wonders, he never had attained to the reputation of being generally accounted and <hi>believed</hi> in, for the <hi>Son of God</hi>: or such a God at best who doth die <hi>like men</hi> 
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Psal. 82.6.</note>, and <hi>fall like others of the Princes</hi>; some <hi>earthly Magistrate</hi> at the most, and no great one neither. Nor was it necessary to his <hi>glory</hi> only, but to our <hi>justification.</hi> For how could we assure our selves of salvation by him, or of <hi>redemption</hi> in his bloud; had he been swallowed up in <hi>death,</hi> and not appeared alive again for our <hi>consolation?

How could we <hi>Christians,</hi> of all men <hi>most miserable,</hi> be possibly assured of this saving truth, that <hi>Christ was delivered for our sins, if he had not risen again for our justification</hi>

Either of these <hi>constructions</hi> will atone the difference, and reconcile the <hi>Creed</hi> with the words of the Text: though we may further add, and <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that St. <hi>Luke</hi> doth not only say <hi>ferebatur in Coelum,</hi> or he was <hi>carryed up</hi> into Heaven, as if he were <hi>passive</hi> in it only; but that <hi>Recessit ab iis</hi> first <note n="(q)" place="margin">Luk. 24.51.</note>, he <hi>left them</hi> of his own accord, gave the <hi>first rise</hi> to his Ascension, and after <hi>ferebatur</hi> (for so it followeth) suffered himself to be <hi>assumpted,</hi> taken or carryed up into Heaven, either by the <hi>Cloud</hi> or by the <hi>Angels,</hi> or how else he pleased. Lastly, it is to be observed, that he <hi>ascended</hi> into Heaven, <hi>videntibus illis</hi> saith the Text, whilest his Apostles <hi>looked on</hi>: to signifie that he did <hi>ascend by little and little,</hi> that he might feed their eyes, and refresh their souls, and by his <hi>leisurely ascent,</hi> make them more able to attest it, as occasion served. For had he been caught up into Heaven as <hi>Elias</hi> was <note n="(r)" place="margin">2 King. 2.11.</note>, who had but <hi>one witness</hi> to affirm it, or <hi>rapt up</hi> into Heaven, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was afterwards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any witness but himself, and scarce that neither, (for whether it were <hi>in the body,</hi> or <hi>out of the body</hi>

But here perhaps it will be objected, that either <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> were not taken up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> and so no <hi>Types</hi> and figures of the Lords <hi>Ascension</hi>: or if they were, then was not <hi>Christ</hi> the first which <hi>opened the gates of</hi> Heaven, and <hi>ascended</hi> thither in his body, to make a way for others in due time to follow; as all <hi>Antiquity</hi> in a manner do affirm he was, grounding their judgement on the evident and plain texts of Scripture. For doth not the <hi>Apostle</hi> expressely say, that the <hi>way into the</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest of all <hi>was not yet manifest, while the</hi> first Tabernacle was <hi>yet standing, Heb.</hi> 9.8.

How then were <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> Types of <hi>Christs Ascension,</hi> if they were not <hi>taken up</hi> into Heaven? or how was <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> if they there before him? Our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> himself makes answer unto this objection, where he saith, that in his <hi>Fathers house there were many mansions</hi> 
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Joh. 14.2.</note>: that is to say, several <hi>degrees of happiness</hi> and estates in glory, though all most glorious in themselves. To some of which <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>happiness,</hi> and estates in glory, unto some one or other of those heavenly <hi>Mansions,</hi> both <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> were by God <hi>translated,</hi> there's no doubt of that; the Scripture is expressely for it. But that they were <hi>in Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losummo,</hi> in the highest Heaven, that unto which the Lord <hi>ascended,</hi> and where he now <hi>sitteth at the right hand of God</hi> the Father, that as the Scriptures doe not say, so there is no <hi>necessity</hi> why we should believe it. Our Saviour was the first who <hi>ascended thither</hi>; that place of <hi>supreme glory</hi> being typified in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> and by that entituled, as before we saw, unto which <hi>none might enter</hi> but the <hi>High Priest</hi> only.</p>
                     <p>From Types proceed we next unto the way of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and there we finde assured proof not only for the <hi>Substance</hi> of the Lords <hi>Ascension,</hi> but for every <hi>Circumstance.</hi> First for the <hi>substance,</hi> thus saith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 24. <hi>Lift up your heads O you</hi> gates, <hi>and be you lift up you</hi> Everlasting doores, <hi>and the King of</hi> Glory <hi>shall come in.</hi> Who is the King of Glory? <hi>the Lord strong and mighty,</hi> the <hi>Lord mighty in battel.</hi> Which Psalm as it was framed by that sweet singer of <hi>Israel,</hi> on the reduction of the Ark to the City of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>literally</hi> meant of the <hi>Gates of the Tabernacle,</hi> through which the Ark, the <hi>glory of the Lord of</hi> Hosts, was to have its entrance; so was it <hi>mystically</hi> and <hi>Prophetically</hi> spoken of our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> who in a mighty battel had subdued all the powers of <hi>hell</hi>; and afterwards by his <hi>Ascension</hi> did set open the <hi>Gates of Heaven</hi>; as all the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> generally down from <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> do expound the place. The <hi>Gates</hi>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:59300:164"/>
were <hi>lift up</hi> in the Psalm, for <hi>the King of glory,</hi> and opened in the Gospel <hi>for the Lord of glory</hi> 
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.8.</note>, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> with some reference to the <hi>Psalmist</hi> cals him. Where by the way, I think we need not go much further to resolve a doubt, which hath been made by some in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; that is to say, whether the <hi>Heavens did open</hi> to make way to our Saviours passage, <hi>an vero sine diversione eos penetravit</hi> 
                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">

But unto this, the <hi>lifting up of the Gates</hi> gives a ready answer, and such an answer as hath countenance from the Gospel also. For if the <hi>Heavens were opened</hi> to make way for the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God to <hi>descend upon him</hi> at his Baptism <note n="(f)" place="margin">Mat. 3.16.</note>, as we know it was: with how much greater reason must they then be <hi>opened,</hi> when he <hi>ascended into Heaven</hi> not in <hi>Spirit</hi> only, but also in his <hi>body,</hi> in his <hi>humane nature?</hi> Next for the <hi>circumstances</hi> which occur in the Lords <hi>Ascension,</hi> we have the <hi>time</hi> thereof, the <hi>fortieth day</hi> precisely from his Resurrection, <hi>prefigured</hi> in the <hi>forty days</hi> of respit which God gave to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> before he purposed to destroy it. The correspondence or <hi>resemblance</hi> doth stand thus between them, that as God gave the <hi>Ninivites</hi> forty days of <hi>Repentance,</hi> after the miraculous deliverance of <hi>Ionah</hi> from the <hi>belly of the Whale,</hi> had (in all probability) been made known unto them to confirm his <hi>Preaching</hi>: so he gave <hi>forty days</hi> to the <hi>Iews</hi> also after <hi>Christs Resurrection,</hi> to see if they would turn from their sins, or not; before he did withdraw the presence of their Saviour from them, and lay them open to that <hi>desolation,</hi> which he had denounced against them for their wickedness. And this I am the more confirmed in by another passage of this kinde, in the Book of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where it is said, <hi>Thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of</hi> Judah forty days <note n="(g)" place="margin">Ezek. 4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All I shall add now in brief is this, that they which did <hi>ascend</hi> in our Saviours train, and made up a great part of his glorious <hi>triumph</hi>; were either his <hi>Souldiers,</hi> or his <hi>Captives.</hi> His <hi>Souldiers</hi> I call those of the <hi>Saints departed,</hi> whose <hi>graves</hi> were <hi>opened</hi> at the time of his <hi>resurrection,</hi> who being united to their bodies <hi>rose, and came out of the their</hi> graves <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 27.53.</note>, <hi>and went into the</hi> holy City, <hi>and appeared unto many.</hi> It was not probable that they were raised from the dead, <hi>to die again</hi>; much lesse to be left wandering up and down the earth, as if they had no certain <hi>ubi</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto. Nor could they <hi>ascend into the heavens</hi> before our Saviour; who as <hi>in all things,</hi> so in that also was to <hi>have the preeminence.</hi> They must then <hi>ascend with him</hi> as a part of his train; and go in with the <hi>Bridegroome,</hi> as the <hi>wise Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> did, when the <hi>doors were open.</hi> For my part I can see no reason why, being made partakers of his <hi>resurrection,</hi> they should be rejected, or cast off at his <hi>ascension.</hi> That they were <hi>Saints,</hi> whose bodies had been <hi>raised</hi> by so great a miracle, is affirmed expressely in the text; and therfore were in some <hi>possession</hi> of the <hi>heavenly</hi> glories. And that their <hi>bodies</hi> had been putrefyed, and some of them perhaps reduced to their <hi>primitive dust,</hi> is more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the text speaks of them as of men which had long been dead. Now why a <hi>glorifyed soul</hi> should be re-united to a corrupt and <hi>putrefyed</hi> (although new raised) <hi>body,</hi> unlesse it were to <hi>raise that body</hi> also to a share of <hi>glory</hi>; I plainly must confesse I can see no reason. Some of the <hi>Saints</hi> then, as his <hi>Souldiers,</hi> did attend this Pomp; I take that for granted: And I conceive it probable (for I goe no further) that every <hi>Saint</hi> or <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi> had his <hi>Crown</hi> or Coronet bestowed upon them by their <hi>Generall,</hi> in testimony that they had <hi>fought a good fight against sinne and Satan.</hi> For though in <hi>common course</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> and servants of the Lord shall not have their <hi>Crowns</hi> untill the generall day of judgment; yet here in this <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular case</hi> it might be otherwise, by speciall priviledge and <hi>extraordinary</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</p>
                     <p>Next to the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> look we on the <hi>Captives,</hi> of whom the <hi>Psalmist</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> both do expressely speak, <hi>Duxit captivam captivitatem.</hi>

He led <hi>captivity captive,</hi> saith the holy Scripture. But who these <hi>captives</hi> were, and what this <hi>captivity,</hi> will aske a little more paines to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; though somewhat hath been said in this point before. We shewed you in our Commentaries on the former <hi>Articles,</hi> that by the unanimous consent of all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> our Saviour <hi>spoyled</hi> the <hi>Principalities and powers of hell,</hi> when he went down thither; and there took <hi>captive</hi> both the <hi>Devill</hi> and his <hi>evill Angels.</hi> The <hi>shewing of them openly,</hi> and <hi>triumphing over them,</hi> the <hi>leading of them captive</hi> when they were so taken, that doubtlesse was the work of another day, that was the work of the <hi>Ascension.</hi> When he <hi>ascended up on high,</hi> then, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he <hi>led them captive</hi>; and when he <hi>led them captive,</hi> then he <hi>triumphed over them.</hi> The victory he obtained before, now he made his <hi>triumph.</hi> The great Battel which <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> won of <hi>Perseus</hi> the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> did shrewdly shake the main foundations of his power and Empire; the victory was not perfected, nor the <hi>Realme</hi> subdued, and made a <hi>Tributary</hi> Province of the state of <hi>Rome,</hi> untill the King himself was taken, in the Isle of <hi>Samothrace,</hi> to which he had retired as his strongest hold, immediately on his defeat near the City of <hi>Pidna.</hi> The <hi>triumph</hi> followed not till after when he made his entrie into <hi>Rome,</hi> the imperiall City: the <hi>miserable King</hi> and all the flower of his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, being led like <hi>Captives</hi> in their <hi>chaines,</hi> and doomed unto perpetuall prison.

She did not doubt, but they should be of good esteem with him upon all occasions. Our Saviour Christ had as it were, assured them of that before, when he took them and <hi>Peter</hi> out of all the rest, to be present at the miracle of his <hi>Transfiguration</hi>

That was her meaning, in the placing of them, the <hi>one at his right hand,</hi> and the other <hi>on his left,</hi> when he came to his Kingdome. <hi>Sedere ad dextram alicujus, est proximam ab eo dignitatem; sedere autem ad sinistram, secundum dignitatis locum obtinere,</hi> as <hi>Estius</hi> states it very rightly. So that by <hi>sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the right hand</hi> in the holy Scriptures, we are to understand the <hi>next place</hi> of power and dignity, to him upon whose <hi>right hand</hi> they are said to sit; and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the same or the like authority as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> gave to <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the Book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis</hi>

The reason, as I take it was, because that in the rites of <hi>Augurie,</hi> the flying or appearing of the birds of <hi>divination</hi> on the left hand, did signifie good luck and prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in their intendments.

But if there were more then two in company, the best man always used to place himself in <hi>the midst</hi>; that he might seeme to be protected on all sides from the hands of his enemies. And this <hi>Minutius</hi> witnesseth in his elegant <hi>Dialogue,</hi> where seating himself in the midst betwixt <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Cecilius,</hi> he said he did it to this end, (as the use then was) <hi>ut me ex tribus</hi> medium <hi>ambitione lateris protegerent</hi>

                     </p>

How much an higher honour and a greater favour must it then be thought to sit on <hi>the right hand of God the Father</hi> Almighty, the <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> from whom all Princes of the earth had received their Scepters? Which honour that we may the better estimate, and put no less a value then it ought to have; we will consider in the next place what is meant by the <hi>Right hand of God</hi>; and then proceed unto the honour done to our Lord and Saviour, in his advancement to a place so great and glorious. And first I take it for a thing granted by all <hi>Orthodox</hi> Christians, that the word is not to be taken <hi>literally,</hi> that God hath any <hi>hands</hi> either <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left.</hi> That were to fall into the <hi>Heresie</hi> of the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi>

But therein of the two, the <hi>Heathen</hi> was the better <hi>Christian,</hi> who told us, <note n="(o)" place="margin">

                        <hi>ad divinam imaginem propius accedere humanam vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem quam figuram</hi>; that men resembled the <hi>Divine Image</hi> of God more then in their <hi>vertues</hi> then their making, more in the endowments of the <hi>minde,</hi> then in the structure of their bodies. So that as often as we meet with such expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the Book of God, we must conceive that God doth frame his speech unto our capacities, and speaketh unto us <hi>after the manner of men</hi>; that so we may the easier apprehend his meaning. Which being premised once for all, the <hi>right hand of God</hi> will be found to signifie either his power and dignity, or his love and goodness. That the <hi>right hand</hi> is the hand of <hi>strength,</hi> will I think be granted. And that it is the hand of <hi>love,</hi> besides the ordinary form of salutation, by taking and giving the <hi>right hand</hi> with those whom we affect most cordially; is evident in holy Scripture. For in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> called that son whom he loved most tenderly, by the name of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> that is the <hi>son of his right hand</hi> 
                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">Gen. 35.18.</note>. And the same <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he intended to bestow the more excellent blessing on <hi>Ephraim, Ioseph</hi> youngest son, he laid <hi>his right hand upon his head,</hi> and <hi>his left hand on the head of Manasseh,</hi> which was the elder <note n="(q)" place="margin">Gen. 48.14, 19.</note>. And this he did wittingly, saith the Text, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that though <hi>Manasseh</hi> should become a great people, yet that his <hi>younger brother should be greater then he.</hi> Thus also in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> we meet with <hi>dextra societatis</hi> 
                        <note n="(r)" place="margin">Gal. 2.9.</note>, the <hi>right hand of fellowship,</hi> which the three chief Apostles gave to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi> Which whether it was to testifie by that outward sign the <hi>mutual correspondency</hi> and good consent which was between them; or to establish the <hi>agreement</hi> then at that time made, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> should preach the Gospel to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and the others unto those of the <hi>Circumcision</hi>; is not much material: though possibly it might be in both respects; for the <hi>right hand</hi> was antiently aswell the pledge of truth and <hi>fidelity,</hi> as of love and <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>: the joyning of the <hi>right hands</hi> in the making of <hi>Leagues,</hi> (<hi>Iungamus foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra dextra,</hi> as one Poet, <hi>&amp; data dextera quondam,</hi> as another hath it) being of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary use amongst most Nations. To bring this home unto our purpose, the <hi>right hand</hi> being of it self and of common usage, the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> the hand of <hi>friendship</hi> and <hi>fidelity</hi>; it followeth that by the <hi>right hand</hi> of Almighty God, we must mean some or all of these, either his <hi>mighty</hi> power, or his <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> goodness, or his <hi>fidelity</hi> in performing of his word and promises. That the <hi>right hand</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is used to denote his <hi>power,</hi> is evident by many several pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in the Royal Psalmist; <hi>The right hand of the Loud,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, the</hi> right hand <hi>of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass</hi>

For he who in the <hi>Creed,</hi> and in divers places of the Old and <hi>New Testament,</hi> is said to <hi>sit at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,</hi> is by St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who saw him with a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied eye, affirmed to <hi>stand.</hi> Behold (saith he) <hi>I see heaven opened, and the Son of man</hi> standing <note n="(a)" place="margin">Act. 7.56.</note> 
                        <hi>at the right hand. Sitting</hi> and <hi>standing</hi> then, for both words are used, denote not to us any <hi>certain posture</hi> of our Saviours body; but serve to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that <hi>rest and quiet,</hi> which he hath found in Heaven after all his labours. For what was our most blessed Saviour in the whole course and passages of his life and death but a man of troubles; transported from one Countrey to another in his very infancy, and from one City to another when he preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: compelled to convey himself away from the sight of men to save his life; exposed to scoffs and scorns at the hour of his death? <hi>Noahs Dove</hi> and he were both alike. No rest for either to be found <hi>on the face of the earth</hi>; no ease till they were taken into the <hi>Ark</hi> again, out of which they were sent. And this St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth intimate, where he tels us of him, that <hi>for the joy which was set before him he endured the</hi> Cross, <hi>and despised the shame,</hi> and is set down <hi>at the right hand of the Throne of God</hi> 
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note>; And unto this construction of the word <hi>Sedere,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> very well agrees, saying, <hi>Secundum consuetudinem nostram illi</hi> conses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus <hi>offertur, qui aliquo opere perfecto victor adveniens,</hi> honoris gratia <hi>promeretur ut sedeat</hi>

Thus far and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he.

From whence they took that usual saying, <hi>Sine stationibus non subsisteret mundus,</hi> that were it not for such <hi>standings,</hi> the world would not stand.

                     <p>Let us consider in the next place, whether this <hi>sitting</hi> of our Saviour at the <hi>right hand</hi> of God, doth give him an <hi>equality</hi> with <hi>God the Father,</hi> which is the more received opinion, and more likely far: or if not that, then what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gains by his <hi>sitting</hi> there, and what we take to be the meaning of that <hi>form of speech.</hi> And first, I see no reason strong enough to perswade me to it, that <hi>sitting at the right hand</hi> is a sign of <hi>equality,</hi> the case being rightly laid, as it ought to be, betwixt a King and his Subjects, betwixt God and man. For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this <hi>Article</hi> to relate only to <hi>the man CHRIST IESVS</hi>; and that the note of <hi>Estius</hi> is exceeding good, that is to say, that all the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed</hi> concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> from his being <hi>conceived by the holy Ghost,</hi> to that of his <hi>coming unto judgement</hi> inclusively, <hi>de Christo dici secundum humanam naturam</hi>

And if his <hi>humane nature</hi> in it self consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, will not give him an <hi>equality</hi> with God the Father, as he himself affirms it did not, acknowledging that his <hi>Father was greater then he</hi>

were a great honour to the man that sate there, and gave him the <hi>next place</hi> to the Prince himself: yet that it gave him an <hi>equality</hi> of power and Majesty, neither the nature of <hi>Soveraignty</hi> which can brook no <hi>equals,</hi> nor any of the <hi>instances</hi> before remembred, can evince or evidence.

                     <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the Priesthood of our Lord and Saviour which he executeth sitting at the right hand of God; wherein it was fore-signifyed by that of <hi>Melchisedech;</hi> in what particulars it consisteth; and of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech</hi> himself.</head>
                     <p>WE told you in the beginning of our former Chapter, that they which do consider <hi>Christ</hi> in his several <hi>offices,</hi> and did reduce each several office to some branch or other of the <hi>Creed</hi>; did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally refer his office of <hi>high Priest,</hi> unto this branch of <hi>sitting at the right hand</hi> of God the Father Almighty. For being advanced to such a place of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the <hi>throne</hi> of God, he hath, no doubt, the better opportunities (as a man may say) of <hi>interceding</hi> with God in behalf of his people, and <hi>offering</hi> up the peoples prayers to the <hi>throne of grace</hi>; which are the two main parts of the <hi>Priestly</hi> function. And yet this <hi>sitting at the right hand</hi> of God is not precisely proper and peculiar to him as he is our <hi>Priest</hi>: but that he claimes the place also as he is our <hi>King,</hi> and there doth execute so much of the <hi>Regall office,</hi> as doth consist in <hi>governing</hi> his holy Church, untill the coming unto judgment. Certain I am that <hi>David</hi> findes him <hi>sitting on the right hand</hi> of God, in both capacities, as well <hi>King</hi> as <hi>Priest</hi>; and so doth represent him to us. <hi>The Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>said unto my Lord,</hi> sit thou at my right hand <note n="(a)" place="margin">Psal. 110.1.</note> 
                        <hi>till I make thy enemies thy footstoole.</hi> That <hi>David</hi> by those words, <hi>My Lord,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour, is a thing past question: We have the <hi>truth it self</hi> to bear witnesse to it; the Lord himself applying it unto himself in his <hi>holy Gospels.</hi> And that he meaneth it of <hi>Christ</hi> both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Priest,</hi> is no lesse evident from the rest of the Prophets words, which do immediately follow on it. For in the very next words he proceedeth thus, <hi>The Lord shall send the</hi> rod of thy strength <hi>out of Zion</hi>; Rule thou <hi>in the middest of thine enemies</hi> 
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">V. 2, 3.</note>; <hi>Thy</hi> people <hi>shall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> In which assuredly he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in his <hi>regal function.</hi> And no lesse plainly it doth follow for the <hi>Priesthood</hi> also. <hi>The Lord hath sworn,</hi> saith he, <hi>and shall not repent,</hi> thou art a Priest for ever <hi>after the order of Melchisedech</hi> 
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">V. 4.</note>. Touching the <hi>Regal</hi> office, though here also executed, we shall more fully and more fitly speak in the following <hi>Article,</hi> that of his <hi>coming to judge the quick and dead:</hi> the power of <hi>judicature</hi> being the richest flower of the <hi>regal diademe.</hi> The <hi>Priesthod</hi> we shall treat of now; Tis the place most proper: <hi>Christs Priesthood</hi> and his <hi>sitting at the right hand</hi> of God, being often joyned together in the holy Scripture. Nay therefore doth he sit at the <hi>right hand</hi> of God, that so he might with more advantage execute the <hi>Priestly office.</hi> Every Priest (saith the Apostle) <hi>standeth dayly ministring, and</hi> offering <hi>oftentimes the same sacrifices,</hi> which can never take away sinnes <note n="(e)" place="margin">Heb. 10.11, 12.</note>: <hi>But this man</hi> (that is <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour, the <hi>high Priest</hi> of the new Testament) after he had <hi>offered one</hi> sacrifice for our sins, <hi>is set down for ever</hi> at the right hand of God; <hi>From hence forth tarrying till his enemies be made his footstool.</hi> And in another place to the same purpose thus <note n="(f)" place="margin">Heb. 8.1.</note>, <hi>We have such an</hi> high Priest <hi>that sitteth on</hi> the right hand of the throne <hi>of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in the heavens</hi>; A Minister of holy things, and <hi>of the true Tabernacle,</hi> &amp;c. Being therefore in this place to speak of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> we will consider it in all those particulars, which may make the calling <hi>warrantable</hi> to himself, and <hi>comfortable</hi> unto us. To make it <hi>warrantable</hi> in respect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, we must behold him in his <hi>calling,</hi> in his <hi>consecration,</hi> and finally in the <hi>order</hi> it self, which was that of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> to which he was so called and consecrated. To make it <hi>comfortable</hi> in regard of us, we will behold him in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59300:175"/>
the excercise of those three great duties, wherein the <hi>Priesthood</hi> did consist, viz. the <hi>offering of sacrifice</hi> for the sins of the people, the <hi>offering of prayers</hi> in behalf of the people, and lastly in the act of <hi>benediction</hi> or of blessing the people. To these heads all may be reduced which concernes this argument; and of all these, according to the <hi>method</hi> now delivered which I think most natural, a little shall be said to instruct the reader.</p>
                     <p>First, for his <hi>calling</hi> to the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> it was very necessary, as well to satisfie himself, as prevent objections. For <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour being of the line of <hi>Iudah,</hi> he could not ordinarily and of common right intermedle with the <hi>Priestly</hi> function; which was entailed by God, to the house of <hi>Aaron</hi>; and therefore he required a special and extraordinary warrant (such as God gave <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the sons of <hi>Aaron</hi>) to authorize him thereunto. <hi>No person</hi> (whatsoever he was) was to <hi>take this honour to</hi> himself, but he <hi>that was called of God, as</hi> Aaron <hi>was</hi> 
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Heb. 5.4.</note>, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> averreth. Now such a <hi>calling</hi> to the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> as that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> our blessed Saviour had, and a better too; for <hi>he was called</hi> [to be] <hi>an</hi> high Priest <hi>after the order of Melchisedech</hi> 
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">V. 10.</note>. Where this word <hi>called</hi> imports more then a name or title, as if he were <hi>called Priest,</hi> but indeed was none; but a <hi>solemne calling</hi> or designement unto that high office, a <hi>calling</hi> far more solemne and of better note then that which <hi>Aaron</hi> had to the <hi>Legal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> For of the <hi>calling</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> it is only said, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that he was <hi>called by God,</hi> is a common word, and therefore like enough 'twas done in the <hi>common way.</hi> But the <hi>calling</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is a more <hi>solemne</hi> and significant word; and intimates that he was <hi>solemnely</hi> declared and pronounced by God to be a <hi>Priest after</hi> the order of <hi>Melchisedech.</hi> Now as the <hi>calling</hi> was, so was the <hi>consecration</hi>; in all points parallel to <hi>Aarons,</hi> and in some beyond. <hi>Aaron</hi> was <hi>consecrated</hi> to the <hi>Priesthood</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour by the hand of Almighty God; who long before, as long before as the time of <hi>David</hi> 
                        <note n="(i)" place="margin">Psal. 110.4.</note>, had bound himself by oath to <hi>invest</hi> him in it. <hi>Aarons</hi> head was anointed only with materiall oile; <hi>Christs</hi> with the <hi>oil of gladnesse above all his fellowes</hi> 
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">Psal. 45.7.</note>. The <hi>consecration</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before all the people, gathered together for that purpose at the dore of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> 
                        <note n="(l)" place="margin">Levit. 8.3.</note>; That of our Saviour was accomplished in the great feast of the <hi>Passeover,</hi> the most solemne, publick, and universall meeting that ever any nation of the world did accustomably hold, besides the confluence and concourse of all sorts of strangers. In the next place the <hi>consecration</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> was solemnized with the sacrifices of <hi>Rams</hi> and <hi>Bullocks</hi> 
                        <note n="(m)" place="margin">Exod. 29.1, 15.</note>: of which that of the <hi>Bullock</hi> was a sin-offering, as well for <hi>Aarons</hi> own sins, as the sins of the people; and of the <hi>Rams,</hi> the one of them was for a fire-offering or a <hi>sacrifice of rest,</hi> the other was the <hi>Ram</hi> of <hi>consecration,</hi> or of filling the hand. And herein the preheminence runs mainly on our Saviours side, who was so far from needing any <hi>sin-offering</hi> to fit him and prepare him for that holy office, that he himself became an <hi>offering for the sins</hi> of others, even for the sins of all the world. And as he was to be advanced to a more <hi>excellent Priesthood</hi> then that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> so was he sanctifyed or prepared (if I may so say) after a far more <hi>excellent manner,</hi> then with bloud of <hi>Rams.</hi> For he was <hi>consecrated,</hi> saith the text, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">Heb. 9.12.</note>, <hi>with his own bloud</hi>; and with this bloud not only his <hi>hands or ears</hi> were spinkled, as in that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but his whole body was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed: first being bathed all over in a <hi>bloudy sweat</hi>; next with the <hi>bloud</hi> issuing from his most sacred head, forced from it by the violent piercing of the <hi>Crown of thornes,</hi> which (like the <hi>anointing oyle on the head of Aaron</hi>) distilled unto the lowest parts of that blessed body; and lastly with the <hi>streams of bloud</hi> flowing abundantly from the wounds of his <hi>hands and feet,</hi> and that great <hi>orifice</hi> which was made in his precious <hi>side.</hi> Though our Redeemer were <hi>originally sanctifyed</hi> from the very wombe, and that in a most absolute and perfect manner; yet would Almighty God have him thus <hi>visibly consecrated</hi> in his own bloud also, that so he might become the <hi>authour of salvation to all those that obey him,</hi> 
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note>, and that he having <hi>washed our robes in the bloud of the Lamb,</hi> might be also sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59300:176"/>
and consecrated to the service of our heavenly father. Finally the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration</hi> of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and of all the <hi>high Priests</hi> of the law which succeeded him, was to last <hi>seven dayes</hi> 
                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">Exod. 29.30.</note>, that so the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or seventh day might passe over him: because no man, as they conceived could be a perfect <hi>high Priest</hi> to the Lord their God, until the <hi>Sabbath day</hi> had gone over his head. The <hi>consecration</hi> of our Saviour lasted <hi>seven dayes</hi> too, in every one of which although he might be justly called an <hi>high Priest</hi> in <hi>fieri,</hi> or <hi>per medium participationis,</hi> as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men phrase it, yet was not he fully <hi>consecrated</hi> to this <hi>Priestly</hi> office, till he had bathed himself all over in his own bloud, and conquered the powers of death by his <hi>resurrection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That so it was will evidently appear by this short <hi>accompt,</hi> which we shall draw up, of his actions, from his first entrance into <hi>Hierusalem</hi> in the <hi>holy week,</hi> till he had finished all his works, and obtained rest from his labours. On the <hi>first day</hi> of the week (which still in memory thereof we do call <hi>Palme Sunday</hi>) he went into the holy City, not so much to prepare for the <hi>Iewish Passeover,</hi> as to make ready for his own: and at his entrance was received with great acclamations, <hi>Hosanna be to him that cometh in the name of the Lord</hi> 
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Mat. 21.9.</note>. And on the same day, or the day next following, he <hi>purged the Temple</hi> from brokery and merchandizing, and so restored that holy place to the use of <hi>prayer,</hi> which the <hi>high Priests</hi> of the Law had turned or suffered to be turned (which comes all to one) to a <hi>den of Theeves.</hi> The intermediate time betwixt that and the day of his <hi>passion,</hi> he spent in preaching of the Gospell, instructing the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and in healing of the blind and lame which were brought unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the performance whereof and the like workes of mercy, he was more diligent and frequent and more punctuall far then <hi>Aaron</hi> or any of his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors in the <hi>legal Priesthood,</hi> in offering of the <hi>seven dayes sacrifice</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and the people. On the <hi>fift day,</hi> having first bathed his body in a <hi>bloudy sweat</hi> he was arrained and pronounced to be <hi>worthy of death,</hi> in the <hi>high Priests</hi> hall: And on the <hi>sixt</hi> (according to the <hi>Iewish</hi> accompt, with whom the evening is observed to begin the day) he went into his <hi>heavenly sanctuary</hi> to which he had prepared entrance with his precious bloud, as <hi>Moses</hi> at <hi>Aarons</hi> consecration did purifie and consecrate the <hi>materiall Sanctuary,</hi> with the bloud of Bullocks and of Rams. <hi>Not by the bloud of Goats, and Calves,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>but</hi> by his own bloud, <hi>hath he once entred into</hi> the holy place, <hi>and obtained eternal redemption for us</hi>

Which <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the Son of God on the accursed <hi>Crosse,</hi> although it was the perfect and full accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the <hi>typical</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> sacrifices offered in the law: yet was it but an intermediate, though an especiall part of his <hi>consecration,</hi> to the eternall <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Priesthood</hi> which he was to exercise, and not the <hi>ultimum esse</hi> or perfection of it. That was not terminated till the day of his <hi>resurrection,</hi> untill a <hi>Sabbath</hi> day had gone over his head; which was more perfectly fulfilled in his <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,</hi> then ever it had been in <hi>Aarons,</hi> and the sons of <hi>Aaron.</hi> For then, and not till then, when God had powerfully defeated all the plots of his enemies, did God advance him to the Crown, to the <hi>regal Diademe,</hi> setting him as a <hi>King on his holy hill,</hi> the hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> and saying to him as it were in the sight of his people <note n="(s)" place="margin">Psal. 2.6, 7.</note>

                     <p>The <hi>order of Melchisedech,</hi> that comes after next. And touching that we will examine these three things; 1. Who <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was. 2. Wherein his <hi>high Priesthood</hi> did consist. 3. In what the <hi>Parallel</hi> doth stand between <hi>Christ</hi> and him. Concerning the first point, who and what he was, hath been a great dispute amongst learned men: some thinking that he could not be a <hi>mortal man,</hi> and therefore must needs be either the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> or else the <hi>Son of God</hi> then appearing to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the likenesse and similitude of an earthly Prince. The last is most eagerly defended by <hi>P. Cunaeus</hi> a very learned man and a great <hi>Philosopher,</hi> in his book <hi>de Republ. Hebraeorum.</hi> The reason of this difficulty and his errour, are those words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> where he describeth <hi>Melchisedech</hi> to be <hi>without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life</hi> 
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Heb. 7.3.</note>. And this thought he can be no other then the <hi>Son of God.</hi> Others with greater probability both of proof and reason, declare him to be <hi>Sem,</hi> the third son of <hi>Noah,</hi> out of whose loins our father <hi>Abraham</hi> was descended: and this opinion hath found most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance generally amongst the learned, though some of very eminent parts do opine the contrary. But whether he were <hi>Sem</hi> or not, or rather some petty <hi>King</hi> of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who went forth to congratulate <hi>Abraham</hi> upon his returne; they are much troubled to apply the <hi>negative character</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath given us, to any upon whom they desire to fasten. The best and clearest resolution of the doubt, which I yet have met with, is that <hi>Meschisedech,</hi> whosoever he was, is said to be <hi>without father and mother,</hi> in the same sense, as he is after said to be <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> without genealogy (and not <hi>without descent,</hi> as our <hi>English</hi> reads) because he hath no <hi>predecessour</hi> either <hi>father</hi> or <hi>mother</hi> amongst the rest of the Patriarks, whose <hi>Genealogies</hi> are recorded in the book of God. And in this sense, as he is said to have no <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of dayes,</hi> because the time of his birth is no were remembred; so is he
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59300:177"/>
also said to have no <hi>end of his life,</hi> because neither the time of his death, nor the <hi>succession</hi> of any after him in his two great offices is specifyed upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters</hi> of sacred writ. And yet if the <hi>Catena Arabica</hi> be of any credit, we have heard more news of late touching this great man, then hath been, till of late, made known in these <hi>Western</hi> parts. For in their <hi>Marginal</hi> notes on the 10. of <hi>Genesis</hi> they say of <hi>Phaleg,</hi> of whom we finde mention vers. 25. <hi>And this</hi> Phaleg <hi>was the Father of</hi> Heraclim, <hi>the Father of Melchisedech</hi>

All power</hi> (saith he) <hi>is given me both in heaven and earth,</hi> and therefore <hi>power</hi> to give the <hi>blessings</hi> of the earth, and the <hi>blessings</hi> of Heaven, the <hi>blessings</hi> of this life, and the life to come. Nor are we only <hi>blessed</hi> by him, in the sense aforesaid, but we are also <hi>blessed</hi> for him, we are <hi>blessed</hi> through him, and all unto this end and purpose, to be <hi>everlastingly blessed</hi> in him. <hi>For him</hi> it is that we are <hi>blessed</hi>; and therefore dare not aske any good thing at the hands of God, but it is <hi>propter merita Iesu Christi,</hi> for the merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which either <hi>explicitly</hi> or <hi>implicitely</hi> is in all those prayers, which we do or ought to make to the Lord our God. <hi>Through him</hi> it is that we are <hi>blessed,</hi> he being as it were the <hi>Conduit</hi> or Channell, through which the <hi>blessings</hi> of the Lord are conveied unto us: in which regard the Church concludeth most of her formes of prayer, with this solemne clause, <hi>per Dominum nostrum I.

                     <p>The next part of the <hi>Priestly</hi> function, consisted in <hi>offering up the peoples prayers</hi> to Almighty God; or <hi>offering up his own prayers</hi> for the weal of the people. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech</hi> did both in the case of <hi>Abraham</hi>; for first he <hi>prayed unto God</hi> for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on him; and then he <hi>praised God</hi> in his Name, for his blessings to him. And so doth <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour also. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> who had presented him unto our view, in the first Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> clothed in <hi>Priestly garments,</hi> as before was said; doth in the eight present him in the execution of his <hi>Priestly</hi> Office. For there he telleth us of an <hi>Angel standing before the</hi> Altar, <hi>having</hi> (in his hands) <hi>a golden Censer,</hi> to <hi>whom much</hi> Incense was given, <hi>that he should offer it with the prayers of all Saints</hi> (those upon the earth) <hi>upon the</hi> golden Altar, <hi>which was upon the Throne,</hi> vers. 3. This <hi>Angel</hi> was our Lord <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> telleth us, the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> as the Scriptures call him <note n="(u)" place="margin">Heb. 12.24.</note>, who offereth up the <hi>prayers</hi> of his faithful servants to the Throne of God, and addes much also of his own <hi>incense, which was given unto him,</hi> to offer it together with the <hi>prayers of the Saints,</hi> that so they might be made more acceptable in the sight of God. This that he doth, and doth it by the vertue of the <hi>Priestly</hi> function, is more cleerly evidenced by St. <hi>Paul, This man</hi> (saith he, discoursing of our blessed Saviour) <hi>because he continueth</hi> for ever, <hi>hath an unchangeable Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> 
                        <note n="(x)" place="margin">Heb. 7.24, 25.</note>, and <hi>therefore he is also able to</hi> save them <hi>to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he</hi> ever liveth to make intercession <hi>for them.</hi> And for performance of this Office, his <hi>sitting at the right hand</hi> of God doth so fitly serve, as if he were advanced to it for this purpose only. We touched upon this string before, and now to make the <hi>Harmony</hi> more compleat and perfect, I shall adde that also of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in another place, where he brings in our Saviour <hi>sitting at the right hand</hi> of God <note n="(y)" place="margin">Rom. 8.34.</note>, and making <hi>intercession for us</hi>; In this respect he is called the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the New Testament; Heb.</hi> 12.24. that is to say, one that doth <hi>intercede</hi> betwixt God and man, to make up the breach that was between them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile poor man to Almighty God. And this is such a trust, such an <hi>high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,</hi> as never was committed unto <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi>; but purposely resolved by God for this great <hi>High Priest.</hi> As we acknowledge but one God, so can we have no more then <hi>one Mediatour,</hi> and this can be no other then our Lord and Saviour. <hi>There is one God</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>and one Mediator between God and man, even the man CHRIST IESVS.</hi> Do we desire to know more of him in this <hi>Office</hi> from the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> hear him then speaking of himself, and saying, I <hi>am the way, the truth, and the life</hi>

                     <p>But here perhaps it will be asked, that if our Saviour be to offer no more <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and that which he once offered upon the Cross, be not to be <hi>reiterated,</hi> as the Priest thinks necessary; what use there is to us of his <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, as concerning <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> I answer with St. <hi>Paul</hi> on another occasion, <hi>much every way.</hi> For though he offereth <hi>no more Sacrifices</hi> then that made already; yet the effect and fruit thereof is still to be applyed to the souls of men, the <hi>merit</hi> of it still to be represented in the sight of God. Of these the first may seeme to be the Office of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>; but the later most assuredly is the Office of our <hi>High Priest,</hi> and of him alone.

                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.31.</note>; yet we may safely say, and make it <hi>the rejoycing which we have in CHRIST IESVS our Lord,</hi> that the merit of his death and passion, are <hi>daily,</hi> hourly, nay continually, presented by him to the view and consideration of Almighty God. A point of no mean <hi>consolation</hi> to us, whilest we are subject to the <hi>sins</hi> and lusts, which we bear about us in the flesh; and cannot otherwise be excused from them but by changing our <hi>mortal into immortality.</hi> And this is that which was <hi>prefigured</hi> in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> by the <hi>High Priests</hi> entring into the <hi>Sanctum Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> which was parted with a vail or <hi>traverse Curtain</hi> from the rest of the <hi>Temple,</hi> to make <hi>atonement</hi> with the Lord for the peoples sins. The <hi>parallel</hi> stands thus between them. First none might enter into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> or the <hi>holiest of all,</hi> but the High Priest only, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.3. So <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>High Priest,</hi> and none but he, hath entred into the <hi>holy places not made with hands,</hi> to appear in the presence of God for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24, Secondly, as the <hi>veil</hi> of the Temple was lifted up or drawn aside, to make room for the <hi>High Priest</hi> to enter into it: so did the <hi>vail of the Temple rent in sunder</hi> at the very instant, when the soul of our <hi>High Priest</hi> did depart from his body, and enter the <hi>Celestial Sanctuary, Mattb.</hi> 27. Thirdly, the <hi>High Priest</hi> was apparelled in his Priestly vestments, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.10. and so our Saviour is described in the <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13. Fourthly, the <hi>High Priest,</hi> entred into the Sanctuary but <hi>once a year,</hi> which was upon the Feast of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, Exod.</hi> 30.10. So did <hi>Christ</hi> enter <hi>once into the holy place,</hi> which was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day (of his death and passion) whereon he obtained <hi>eternal</hi> redemption <hi>for us, Heb.</hi> 9.12. And last of all, as the <hi>High Priest</hi> made an offering for the sins of the people, though it were only of the bloud of <hi>Calves</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went <hi>within the veil, Levit.</hi> 16.12. &amp; 15. which bloud he was to sprinkle on the <hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> vers. 14, 15. and thereby made <hi>atonement</hi> in the holy place for all the Congregation of <hi>Israel,</hi> vers. 17. So before <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>High Priest</hi> entred into the Heaven of glories, he made an <hi>offering of himself, Heb.</hi> 9.25. and by his <hi>own bloud entred into the holy places,</hi> vers. 12. which bloud of his, that is to say, the <hi>merits</hi> of it, he sprinkleth on the <hi>Mercy-seat</hi> of Almighty God, and thereby doth avert him from his displeasure, and reconcile him <hi>daily</hi> to poor sinful man. Which <hi>Parallel</hi> thus made, we may the better understand St. <hi>Pauls</hi> drift and meaning, in comparing the <hi>High Priests</hi> together, and the excellency of <hi>Christs Priesthood</hi> above that of <hi>Aaron.</hi> The <hi>Priests,</hi> saith he, (<hi>i. e.</hi> those of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour order) <hi>went into the first</hi> Tabernacle, <hi>accomplishing the service of God; But into the</hi> second <hi>went the</hi> High Priest alone <hi>once every year, not without bloud, which he</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>for himself and for the errors of the people</hi>

                     <p>Thus standeth the case with our <hi>High Priest</hi> in the point of <hi>Sacrifice</hi>; in which, as in the other Offices, of <hi>offering up our prayers</hi> to God, <hi>interceding</hi> for us, and pouring down his <hi>blessings</hi> on us, he doth perform the Office or Function of an <hi>High Priest for ever,</hi> after the Order of <hi>Melchisedech.</hi> But there is yet one Argument more that St. <hi>Paul</hi> brings in proof of <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> Priesthood; which is, that he <hi>tithed</hi> Abraham, or <hi>took Tithes</hi> of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2, 9. And if we prove not this also of our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>parallel</hi> betwixt him and <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech</hi> will not be complete, nor his high <hi>Priesthood</hi> so asserted as it ought to be.

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59300:181"/>
to make good this point, the one derived from the <hi>eternity</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Priesthood,</hi> the other from the <hi>Prerogative</hi> which <hi>Melchisedech</hi> had in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, above <hi>Aaron</hi> and the sons of <hi>Levi.</hi> The first stands thus: <hi>Melchisedech took Tithes of</hi> Abraham <hi>in his own right,</hi> as Priest of the most high God; whose <hi>Priesthood</hi> being everlasting in the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> (for he hath an <hi>unchangeable Priesthood,</hi> vers. 24.) the right of <hi>taking Tithes</hi> is inherent in him, on the meer taking on himself of <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> function; I mean in being made a <hi>Priest for ever,</hi> after the Order of <hi>Melchisedech.</hi> And this is that to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> alludeth, saying, <hi>Here, men</hi> that die <hi>receive Tithes</hi> 
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Heb. 7.8.</note>, that is to say, <hi>Here,</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> of our Nation being <hi>mortal men,</hi> and subject to the stroke of death aswell as we, do <hi>receive tithes</hi> of us, to shew that we acknowledge them to be our <hi>Superiours</hi> in their place and <hi>Ministery.</hi> But <hi>there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth</hi>; His meaning is, that when <hi>Melchisedech</hi> received <hi>Tithes of Abraham,</hi> he received them as a <hi>Type</hi> of our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> who now <hi>liveth</hi> with God, and by his <hi>Resurrection</hi> did make known that he <hi>liveth for ever,</hi> and lived to execute the Office of a <hi>Priest for ever,</hi> after the Order of <hi>Melchisedech.</hi> He then of whom it is witnessed that <hi>he liveth,</hi> receiveth <hi>Tithes,</hi> or hath at least a <hi>right and title</hi> to receive them, in regard of his <hi>unchangeable</hi> and eternal <hi>Priesthood.</hi> But he <hi>receiveth</hi> them not in <hi>person</hi>; having transferred all his <hi>interests</hi> in them, and title to them, upon the <hi>Ministers</hi> of his Gospel.

Clearly St. <hi>Paul</hi> who spake by the <hi>same Spirit</hi> that <hi>David</hi> did, and therefore could not erre in expounding the words of <hi>David,</hi> intends them neither to <hi>CHRISTS natural birth,</hi> as the son of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> nor his <hi>eternall generation</hi> as the Son of God; but to his <hi>birth day</hi> or begetting to the <hi>Crown</hi> of the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi>; the day of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the <hi>regal throne,</hi> being esteemed as their <hi>birth day</hi> by most Kings and Princes.

when he hath put down all rule, and all authority, and power, then cometh the end, and <hi>then he shall deliver up the Kingdome</hi> unto God the Father, <hi>that God may be all in all.</hi> This is the summe of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that point.

And first he saith that <hi>CHRIST</hi> must <hi>reign till he hath put all things under his feet,</hi> that being one of the especial parts of the Kingly function, as before was shewn, to save and defend his Church from <hi>the hands of her enemies</hi>; and for the <hi>enemies</hi> themselves, to crush them with a <hi>Scepter of iron,</hi> and break them in pieces like a Potters vessel. When this is done, when he hath trodden <hi>under foot</hi> all his mortal <hi>enemies,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of his Church, false Prophets, false Apostles, and the great <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist</hi> himself, which labour to <hi>seduce even the very Elect</hi>: when he hath subjugated the powers of <hi>Hell,</hi> and that <hi>sin</hi> hath no more dominion over us, yet we shall still lie under the power of <hi>death</hi> untill the last and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Resurrection. <hi>Death</hi> therefore is the <hi>last enemie to be destroyed,</hi> that being delivered from his <hi>thraldome,</hi> raised from the grave which is his <hi>prison,</hi> and all those bonds and fetters broken by which we were held <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> under his command, we may be made partakers of eternal life, and <hi>reign with Christ</hi> for ever in his heavenly glories. When that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when there are neither <hi>enemies</hi> from which to protect his <hi>Church,</hi> nor any <hi>Church</hi> to be instructed in the wayes of godliness, according to the <hi>Nomothetical</hi> part of the Regal Office: then <hi>cometh the end,</hi> the end of all things in this world, which shall be no more; the end of <hi>Christs Kingdome,</hi> as the <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and man, man having by the power of his <hi>mediation,</hi> attained the end of his desires, the guerdon and reward of his faith and piety. This being done, the rule of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>sin,</hi> and the power of <hi>death,</hi> being all broken and subdued; he shall first <hi>raise</hi> our mortal bodies in despight of <hi>death,</hi> pronounce the joyful sentence of <hi>absolution</hi> on them in despight of <hi>sin</hi>; and finally advance them to that height of glory from which <hi>Satan</hi> fell, to the confusion of the <hi>Devil</hi> and all his Angels. And having so discharged the Office of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> for executing which he sate at the <hi>right hand</hi> of God, he shall deliver up unto God the Father, the right and interest which he had in the <hi>Kingdome of Grace,</hi> consisting in the building up of his <hi>Elect</hi> in faith, hope, and charity, that they with him, and he with them, may <hi>reign</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>evermore in the <hi>Kingdome of glory.</hi> Where there shall be no use of <hi>Faith,</hi> for they shall <hi>see God face to face,</hi> and faith is the <hi>existence of things</hi> not <hi>seen</hi>

What then if we should say, that by <hi>Regnum</hi> here, we are so understand only <hi>filios Regni</hi>; if by the word <hi>Kingdome</hi> in this place, St. <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth those who are called the <hi>Children of the Kingdome</hi> 
                        <note n="(l)" place="margin">Mat. 13.38.</note>, in another place: and that by the <hi>delivering up of the Kingdome</hi> unto God the Father, we are to understand no more then the <hi>presenting of his children (Behold I and the children whom thou hast given me</hi> 
                        <note n="(m)" place="margin">Heb. 2.35.</note>) to the fight of God; to be received into his glories, and crowned by him with immortality.

Something there also is which may make us <hi>Christians</hi> not only to believe but expect this day, considering that we are told in the holy Scriptures that we <hi>shall all appear before the</hi> judgement-seat <hi>of Christ,</hi> that every man may receive according to that which <hi>he hath done in his body whether good or evill</hi> 
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Rom. 14.10</note>. The strength and efficacie of the Argument in brief is this. The bodies of us men being the <hi>servants</hi> of the soul to <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> or else the instruments to sin, in justice ought to be partakers of that weal and woe, which is adjudged unto the <hi>soul</hi>; and therefore to be raised at the day of judgment, that as they sinned together, or served God together, so they may share together of <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>punishment.</hi> But because many times the soul sins without the body, and many

times without it doth some works of piety, which God is pleased to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of: therefore as requisite it is that the soul separated from the body, should either suffer torment or enjoy felicity, according as it hath deserved in the sight of God, whilest yet the body sleepeth in the grave of death. And on these grounds, next to the dictates and authority of the book of God, the doctrine <note n="(i)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Philastr. de haeres.</hi>
                        </note> of the <hi>general judgement</hi> hath been built so strongly, that only some few <hi>Atheists</hi> amongst the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and none but the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sect of <hi>Manichees</hi> amongst the <hi>Christians,</hi> had ever the impudence to denie it.</p>
                     <p>That which concernes us most as <hi>Christians,</hi> and doth especially relate to the present <hi>Article,</hi> is that this judgement shall be executed by our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> sitting with power at the <hi>right hand of God the Father,</hi> but in the nature and capacity of the <hi>Son of man.</hi> Hereafter shall ye see <hi>the Son of man, sitting at the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of the Aire, Mat.</hi> 26.64. See the same also <hi>Mark</hi> 14.62. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.69. The like we have also in St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell. <hi>The Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all</hi> judgement <hi>to the Son,</hi> Chap. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. What? to the Son according to his <hi>eternal generation,</hi> as the <hi>Word</hi> of God? Not so, but to the <hi>Son of man.</hi> For so it followeth in that Chapter, viz. <hi>And hath given him</hi> power also to judge, <hi>because he is the Son of man,</hi> V. 27. And this we have directly from the Lords one mouth. The Apostles also say the same. St. <hi>Peter</hi> first, <hi>God raised him up the third day and shewed him openly</hi> 
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">Act. 10.40, 42.</note>, <hi>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testifie that it is he, which is ordained of God to be</hi> judge <hi>both of quick and dead.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> next. <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me</hi> a Crown of righteousnesse <hi>which the Lord the</hi> righteous judge <hi>shall give me at that day</hi> 
                        <note n="(l)" place="margin">2 Tim. 4.8.</note>, and not to me only <hi>but to all those that love his appearing.</hi> So for St. <hi>Iude, Behold the Lord shall come with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of his Saints to</hi> give judgment <hi>against all men, and to rebuke all that are ungodly amongst them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed, and of all the</hi> cruel speakings <hi>which ungodly sinners have spoken against him</hi>

And this he citeth out of the Prophecies of <hi>Enoch</hi> the seventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> which sheweth that even the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the flood, were thoroughly possessed with this sacred truth; and therefore not concealed from the holy <hi>Prophets which have been since the world began.</hi> That it was manifested also to the antient <hi>Gentiles,</hi> I have no reason to believe. For though they might collect upon grounds of reason, that there should be a <hi>day of judgement</hi> in the world to come: yet that this judgement should be executed by the man <hi>CHRIST IESVS,</hi> could not in possibility be discovered to them by the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; nor indeed by any other sight then by his alone, who was to be <hi>a light to lighten the Gentiles,</hi> as well as to be the <hi>glory of his people Israel.</hi> And therefore in my minde <hi>Lactantius</hi> might have spared that part of his censure upon the judgment of <hi>Hydaspes</hi> before remembred <note n="(n)" place="margin">

For what could be more just in Almighty God, then to advance his Son to the <hi>seat of judgment,</hi> to the end that having been dishonoured publickly both in life and death, scorned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and brought unto a shamefull end in the eye of men; <hi>he might have opportunity</hi> to shew his great power and majesty in the sight of all, but speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of his barbarous and ungodly enemies?

                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">Zach. 12.10</note>. Which words, although St. <hi>Iohn</hi> applyeth in his holy Gospel unto the <hi>piercing of Christs side,</hi> Chap. 19.37. yet in the <hi>Revelation</hi> he applyeth it to his sitting in judgement, <hi>Behold,</hi> saith he, <hi>he cometh in the clouds, and all eyes shall see him, and they also that</hi> pierced him, Chap. 1.17. And from these words it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived I think not improbably, that the wounds in our Saviours body shall then be visible to the eyes of all spectatours: to the great comfort of the faithfull, who do acknowledge their redemption to the bloud <hi>of the Lamb</hi>; and to the astonishment and confusion of all his enemies, but most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of them, <hi>qui vulnera ista inflixerunt</hi>

                        <note n="(r)" place="margin">Luk. 23.43.</note>. As plain is that of the Apostle, <hi>It is appointed unto men once to die, and after</hi> death <hi>the judgement</hi>

                        <note n="(t)" place="margin">Luk. 26.22, 23.</note>; the other being plunged in <hi>unquenchable flames.</hi> If so, as so it is most certain, what use can be conceived of a <hi>general judgement,</hi> when all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons have already received their sentence; what further punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or glory can be added to them, then <hi>Paradise</hi> to Gods Saints and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the <hi>unquenchable flames</hi> of hell for impenitent sinners.

justice of Almighty God, and the <hi>participation</hi> of the body in that blisse or misery, which the soul presently is adjudged to on the separation, and finally the <hi>manifesting</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> power and glory in the sight of his enemies: shall now be also cleared as to that part thereof, which seems to place the soul in the <hi>height of happinesse,</hi> as soon as separate from the body, or in the <hi>depth of anguish</hi> and disconsolation. And first, that the souls of just and righteous persons are in the <hi>hands of God,</hi> in Paradise, in <hi>Abrahams bosome,</hi> yea in the <hi>very heavens</hi> themselves, I shall easily grant.

Certain I am, the Scripture seems to me to be quite against it, the current of antiquity, and not a few <hi>Moderns</hi> of good note and eminencie to incline very strongly to the other side. For Scriptures first, St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth speak indeed of a <hi>Crown of righteousnesse,</hi> to be given to him, and to all those that love the <hi>appearing of Christ</hi>

St. <hi>Peter</hi> next informeth of an <hi>incorruptible inheritance reserved for us in the heavens</hi>; and more then so, <hi>prepared already</hi> 
                        <note n="(x)" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.4, 5.</note>, but not to be shewed <hi>till the last time.</hi> In the last place we have St. <hi>Iohn</hi> acquainting us with the condition of the Saints, as in matter of <hi>fact,</hi> where he telleth us that the souls of the <hi>Martyrs under the Altar</hi> 
                        <note n="(y)" place="margin">Apocal. 6.10, 11.</note>, where they were willed <hi>to rest themselves, till the number of their fellow servants was accomplished.</hi> And though we grant the souls of righteous men departed are in <hi>heaven</hi> it self; yet doth it not follow by any good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that therefore they are in the <hi>highest Heaven,</hi> where God himselfe refideth in most perfect majesty. The name of <hi>Heaven</hi> is variously used in holy Scriptures.

Next for the <hi>Firmament</hi> above, in which the Lord hath placed those most glorious lights, which frequently are called the <hi>Stars of heaven,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. Then for that place, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth in one text by the name of <hi>the third heaven,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place shortly after by the name of <hi>Paradise, vers.</hi> 4. which is conceived to be the habitations of the <hi>Angels,</hi> their <hi>proper habitation,</hi> as St. <hi>Iude</hi> calleth it, <hi>vers.</hi> 6.

                     <p>I had not named St. <hi>Bernard</hi> amongst those Antients, but only to the end that it might be seen that this was generally the doctrine of the <hi>Western</hi> Church, as to this particular; untill the <hi>invocation of the Saints departed</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came first to be put in practise, and afterwards to be defended and imposed as good <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrine. For they saw well, that unlesse it were received for an <hi>Orthodox</hi> truth that the <hi>Saints departed</hi> were admitted presently into the <hi>beatificall vision</hi> of Almighty God; and in him see, as in a <hi>Mirrour,</hi> what things soever could be done or said on the earth beneath: it were in vain to make unto them either <hi>prayers</hi> or <hi>vows,</hi> not being yet estated in their own full <hi>glories,</hi> and consequently not admitted to the presence of God. And on the very same reasons, for which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth admit the <hi>Saints</hi> to enjoy the <hi>blessed vision</hi> of Almighty God in the heaven of glories; did <hi>Calvin</hi> labour to decrie the received opinion in that point: though by long
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59300:192"/>
tract of time, engendering prejudice and prepossession in the hearts of men against any contrary position, it was become the generall tenet of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Schools. For well he knew, that if that doctrine could be rooted out of the minds of men, by which the <hi>Saints</hi> were brought (though before their time) into an habitation in the <hi>highest heavens</hi>: that of the <hi>invocation of the Saints departed,</hi> which depends upon it, must of necessity perish with it. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever moved him to opine so of it (for I am confident it was not any love to the <hi>antient Fathers</hi>) certain it is that he hath freely declared his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it, in several places of his writings. In that entituled <hi>Psychopannychia,</hi> he doth thus expresse it, The <hi>souls of the</hi> Saints <hi>after death, be in peace,</hi> saith he, <hi>because they are escaped from the power of the enemie</hi>; but shall not raign with Christ their King, <hi>untill the heavenly</hi> Hierusalem <hi>shall be advanced to her glory, and the true</hi> Solomon the King of peace <hi>shall sit on high on his tribunal</hi>

And this he doth not only say, and leave the proof thereof to his <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> as if that were enough to carry it over all the world: but cites <hi>Tertullian, Chrysostome, Augustine, Bernard,</hi> (some of whose words we saw before) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the point. But seeing that tract of his hath been called in question, as if it did incline too much towards the <hi>Anabaptists</hi>: we will next look upon his book of <hi>Institutions,</hi> where we finde him saying,
<q>That <hi>since the Scripture every where biddeth us to depend</hi> upon the expectation of Christs coming, and <hi>deferreth the Crown of glory till that time,</hi> we are to be content with the bounds that God hath appointed us; <hi>viz.</hi> that the souls of the godly having ended their warfare <hi>depart unto an happy rest,</hi> where with a blessed joy they look for the fruition of the promised glory; and that so all things shall stand suspended <hi>untill Christ appeare</hi>

The same he also intimateth in another place, where he resolveth,
<q>That <hi>not only the</hi> Fathers <hi>under the Law, but even the</hi> holy men of God since the death of Christ, <hi>are but in profectu,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, as it were, to that perfect happinesse, <hi>which is to be conferred upon them in the day of doom</hi>; that in the mean time they abide <hi>in atriis</hi> in the out-courts of Heaven, <hi>and there expect the consummation of their beatitude.</hi> And finally, <hi>none but our Saviour Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath entred into the heavenly Sanctuary</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where to the end of all the world, <hi>Solus populi eminus</hi> in atrio <hi>residentis vota ad deum defert,</hi> he alone represents to God the desires of his people, <hi>sitting a far off in the outward Courts</hi>

I know that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth quarrell at these passages of <hi>Calvins,</hi> and I cannot blame him. He, and the common interesse of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were so ingaged in the defence of the other opinion, without which that of the <hi>invocation of Saints</hi> must needs fall to the ground, that it concerned them all to calumniate <hi>Calvin,</hi> as the broacher of new Doctrines in the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> though in this point they finde him countenanced by most antient writers. Neither doth <hi>Calvin</hi> stand alone in this opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being seconded, though not in so expresse terms as himself delivereth it, by <hi>Bucer, Bullinger, Martyr, Musculus,</hi> and some others also. And wonder tis, not that he was followed by so many, but by so few prime men of the <hi>reformation,</hi> to whom his name and authority were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dear.</p>
                     <p>And if the case stand so with the <hi>Saints above,</hi> no question but it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so too with the <hi>souls below.</hi> For <hi>contrariorum par est ratio,</hi> as the old rule is. And to the truth we have not only the testimonie of the holy Scriptures, saying expressely that God <hi>reserveth the unjust unto the</hi> day of judgement <hi>to be punished,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. but of so many of the <hi>Fathers</hi> as do touch upon it, as may appear by that of <hi>Hilarie</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> before delivered. By which the other passages of holy writ, as <hi>Iude v.</hi> 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. it is plain and manifest that the torments of the <hi>damned</hi> and the <hi>Devils</hi> too, which are inflicted on them for the present time, are far lesse then the vengeance of eternal and external fire reserved untill the day of judgement, and then augmented upon all the <hi>reprobate</hi> both men and Angels. For grant the most which had been said by any of the <hi>Antients</hi> as to this particular, and we shall

finde that it amounteth to no more then this, that the souls of wicked men departed, are presently made to understand by the <hi>righteous judge,</hi> the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence due unto their sins, and what they are to look for at the day of doome. <hi>Postquam anima de corpore est egressa, subito judicium</hi> Christi <hi>de salute cognoscit</hi>

For of that day it is, not the day of their death, of which Scriptures doe report such terrible things, saying that the <hi>heavens shall vanish away, and be</hi> rolled <hi>up like a scroule, that all the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and the hils shall be moved out of their places</hi>

                     <p>And first beginning with the <hi>time,</hi> there is but little, I confesse, to be said of that. Our Saviour telleth us in plain termes, that of <hi>that day and that hour knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father</hi> 
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Mar. 13.32.</note>. And yet as plain as these words are, they have given great matter of dispute in the <hi>Christian</hi> Church: especially that part of them which concernes the <hi>Son,</hi> and his not knowing when that day and that hour should come. The <hi>Arians</hi> hereupon concluded against <hi>CHRISTS divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> as being <hi>ignorant</hi> of some things which the <hi>Father knew.</hi> But unto this, the <hi>Fathers</hi> of that age answered very rightly, that <hi>Christ</hi> speaks not of himself as God, or as the <hi>Word</hi> both <hi>made</hi> and manifested in the <hi>flesh,</hi> but as he was the <hi>Son of man,</hi> to whom the Father had not pleased to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the knowledge of so great a mysterie.

Add unto this a pleasant jest which King <hi>Iames</hi> put upon the Author of the book aforesaid (for such <hi>adventurers</hi> cannot be too much exposed to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick scorne) and in brief is this, The Gentleman holding lands of the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> petitioned the King to have a longer terme granted in his estate.

To which when he had answered five hundred years, <hi>God a my soul,</hi> replyed the King, <hi>that is four hundred years more then the world shall last,</hi> and <hi>I conceive you do not mean to hold my Land in the world to come.</hi> And so dismissed him for that time, although he after gratifyed him in his request, having thus made him sensible of his own absurdities.</p>

This by some very learned men is supposed to be in <hi>the Aire,</hi> over the <hi>valley of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hosaphat,</hi> which is near mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and both of them Eastward of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> And this they do upon these grounds. For first they say, the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> seem to say it in as <hi>plain words</hi> as may be. For thus saith <hi>God the Lord</hi> Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, <hi>I will gather all nations into the</hi> valley of Jehosaphat, and <hi>plead with them there.

very place, as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors do expound it. That of the Prophet <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> And <hi>his feet shall stand in that day on the</hi> Mount of Olives <note n="(l)" place="margin">Zech. 14.4.</note>, <hi>which is before</hi> Hierusalem <hi>to the East, &amp;c.</hi> though formerly applyed by us unto Christs <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> may be accommodated also to his <hi>coming to judge the world</hi>: The rather in regard it was said by the holy Angel unto his Disciples, <hi>This same</hi> Jesus <hi>which is taken up from you into Heaven</hi> 
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Act. 1.11.</note>, (being then upon the mount of <hi>Olives</hi>) <hi>shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go hence.</hi> Which possibly may as wel be meant of the <hi>place,</hi> as of other the <hi>circumstances</hi> of his coming: and therefore by <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> and all the rest of the old <hi>Schoolmen</hi> except <hi>Lombard</hi> and <hi>Alexander of Hales,</hi> is made to be the second reason which they build upon, for nominating this <hi>valley</hi> (or rather some place over it in <hi>the Ayr</hi>) to be the place appointed for the future judgement. The third reason they take from a passage in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> compared with <hi>Christs</hi> own words in his holy Gospel. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet tels us of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> that it is placed <hi>in medio Gentium,</hi> in the very midst of the world: and so accordingly it is seated by some <hi>Cosmographers.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> hath told us of the <hi>Angels,</hi> that they shall <hi>gather together the</hi> Elect <hi>from the four windes, from one end of Heaven unto the other</hi> 
                        <note n="(r)" place="margin">Matth. 24.31.</note>. If then the <hi>Termini a quibus</hi> be the four parts of the world, and <hi>Hierusalem</hi> be seated in the <hi>midst of the earth,</hi> as they say it is: the <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> must be <hi>Hierusalem</hi> or some place neer it; (and such is this <hi>Valley</hi> of <hi>Iehosophat</hi>) or else some <hi>Angels</hi> must be thought to be of a more quick dispatch then others, which were ridiculous to imagine. But that which is of greatest moment, is that our Lord and Saviour <hi>for ever blessed,</hi> was <hi>crucified</hi> and put to open shame very neer that place: Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and the Valley of <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> being not far asunder, if not close together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminous. And what can be more <hi>probable,</hi> (for they propose not these proofs for <hi>Demonstrations</hi>) then that where <hi>Christ</hi> was put unto <hi>publick shame,</hi> he should again receive a more <hi>publick honour</hi>: and that where he himself was condemned and punished with so much <hi>malice and injustice</hi>; he should appear to judge the world with such <hi>truth and equity?</hi> These are the reasons brought to make good this <hi>Tenet,</hi> which as I cannot easily grant to be <hi>convincing</hi>; so I am far from saying any thing in reproof of that, which hath such handsome <hi>probabilities</hi> to gain credit to it.</p>
                     <p>And now I am fallen upon these points, I will adventure on another, though more <hi>nice</hi> then <hi>necessary.</hi> At least it may be so accounted, and I pass not for it. <hi>Quilibet abundet in suo sensu.</hi> Let every man injoy that liberty (I mean in matters of this nature) which I take my self. We said that <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was seated in <hi>the midst of the earth,</hi> and thereupon is called by some Geographers, <hi>Vmbilicus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae</hi>; and that aswell <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> as the <hi>Valley of Iehosaphat,</hi> did both stand East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of that City. From hence it is by some inferred, and their illation backed by no mean authority, that <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour did ascend up into the <hi>East part of Heaven,</hi> (I mean that part of Heaven which answereth to the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial East</hi> upon the Earth); that in <hi>that part</hi> of Heaven, he sitteth <hi>at the right hand of the Throne</hi> of Almighty God; and from <hi>the same shall also</hi> come in the day of Judgement.

Touching the <hi>sign of the Son of man,</hi> which our Saviour speaks of, as of a certain note and token of his <hi>coming to judgement</hi>: it stands thus in Scripture; <hi>Then shall appear</hi> the sign of the Son of man <hi>in Heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the Earth mourn, and they shall see</hi> the Son of man <hi>coming in the Clowds of Heaven, with power and great glory,</hi> Mat. 24.30. <hi>This sign</hi> then, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is, is the <hi>prodromos</hi> or fore-runner of <hi>Christs</hi> coming to judgement, of his <hi>second coming,</hi> as was the <hi>Star</hi> which shined in the <hi>East</hi> of his birth or <hi>first coming</hi> into the world.

If you would know what <hi>sign</hi> this is; I answer that it is the <hi>sign of the Cross:</hi> a sign like that which Christ vouchsafed to shew from Heaven to the famous <hi>Constantine.</hi> Of whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> hath reported, from his own mouth too, that being imbarked in a war against <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and much perplexed in minde about that affair, there shewed it self unto him in an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon the <hi>form of a Cross</hi> figured in the Ayr, and therein these words written <gap reason="foreign">

Which apparition of the Cross, or <hi>sign of the Son of man</hi> in the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> was a fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it were of that <hi>petit Sessions,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> at that time held against the cruel <hi>Persecutors</hi> of his Church and people, <hi>Diocletian, Maximinus, Maximianus, Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and the aforesaid <hi>Maxentius,</hi> all which in very little time were brought to most shameful ends.

Whatsoever <hi>noyse</hi> that was, which is by <hi>Moses</hi> said to be made with the <hi>sound of the Trumpet,</hi> when the Law was given: the same do I conceive it will also be, when all the world is called to given an account of all their doings, whether conform unto <hi>that Law,</hi> or against the same. The <hi>Trumpet</hi> was sounded with great terrour, when the <hi>Law was given,</hi> that the whole world might hear the noise of the <hi>Eccho</hi> of it, and thereby brought into a fear of violating any part of that sacred Rule. For though the <hi>Law</hi> seemeth to be given only to the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to none but them; as indeed it was given to none but them by the hand of <hi>Moses</hi>; in which respect it is not binding to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> very well observe: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was <hi>naturally</hi> imprinted in the hearts of men, as the <hi>perpetual moral Law</hi> of the most high God, although the tract and footsteps of it were almost defaced; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at their peril were obliged to keep it, and to take notice of the <hi>publication</hi> of it, whensoever, and by what means soever, it should arrive unto their Ears.

                     <p>Thus have I made a brief but a plain discovery, so far forth as the light of Scripture could direct me in it, both of the <hi>manner</hi> of our Saviours coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Judgement; and of the <hi>Method</hi> he shall use in the act of judging. That which comes <hi>after Iudgement,</hi> whether life or death, whether it be the <hi>joys of Heaven</hi> or the <hi>pains of Hell,</hi> will fall more properly under the consideration of the last <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> that of <hi>Life Everlasting</hi>: and there we mean to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle all those particulars which I think pertinent thereunto. In the mean time a due and serious consideration of this <hi>day of Iudgement</hi> will be exceeding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to all sorts of people: and be the <hi>strongest bridle</hi> to restrain them from the acts of sin, that ever was put into the mouths of ungodly men. For what a <hi>bridle</hi> think we, must it be unto them, to keep them from unlawful lusts, nay from sinful purposes, when they consider with themselves, that in that day, the <hi>hearts of all men shall be opened, their desires made known,</hi> and that no <hi>secrets shall be hid</hi>; but all laid open as it were, to the publick view? What a <hi>strong bridle</hi> must it be to curb them and to hold them in, when they are in the full <hi>careere</hi> and race of wickedness, when they consider with themselves, that there will be no way nor means to escape this Judgement? Though they procure the <hi>Rocks to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,</hi> and the <hi>Hils to hide them,</hi> yet will Gods <hi>Angels</hi> finde them out; <hi>and gather them from every corner of the World,</hi> be they where they will. Though they have flattered their poor souls, and said, <hi>Tush God will not see it</hi>; or have disguised themselves with <hi>fig-leaves,</hi> out of a silly hope to conceal their nakedness; or <hi>wiped their lips</hi> so cunningly with the <hi>harlot</hi> in the Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> that no man can discern a stollen kiss upon them; yet all this will not serve the turn. God will for all this bring them unto judgement, and apprehend them by his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> when they go a <hi>gathering.</hi> There shall not one of them escape the hands of these diligent <hi>Sergeants; Ne unus quidem,</hi> no not one. And finally what a <hi>bridle</hi> must it be unto them, to hold them from exorbitant wickedness, as either the <hi>crucifying again</hi> of the Lord of glory, the <hi>persecuting of the Saints,</hi> their mischievous plots against the Church in her <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>Patrimony</hi>; when they consider with themselves that he whom thus they <hi>crucifie,</hi> is to be their <hi>Iudge</hi>; and that those <hi>poor souls</hi> whom they now contemn, shall give a <hi>vote</hi> or suffrage on their <hi>condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and that the poor afflicted Church which they made truly <hi>militant</hi> by their foul oppressions, malgre their tyranny and confederacies, shall become <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant?</hi> And on the other side, what a great <hi>comfort</hi> must it be to the <hi>righteous</hi> man, to think that <hi>Christ</hi> who all this while hath been his <hi>Mediator</hi> with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, shall one day come to be his <hi>Iudge?</hi> What a great <hi>consolation</hi> must it be unto him in the time of trouble, to think that all his groans are regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, his <hi>tears kept in a bottle,</hi> and his sighs recorded: and that there is a <hi>Iudge</hi> above who will <hi>wipe all the tears from his eyes,</hi> and give him <hi>mirth in stead of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> What an <hi>incouragement</hi> must it be unto him in the way of godliness, when he considereth with himself that there is laid up for him a <hi>Crown of glory, which the Lord the</hi> righteous Judge <hi>will give him at that day,</hi> and give it him in the fight both of men and <hi>Angels?</hi> Finally what <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>animation</hi> must it put into them to make them stand couragiously in the cause of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to contemn what ever misery can be laid upon them, in the defence of <hi>Christs</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> cause: when they consider with themselves, that there is no man <hi>who hath lost Father or Mother, or wife or children, or lands and possessions for the sake of</hi> Christ; <hi>but shall receive much more in this</hi> present world, <hi>and in the</hi> world to come <hi>life everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> For behold <hi>he cometh quickly,</hi> (as himself hath told us) <hi>and his reward is with him, to give to every man according as his work shall be.</hi> Even so Lord Jesus, So be it. <hi>Amen.</hi>

of my heart, may be alwayes acceptable in the sight of God,</hi> the Lord, <hi>my strength and my Redeemer.</hi> But because the word or notion of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a word of various signification in the Book of God: we will first look upon it in those significations, and then conclude on that which is chiefly, perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the intent and purpose of the present <hi>Article.</hi> For certainly the Orators Rule is both good and useful, viz. <hi>Prius dividenda antequam definienda sit ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Tull. in Orat.</hi>
                        </note>; That we must first distinguish of the <hi>Termes</hi> in all Propositions before we come unto a positive definition of them. According to which Rule, if we search the Scripture, we shall there find that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is first taken <hi>personaliter,</hi> or <hi>essentialiter,</hi> for the third person in the <hi>Oeconomie</hi> of the glorious <hi>Trinity.</hi> We find him in this sense in the <hi>incarnation</hi> of our Lord and Saviour, as the principal Agent in that Work; <hi>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,</hi> Luk. 1.35. And in his Baptism, <hi>descending on him like a Dove,</hi> to fit him and prepare him for the <hi>Prophetical Office</hi> he was then to exercise; <hi>And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a Dove upon him,</hi> Luk. 3.22. From which descent St. <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us that he <hi>was anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power,</hi> and that from thenceforth he <hi>went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed with the Devil</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 10.38.</note>. In the next place, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is used in Scripture, to signifie the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of the holy Spirit; as in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. where it is said of the Apostles, that they were <hi>all filled with the holy Ghost,</hi> ver. 4. not with his <hi>essence,</hi> or his <hi>person,</hi> but with the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Spirit, the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; such as the Gift of <hi>Tongues</hi> mentioned in the following words; The <hi>Gift of the Holy Ghost</hi>; as it is called expresly, Ver. 38. Thus read we also that the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> was given by the <hi>hands of Peter, Act.</hi> 8.17, 18. And by the <hi>hands of Paul, Act.</hi> 19.6. In which we read, that when <hi>Paul</hi> had laid his hands upon them, <hi>the Holy Ghost came on them, and they spoke with tongues and Prophesied,</hi> which last words are a commentary upon those before, and shew, that by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> which did come upon them, is meant the <hi>Gift of Tongues,</hi> and the power of <hi>Prophecying,</hi> both which the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> then conferred upon them. And lastly it is taken not onely for the ability of doing Miracles, as speaking with strange Tongues, Prophecying, curing of Diseases, and the like to these, but for the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> which in the Church is given to some certain men to be <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>holy things</hi> to the rest of the people. As when <hi>Christ</hi> breathed on his Apostles, and said unto them, <hi>Receive the holy Ghost</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 20.22.</note>; that is to say, Receive ye an <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>spiritual power</hi> over the soules of men, a part whereof consisteth in the <hi>remitting</hi> and <hi>retaining</hi> of sins, mentioned in the words next following, and serving as a Comment to explaine the former. In which respect the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> said unto certain of the <hi>Elders in the Church of Antioch, Segregate mihi</hi> Barnabam <hi>&amp;</hi> Saulum, <hi>Separate unto me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the work whereunto I have called them, Act.</hi> 13.2. It is the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> which cals, it is his work to which they were called; and therefore <hi>separate mihi,</hi> separate to me, may not unfitly be expounded to my Work and Ministery, and consequently to the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>power</hi> which belongs unto it. Which being premised, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Article</hi> will in briefe be this, That we <hi>beleeve</hi> not onely that there is such a person as the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> in the Oeconomy of the blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> though that be principally intended;) but that he doth so distribute and dispose of his <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> as most conduceth to the edification of the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> But this I cannot couch in a clearer way, as to the sense and doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than in the words of Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> who doth thus expresse it,
<q>
                           <hi>Credimus spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum sanctum, qui est tertia persona in sacra Triadi, illum verum esse Deum, &amp;c.</hi> 
                           <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> i. e. we <hi>beleeve</hi> that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> who is the Third Person in the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> is very God, not made, nor created, nor begotten, but <hi>proceeding both from the Father and the Son,</hi> by an unspeakable means, and unknowne to man; and that it is his property to mollifie and soften mans heart, when he is once received thereinto, either by the wholesome Preaching of the Gospel, or by any other way; that he doth give men light, and guide them to the knowledge of God, to the wayes of truth, to newnesse of life, and to everlasting hope of salvation.</q>

                     <p>And yet before we come unto his <hi>Person,</hi> I mean his Nature and his Essence, We will first look a little on the <hi>quid Nominis,</hi> the name by which he is expressed in the Book of God. In the Original he is called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, which signifieth to <hi>breath,</hi> and is the same with the Latine <hi>Spiro,</hi> from whence comes <hi>Spiritus,</hi> or the Spirit, a name not given, as I suppose, because he doth proceed from the Father, or the Son, or both, in the way of <hi>breathing</hi> (though <hi>Christ</hi> be said to <hi>breath</hi> upon his Apostles, when he said <hi>receive the Holy Ghost</hi>) but because the <hi>breath</hi> being in it selfe an <hi>incorporeal</hi> substance, and that which is the great preservative of all living creatures, it got the name first of <hi>Spiritus vitae</hi> (we read it in our English, the <hi>breath of life,</hi> Gen. 11.7.) and afterwards came to be the name of all <hi>unbodyed, incorporeal</hi> essences. For thus is God said to be a <hi>Spirit,</hi> God is <hi>a Spirit, Ioh.</hi> 4.24. The Angels are called <hi>Ministring Spirits, Heb.</hi> 1.14. the Soule of man is called his <hi>Spirit,</hi> let us <hi>cleanse our selves,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>from all filthiness both of flesh and Spirit</hi> 
                        <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note>, that is, of the body and the soule: and by a <hi>metaphor,</hi> the motions of the minde whether good or evill, are called <hi>spirits</hi> also, as the spirit of <hi>giddiness, Isa.</hi> 19.14. <hi>the spirit of error,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. the <hi>spirit of envie, Iam.</hi> 4.5. which come all from the <hi>unclean spirit</hi> mentioned <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.24. And thus in general, the pious motions in the mind are called <hi>Spirits</hi> too, <hi>Quench not the spirit,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">1 Thes. 5.20.</note>, i. e. those godly motions to the works of Faith and Piety, which the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God doth secretly kindle in thee. For the word <hi>Ghost</hi> it is originally <hi>Saxon,</hi> and signifieth properly the soul of a man: as when we read of Christ, that he <hi>gave up the Ghost, Mark.</hi> 15.37. and in the rest of the Evangelists also, the meaning is, that his soule departed from his body, he <hi>yeelded up his soule</hi> to the hands of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, saith the Original, <hi>Expiravit,</hi> as the <hi>Latine</hi> reads it; that is to say, he <hi>breathed</hi> out his soul, or he <hi>breathed</hi> his last. Nor doth it signifie the <hi>soule</hi> onely (though that most properly) but generally also, any <hi>spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> as doth the word <hi>spiritus</hi> in the <hi>Latine</hi>: a touch whereof we have still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Adjective <hi>Ghostly,</hi> by which we mean that which is <hi>spiritual,</hi> as our <hi>Ghostly Father, Ghostly Counsel,</hi> i. e. our Father in the <hi>spiritual</hi> matters, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel that savoreth of the <hi>spirit.</hi> So then the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> are the same <hi>Person</hi> here, though in different words; and the word <hi>Holy</hi> which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, doth clearly difference him from all other <hi>spirits</hi>: Not that God being a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> is not holy also, or that the <hi>Angelical spirits</hi> are not replenished with as much <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse</hi> as a created nature can be capable of; but because it is his Office to sanctifie (or <hi>make holy</hi>) all the <hi>elect</hi> Children of God; therefore hath he the title or attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <hi>holy</hi> annexed unto him: And yet the title of <hi>holy</hi> is not always added to denote this person, though when we find mention of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> it is meant and spoken of him onely.

as to have found him out to be the <hi>Spirit of God the Father,</hi> from whom he doth <hi>proceed</hi> by an unspeakable way of <hi>emanation,</hi> and unknown to man; for he <hi>proceedeth from the Father,</hi> as our Saviour telleth us <note n="g" place="margin">John 15.26.</note>; and to be also the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> the Son of God, by whom he was <hi>breathed</hi> on the <hi>Apostles</hi>; and so <hi>proceeding from the Son,</hi> doth proceed from both.

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if either every sin committed after <hi>Baptism,</hi> or every sin of <hi>malice,</hi> or <hi>despair</hi> of mercy, or <hi>falling</hi> into heresie (especially in that large sense as <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strius</hi> takes it) should be uncapable of pardon, it were almost impossible for any man to be sayed. And for the rest, <hi>final Impenitency</hi> is not so properly a particular and distinct <hi>species</hi> of sin, as a general circumstance which may accompany any sin: And many of those who have <hi>renounced the Faith of Christ,</hi> under perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or called <hi>his divinity</hi> in question, did afterwards recant their Errors, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came good <hi>Christians.

Therefore to set this business right, it is judiciously observed by my Learned Friend Sir <hi>R. F.</hi> in his Tractate <hi>Of the Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy of the Holy Ghost,</hi> First, That this <hi>sin</hi> so much disputed and debated, in neither of the three <hi>Evangelists</hi> which record this passage, is called <hi>The sin against the Holy Ghost, but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost</hi>; Secondly, That <hi>blaspheming,</hi> according to the true <hi>Etymon</hi> of the Word, is a blasting of the fame of another man, a malicious detracting from him, or speaking against him; as both St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> do expound the word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. and <hi>Luke</hi> 12.10. Thirdly, That these words were spoken by our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> against the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who traduced his Miracles, affirming. That that wondrous work of <hi>casting out Devils,</hi> which he had wrought by the power of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> as he himself affirmeth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.28. was done by the <hi>power</hi> and help of <hi>Beelzebub, the Prince of Devils,</hi> Vers. 24. And Fourthly, That the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> being the eye-witnesses of such <hi>miracles,</hi> as might make them know that <hi>Christ</hi> was a <hi>Teacher come from God,</hi> did notwithstanding lay that reproach upon them, to the end, That the people being beaten off from giving credit to his <hi>miracles,</hi> should give no faith unto his Doctrine. Upon which grounds he builds this definition of it, <hi>viz. The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost was an evil-speaking or slandering of the miracles of our Saviour Christ, by those, who though they were convinced by the miracles, to believe that such works could not be done but by the power of God, did yet maliciously say, That they were wrought by the power of the Devil.</hi> And hereupon he doth infer these two following <hi>Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries</hi>; First, That we have no safe rule to conclude, that any but the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and their confederates, committed (in those times) this <hi>blasphemy</hi> against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> so condemned by <hi>Christ:</hi> And Secondly, That it is a matter of probability, that the blasphemy against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> is not a sin <hi>committable</hi> by any <hi>Christian</hi> who lived not in the time of our <hi>Lord and Saviour.</hi> And to say truth, If such a <hi>sin</hi> were practicable by us <hi>Christians</hi> since, it must needs be a very great marvel (if not somewhat more) that the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who were very precise and punctual in dehorting from all manner of <hi>sin,</hi> should never in any of their <hi>Epistles</hi> take notice of this, or give us any <hi>Caveat</hi> to beware thereof; and in particular, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> making a specification of the fruits of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and such a general muster of the <hi>works of the flesh,</hi> as are repugnant thereunto <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 5.19, &amp;c.</note>, should not so much as give a glance which doth look this way. To countenance the opinion of this Learned Gentleman, I shall adde here the judgement of two learned <hi>Iesuites. Maldonates</hi> first, Who makes this <hi>sin</hi> to be the sin of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who seeing our Saviour cast out Devils, <hi>Manifesta Spiritus Sancti opera daemoni tribuebant</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">
                           <hi>Maldonat.</hi> in Matth. 12.</note>, ascribed the visible works of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to the power of the <hi>Devil.</hi> Of <hi>Estius</hi>
                        <pb n="361" facs="tcp:59300:203"/>
next, who distinguishing betwixt the <hi>sin</hi> against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and the <hi>blasphemy</hi> against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> referreth to the first all sins of <hi>determined malice</hi>; to the second, onely such malicious and slanderous reproaches against the mighty works of God, <hi>Quale erat illud Scribarum divina miracula malitiosè calumniantium</hi> 
                        <note n="g" place="margin">
                           <hi>Estias</hi> in Marc. 3.</note>, As was that of the <hi>Scribes,</hi> maliciously slandering our Saviours miracles. And if it be a <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>blasphemy,</hi> call it which you will, not acted but by them, and on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, it is not <hi>practicable</hi> now.</p>
                     <p>But leaving this to the <hi>determination</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (lawfully and <hi>Canonically</hi> represented in an <hi>holy Synod,</hi>) to which, that Learned Gentleman doth submit his judgement; proceed we on in our discourse of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whose <hi>Divinity</hi> or <hi>Godhead,</hi> there is not so much difference in the <hi>Christian World,</hi> as in the manner of his <hi>Procession</hi> or <hi>Emission.</hi> And here indeed the World hath been long divided; the <hi>Greek</hi> Church keeping themselves to express words of <hi>Scripture</hi> 
                        <note n="h" place="margin">John 15.26.</note>, making him to proceed from the <hi>Father</hi> onely; the <hi>Latines,</hi> on the Authority of some later <hi>Councils,</hi> and <hi>Logical</hi> inferences from the Scripture, making him to proceed both from <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> And though these last may seem to have the worst end of the Cause, in as much as <hi>Logical inferences</hi> to men of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary capacities, are not so evident as plain Text of Scripture; yet do they <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize</hi> and <hi>curse</hi> the other, as most desperate <hi>Hereticks,</hi> if not <hi>Apostates</hi> from the Faith.

That which God giveth us for the <hi>benefit</hi> and <hi>use</hi> of others, must be so spent, that they may be the better for it; because not given unto us for own sakes onely, nor to gain others to our selves, but all to him. In which respect, Gods Servants are to be like <hi>Torches,</hi> which freely wast themselves to give light to others, like <hi>Powder</hi> on the day of some Publick <hi>Festival,</hi> which freely spends it self to rejoyce the multitude. That which he gives us for our selves must be so improved, that we may thereby become <hi>fruitful</hi> unto all <hi>good works, vessels prepared</hi> and <hi>sanctified for the Masters use.</hi> In the first of these we may behold the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; in the last, his <hi>office.</hi> His <hi>power</hi> in giving <hi>tongues</hi> to unlearned men, <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> to the <hi>ignorant, wisdom</hi> to the <hi>simple,</hi> the <hi>gift of prophecy</hi> even unto very <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Sucklings,</hi> I mean to men not studied in the Liberal Sciences.

In which regard the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is called in Scripture, <hi>The power of God; The power of the most High shall over-shadow thee, Luke</hi> 1.35.

Nor want I Reasons to induce me unto this opinion, that when <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had effected by his <hi>sorceries</hi> and <hi>lying wonders,</hi> to be called the <hi>great power of God</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 8.10.</note>; but that his purpose was to make men believe, that he was the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit of God</hi>; which title afterwards he bestowed on his strumpet <hi>Helena</hi>

To these he shewed himself after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and conversed with them for the space of forty days; to the intent he might the better fit them for so great a work. And being even upon the instant of departing from them, it seemed good to him to invest them with a <hi>sacred Power,</hi> and by some outward <hi>Ceremony</hi> and set <hi>Form</hi> of words, to dedicate them to the <hi>Ministry</hi> of such holy things, as were not to be meddled with by vulgar hands. <hi>He breathed on them</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost</hi>

When therefore <hi>Christ</hi> breathed on his Apostles, and said, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> he did, as it were, <hi>breathe</hi> out that <hi>power</hi> of Preaching the <hi>Word of Truth,</hi> and doing other <hi>holy Offices</hi> in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly received from the <hi>Holy Ghost.

He had promised them the <hi>Keys</hi> before <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 16.19.</note>, but now he hangs them at their <hi>girdle,</hi> and puts them absolutely and fully into their possession. <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to perform the rest, they were to tarry for yet a little longer, and then immediately to receive both from the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> whom he did promise to send them after his departure: And so accordingly he did; the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> descending on them, upon the tenth day after his <hi>Ascension,</hi> in the likeness of <hi>fiery cloven tongues</hi>

                     <p>But our Redeemer staid not here, as if he had sufficiently discharged his <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> Office, by furnishing his Apostles with the <hi>Gifts of the Spirit,</hi> and meant from henceforth to betake himselfe to the execution of the <hi>Priestly</hi> or the <hi>Kingly</hi> Offices, as being in themselves more glorious, and to him more honorable. <hi>When he ascended up on high he led captivity captive, and gave Gifts to men</hi>

                        <p>But to proceed, the word <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> in the <hi>Genuine</hi> sense, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the <hi>Body Collective</hi> of <hi>Gods Servants,</hi> since the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> is variously taken in the <hi>Book of God,</hi> and also in the <hi>Writings</hi> of the purest times. For first, it signifieth a <hi>particular Congregation</hi> of men assembled together, in some certain and determinate place, for <hi>Gods</hi> publick service. In this sense it is taken in those several Texts, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the <hi>Church in the house of</hi> Nymphas, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.15. <hi>To the Church in the house of</hi> Philemon, Vers. 5. <hi>The Church which was in the house of</hi> Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priscilla, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.19. I know that this is commonly expounded of their <hi>private Families,</hi> as if the house and family of each <hi>Faithful Christian,</hi> were in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> esteem reputed for a <hi>Church of Christ.</hi> But herein I prefer Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> opinion before all men else, who understands those words of the <hi>Congregation of Saints,</hi> which were wont to assemble at such <hi>houses</hi> for the performance of <hi>Divine Duties</hi> 
                           <note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mede</hi> of Churches, p. 20.</note>; it being not unusual with some principal <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> in those early days, to dedicate or set apart some private place within their <hi>own houses,</hi> for the residue of the <hi>Church</hi> to assemble in. And this he proveth, first from the <hi>singularity</hi> of the expression, which must <hi>needs</hi> include somewhat more than ordinary, somewhat which was not common to the rest of the <hi>Saints,</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> salutes in his <hi>Epistles.</hi> For in so large a Bedrol as is made in the last to the <hi>Romans,</hi> it is very probable that many, if not most of them, were <hi>Masters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi>; and then must all their <hi>Families</hi> be <hi>Churches</hi> too, as well as that of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> or else we must finde some other meaning of the words, than that which hath hitherto been delivered. Secondly, Had St. <hi>Paul</hi> intended by those words, <hi>The Church which is in their house,</hi> nothing but the Family of <hi>Nymphas, Philemon,</hi> and the rest, we should have found it put in the same expression which he doth elswhere use on the same occasion; as <hi>viz. The houshold of</hi> Aristobulus, <hi>the houshold of</hi> Narcissus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.10, 11. <hi>The houshold of</hi> Onesiphorus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.19. Patrobas, Hermes, <hi>and the Brethren which are with them,</hi> Rom. 16.14. Nereus <hi>and</hi> Olympas, <hi>and all the Saints which are with them,</hi> Vers. 15. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of expressions makes a different case of it, and plainly doth conclude in my apprehension, That by <hi>the Church in such an house,</hi> the Apostle meaneth, <gap reason="foreign">

And though he cite no antient <hi>Author</hi> to confirm him in this opinion, but <hi>Oecumenius</hi> (and he none of the antientest neither:) Yet in a <hi>matter</hi> of this nature, I may say of him, as <hi>Maldonat</hi> doth of <hi>Euthymius</hi> in a greater point, whose single judgement he preferreth before all the rest of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> viz. <hi>Quem minorem licet &amp; solum autorem, verisimilia tamen dicentem, quam plures ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joresque illos sequi malo</hi>

                        <p>But to proceed unto the other acceptions of the word <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> it is also used to signifie in holy Scripture, <hi>The Church of some City,</hi> with the <hi>Region</hi> or <hi>Country</hi> round about it, a <hi>National</hi> or <hi>Provincial Church,</hi> under the Government of one, or many <hi>Bishops,</hi> and subordinate <hi>Ministers</hi>; as the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Thessalonians, Romans,</hi> and the rest mentioned in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles. Thirdly, It is also used to signifie not the <hi>Church</hi> it self, or the <hi>whole Body</hi> of the people of a <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Province,</hi> agreeing in the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; but for the principal <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of it, such as possess the place of <hi>Iudicature</hi> in the <hi>Court,</hi> or <hi>Consistory.</hi> In this sense it is used in the 18 of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where the party wronged, and able to get no remedy otherwise, is willed by <hi>Christ,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59300:211"/>
to tell the Church</hi> 
                           <note n="y" place="margin">Matth. 18.17.</note>; that is to say, to make his complaint to them, who having the <hi>chief place</hi> and <hi>power</hi> in <hi>Spiritual matters,</hi> are able to compel the <hi>wrong-doer</hi> to make satisfaction, by menacing and inflicting the <hi>Churches Censures.

And lastly, it is used for the <hi>Body Collective</hi> or <hi>Diffusive</hi> of the people of <hi>God,</hi> made up of several <hi>Congregations, States,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> consisting both of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> of <hi>men</hi> as well under, as in <hi>Authority.</hi> In this respect, <hi>Christ</hi> is said to be <hi>the head of the Church,</hi> Eph. 5.23. <hi>The husband of the Church,</hi> V. 32. <hi>To love his Church, and to give himself for his Church,</hi> V. 25.

                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>Universal Church</hi> being thus found out, is represented to us in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Article</hi> by two <hi>marks</hi> or <hi>characters,</hi> by which she is to be discerned from such <hi>Publick meetings,</hi> which otherwise might claim that title. Of which, the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the <hi>generality</hi> of extent and latitude, and is that of <hi>Catholick</hi>; by which it is distinguished from the <hi>Iewish Synagogue,</hi> being shut up in the bounds of that Country onely; and from the <hi>private Conventicles</hi> of <hi>Schismatical</hi> persons: The other doth express the <hi>quality</hi> of the whole <hi>compositum,</hi> by the <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> of its several <hi>members,</hi> and is that of <hi>Holy</hi>; by which it is distinguished from the <hi>Assemblies</hi> of ungodly men, from the <hi>Ecclesia malignantium,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> calls it.</p>
                        <p>Or, if you will, we may by these behold the <hi>Church</hi> in her chief ingredients, which are the sanctimony of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>conversation</hi>; it is an <hi>holy Church</hi>; and the integrity of her doctrine, free from all <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> in the title <hi>Catholick:</hi> For the word <hi>Catholick</hi> is not onely used to signifie <hi>Universality</hi> of extent, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of doctrine also: The first in the <hi>natural,</hi> the second in the <hi>borrowed</hi> sense of the word.</p>
                        <p>In the first sense, the <hi>Church</hi> is called <hi>Catholick</hi> in respect of <hi>place; Thou hast redeemed us by thy blood out of every kinred, and tongue, and people, and nation</hi>

Ibid.</note>, saith the same St. <hi>Ierom.</hi> But here we must distinguish first of <hi>Heresies,</hi> before we venture to resolve of the point in Question, it being so, That neither every <hi>erroneous opinion</hi> may be called an <hi>Heresie,</hi> nor every <hi>Heresie</hi> of it self is so great and capital, as to exclude the man that holds it from the Church of Christ. Many in all ages have been branded and condemned for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> because they were not wholly of the <hi>same opinions</hi> with those of greatest reputation in their several Churches, though oftentimes in matters of inferior nature, in which <hi>diversity</hi> of <hi>opinions</hi> might have been admitted; whom it were both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and unchristian too, to bar from all their right and interess in the Christian Church. Nay granting, that the <hi>Heresie</hi> be in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> not taken up upon mistake, but <hi>wilfully</hi> and <hi>maliciously</hi> invented for some private ends; yet in regard they still retain amongst them the profession of other <hi>Divine verities,</hi> which they hold and believe in common, with the rest of the faithful (for should they erre in all points of the Christian Faith, they were no longer to be called <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Infidels</hi>) they pertain still unto the Church, and were so counted and esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in the strictest times. An Argument whereof may be, that when an <hi>Heretick</hi> recanted of his sin and heresie, and sought to be again admitted to the <hi>Churches Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>; he was not entred, as at first, by the door of <hi>Baptism,</hi> nor any of his acts made void, if a <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Minister,</hi> which he had done by vertue of his <hi>holy orders.</hi> And so far were the <hi>Antients</hi> from this new <hi>opinion</hi> of making <hi>Hereticks</hi> no <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> at all: That the <hi>Rebaptization</hi> of an <hi>Heretick,</hi> or of such as had been formerly baptized by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> was counted an error in St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and afterwards condemned for <hi>Heresie</hi> in those that wilfully maintained it upon his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The stories of those times make this plain enough, especially St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s works against the <hi>Donatists,</hi> where this point is very fully handled; and with his resolution in it, I conclude this controversie. <hi>Isti in quibusdam rebus nobiscum sunt, in quibusdam à nobis exierunt, &amp;c</hi>

And because every man had liberty to adde unto the holy Faith, what new points he pleased, a very great number of Hereticks and Apostates did ensue upon it, with whom the Church for a long time was perplexed and exercised. Besides that, great seditions and disorders did from hence arise; the rascal rabble of that Sect pressing unto the Rails of the Altar, threatning to fine the Priests, and cast them out of their Churches with reproach and infamy, if they presumed to mention the Authority of the General Council</hi> (that of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> it is he means) <hi>or to recite the names of those holy Fathers who were present at it.</hi> So far, and to this purpose he, in which we may discern a great deal of the humor, as well as we have found the name of our new <hi>Acephali.</hi>

                        <p>But this is to be understood with a <hi>salvo jure,</hi> a reservation of the Rights and Privileges of such <hi>Christian Princes</hi> as God raised up to be <hi>nursing Fathers</hi> to his Church <note n="k" place="margin">Isai. 43.23.</note>.

                        <p>The constant practise of all godly Kings and Emperors, as well under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> as since the time of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> makes this plain enough: For if we please to search the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> we shall finde <hi>David</hi> giving <hi>Rules</hi> to the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> in matters which concerned the worship of God <note n="m" place="margin">1 Chro. 23.4, 5, &amp;c.</note>, dividing them in several <hi>ranks,</hi> appointing unto every rank the course of his ministery, composing <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> to the praise of God, prescribing how they should be <hi>sung,</hi> with what kind of instrument <note n="n" place="margin">Ib. c. 25.12, 13.</note>, and ordering with what <hi>vestments</hi> the <hi>Singing-men</hi> should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in the act of their service.

A matter very necessary, as the world now goes; in which, so many <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Factions</hi> do distract mens mindes, that <hi>Truth</hi> is in danger to be lost by too much curiosity in enquiring after it. For as the most Reverend Father, the late Lord Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, <hi>Whiles one Faction cries up the Church above the Scripture, and the other side, the Scripture to the contempt and neglect of the Church, which the Scripture it self teacheth men both to honor and obey; They have so far endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered the belief of the one, and the authority of the other, That neither hath its due from a great part of men</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Relat. of the Conf. in the Epistle Dedic.</note>. The Church commends the Scripture to us as the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which she hath carefully preserved from the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> to this day; and so far we are willing to give credence to her, as to believe that therein she hath done the duty of a <hi>faithful witness,</hi> not giving testimony to any supposititious or corrupted Text, but to that onely which doth carry the impressions in it of the Image and Divine Character of the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> But if a <hi>difference</hi> do arise about the sense and meaning of this very <hi>Scripture,</hi> or any <hi>controversie</hi> do break forth on the mis-understanding of it, or the applying and perverting it to mens private purposes (which is the general source and fountain of all <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi>;) we will not therein hearken to the voice of the Church, but every man will be a Church to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and follow the <hi>Dictamen</hi> (or the <hi>illumination,</hi> as they please to call it) of their <hi>private Spirit.</hi> It therefore was good counsel of a learned man of our own,
<q>Not to indulge too much to our own affections, or trust too much unto the strength of a single judgment, in the <hi>controverted</hi> points of Faith; but rather to relie on the authority and judgment of the Church therein. For seeing (saith he) that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in our time are grown in number so many, and in nature
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59300:218"/>
so intricate, that few have time and leasure, and fewer strength of understanding to examine them; what remaineth for men desirous of satisfaction in things of such consequence, but diligently to search out which of all the Societies of men in the world, is that <hi>blessed company of holy ones,</hi> that <hi>houshold of faith,</hi> that <hi>Spouse of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Church of the living God,</hi> which is the <hi>pillar and ground of truth</hi>; that so we may imbrace her communion, follow her directions, and rest in her judgment <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Field</hi> of the Church in Epist. Dedic.</note>.</q>
Very good counsel, I confess, and such as is to be pursued by all <hi>sober Christians:</hi> But being this counsel doth suppose, as a matter granted, that the <hi>true Church</hi> is very easie to be found if it be carefully sought after; which doth imply the constant and perpetual <hi>visibility</hi> of it, (however controverted and denied by some later Writers:) I shall first labor to make good that which he supposeth, and prove that which he takes for granted; that so we may proceed the better on our following search, and rest the surer on the judgment of the <hi>Church,</hi> being once found out.</p>
                     <p>And here I shall not need to look back on those, who making none to be of the <hi>Church,</hi> but the <hi>elect children</hi> of God, do thereby make it altogether <hi>invisible</hi> to a <hi>mortal eye.</hi> We have spoke enough of that in the former Chapter, and therefore shall adde nothing now, but that it may seem strange unto men of reason, that when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they were <hi>received of the Church,</hi> as is said <hi>Acts</hi> 15.4. and yet could not see the <hi>Church</hi> which did receive them; or that <hi>Paul</hi> went unto <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and <hi>saluted the Church,</hi> as is said of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.22. in case he had not <hi>seen the Church</hi> which he did salute. We grant, indeed, the Church to be <hi>invisible</hi> in its more noble parts, that is to say, the <hi>Saints triumphant</hi> in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Elect</hi> on <hi>Earth:</hi> and that it is <hi>invisible</hi> in the whole latitude and extent thereof; for who can see so great a body, diffused in all places of the world, at one time, or in all the times of his life, supposing him to be the greatest traveller that was ever known. And yet this doth not make the <hi>Church</hi> to be more <hi>invisible,</hi> than any particular man may be said to be <hi>invisible</hi> also, because we do not see his Brain, his Heart, and his Liver, the three principal parts, which convey Life, and Blood, and motion to the rest of the Body; nor because we cannot see at once both his back and his belly, and every other member in his full proportion. The <hi>visibility</hi> of the Church is proved sufficiently by the <hi>visibility</hi> of those several and respective Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations or Assemblies of men, which are convened together under lawful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters for the <hi>Administration</hi> of the <hi>Word and Sacraments</hi>; to which, men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, as they see occasion, for their <hi>spiritual comfort,</hi> and instruction in the <hi>things of God</hi>; with whom they may joyn themselves in his publick worship, with reference to that soul and power of <hi>Government,</hi> which animates and directs the whole. And such a <hi>Visibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> there hath always been, from <hi>Adam</hi> down to <hi>Noah,</hi> from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from him to <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> from thence to <hi>Christ,</hi> and from <hi>Christs</hi> time unto the present. It is true, the light hereof hath been sometimes dangerously <hi>ecclipsed,</hi> but never extinguished; no more than is the Sun when got under a Cloud. <hi>Desicere videtur Sol, non defi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Since God first had a <hi>Church,</hi> it hath still been <hi>visible,</hi> though more or less, according unto times and seasons, more in some places than in others, although not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in such whole and sound condition, as it ought to be. They who are otherwise perswaded, conceive that they have found some <hi>intervals</hi> or space of time, in which there was no <hi>Visible Church</hi> on the face of the <hi>Earth</hi>; of which times there are two remarkable under the <hi>Law,</hi> and two as notable as those since the <hi>birth of the Gospel.</hi> Under the <hi>Law</hi> they instance in the reign of <hi>Ahab,</hi> of which, <hi>Elijah</hi> makes complaint, That they had <hi>laid waste the Church, and slain the Prophets</hi>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> King of <hi>Syrius,</hi> of which it is reported in the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> was defiled, the <hi>publick Sacrifices</hi> interdicted <note n="e" place="margin">1 Mac. 1.</note>. <hi>Circumcision</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath</hi> abrogated; and more than so, the <hi>Idols</hi> of the <hi>Syrians</hi> publickly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced for the people to fall down and worship, insomuch, as <hi>all those who sought after righteousness and justice, were fain to flie unto the wilderness, there to

save themselves</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">1. Mac. 2.19.</note>. But the answer unto this is easie, For though those instances do prove that the <hi>Church</hi> at those times was in ill-condition, in regard to her <hi>external peace</hi>; yet prove they not, that there was such a <hi>general defection</hi> from the <hi>worship of God,</hi> as to make the <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>invisible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For first, The complaint of <hi>Elijah</hi> was not universal, in reference to the whole <hi>Church of God,</hi> but in relation onely unto that of <hi>Israel,</hi> where King <hi>Ahab</hi> reigned; a <hi>Schismatical Church</hi> that, when it was at the best, and sometimes an <hi>Idolatrous</hi> one also. The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Iudah</hi> stood entire in the <hi>service of God,</hi> according to the prescript of his <hi>holy Law,</hi> under the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the good King <hi>Iehosaphat</hi>; a Prince, who with a perfect heart served the <hi>God of his Fathers,</hi> and who preserved the people under his command in the <hi>true Religion.</hi> The Sun shined comfortably on <hi>Iudah,</hi> though an <hi>Egyptian darkness</hi> had over-spread the whole Realm of <hi>Israel.</hi> And if <hi>Elijah</hi> fled for safety to the <hi>woods</hi> and <hi>deserts,</hi> and did not flie for succor to the <hi>Land of Iudah,</hi> it was not out of an opinion, that the <hi>two Tribes</hi> had Apostated from their God as well as the <hi>ten,</hi> but out of a wise and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable fear of being delivered by those of <hi>Iudah,</hi> into the hands of his enemies; <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> being at that time in good terms with <hi>Ahab,</hi> by whom <hi>Elijah</hi> stood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for <hi>troubling</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the other instance under King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the Text indeed describes it for a great persecution, greater than which that Nation never suffered under; but it declares withal expresly, that there was no such <hi>general defection</hi> from the <hi>Law of God,</hi> as was projected by the Tyrant. For the common people stood couragiously to their <hi>old Religion,</hi> and neither would obey the <hi>Kings Commandment</hi> in offering to the <hi>Syrian Idols,</hi> or eating meats which were prohibited by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses.</hi> And as for those which fled unto the <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Wilderness,</hi> they fled not thither onely for their personal safety, in hope to finde an <hi>hiding place</hi> in those impenetrable desarts; but as unto a place of strength, or a fortified City, from whence they might sally (as they did) against their enemies; and in the which, they might enjoy that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the <hi>exercise</hi> of their own <hi>Religion,</hi> which could not be hoped for in <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and other places under the command of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> A <hi>persecuted Church</hi> we finde both before, and here; but the <hi>persecution</hi> neither held so long, nor was so general, as to make the Church to be <hi>invisible.</hi>
                     </p>

                        </note>; who in their several times and ages, had publickly opposed some errors and corruptions in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereby drew upon themselves the hatred of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy. And by this means it was conceived, That a <hi>perpetual visibility</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> might be fairly proved; the fancy of an <hi>invisible Church</hi> beginning to grow out of credit with most sorts of men; especially considering, that besides the opposition made by those before remembred, <hi>Clemangius, Armachanus, Lincolniensis,</hi> had severally inveighed against the pride and vices of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; and that there were many things also in the <hi>Church</hi> it self, whereof St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> wished a <hi>Reformation.</hi> But this, in my opinion, will not do the deed: For neither did <hi>Clemangius, Armachanus,</hi> or the rest that follow, withdraw themselves from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; or if they had, they did not thereby make themselves a <hi>distinct Church</hi> from it, and least of all, a <hi>Church agreeing in all points,</hi> (perhaps not in any) with those which are defended in the <hi>Protestant Schools.</hi> And as for <hi>Wicliff, Hus,</hi> and the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> though they held some opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which the <hi>Protestants</hi> do, yet held they many others which the <hi>Protestants</hi> do not <note n="p" place="margin">

and the rest of those scattered companies, from whom this goodly <hi>Pedegree</hi> is to be derived: Whereof the one started up in <hi>England,</hi> the other long before him in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the third in <hi>France,</hi> and others in the Mountains of <hi>Italy,</hi> not having a <hi>Succession</hi> from, nor giving a <hi>Succession</hi> unto one another. So that relinquishing this plea as a sorry shift, which onely seemed to be excogitated for the present pinch; If any ask me, <hi>Where the Church was before</hi> Luthers <hi>time,</hi> I answer generally, First, That if the <hi>Church</hi> had failed in these <hi>North-west</hi> parts of the world (as indeed it did not) yet were there many <hi>Christian Churches</hi> in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> the <hi>Greeks, Nestorians, Melchites, Abassins,</hi> with divers others, with whom the first <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> might have held <hi>communion,</hi> though differing from them in some points of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior moment. And secondly, I answer more particularly, that our Church was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther,</hi> where it hath been since, in <hi>Germany, France, England, Italy,</hi> yea, and <hi>Rome</hi> it self; A <hi>sick Church</hi> then, but since by Gods grace brought to more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health; a <hi>corrupt Church</hi> then, but since reformed of those particular abuses, both in life and doctrine, which seemed most offensive. That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is a <hi>true Church,</hi> (though not the true Church) no sober <hi>Protestant</hi> will deny. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> grants it in his Book <hi>De Ecclesia, cap.</hi> 19. and so doth Dr. <hi>Whitakers</hi> also, <hi>Cont.</hi> 2. <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. as great an enemy as any, of the <hi>Romish</hi> factions. The like doth Dr. <hi>Raynolds</hi> in his fifth <hi>Thesis,</hi> though he deny it (as he might) to be either the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> it self, as they vainly boast, or any found member of the same. Nay, even the very <hi>Separatists</hi> do not grutch them that, as <hi>Francis Iohnson</hi> in his Treatise called <hi>A Christian Plea,</hi> Printed 1627. <hi>pag.</hi> 123, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>true Church</hi> in the <hi>verity</hi> of essence, as the <hi>Church</hi> is a company of men which profess the <hi>Faith of Christ,</hi> and are baptized into his <hi>Name</hi>; but neither <hi>Orthodox</hi> in all points of doctrine, nor sound or justifiable in all points of practise.

No <hi>new man</hi> in this case created, that is <hi>Gods sole privilege,</hi> but the <hi>old man</hi> cured: No <hi>new Church</hi> founded in the other, that belongs to <hi>Christ,</hi> but the <hi>old Reformed.</hi> When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> purged the <hi>Temple,</hi> and other <hi>godly Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the Land of <hi>Iudah</hi> did reform <hi>Religion,</hi> as we know they did; Neither did the one erect a <hi>new Temple,</hi> or the others frame a <hi>new Religion,</hi> but onely rectified in both what they found amiss. And so it was also in the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> further than which, we need not go to look <hi>where our Church was before</hi> Luthers <hi>time,</hi> or to finde out that constant and perpetual <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> which hath been hitherto the subject of this Disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
                     <p>But put the case the worst that may be, and let it be supposed this once, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had so apostated from the <hi>Faith of Christ,</hi> that it ceased to be a <hi>Church</hi> at all, both in <hi>name</hi> and <hi>nature</hi>; yet were there many <hi>Christian Churches</hi> in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> all of them <hi>visible</hi> no doubt, as they still continue, which constantly maintained all those several Truths, that had been banished and exploded in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For that the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> should so fall away, as to teach any <hi>doctrine</hi> contrary to the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> is plainly to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made by <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Saviour.</hi> It is true indeed, <hi>Christ</hi> hath not bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, nor annexed his spirit so inseparably to a <hi>National</hi> or <hi>Provincial Church,</hi> but that it may fall at last unto such desperate and dangerous Errors, as finally may cut it off as an unsound <hi>Member</hi> from the residue of the <hi>Body Mystical.</hi> The <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> may be removed as well out of any <hi>Church,</hi> as from that of <hi>Ephesus</hi>

As the Church of</hi> Jerusalem, Alexandria, <hi>and</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, <hi>hath erred, so also the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath erred not onely in their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and manner of Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith,</hi> saith the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Article <note n="x" place="margin">Artic. 19.

He promised his <hi>Apostles</hi> to send them a <hi>Comforter,</hi> who should <hi>teach them all things, Iohn</hi> 14.16. who should guide them <hi>into all truth, Iohn</hi> 16.13. Not that he bound himself hereby to teach them all things, or lead them into all truths, of what sort soever; For it is sure, that some things the Apostles were still ignorant of, as of the day and hour of the <hi>General Iudgment</hi>; And probable enough it is, that there were many <hi>Philosophical</hi> and <hi>Historical</hi> truths, into which, the <hi>Spirit</hi> did not lead them. <hi>All things,</hi> and <hi>all truth,</hi> must be understood of all things truly necessary to a mans salvation. <hi>In omnem veritatem,</hi> i. e. <hi>Omnem quae expedit ad salutem</hi>

That makes directly against those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have obtruded many Ceremonies on the Church of Christ, plainly repugnant to the Word, and therefore not to be observed without <hi>deadly sin.</hi> The other Rule is given by our Learned <hi>Andrews,</hi> and that relates to those of the opposite faction. <hi>Every Church</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath power to begin a custom, and that custom power to binde her own children to it; Provided</hi> (that is the Rule) <hi>that her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate customs do not affront the general, received by others</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This was the judgment and the practise of the best times of the <hi>Church,</hi> when <hi>superstitious vanities</hi> had not yet prevailed; according as I finde it registred in the works of <hi>Augustine, Honoramus sane memorias eorum, tanquam sanctorum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum Dei, qui usque ad mortem corporum pro veritate certarunt</hi>

                     <p>First, for the first, We do not think it lawful <hi>to pray unto them,</hi> because that by the <hi>testimony</hi> and <hi>confession</hi> of the very <hi>adversary,</hi> we have no warrant for it from the <hi>holy Scriptures.</hi> Sure I am, that <hi>Dominicus Bannes,</hi> a <hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> and one of the learnedst of the pack, doth confess ingenuously, That the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Invocation</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Worship of Images,</hi> are neither taught expresly, nor implicitely, in the <hi>Word of God</hi>

                     <p>Lastly, We do not think it <hi>lawful,</hi> because we cannot be perswaded that it stands with <hi>Reason</hi>; which reasonable men must needs allow some place to, in <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> appertaining to the <hi>worship of God.</hi> And <hi>Reason</hi> tells us, how improper and absurd it is, To <hi>pray</hi> to those, of whom we have no certainty that <hi>they hear our prayers</hi>; but certainty enough, that they cannot grant them: The <hi>gifts and graces</hi> which we ask for, not being in the power of the <hi>Saints</hi> to give, as is acknowledged generally in the <hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which <hi>Reason</hi> is so strong on the <hi>Protestant</hi> side, That the <hi>Papists</hi> have no way to bear off the blow, but by an <hi>illustration</hi> drawn from the <hi>Courts of Princes:</hi> To whom, since every private subject may not have <hi>access,</hi> they are necessitated to make use of some <hi>powerful favorite,</hi> or otherwise to commend their <hi>sute,</hi> and tender their <hi>Petitions,</hi> to those which are in <hi>ordinary attendance</hi> on him.

                     <p>The truth or probability of this opinion, I dispute not here, having declared my self in that point already: All that I shall from hence infer, be it true or false, is, That according to their <hi>own Divinity,</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi> before <hi>Christs Resurrection</hi> could very ill sollicite the affairs of the <hi>Iews,</hi> their <hi>children,</hi> as being not till then admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>presence</hi> of the <hi>Lord Almighty,</hi> nor yet possessed, though sure enough at last, of their own felicities. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that great master of <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,</hi> hath resolved it so <note n="m" place="margin">

This is all, and this we will not grutch them; for observe the <hi>Inference.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as his use was, spake in <hi>Parables,</hi> even in the <hi>Parables</hi> of the <hi>lost sheep,</hi> the <hi>lost groat,</hi> and the <hi>Prodigal Son.</hi> A certain man having a flock consisting of an <hi>hundred sheep,</hi> doth lose one of the <hi>hundred</hi>; and after long search made doth finde it, and bring it <hi>back unto the Fold</hi>

supposed, having a little stock of <hi>ten peeces of silver,</hi> to lose one of her peeces; and, after great pains taken, to meet with it again <note n="p" place="margin">Vers. 8.</note>. On this they call together their <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>neighbors,</hi> and say unto them, <hi>Rejoyce with us, for we have found the sheep, and the peece of silver,</hi> which was lately lost <note n="q" place="margin">Vers. 6.8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note>. So then, unless the <hi>man</hi> and <hi>woman</hi> in our <hi>Saviours Parable,</hi> had pleased to call their <hi>friends</hi> together, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to them the finding of the <hi>lost sheep,</hi> and the lost <hi>peece of silver,</hi> the <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>neighbors</hi> might have been so far from shewing any <hi>great joy</hi> at the recovery, that possibly they might have never heard of the loss. If so, then certainly it cannot be inferred from hence, that the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> which are the <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>neighbors</hi> of those several <hi>Parables,</hi> are privy to our wants on <hi>Earth,</hi> by <hi>course</hi> and <hi>ordinary dispensation</hi>; but onely this, that some things, and at some times, are imparted to them by their <hi>God,</hi> by way of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary revelation.</hi> No <hi>Protestant</hi> (as I conceive) so void of <hi>Reason,</hi> as to make question of the one; no <hi>Papist</hi> hitherto so cunning, as to prove the other.</p>
                     <p>This, though it seem to be a very bold and venturous <hi>Assertion,</hi> may very easily be made good, though we should use no other <hi>medium</hi> for the proof thereof, than their own <hi>difference</hi> and <hi>disagreement</hi> in the manner of it. A <hi>difference</hi> or <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> indeed so great and admirable, that fire and water will more easily be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, than their <hi>opinions.</hi> Five several ways have been invented by the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and those that since have travelled in the <hi>controversies</hi> of the present times, by which to make the <hi>Saints</hi> acquainted with our state on <hi>Earth</hi>; some <hi>false,</hi> others <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,</hi> and the rest so <hi>doubtful,</hi> that there is no belief to be given unto them, no building to be laid on such weak foundations.</p>
                     <p>The first of these <hi>opinions</hi> is, <hi>Quod sint ubique praesentes</hi>

                     <p>First then we are to speak of the <hi>Forgiveness of sins,</hi> and therein we will first behold the <hi>whole body of sin,</hi> in its own foul nature, that so we may the better esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the <hi>great mercies</hi> of God in the <hi>forgiveness</hi> of the same. And for behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole body of sin in <hi>its own foul nature,</hi> we must first take notice, That it pleased God in the beginning to exhibite to the world, then but newly made, a <hi>lively copy</hi> of himself, a Creature fashioned <hi>ad similitudinem suam,</hi> after his own <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 1.27.</note>, saith the Text. In the creating of the which, as he collected all the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies</hi> of inferior Creatures, so did he also crown him with those <hi>heavenly graces,</hi> with which he had before endued the most holy <hi>Angels</hi>; that is to say, a <hi>rectitude</hi> or <hi>clearness</hi> in his <hi>understanding,</hi> whereby he was enabled to distinguish betwixt <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>error</hi>; and with a <hi>freedom</hi> in <hi>his will,</hi> in the choice of his own ways and counsels, <hi>Ut suae faber esse possit fortunae,</hi> That if he should forsake that station wherein God had placed him, he might impute it unto none, but his wretched-self. It is true, God said unto him in the way of <hi>Caution,</hi> That in <hi>what day soever</hi> he did eat of the <hi>fruit</hi> forbidden, he should <hi>die the death:</hi> But he had neither undertaken to <hi>preserve him</hi> that he should not eat, and so by consequence not sin; much less had he <hi>ordained</hi> him to that end and purpose, that he should eat thereof, and so die for ever. And true it is, that God <hi>fore-knew</hi> from before all eternity, unto what end this <hi>Liberty</hi> of man would come; and therefore had provided a most excellent remedy for the restoring of lapsed man to his grace and favor: Yet was not this <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> in <hi>Almighty God</hi> that so it would be, either a <hi>cause,</hi> or a <hi>necessity,</hi> or so much as an <hi>occasion,</hi> that so it should be. And it is therefore a good rule of <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> seconded by <hi>Origen,</hi> and divers others of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

And as the <hi>Prodigal childe</hi> being an ill husband on the stock which his Father gave him, did quickly waste the same by his <hi>riotous living,</hi> suffered the extremities of cold and hunger, and was fain to cast himself again on his Fathers goodness <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 15.18.</note>; so man not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing well that <hi>stock</hi> which the Lord had given him, gave himself over to the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism</hi> of his eye and appetite; By means whereof, he lost those excellent endowments of his first Creation, was shamefully thrust out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and in conclusion fain to cast himself on the mercies of God, as well for his subsistence here, as his <hi>salvation</hi> hereafter.

sad a ruine. For there we finde how God created him after his <hi>own Image,</hi> placed him in <hi>Paradise,</hi> commanded him not to meddle with the <hi>Tree of good and evil,</hi> threatned that in case he did eat thereof, he <hi>should surely die</hi>; and lastly, with what grievous punishments he did chastise him, for violating that Commandment <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note>. All which had been too like a <hi>Pageant,</hi> if God had laid upon him a <hi>necessity</hi> of sin and death, and made him to <hi>no other end,</hi> as some teach us now, but by his fall to set the greater estimate on his own <hi>rich mercies.</hi> So excellently true is that of <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticus,</hi> though the <hi>Author</hi> of it be <hi>Apocryphal, That God made man in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and left him in the hands of his own counsels</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Ecclus. 15.14.</note>. And this is the unanimous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>New Testament</hi> also, where it is said, That by <hi>man came death,</hi> and <hi>that not onely of the body, but of the soul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.21. <hi>That by one man, sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, and death by sin,</hi> Rom. 5.12. <hi>That by one mans disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence many were made sinners,</hi> Vers. 19. <hi>That all die in</hi> Adam, Vers. 22.

                        <note n="g" place="margin">Jam. 1.13.</note>. If God <hi>tempt no man,</hi> as it is plain by St. <hi>Iames</hi> he doth not, then was not <hi>Adam</hi> (that <hi>one man</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> relates to) either <hi>tempted</hi> by him, or by his purpose and decree drawn into <hi>temptation.</hi> If every man ought to ascribe his falling into sin and death, unto a <hi>voluntary yeelding</hi> to his own desires, then certainly ought <hi>Adam</hi> so to do, as well as any, who by his own unworthy lusts, was drawn away so visibly to his own destruction. We might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Scripture to the Primitive Fathers, but that the evidence would be too great to be listned to: Suffice it that we finde not any of that <hi>sacred number,</hi> which ever made <hi>God accessary</hi> to the act of sin; scarce any of those <hi>blessed Spirits,</hi> which either of set purpose, or upon the by, did not oppose so leud a <hi>Tenet.</hi>

them to <hi>sin</hi> also; there being, as themselves confess, no way unto the end but by the means.

                     <p>For if we look into the Scripture, we find that <hi>sin</hi> did not content it self with the person of <hi>Adam,</hi> as if it had been a sufficient victory to have brought him under, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in him, his whole Race and Off-spring, which were then <hi>radically</hi> and <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> in the loyns of <hi>Adam,</hi> had been infected also with the same contagion. For <hi>Adam</hi> is not here considered as a <hi>private person,</hi> who was to stand or fall to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone, without occasioning either good or evill unto any, more than in way of <hi>imitation</hi> of his great Example: But as the <hi>stock</hi> of all mankinde, who were to have a share in his weal or woe. For being the <hi>original</hi> and root (as before was said) of all mankind descended from him, whom he did <hi>represent</hi> at his first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he did receive that <hi>stock of righteousness</hi> which God gave unto him, not for himself onely, and his own particular benefit, had he used it well, but as the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Patrimony</hi> and Inheritance of himself and his. And having so improvidently lost both himself and it, by yeelding to the motions of that flesh which he was to govern, he lost it not onely for himself when he came under the <hi>attainture</hi> which the Law brought on him, but he did wholly forfeit it for himself and them; his Race or Off-spring which were then <hi>radically</hi> in his Loins, being involved with him in the same perdition. For as the Scripture saith of <hi>Levi,</hi> that he <hi>paid Tithes in</hi> Abraham <hi>unto</hi> Melchisedech, <hi>because he was in the Loyns of</hi> Abraham <hi>when</hi> Melchisedech <hi>met him</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 7 9, 10.</note>; so may we also say in the present case, that all men <hi>sinned</hi> and lost themselves in our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> because they were all of them <hi>in the Loyns of Adam</hi> when he lost himself. The Scripture saith not onely that <hi>sin came to man,</hi> or fell on him onely, as if the power thereof had terminated in that one mans person, on whom it first did come or fall, but that it <hi>came by man,</hi> as a Pipe or Conduit, by
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59300:240"/>
which it passed also unto others. <hi>By one man sin entred into the world,</hi> saith the Apostle to the <hi>Romans</hi>

And thirdly, That it is an <hi>inclination unto evil,</hi> to the works of wickedness, by means whereof (as afterwards the <hi>Article</hi> explains it self) <hi>the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and both together do incur the indignation of God.</hi> So that if we speak of <hi>Original sin</hi> formally, it is the <hi>privation</hi> of those excellent gifts of divine Grace, inabling us to know, love, serve, honor and trust in God, and to do the things that God delights in, which <hi>Adam</hi> once had, but did shortly lose; If <hi>materially,</hi> it is that <hi>habitual inclination</hi> which is found in men, most averse from God, carrying them to the <hi>inordinate love</hi> and desire of finite things, of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more than the Creator; which is so properly a sin, that it makes guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation the person whosoever it be in whom it is found.

makes us subject to the <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>displeasure of God.</hi> Last of all, we are told by the same <hi>Apostle,</hi> (for we will clog this point with no further evidence) <hi>That the wages of sin is death</hi>

And thereupon we may conclude, That wheresoever we behold a <hi>spectacle</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> there was a <hi>receptacle</hi> of some <hi>sin.</hi> Now we all know, that <hi>death</hi> doth spare no more the <hi>Infant,</hi> than the <hi>Elder man</hi>; and that sometimes our <hi>children</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of life, assoon almost as they enjoy it, sometimes born dead, and sometimes dead assoon as born, <hi>Prima quae vitam dedit hora carpsit,</hi> in the Poets language. A <hi>wages</hi> no way due to <hi>Infants</hi> for their <hi>actual sins</hi> (for <hi>actually</hi> as yet they have not offended;) and therefore there must needs be in them some <hi>original guilt,</hi> some <hi>Birth-sin</hi> (as the <hi>Article</hi> calls it) which brings so quick a death upon them. And this is further verified from the <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>continual practise</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> which hath provided, That the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi> be conferred on <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> before they come unto the use of <hi>Speech</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi>; yea, and at some times, and on some occasions (as namely, in cases of extremity, and the danger of death) to <hi>Christen</hi> them assoon as born.

And with this that of <hi>Origen</hi> doth agree ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, <hi>Si nihil esset in parvulis quod ad remissionem deberet &amp; indulgentiam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere, gratia Baptismi superflua videretur</hi>

A second thing we finde in the <hi>Churches practise,</hi> and in the practise of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of most <hi>note and evidence,</hi> which serves exceeding fitly to confirm this point; and that is, That neither the <hi>Church</hi> in general doth celebrate the <hi>birth-day</hi> of the <hi>Saints departed,</hi> but the day onely of their deaths; nor any of the <hi>Saints</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves did solemnize the day of their own <hi>Nativity</hi> with <hi>Feasts</hi> and <hi>Triumphs.</hi> First, for the <hi>practise</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> we may take this general rule once for all, <hi>Non nativitatem sed mortem sanctorum ecclesia pretiosam judicat &amp; beatam,</hi> That the <hi>Church</hi> reckoneth not the day of their <hi>birth,</hi> but the <hi>death-day</hi> (if I may so call it) of the <hi>Saints</hi> to be blest and precious.

countenanced by <hi>Authors</hi> of unquestioned credit, (not to say any thing further in so clear a case from the <hi>concurrent Testimonies</hi> of the <hi>Antient Fathers</hi>) That there is such a sin as <hi>Birth-sin,</hi> or <hi>Original sin,</hi> a <hi>Natural corruption</hi> radicated in the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> which makes us subject to the <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>indignation</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Thus have we seen the <hi>Introduction</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> the first act of the <hi>Tragedy</hi>; let us next look upon the second, on the <hi>Propagation,</hi> the manner how it is derived from <hi>Adam</hi> unto our <hi>Fore-fathers,</hi> and from them to us. And this we finde to be a matter of greater difficulty. St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> in whose time these <hi>controversies</hi> were first raised by the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> did very abundantly satisfie them in the <hi>quod sit</hi> of it; but when they pressed him with the <hi>quo modo,</hi> how it was propagated from <hi>Adam,</hi> and from one man to another, he was then fain to have recourse to Gods secret justice, and his unsearchable dispensation. <hi>Et hoc quidem libentius disco quam doceo, ne audeam docere quod nescio</hi> 
                        <note n="z" place="margin">
                           <hi>August.</hi> adv. <hi>Iulian.</hi> l. 5.</note>, as with great modesty and caution he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the business: For whereas <hi>sin</hi> is the contagion of the <hi>soul,</hi> and the <hi>soul</hi> oweth its <hi>being</hi> unto God alone, and is not <hi>begotten</hi> by our <hi>parents</hi>; the <hi>Pelagians</hi> either would not, or could not be answered in their <hi>Quere,</hi> How Children should receive corruption from their <hi>Parents,</hi> not could the good <hi>Father</hi> give them satisfaction unto their demand. But as a <hi>Dwarf</hi> standing on the shoulders of a <hi>Giant,</hi> may see many things far off, not visible to the <hi>Giant</hi> himself; so those of the ensuing times, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>foundations</hi> which were laid by <hi>Augustine,</hi> have added to him the solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such doubts and difficulties, as in his time were not discovered. Of these, some have delivered, That the <hi>soul</hi> contracts contagion from the flesh, even in the very act of its first <hi>infusion,</hi> the union of the <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>body</hi>; nor is it any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that it should so be. We see that the most excellent <hi>Wines</hi> retain their <hi>natural sweetness,</hi> both of taste and colour, as long as they are kept in some curious Vessel; but if you put them into <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>musty bottles</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 9.17.</note>, they lose forthwith their former <hi>sweetness,</hi> participating of the uncleanness of the Vessel in which they are: Besides, it is a <hi>Maxim</hi> amongst <hi>Philosophers, Quod mores animae sequuntur tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peramentum corporis,</hi> That the soul is much byassed and inclined in the actions of it unto the <hi>temper</hi> of the <hi>body</hi>; and if the equal or unequal temper of the body of man, can (as it seems) incline the minde unto the <hi>actual</hi> embracing of good or evil; then may it also be believed, that the <hi>corruptions</hi> of the flesh may dispose the soul, even in the first <hi>infusion</hi> of it, to some <hi>habitual inclinations</hi> unto sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Than which, though there may be a more solid, there cannot be a more conceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Answer: But others walking in a more <hi>Philosophical way,</hi> conceive that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the great work of <hi>Generation,</hi> consists not in the introduction of the <hi>form</hi> onely, or in preparing of the <hi>matter,</hi> but in the constituting the whole <hi>compositum,</hi> the whole man, as he doth consist both of <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>body:</hi> And that a man is, and may properly be said to beget a man, notwithstanding the <hi>Creation</hi> of his <hi>soul</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> because that the <hi>materials</hi> of the <hi>Birth</hi> do proceed from man, and those <hi>materials</hi> so disposed and actuated by the <hi>emplastick</hi> vertue of the <hi>Seed,</hi> that they are fitted for the <hi>soul,</hi> and as it were produced unto <hi>Animation.</hi> Which reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, though it be more obscure unto <hi>vulgar</hi> wits, is more insisted on by the <hi>learned,</hi> than the former is, and possibly may have more countenance from <hi>holy Scripture.</hi> When God made man, it is said of him, That he was <hi>created after Gods own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>

                           <hi>Cajetan</hi> ap. Field of the Ch. l. 3. c. 9.</note>, <hi>That which doth positively make sin venial, or not venial, is the state of the subject wherein it is found. If therefore we respect the nature of sin as it is in it self, without grace, it will remain eternally in stain or guilt, and so subject the sinner to eternal punishment: But yet such is the nature of some sins, either in regard of the matter wherein they are conversant, or their not being done with full consent, that they do not necessarily imply an exclusion of Grace out of the subject in which they are found, and so do not necessarily put the doers of them into such a state which positively makes them not to be venial, by removing grace, which is the fountain of remission. So that no sin is positively venial, as having any thing in it self which may claim remission, because it hath not any thing of Grace from whence all remission doth proceed; though many sins</hi> ex genere, <hi>or</hi> ex imperfectione actus (as before was said) <hi>that is to say, in reference to the matter wherein man offendeth, or to the manner, as not done with a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, may be said to be venial</hi> negative, <hi>and</hi> per non ablationem principii re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionis, <hi>in that it doth not necessarily imply the exclusion of grace, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of which grace from the souls of men, sins are named mortal.

                     <p>The third and last place, which is commonly alleged for proof that there are some sins <hi>irremissible</hi> in their own nature, is that of St. <hi>Iohn, If any man</hi> (saith he) <hi>see his brother sin a sin, which is not unto death, he shall ask, and God shall give life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death, I do not say he shall pray for it</hi> 
                        <note n="y" place="margin">1 John 5.16.</note>. In which words we finde two sorts of sins, <hi>a sin to death,</hi> and <hi>a sin that is not to death</hi>; a sin which is <hi>not unto death,</hi> for the remission of the which a man is bound to pray in behalf of his Brother; a <hi>sin to death,</hi> concerning which it seems unlawful for one man to pray for another. And yet it doth but seem so neither: For the <hi>Apostles</hi> words, <hi>I do not say he shall pray for it,</hi> amount not to a <hi>Negative,</hi> that he <hi>shall not pray for it,</hi> as the fautors of the contrary opinion would full gladly have it; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> a nature, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> had no minde to encourage them in it, because he could not promise them the success desired; but leaving every man to himself, <hi>to pray, or not to pray,</hi> as his affections to the party, or <hi>Christian</hi> pity of the case might induce him to. That by <hi>peccatum ad mortem</hi> somewhat more is meant than ordinary <hi>mortal sins,</hi> is a thing past question; but what it is, is not so easie to discover. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> will have the sin, which is here called a <hi>sin unto death,</hi> to be that <hi>sin</hi> wherein a mam continueth until his death without repentance <note n="z" place="margin">
                           <hi>August.</hi> de corrept. &amp; grat. c. 12.</note>; but addes withal, That in as much as the name of the <hi>sin</hi> is not expressed, many and different things may be thought to be it. <hi>Pacianus</hi> an old <hi>Catholick</hi> writer, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it of <hi>peccata manentia</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pacian.</hi> Epl. 3.</note>, Such sins as men continue in till the hour of death. St. <hi>Ierom</hi> reckoneth such men to commit this sin, <hi>Qui in sceliribus permanent,</hi> who abide in their wickedness, and express no sense nor sorrow of their lost estate. The <hi>Protestant</hi> writers do expound it generally of <hi>the sin against the Holy Ghost</hi>; For which, say they, no man ought to pray, because our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath testified it to be <hi>irremissible</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Fulk.</hi> on the Rhemist. Test. 1 Joh. 5.16.</note>. And to this end, they do allege a place from <hi>Ierom,</hi> affirming, <hi>Stultum esse pro eo orare qui peccaverit ad mortem,</hi> That it is a foolish thing to pray for him which <hi>sins unto death,</hi> because the man that is marked out to some visible ruine, <hi>nullis precibus erui potest,</hi> cannot possibly be <hi>reprieved</hi> by prayer. But herein <hi>Ierom</hi> is not consonant to himself elswhere; for in another place he telleth us, with more probability, that nothing else is here meant, but <hi>that a prayer for such a sin</hi> (whatsoever it be) <hi>is very difficulty heard</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ierom.</hi>
                        </note>. And this I take to be the truer, or at least the more probable meaning of the Apostle, who saith immediately before, <hi>This is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.14. And therefore lest we should conceive that this holds true in all <hi>Petitions</hi> whatsoever, which we make for others, he addes, That if it be a <hi>great sin,</hi> such as is not ordinarily forgiven, but <hi>punished with death,</hi> I dare not say, that you can either <hi>pray with confidence,</hi> or that I can give you any great hopes of prevailing in it. According as God said to the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, Pray not for this people, for I will not hear thee</hi> 
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Jere. 7.16.</note>. And though St. <hi>Augustine</hi> sometimes thought this sin to be <hi>final impenitency,</hi> or a continuance in sin till death without <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> yet in his Book of <hi>Retractations,</hi> he resolves the contrary, affirming, That we must <hi>despair of no body,</hi> no not of the wickedest, as long as he lives; and that <hi>we may safely pray for him, of whom we do not despair</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">

                     <p>THus have we in the former <hi>Chapter</hi> discoursed at large of the <hi>Introduction</hi> and <hi>Propagation</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and of the several <hi>species</hi> or kindes thereof; and also proved, by way of ground-work and foundation, that albeit <hi>sin</hi> in its own nature be so odious in the sight of God, as to draw upon the <hi>sinner everlasting damnation</hi>; yet that there is no sin so <hi>mortal,</hi> so deserving death, which is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>pardon</hi> or <hi>forgiveness</hi> by the <hi>mercy of God.</hi> We next descend unto those <hi>means,</hi> whereby the <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>remission</hi> of our sins is conveyed unto us; the <hi>means</hi> by which so great a benefit is estated on us. The principal <hi>agent</hi> in this work is <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God,</hi> of whom the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith expresly, <hi>That it is one God which shall justifie the circumcision by Faith, and the uncircumcision through Faith</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.</note>. In all which Texts, <hi>to justifie the Elect,</hi> the <hi>Iews,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> doth import no more, than <hi>freely to forgive</hi> them all the <hi>sins</hi> which they had committed against the <hi>Law,</hi> and to <hi>acquit them absolutely</hi> from all blame and punishment, due by the <hi>Law</hi> to such offences. Which appears plainly by that passage of the same <hi>Apostle,</hi> where speaking of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> as of him that <hi>justifieth the ungodly, Rom.</hi> 4.5. he sheweth immediately by way of <hi>gloss</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> in what that <hi>justifying</hi> doth consist, saying out of <hi>David, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered: Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 4.7, 8.</note>. And this God doth, not out of any <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added</hi> or <hi>acquired principle,</hi> which is not naturally in him; but out of that <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>supream power</hi> which is <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> to him: In which respect, no <hi>Creature</hi> can be said to <hi>forgive sins,</hi> no not our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> himself, in his meer <hi>humane nature</hi>; but must refer that work unto God alone: <hi>For who can</hi> (so) <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give sins, but God onely,</hi> said the <hi>Pharisees</hi> truly <note n="d" place="margin">Mark 2.7.</note>. And as God is the onely natural and <hi>efficient</hi> cause of this <hi>justification,</hi> the principal <hi>Agent</hi> in this great work of the <hi>remission of sins</hi>; so is the onely <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>internal impulsive</hi> cause which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines him to it, to be found onely in himself; that is to say, <hi>his infinite mercy,</hi> love, and graciousness, toward his poor creature, Man, whom he looks on as the miserable object of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>pitty,</hi> languishing under the guilt and condemnation of sin. Upon which <hi>Motives,</hi> and no other, he gave his onely begotten Son <hi>to die for our sins,</hi> to be a <hi>ransom and propitiation for the sins of the world</hi> 
                        <note n="e" place="margin">1 John 2.2.</note>: <hi>That whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but</hi> (through forgiveness in his Blood) <hi>have life everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">John 3.16.</note>. But for the <hi>external impulsive efficient cause</hi> of this act of Gods, the <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cause</hi> thereof, that indeed is no other than our Lord JESUS CHRIST; the <hi>death</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi> of our most blessed <hi>Lord and Saviour.</hi> For God behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Christ,</hi> as such, and so great a <hi>sufferer</hi> for the <hi>sins of men,</hi> is thereby moved and
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:59300:245"/>
induced to deliver those that <hi>believe in him,</hi> both from the <hi>burden</hi> of their <hi>sins,</hi> and that <hi>condemnation</hi> which legally and justly is due unto them. This testified most clearly by that holy Scripture, <hi>Be ye kinde</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>unto one another forgiving one another, even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you</hi> 
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Eph. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.32.</note>. Where plainly the <hi>impulsive</hi> cause inclining God to pardon us our sins and trespasses, is the respect he hath unto the <hi>sufferings</hi> of our <hi>Saviour Christ.</hi> Thus the Apostle tells us in another place, <hi>That we are freely justified by the grace of God, through the Redemption which is in CHRIST IESUS</hi> 
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 3.24.</note>. Justified freely by Gods grace, as by the <hi>internal impulsive</hi> cause of our <hi>Iustification,</hi> by which he is first moved to forgive us our sins; <hi>through the Redemption</hi> procured for us, by the death and sufferings of <hi>CHRIST IESUS,</hi> as the <hi>external moving</hi> or <hi>impulsive cause</hi> of so great a mercy.</p>
                     <p>In this respect, the <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>forgiveness</hi> of the sins of men, is frequently ascribed in Scripture to the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; as in the <hi>Institution</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> by the <hi>Lord</hi> himself, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you, and for many, for the remission of sins</hi> 
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Matth. 26.28.</note>. Thus the Apostle to the <hi>Romans, Whom</hi> (JESUS CHRIST) <hi>did God set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his Blood, to declare his righteousness, for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God</hi> 
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 3.25.</note>. And thus to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> also, <hi>In whom we have redemption through his Blood, the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace</hi> 
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Eph. 1.7.</note>. To this effect St. <hi>Peter</hi> also, <hi>For ye know that ye were not redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with corruptible things, as with silver and gold, but with the precious Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish, and without spot</hi> 
                        <note n="m" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18, 19.</note>. And so St. <hi>Iohn, The Blood of Iesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin</hi> 
                        <note n="n" place="margin">1 John 1.7.</note>; and, <hi>he hath washed us from our sins in his own Blood,</hi> in another place <note n="o" place="margin">Apoc. 1.5.</note>. Infinite other places might be here produced, in which the <hi>forgiveness</hi> of our sins is positively and expresly ascribed <hi>to the Blood of Christ,</hi> or to his death and sufferings for us, which comes all to one. But these will serve sufficiently to confirm this truth, that the main end for which <hi>Christ</hi> suffered such a shameful ignominious death, accompanied with so many scorns and torments, was thereby to <hi>attone</hi> or <hi>reconcile</hi> us to his <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> to make us capable of the <hi>remission of our sins, through the mercy of God</hi>; and to assure us by that means of the favor of God, and our <hi>adoption</hi> to the glories of eternal life. <hi>By that one offering of himself hath he for ever perfected all them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> 
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note>: <hi>Blotting out the hand-writing of Ordinances which was against us, and nailed it to his cross for ever</hi> 
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note>; to the end, that being mindful of <hi>the price where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we were bought,</hi> and of the enemies from whom we were delivered by him, <hi>We might glorifie God both in our bodies and our souls</hi> 
                        <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20.</note>, <hi>and serve the Lord in righteousness and holiness, all the days of our lives. For if the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the ashes of an Heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctified to the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the flesh,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Ordinances: <hi>How much more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God</hi> 
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 9.13, 14.</note>, in the time of the Gospel? This is the constant <hi>tenor</hi> of the Word of God, touching <hi>remission of our sins</hi> by the <hi>Blood of Christ.</hi> And unto this we might here adde the consonant suffrages and consent of the antient Fathers; If the addition of their Testimonies, where the authority of the Scripture is so clear and evident, might not be thought a thing unnecessary. Suffice it that all of them, from the first to the last, ascribe the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of our sins</hi> to the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> as to the <hi>meritorious</hi> cause thereof; though unto God the Father, as the <hi>principal Agent,</hi> who challengeth to himself the power of <hi>forgiving sins,</hi> as his own peculiar and prerogative, <hi>Isai.</hi> 43.25.

                     <p>Now as the state of man is twofold in regard of sin, so is the <hi>Ministery</hi> of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> twofold also in regard of man.

                        <note n="p" place="margin">Mark 7.3, 4.</note>, <hi>That they eat not, except they wash their hands oft</hi>; that they <hi>washed as often as they came from market,</hi> or any publick place of meeting; and that they did observe upon old <hi>Tradition, the washing of Cups, and Pots, of brazen Vessels, and of Tables.</hi> And this they did not onely in the way of <hi>cleanliness,</hi> or in point of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to wash away the filth of their bodies when they went to eat, or to make clean their Vessels, and other <hi>Vtensiles,</hi> which they ate or drank in: But rather out of an opinion, that by those <hi>frequent washings</hi> they preserved themselves from the filth and <hi>corruption of the world</hi>; especially in their return from the <hi>streets</hi> and <hi>market places</hi> 
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Mark 7.4.</note>, where possibly they might meet with some that were <hi>uncircumcised,</hi> or otherwise obnoxious to an ill report, by which they thought themselves defiled. And this I take to be an antient custom of the <hi>Iews,</hi> because I finde it much in use amongst the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who were in many, if not most, of their common <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> but the <hi>Apes</hi> onely of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Who on the same opinion of their own dear sanctity, which had so perfectly possessed their neighbors of <hi>Iudah,</hi> did use when they had visited any of the <hi>Nations,</hi> to sprinkle themselves with <hi>urine</hi> upon their return; and if by negligence or necessity of business they had touched any, not of their own Sect, to drench themselves over-head and ears in the next Fountain <note n="r" place="margin">

not God in the way of a present remedy, conferred that blessing upon <hi>Iordan,</hi> which was not to be found in those other Rivers. It was Gods blessing, not the <hi>water,</hi> which produced that Miracle, to which all other <hi>waters</hi> might have been as serviceable, if God had said the word, and disposed so of them.

For as the <hi>Spirit of God moving upon the waters</hi> of the great <hi>Abyss,</hi> did out of that imperfect matter produce the world; so the same <hi>Spirit moving</hi> on the waters of <hi>Baptism,</hi> doth by its mighty power produce a <hi>regenerate</hi> Creature.

                        <note n="q" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note>; And in St. <hi>Paul, accrrding to his mercy hath he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost</hi>

                     <p>For proof whereof, besides what hath been said of this Point already, let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>practise</hi> of the Primitive times, when the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church was grown so severe, that some were hardly admitted at all unto <hi>publick Penance,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers removed from the <hi>communion</hi> of the Church, for three, four, or seven years together, and sometimes (as the quality of the sin appeared) for the whole time of their lives. A <hi>Discipline</hi> which the Church used onely towards those which had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up their names in <hi>baptism,</hi> to be <hi>visible</hi> members of that body whereof <hi>Christ</hi> was Head; and that made more unpleasing to most sort of men upon the growth and spreading of the <hi>Novatian Heresie,</hi> who mistaking the <hi>Apostles</hi> meaning, declared all those to be uncapable of mercy, who <hi>sinned after Baptism,</hi> and therefore neither would admit them unto <hi>publick penance,</hi> nor otherwise restore them to the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches peace,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> thus complaineth, <hi>Sic obstinatos esse quosdam ut dandam non putent lapsis poenitentiam</hi>

In the beginning of this third <hi>Century,</hi> or the end of the second, did <hi>Tertullian</hi> write his Book of <hi>Baptism</hi>; in which, though he seem to <hi>disallow</hi> of <hi>Baptizing Infants,</hi> in regard of the danger which may arise unto the <hi>Sureties,</hi> (<hi>Quid enim necesse est sponsores etiam periculo ingeri</hi>

And I hope no man will conceive, who rightly understands what <hi>Tertullian</hi> was, that his dislike or disallowance, is to be put in ballance with a <hi>Catholick</hi> custom, retained for so many ages in the Church of <hi>Christ</hi>; or if it were, not onely children must be barred from the favor of <hi>Baptism,</hi> but all <hi>unmarried per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> whether <hi>Maids</hi> or <hi>Widows, Batchelors</hi> or <hi>Widowers,</hi> (for them he would have put off too in the self-same Chapter,) unless they can give good assurance of their future <hi>continuance.</hi> But before him, about the middle of this second <hi>Century</hi> flourished <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> one who conversed with <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> and others of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples; and he seems very clear also for <hi>Infant-Baptism, Christus venit omnes per seipsum salvare, omnes inquam qui per ipsum renascuntur in Deum, Infantes, &amp; parvulos, &amp; pueros</hi> 
                        <note n="y" place="margin">
                           <hi>Irenaeus</hi> adv. haeres. l. 2. 39.</note>. <hi>Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>came into the world to save all by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; even all, which by him are born again unto God, whether they be Infants, Boyes, or Youths.</hi> Upon which words the <hi>Glosser</hi> makes this observation, <hi>Nomine renascentiae Dominica &amp; Apostolica phrasi Baptismum intelligi</hi>; that is to say, that under the name of <hi>new-birth,</hi> or of being <hi>born again unto God,</hi> both our <hi>Redeemer, Iohn</hi> 3.5. and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 3.5. understand the <hi>Sacrament of Baptism.</hi> Which note, by whomsoever made, is not alone agreeable unto <hi>holy Writ,</hi> but to the meaning and acception of most <hi>Catholick Doctors,</hi> as might be made apparent, had I place and time. And so far we are able to go in a <hi>direct line</hi> towards the very time of the <hi>Lords Apostles</hi>; and doubt not but we could have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued it higher, had the writings of those few Worthies which went before, come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted to our hands.

                     <p>But here two Questions will arise, which require an Answer. For being that Faith in <hi>Christ</hi> hath been always reckoned for a <hi>necessary condition</hi> in them that come to be <hi>baptized</hi>; what Faith can possibly be expected at the hands of <hi>Infants?</hi> And secondly, If <hi>Baptism</hi> be so necessary, as it seems to be by most of the authorities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore produced, for purging us from the corruption of <hi>original</hi> and <hi>actual sins,</hi> what is to be conceived of them who die unbaptized?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="453" facs="tcp:59300:249"/>First, For the <hi>Faith</hi> which is by some supposed to be in <hi>Infants</hi> born of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Parents,</hi> I can by no means yeeld unto it. For <hi>actual Faith</hi> they can have none, in regard they are not able to distinguish between good and evil; and though the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> are sown in them by <hi>Baptism,</hi> or that thereby they are prepared to receive an <hi>habit of Faith,</hi> which may be afterwards acquired by them, or infused into them; yet that they do bring with them an <hi>Habitual Faith,</hi> I can by no means understand. How then were children justified? by <hi>what faith baptized?</hi> I answer, <hi>By the faith of others.</hi> The faith of those who do present them unto <hi>Baptism,</hi> and of the <hi>Church</hi> which doth admit them, and finally of their <hi>Christian Parents,</hi> with whom the <hi>Covenant</hi> was made for themselves and theirs. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> is express for this, in more places than one. <hi>Sicut eos renasci per ministerium baptizantium, ita eos credere per corda &amp; ora confitentium</hi>

And though St. <hi>Bernard</hi> be a <hi>Postnatus,</hi> one of later date, yet, in my minde, he gives a very special reason why it should be so; why God should graciously accept the <hi>faith of others</hi> for those tender <hi>Infants,</hi> who have none of their own. <hi>Nec enim omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentis justitia propriam ab his putat exigendam fidem, quos novit nullam propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am habere culpam</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>For the next point, though we maintain the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> as the ordinary outward means to attain salvation; and do correct those <hi>Ministers</hi> by the <hi>Churches censures,</hi> by whose gross <hi>negligence</hi> or <hi>default</hi> (if required to do it) an <hi>Infant</hi> shall die <hi>unbaptized</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Can. 69. of the year 1603.</note>, Yet we conceive it not so <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> in the way to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> but it is possible for a man to be saved without it. For <hi>antiquity</hi> supplied in some, the want of water, by blood, which many times was the case of <hi>Martyrs</hi>; in others, the inevitable want of <hi>Baptism,</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the earnestness of the desire, if it might have been had, supplying the defect of the <hi>outward Ceremony.</hi> Hence came the old distinction of <hi>Baptismus fluminis, Baptismus flaminis,</hi> and <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismus sanguinis.</hi> Concerning which, the <hi>Fathers</hi> teach us this in brief <note n="g" place="margin">
                           <hi>Field.</hi> of the Church. l. 3. c. 21.</note>, That where men are debarred by an <hi>evitable impossibility</hi> from the outward <hi>Sacrament, Faith</hi> and the inward conversion of the heart, flying unto God in <hi>IESUS CHRIST,</hi> through the sweet motion and gracious instinct of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a kinde of <hi>Baptism,</hi> because thereby they obtain all that, which they so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sought after in the <hi>Sacrament of Baptism,</hi> if they could have been partakers of it. And if it be so, that an <hi>ordinary degree</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> do sometime obtain salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Water</hi>; much more may that which makes men willing to suffer death for <hi>Christs</hi> and the <hi>Gospels</hi> sake, and be <hi>baptized,</hi> as it were, in their dearest blood. It was not simply the <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> but the <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> thereof, which antiently in the <hi>Adulti,</hi> men of riper years, was accounted <hi>damnable.</hi> But
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:59300:250"/>
what may then be said in the case of <hi>Infants,</hi> in whom are no such strong desires, no such sanctified motions? Shall we adjudge them with St. <hi>Augustine</hi> to eternal fire, (as some say he did) who thereby worthily got the name of <hi>Infanto-mastyx,</hi> or the scourge of Infants, as he had gloriously gained the title of <hi>Malleus Pelagianorum,</hi> The Maul or Hammer of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereticks? No: God forbid, that we should so restrain his most infinite mercies unto outward means. Or shall we feign a <hi>third place</hi> for them, near the skirts of Hell, as our good Masters do in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> We have as little ground for that in the holy Scripture: Rather than so, we may resolve, and I think with safety, that as the Faith of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of those <hi>which do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> such as are <hi>baptized,</hi> is by God accepted for <hi>their own</hi>; so the desire and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness of the same <hi>Church,</hi> and of their <hi>God-fathers,</hi> and <hi>Parents,</hi> where <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> cannot possibly be had, is reputed theirs also. Or if not so, yet we refer them <hi>full of hope</hi> to the grace of God, in whose most rigorous constitutions and sharpest denunciations, deepest mercies are hid; and who is still the <hi>Father of mercies,</hi> though the God of justice. And so I shut up this discourse with these words of <hi>Hooker</hi> 
                        <note n="h" place="margin">
                           <hi>Hooker</hi> Eccl. Polit. l. 5.</note>, <hi>That for the Will of God to impart his grace to Infants without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, the very circumstance of their natural birth, may serve in that case for a just Argument; whereupon it is not to be misliked, that men in a charitable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption do gather a great likelihood of their salvation, to whom the benefit of Christian parentage being given, the rest that should follow is prevented by some such casualty, as man hath no power himself to avoid.</hi> So he, of those which are descended of a <hi>Christian stock.</hi> What may be thought of children born of <hi>unbelievers,</hi> hath been said elswhere: And so much of the first <hi>ordinary</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means ordained by <hi>Christ</hi> for the <hi>remission of our sins,</hi> the <hi>holy Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptism.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Proceed we next unto the other, which is the <hi>power of the Keys</hi> committed in the person of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and those which by the <hi>Churches</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are authorized and appointed to it: That miserable man being wrought upon unto <hi>repentance,</hi> by the power and preaching of the Word, may on <hi>confession</hi> of his sins be <hi>forgiven</hi> of God, or have the benefit of <hi>absolution</hi> from the hands of his <hi>Ministers,</hi> if their spiritual necessities do so require. For certainly there is not a more ready way to <hi>forgiveness of sins,</hi> than by sincere and sound <hi>repentance</hi>; nor any speedier means to beget <hi>repentance,</hi> than to present our sins unto us in their own deformity, by the most righteous <hi>myrror</hi> of the Word of God. For when the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> comes to know by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the heinousness of his misdeeds, the <hi>wrath</hi> which God conceives against him for his gross offences, together with the <hi>punishment</hi> which is due unto them according to his rigorous judgments: The thought thereof must needs affect him both with fear and horror, and make him truly sensible of his desperate state. To whom then shall he flie for succor, but to God alone, humbly <hi>confessing</hi> unto him both his <hi>sins</hi> and <hi>sorrows?</hi> How can he look to be recovered of the biting of these <hi>fiery Serpents,</hi> but by looking with the eye of <hi>faith</hi> on that <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> which was exalted on the <hi>Cross</hi> for his <hi>Redemption?</hi> Or if he finde his <hi>Conscience</hi> troubled, and his minde afflicted, and that he hath not <hi>confidence</hi> enough to draw near to God; then let him go unto the <hi>Priest,</hi> whom God hath made to be the <hi>Iudge between the unclean and the clean</hi> 
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Levit. 10.10.</note>, whom God hath authorized to minister <hi>the word of comfort,</hi> to raise up them that be faln, and support the weak, <hi>to give light to them that sit in darkness,</hi> and in the shadow of death, and <hi>to guide their feet in the way of peace.</hi> This is the <hi>Method</hi> to be used, the course to be pursued by those who do desire to profit in the <hi>School of repentance.</hi> And about this, as to the main and substance of it, there is but little difference amongst knowing men. For that <hi>Repentance</hi> is a necessary means required for the <hi>remission of sins,</hi> committed after <hi>Baptism,</hi> the <hi>Antients</hi> and the <hi>Moderns</hi> do agree in one. The <hi>Fathers</hi> used to call it <hi>secundam tabulam post naufragium,</hi> the <hi>second Table</hi> after Spiritual shipwrack; on which, all those who had made <hi>shipwrack of the Faith and a good conscience</hi> used to lay hold (after they had foregone the benefit received in <hi>Baptism</hi>) to keep them up from sinking in the depth of <hi>despair,</hi> from being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in the bottomless Ocean of sin and judgment.

                     </p>
                     <p>But the main matter in dispute, (for we will not trouble our selves further about this particular) is, Touching the <hi>confession of our sins to men,</hi> and the authority of <hi>Sacerdotal Absolution:</hi> In the first of which we differ from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and in the other, from the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Puritan faction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, For <hi>confession</hi> to be made to the <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Minister,</hi> it is agreeable both to the doctrine and intent of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> though not so much in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise as it ought to be. For in an <hi>Exhortation</hi> before the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lords
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59300:251"/>
Supper,</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> as <hi>Minister</hi> is required to say unto the <hi>People</hi> 
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Second Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note>, <hi>That if there be any of them which otherwise cannot quiet his own conscience by the means afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, but requireth further comfort or counsel, then let him come to me</hi> (the Parish Minister) <hi>or some other discreet and learned Minister of Gods Word, and open his grief, that he may receive such ghostly counsel, advice, and comfort, as his conscience may be relieved; and that by the ministery of Gods Word he may receive comfort, and the benefit of absolution, to the quieting of his conscience, and the avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness.</hi> So also in the form of <hi>Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sick,</hi> the infirm person is required to make a <hi>special confession</hi> (to the Minister) <hi>if he feel his conscience troubled with any weighty matter</hi>; after which <hi>confession,</hi> the Priest <hi>shall absolve him in this sort</hi> 
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Form of visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the sick.</note>. But because men might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to make such <hi>confession,</hi> for fear their <hi>secret sins</hi> should be brought to light, both to their danger and disgrace; in case some <hi>obligation</hi> lay not on the Priest or Minister, for his concealing of the same; the <hi>Church</hi> hath taken order for their secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For in her <hi>Ecclesiastical Constitutions</hi> she hath thus ordained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>That if any man confess his secret and hidden sins to the Minister, for the unburthening of his conscience, and to receive spiritual consolation, and ease of minde from him; the said Minister shall not at any time reveal and make known, to any person what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, any crime or offence so committed to his trust and secresie</hi> (except they be such <hi>crimes</hi> as by the Laws of this Land, his own life may be called into question for concealing the same) <hi>under pain of irregularity</hi> 
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Canon 113. of the year 1603.</note>. And <hi>poena irregularitatis,</hi> as the <hi>Canonists</hi> tell us, not onely doth deprive a man of all his <hi>spiritual promotions</hi> for the present time, but makes him utterly uncapable of any for the time to come; and therefore is the greatest penalty, except <hi>degradation</hi> from his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> which possibly a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> can be subject to. And finally, because good Laws are nothing worth, unless some care be taken for their <hi>execution,</hi> it was made one of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries in the <hi>Book of Articles</hi> established in the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the year 1640. for a perpetual rule and standard in all <hi>Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Archidiaconal Visitations</hi> 
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Canon 9. of the year 1640.</note>, and proposed thus to the <hi>Church-wardens,</hi> viz. <hi>Have you ever heard that your said Priest or Minister hath revealed and made known at any time to any person whatsoever, any crime or offence committed to his trust and secresie, either in extremity of sickness, or in any other case whatsoever</hi> (except they be such <hi>crimes</hi> as by the Laws of this Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>declare the name of the Offender, when and by whom you heard the same</hi> 
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Article of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit. c. 2. n. 25.</note>. In which we see, this <hi>Church</hi> allows of <hi>one Key</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to unlock <hi>Confession,</hi> and that the <hi>Gallican Church</hi> doth allow of also. For in the <hi>Re-admission</hi> of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> into the University of <hi>Paris,</hi> it was especially condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and provided for, amongst other things, <hi>That if they heard of any attempt or conspiracy against the King, or his Realm, or any matter of treason in Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they</hi> (and all other Clergy-men on the like occasions) <hi>should reveal the same unto the Magistrate</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Contin of the Fr. hist. p. 30.</note>. But to proceed, As is the purpose of the <hi>Church,</hi> such also is the judgment of those learned men which are most eminent therein, both for parts and piety, especially for their aversness from all <hi>Popish</hi> fancies.</p>
                     <p>First, Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> thus for one, <hi>Abuses and errors being removed, and specially the Priest being learned, we mislike no manner of Confession, whether it be private or publick. For as we think it not unlawful to make open Confession before many, so we think it not unlawful (abuses always excepted) to make the like confession in private, either before a few, or before one alone</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Defence of the Apol. part. 2. c. 7. sect 2..</note>. The like saith Bishop <hi>Morton</hi> in his <hi>Appeal, It is not questioned between us whether it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for a man burdened with sin, to lay open his conscience in private unto the Minister of God, and to seek at his hands, both counsel of instruction, and the comfort of Gods pardon: But whether there be, as from Christs institution, such an absolute necessity of this private confession, both for all sorts of men, and every Ordinance and particular sin, so as without it there is no pardon and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to be hoped for from God</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>What then? Is there no difference in this point between <hi>Rome</hi> and us? Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, <hi>much every way,</hi> especially as to the necessity, and particularity: For those of <hi>Rome</hi> impose an <hi>absolute necessity</hi> of this Sacramental Confession, as they call it, and that <hi>De jure divino,</hi> by vertue of some positive, and direct command even from <hi>Christ</hi> himself; and that too of <hi>all sins,</hi> and with all the circumstances, which is a tyranny and torture to the souls of men. <hi>But the Protestants</hi> (saith Bishop <hi>Morton</hi>) <hi>acknowledge the use of it with these two restrictions: The first, That it be free in regard of Conscience; the second, That it be possible in regard of performance</hi>

being ingenuously confessed by <hi>Michael de Palacios,</hi> a <hi>Spanish</hi> Writer, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all their pains, to found it on <hi>some Text of Scripture,</hi> they are so far from being agreed amongst themselves <note n="s" place="margin">
                           <hi>Palacios</hi> in Sent. l. 4. dist. 17.</note>, that it is much to be admired, <hi>Quanta sit de hac re concertatio,</hi> What contention there is raised about it, and how badly they agree with one another. And if they have no better ground for the <hi>main foundation,</hi> how little hopes may we conceive of finding any good in their <hi>superstructures?</hi> And yet upon no better grounds do they exact a most unreasonable <hi>particularity</hi> of all mens affairs, to be delivered to them in <hi>confession</hi>; requiring of all persons, being of age, a private and distinct <hi>confession</hi> of all and every known <hi>mortal sin,</hi> open and secret, of outward deed, and inward consent, together with all <hi>circumstances</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though <hi>obscene</hi> and <hi>odrous,</hi> not fit to be communicated to a modest ear; and that too once a year, at least, if they do not oftner. For this we need not go much further than the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where we shall finde, <hi>Oportere à poenitentibus omnia peccata mortalia, quorum post diligentem sui discussionem conscientiam habent, in confessione recenseri, etiamsi occultissima sunt, &amp; tantum adversus duo ultima Decalogi mandata</hi> (remember that they divide the last Commandment into two) <hi>commissa, &amp;c</hi> 
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Concil. Trid. Sess. 4. cap 5. ca. 4, 7.</note>. Which how impossible it is to do, should one go about it, what an <hi>intanglement</hi> it may prove unto the conscience of a penitent sinner, and what a <hi>temptation</hi> also to the Priest himself, to be acquainted with particulars so <hi>unchast</hi> and <hi>lustful,</hi> I leave to any sober Christian to determine of, who shall finde more hereof in <hi>Alvares Pelagius de Planctu Ecclesiae, L.</hi> 2. <hi>Art.</hi> 2, 3, 27, 73, 83. and <hi>Agrippa de Vanitate Scientiarum, cap.</hi> 64. Writers of their own, than I think fitting at this time they should hear from me, who do not love to rake in such filthy puddles. So then, the business of <hi>Confession</hi> doth stand thus between us, That we conceive it to be <hi>free,</hi> whereas those of <hi>Rome</hi> will have it <hi>obligatory</hi>; we, that it is <hi>Iuris positivi</hi> onely, but they <hi>Iuris divini</hi>; we, that it is a matter of conveniency, and they of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity. And then for the performance of it, they do exact a punctual enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of all sins, both of <hi>commission</hi> and <hi>omission,</hi> together with all the <hi>accidents</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi> thereunto belonging; which we conceive in all cases to be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in some not expedient, and in no case at all required by the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>Now as we disagree with those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the nature and necessity of <hi>private confession,</hi> so have we no less differences with the Grandees of the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction, about the efficacy and power of <hi>Sacerdotal Absolution,</hi> which they which speak most largely of it, make <hi>declarative</hi> onely, others not so much; whereas the Church hath taught us, that it is <hi>authoritative</hi> and <hi>judicial</hi> too. Authoritative, not by a proper, natural, and original power, for so the <hi>absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> of a sinner appertains unto God alone; but by a delegated and <hi>derived power,</hi> communicated to the Priest in that clause of their Commission, <hi>Whose sins soever ye remit, they are remitted; and whose sins soever ye retain, they are retained, Iohn</hi> 20.23. Which proves the Priest to have a <hi>power of remitting sins,</hi> and that in as express and ample manner, as he can receive it. But though it be a <hi>delegated, Ministerial power,</hi> yet doth not the descent thereof from <hi>Almighty God,</hi> prove it to be the less <hi>judicial</hi>: Then Judges, and other Ministers of Justice sitting on the Bench, may be said to exercise a <hi>judicial power</hi> on the lives and fortunes of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>; because they do it by vertue of the Kings Commission, not out of any <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power</hi> which they can chalenge to themselves in their several circuits. Now that the <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are vested with as much power in <hi>forgiving sins,</hi> as Christ committed to his Church, and the Church to them, the formal words, <hi>Whose sins soever ye remit, they are remitted, &amp;c.</hi> which are still used in <hi>Ordinations,</hi> do expresly signifie. Which though some of the Grandees of the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction have pleased to call <hi>Papisticum ritum,</hi> an old <hi>Popish ceremony</hi> 
                        <note n="u" place="margin">

And for the <hi>exercise</hi> of this power, we have this form thereof laid down in the <hi>Publick Liturgy</hi>; where, on the hearing of the sick mans <hi>confession,</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> is to <hi>absolve</hi> him with these formal words <note n="x" place="margin">In the Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sick.</note>,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:59300:252"/>
                        <hi>viz. Our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath left power unto his Church to absolve all sinners, which truly repent and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine offences: And by his authority committed unto me, I absolve thee from all thy sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.</hi> In which we finde, that the <hi>Sacerdotal power</hi> of <hi>forgiving sins,</hi> is a derived or delegated <hi>Ministerial power,</hi> a power committed to his <hi>Ministers</hi> by our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi>; but that it is <hi>Iudicial</hi> also, not <hi>Declarative</hi> onely. It is not said, <hi>That I do signifie or declare, that thou art absolved,</hi> which any man may do as well as the Priest himself; <hi>but I do actually absolve thee of all thy sins,</hi> which no mortal man can but he. In this the <hi>Priest</hi> hath the preheminence of the greatest Potentate. And in this sense it is, that St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>Deus ipse subjecit ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Imperatoris manui Sacerdotis</hi>

To which effect, it is affirmed by others of the Antient Writers, but in clearer words, <hi>That the judgment of man goeth before the judgment of God.</hi> The Priest is then a <hi>Iudge</hi> to pronounce the sentence, and not a <hi>Cryer</hi> onely (as some say) to proclaim what the Judge pronounceth; and as a Judge doth actually <hi>absolve</hi> or condemn the sinner, by the same power of <hi>pardoning</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> sins which he had from <hi>Christ,</hi> or which <hi>Christ</hi> executes by him as his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deputy. For as Kings are said to minister Justice to their Subjects, though they do it not in their own persons, but by a power devolved on subordinate Officers; and as <hi>Christ</hi> himself may properly be said to have <hi>fed the multitudes,</hi> though he gave the loaves onely unto his <hi>Disciples,</hi> and <hi>his Disciples to the multitudes</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>First, for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it was a thing much quarrelled and opposed amongst them, that <hi>Christ</hi> himself should be affirmed to have <hi>risen again</hi>; insomuch, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was counted <hi>mad</hi> by <hi>Festus</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 26.24.</note>, and but a <hi>babler</hi> at the best by the great wits of <hi>Athens</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 17.18.</note>, for venturing to Preach before them of <hi>IESUS and the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>

i.e. of <hi>Iesus and his resurrection,</hi> for of that onely he did speak, when they so judged of him; but of this quarrel they grew soon weary, and so gave it off. For being it was a <hi>matter of fact,</hi> confirmed at the first by so many witnesses who had seen him and converted with him after his raising from the dead, and thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Church with such unanimity, that the faithful rather chose to lay down their lives than to alter their <hi>Beleef</hi> in that particular, the world became the sooner satisfied in the truth thereof. But for the <hi>Resurrection of the dead</hi> which was grounded on it, and that his <hi>Resurrection</hi> was of so great <hi>efficacy,</hi> as that by vertue of it all the dead should rise, which had deceased from the beginning of the world to the end thereof, that they accounted such a monstrous and ridiculous <hi>paradox,</hi> as could not find admittance amongst men of reason.

But that from this particular instance (supposing it for true, as it might be possibly) they should infer a general Doctrine, that <hi>all the dead</hi> should rise again at the Day of Judgement, this would not sink into their heads, unless it might be made apparent, as they thought it could not, that any of that <hi>sect</hi> had been raised again, to confirm all the rest in that opinion.

                     <p>Leaving these therefore for a while, and keeping those who did assume the name of <hi>Christians,</hi> and yet denied this Article of the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> unto the close of this discourse; Let us for our parts rest our selves on the Word of God, and see what <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, what <hi>CHRIST</hi> and his Apostles have delivered to us in <hi>affirmation</hi> of this Doctrine. For <hi>Moses</hi> first, it is the general opinion of most learned men, that he was the Author of the Book of <hi>Iob</hi> 
                        <note n="h" place="margin">V. <hi>Bellar.</hi> de Script.

And this is further to be noted in this Text of Scripture, that we no sooner hear of a <hi>Creator</hi> in <hi>Moses,</hi> than of a <hi>Redeemer</hi> in <hi>Iob</hi>; no sooner of the death of mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> but of their restoring to life in <hi>Christ.</hi> And more than so, that though <hi>Moses</hi> who wrot this was a <hi>Iew,</hi> yet <hi>Iob</hi> who spake it was a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> (not of the seed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> though perhaps of <hi>Abrahams</hi>) to shew, that both the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> (as well the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi>) were to have their share in the <hi>resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and therefore in due time to expect their own. I know that the <hi>Socinians, Anabaptists,</hi> and some other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> who are no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good friends to the <hi>resurrection,</hi> do otherwise interpret these words of <hi>Iob,</hi> and will not have them meant of his <hi>resurrection,</hi> but of his <hi>restitution</hi> to his former glories. But for my part I must profess, that if the <hi>Greek Catena,</hi> and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Latine Fathers,</hi> and the consent of all the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and learned Writers of these times, were to be laid aside as <hi>incompetent Iudges</hi>; I am not able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any thing from the Text or Context, that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> intended them any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to set forth <hi>Iobs</hi> constant faith in the <hi>resurrection,</hi> the knowledge that he had of his <hi>Redemption</hi> from the jaws of death.</p>

I know indeed this <hi>Psalm</hi> doth bear the Title of the <hi>Prayer of Moses,</hi> but whether made by him, or by <hi>David,</hi> or some other in his name, is not yet resolved: It is sufficient to this purpose that it passeth amongst <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms, as a distinct and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate body from the works of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On forwards to <hi>Isaiah,</hi> the Evangelical Prophet, who seems to look on <hi>Christ</hi> as if gone before him, <hi>Thy dead men</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise: Awake and sing yee that dwel in dust, for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead</hi> 
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Isa. 26.19.</note>. And parallel to this in another place, <hi>When yee be old your heart shall rejoyce, and your bones shall flourish like herbs; and then the hand of the Lord shall be known towards his Servants, and his indignation towards his Enemies</hi>

This habitude or connexion between <hi>Christ</hi> and us, will help us to another Argument to confirm this Doctrine. For if we be the members of the body of <hi>Christ,</hi> we must be <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified</hi>
                        <pb n="465" facs="tcp:59300:255"/>

                        <note n="g" place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note>, saith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And certainly we may conclude, That if we be <hi>crucified with Christ,</hi> we shall <hi>rise with Christ</hi>; if we do <hi>suffer with him,</hi> we shall also <hi>reign with him</hi> 
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note>, and be <hi>glorified with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is another <hi>rational way</hi> of Argumentation used by the <hi>Apostle</hi>; the sum whereof in brief is this, That if there were no <hi>Resurrection of the Body,</hi> whereby we might receive the comfort of those good acts which we have <hi>done in our flesh</hi>; then should we have but <hi>small encouragement</hi> in the works of piety, especially to hazard our estates, nay, our very lives in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and defence of the <hi>Holy Gospel. Why stand we then</hi> (saith he) <hi>in jeopardy all the day long</hi> 
                        <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.30.</note>? And <hi>why have I my self encountred Beasts at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>after the manner of men</hi> 
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Ibid v. 31, 32.</note>, or suffered in my flesh that full variety of torments, that I may justly say of my self, <hi>that I die daily?</hi> And not so onely, but certainly we rob our selves of too much pleasure by the <hi>severity</hi> of our Religion, and foolishly deny to our lives those comforts, which make life valued for a blessing. For to what purpose should we weary out our souls with fasting, and our skins with sack-cloath; or to what purpose do we make our knees even hard and callous, by kneeling in his <hi>holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>; were there no <hi>Resurrection of the Body,</hi> or no <hi>life to come? If in this life onely we have hope in Christ, we were of all men the most miserable</hi> 
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Ibid. v. 19.</note>. Rather than so, let us give way to our desires, and <hi>eat and drink,</hi> enjoy the pleasures of the world, whiles they are before us; for ought we know, we may <hi>die to morrow</hi> 
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Ibid. v. 32.</note>, and with that death to morrow there is an end of all things. Thus might a man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for a <hi>Resurrection</hi> in behalf of himself, and he may reason for it also on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of God, whose justice cannot be declared in the sight <hi>of men,</hi> if there were no <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the flesh to express it by. To this end, we are told by the same Apostle, <hi>That we shall all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every man may receive according to that which he hath done in his body, whether good or evil</hi> 
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 10.10.</note>. The strength and efficacy of which Argument, as is elswhere noted, is briefly this. The <hi>Bodies</hi> of us men, being the servants of the soul to <hi>righteousness,</hi> or else the instruments to <hi>sin,</hi> in justice ought to be partakers of that weal, or wo, which is adjudged unto the <hi>soul</hi>; and therefore to be raised at the day of judgment; that as they sinned together, or served God together, so they may share together of reward or punishment. Which Argument, as it strongly proves the <hi>Resurrection of the Body,</hi> so it as strongly doth conclude for a <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>same Body,</hi> the same <hi>numerical body</hi> which before we had, not of a <hi>new created body,</hi> as some idly dream. For certainly it were no <hi>justice</hi> in <hi>Almighty God,</hi> if <hi>one flesh</hi> should fast and pray, and kneel, and watch, and weary out it self in the service of God, and <hi>another flesh</hi> reap that which it never labored for. No comfort to the <hi>poor body</hi> at all, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge it self of so much pleasure, and be exposed to so much danger and affliction, and <hi>another strange body</hi> shall step up, and receive the reward. <hi>Iobs</hi> confidence was, That he should see God with <hi>the same eyes,</hi> and none other for them <note n="o" place="margin">Job 19.27.</note>. If they restrained themselves, as it were by <hi>Covenant</hi> with the Lord, from straying after objects of lust, <hi>and not intice him to a maid,</hi> as he saith he did <note n="p" place="margin">Id. 31.1.</note>; It is but justice, that they the <hi>same eyes,</hi> and none other, should be rewarded with the view of a better object. If they have been <hi>poured out like water</hi> 
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Id. 16.20.</note>, and dropped many a tear in the sight of God; Reason and Justice both will agree to this, That the <hi>tears</hi> should be wiped from <hi>those eyes,</hi> not from a pair of <hi>new ones</hi> which did never shed any. And unto this St. <hi>Paul</hi> comes home, not speaking of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of a <hi>Body</hi> in general, but of <hi>this body</hi> in particular. It is <hi>these eyes</hi> of <hi>Iob,</hi> none other, which shall see the Lord; and <hi>hoc corruptibile</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                        <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.53.</note>, this corruptible, and none other, which must then <hi>put on corruption.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus far we have gone upon <hi>positive</hi> proofs, and sought them also in the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> onely. Another kinde of evidence may be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which for distinctions sake, shall be called <hi>Practical</hi>; common alike to <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> both to <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians.</hi> Of this sort was the <hi>solemn form</hi> of <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> the charges they were at in <hi>Spices</hi> and sweet <hi>Ointments</hi> to embalm the <hi>Bodies</hi> of their dead; and the command given both by <hi>Ioseph</hi> and

                        <note n="z" place="margin">Mark 14.8.</note>. And to this purpose the good women mentioned by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> prepared their <hi>ointments and sweet odors</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 23.56.</note>, intending therewithal to embalm his Body, but were therein prevented by his Resurrection <note n="b" place="margin">Id. 24.1, 2, 3.</note>. Which as it proves sufficiently what the custom was, so our <hi>Redeemers</hi> Resurrection which so soon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>anointing</hi> made by <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> shews plainly to what end it pointed. The care they took about them in their <hi>funeral rites,</hi> is evidence sufficient, if there were none else, <hi>That they commit the bodies of the dead unto the Earth, in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">In the form of Burial.</note>, according to the Language of the <hi>English Liturgy.</hi> Upon this very ground, no other, the <hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>Primitive times</hi> did use to spare no cost to <hi>embalm</hi> their dead, but were more prodigal of <hi>sweet odors,</hi> and most <hi>precious oyntments</hi> in the obsequies of the <hi>Saints departed,</hi> than the poverty of their estate could well admit of. <hi>Tertullian</hi> so affirms it, saying, <hi>Sciant Sabaei se pluris merces suas Christianis sepeliendis profligari, quam diis fumigandis</hi> 
                        <note n="d" place="margin">
                           <hi>Tert.</hi> Apol. c. 42.</note>. <hi>We spend,</hi> saith he, <hi>more Frankincense and</hi> Arabian <hi>Spices upon the burial of our dead, than would suffice to offer at the Altars of the Heathen gods.</hi> And on this ground it hath hitherto been the piety of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to lay the bodies of the dead into the Earth with all due solemnities; though now she stand accused for <hi>Superstition,</hi> even in this particular, in the conceit of some <hi>Novators,</hi> more precise than pious. Nay, if I understand aright the Apostles meaning, St. <hi>Paul</hi> derives a very strong Argument from this antient custome, to prove the <hi>Resurrection of the dead</hi> against all opposers. <hi>Else what do they,</hi> saith he, <hi>which are baptized for dead? if the dead rise not again, why are they then baptized for dead</hi> 
                        <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.29.</note>? That is to say, and the <hi>Greek</hi> Text will bear it well, why do they use such <hi>frequent washings</hi> over the bodies of the dead, why are the dead <hi>baptized,</hi> as a man may say, with rich <hi>balms</hi> and <hi>ointments,</hi> why are they laid into the Earth with such costly oyls; if there be no certainty of this, that even those bodies shall be raised to eternal glory?</p>
                     <p>I know it is an hard place I am faln upon: A place which hath as much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed the wits of our greatest <hi>Clerks,</hi> as any one in all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles. St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth expound this place of <hi>Baptism,</hi> applied unto some living man in the name and behalf of his friend dying without <hi>Baptism</hi>; out of a superstitious conceit, that <hi>Baptism</hi> so conferred upon one alive, in the name of him that was deceased, might be available to the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the other dying <hi>unbaptized</hi>

And on the same leg, as I take it, halts the gloss of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> (whom <hi>Theophylact</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth) affirming it to be the custom of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that when they were to be <hi>baptized,</hi> they said over the <hi>Creed,</hi> and that as they said the words of this <hi>Article,</hi> viz. <hi>The Resurrection of the Body,</hi> the Sacrament of <hi>Baptism</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them <note n="o" place="margin">

Finally, not to wander into more particulars, <hi>Lyra</hi> doth give this gloss upon it, <hi>Pro mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis,</hi> i. e. <hi>pro peccatis mortalibus quae sunt opera mortua.

For it is found by those who do trade in <hi>Chymistry,</hi> that the <hi>forms</hi> of things are kept invisibly in store, though the <hi>materials</hi> of the same be altered from what first they were; and that by vertue of those <hi>forms,</hi> the things themselves will be restored to their former being; which they make good by this experiment.

                     <p>And to say truth, there need but little more be added as to the <hi>Quod sit</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> to the point it self. That which remains relates unto the <hi>manner</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to some points of <hi>circumstance,</hi> and to such <hi>Christian</hi> uses as are raised hereon.</p>
                     <p>And first, Perhaps it may be demanded of us, as once of the Apostle in former times, <hi>Quali corpore venient,</hi> How, with what <hi>Bodies they shall rise</hi> 
                        <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.35.</note>? Not whether in the very same <hi>Numerical Body,</hi> for that hath been made good before, but whether in the same shape and fashion which before it had.

In which respect it hath been questioned by the <hi>Antients,</hi> whether they shall arise in the same age, and dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Age and Stature, which they had whilest they lived. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth resolve it <hi>Negatively,</hi> and determineth thus, That we shall all of us be raised in that proportion both of <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> which men attain to commonly at the time of their best perfection. <hi>Restat ergo</hi> (saith he) <hi>ut suam quisque habeat men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suram vel quam habuit in inventute, vel quam habiturus esset, si vixisset</hi>

                           <hi>August.</hi> de Civit. l. 22. c. 13.</note>. And this he groundeth on that passage to those of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where the Apostle speaks of that special care which CHRIST hath taken of his <hi>Church,</hi> and our <hi>edification, till we all come to a perfect man, unto the measure of the fulness of the</hi> (age or) <hi>stature of</hi> CHRIST <note n="m" place="margin">Ephes. 4.13.</note>, <hi>Ad mensuram plenitudinis aetatis Christi,</hi> that is to say, as he expounds it, <hi>Ad juvenilem formam,</hi> to that degree of age or stature which our <hi>Redeemer</hi> had attained to at the time of his passion, which was about the four and thirtieth year of his life, as may be gathered from the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>A second <hi>Quere</hi> hath been made concerning them which are <hi>diffigured</hi> and <hi>deformed,</hi> and <hi>mulcted</hi> as it were by nature, how, in what bodies they shall come in the <hi>Resurrection?</hi> Not with their <hi>imperfections,</hi> I conceive not so; for in the Heavens there shall be nothing not compleat and of full accomplishment. And on the other side, were they freed of those imperfections, it may be said that then they are not raised in the <hi>self-same</hi> bodies. To this we have the resolution of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> also, affirming, That in that glorious day, the <hi>substance</hi> of their bodies shall continue as before it was, but the <hi>deformities</hi> and <hi>imperfections</hi> shall be taken away.

                        </gap>hey either were some <hi>promises</hi> made by God to the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> concerning the coming and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Gospel</hi>; or else some words of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, which they interpreted that way; or finally, some passages in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which did directly seem to give countenance to it.</p>
                     <p>First, For the <hi>Promises</hi> made by God in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> however they may seem to favor those of that opinion; yet is it candidly acknowledged by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> (though he held the <hi>Tenet</hi>) That they were to be understood <hi>non de terrena sed coelesti promissione</hi>

                        <note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 19.29.</note>; that is to say, according to St. <hi>Marks</hi> expression, <hi>An hundred fold now in this life time, and in the world to come life everlasting</hi> 
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Mark 10.30.</note>. But that this is not to be understood in a <hi>literal sense,</hi> nor the accomplishment thereof to be made in that <hi>Golden King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> St. <hi>Ierom</hi> reasoneth very tartly, <hi>For then,</hi> saith he, <hi>it needs must follow,</hi> Ut qui unam uxorem pro domino dimiserit, centum recipiat in futuro <note n="q" place="margin">
                           <hi>Hierom.</hi> in Matth. 19.</note>, <hi>that he who doth forsake one wife for the love of Christ, should in that Kingdom of theirs receive an hundred:</hi> Which how absurd it were, he leaves them to judge. In the next place, they fasten upon that of <hi>Luke,</hi> in which our <hi>Saviour</hi> said unto his Apostles, <hi>That they should eat and drink at the same Table with him in his Kingdom</hi> 
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Luke 22.30.</note>. But neither these words must be taken <hi>literally,</hi> as they seem to sound, or if they be, they will be found directly contrary unto that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> assuring us, <hi>That the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost</hi> 
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Rom 14.17.</note>. The like may be replied to that other place, by them alleged to this purpose <note n="t" place="margin">

Which Answer, how it satisfied the <hi>Millenarians,</hi> I am not able to say; but I profess sincerely, it doth not satisfie me: Nor have I met with any <hi>Exposition</hi> of this difficult place, which doth not leave it as perplexed as before it was. And yet I am not of the minde, that it can possibly be alleged in favor of the <hi>Millenarians,</hi> because it is <hi>in Regno Patris mei,</hi> in my <hi>Fathers Kingdom,</hi> which generally is used in <hi>Scripture</hi> for the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven</hi>; and not <hi>in Regno meo,</hi> my <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> as in that of <hi>Luke:</hi> Though that of <hi>Luke</hi> be but a <hi>metaphorical</hi> form of speech, and signifieth no more than that <hi>degree of nearness</hi> to their <hi>Lord and Saviour,</hi> which the Apostles should obtain in the <hi>Kingdome of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> such as is commonly between those who ordinarily <hi>did eat, drink,</hi> and <hi>sit down together</hi> at the <hi>self-same Table.</hi> And therefore unto these, and such <hi>Texts</hi> as these, which speak of <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> or <hi>sitting down</hi> with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> 
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Matth. 8.11.</note>, there cannot be given a better answer, than that which <hi>Christ</hi> returned to the captious <hi>Saduces, viz. That in the Kingdom of Heaven, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the Angels of God</hi> 
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Matth. 22.30.</note> And if they are as the <hi>Angels of God,</hi> there shall be neither <hi>eating</hi> nor <hi>drinking</hi> then; we are sure of that.

                     <p>I must desire to be excused for calling it a <hi>Dream of an earthly paradise</hi>; for I am verily perswaded, that it is no other.

Which that we may the better see, and see withal how every one added somewhat of his own unto it, according as the strength or weakness of his <hi>fancy</hi> led him, I shall put down a memorable passage of <hi>Gennadius,</hi> which most fully speaks it, <hi>In divinis repromissionibus nihil terrenum vel transitorium expectamus, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut Melitani sperant; Non nuptiarum copulam, sicut</hi> Cerinthus <hi>&amp;</hi> Marcus <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirant; Non quod ad cibum vel ad potum pertinet, sicut</hi> Papiae <hi>Autori</hi> Irenaeus, Tertullianus, <hi>&amp;</hi> Lactantius <hi>acquiescunt: Neque per mille Annos Resurrectionem regnum Christi in terra futurum, &amp; Sanctos cum illo in deliciis regnaturos spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus, sicut</hi> Nepos <hi>docuit, qui primam justorum Resurrectionem &amp; secundam impiorum confinxit</hi>

By which we see that <hi>Melito</hi> did <hi>fancy</hi> onely a transitory and earthly Kingdom; <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and <hi>Marcus</hi> introduced the use of the <hi>marriage-bed; Papias</hi> seemed to be content with <hi>eating and drinking</hi>; and <hi>Nepos</hi> found out the distinction (to make all compleat) between the <hi>first and second Resurrection</hi>; making the first to be onely of the <hi>just and righteous,</hi> the second of the <hi>wicked and impenitent sinner,</hi> after the end or expiration of the <hi>thousand years.</hi> This is the <hi>Genealogie</hi> or <hi>Pedigree</hi> of this <hi>Opinion,</hi> which hath of late begun to revive among us, and findes not onely many <hi>followers</hi> but some <hi>Champions</hi> also.

happiness. I know that some of late times, and of eminent note, have given us this opinion in a better dress; delivering upon probable grounds, That before the end of the world, there shall be a time in which the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> shall flourish for a <hi>thousand years,</hi> in greater purity and power, both for <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>manners,</hi> and in more outward <hi>lustre</hi> and <hi>external glory,</hi> than hitherto it hath done in all former ages. <hi>Coelius Secundus Curio</hi> in his Book <hi>De Amplitudine Regni Dei, P. Cunaeus</hi> in that <hi>De Repub. Iudaeorum, Du Moulin</hi> in his <hi>Christian Combat, Piscator</hi> in his Comment on the <hi>Revelation, Alstedius</hi> in a Tract of his, called <hi>Diatribe de mille Annis Apocalypticis,</hi> and divers others not inferior unto them for parts and learning, have declared for it. And for my part I see no danger in assenting to it: If this will satisfie the <hi>Millenarians,</hi> they shall take me with them; but if they stand too stifly to their former tendries, and look not for this flourishing time of the Gospel till the <hi>Resurrection of the just</hi> be first accomplished, and then expect to have their part and portion in the pleasures of it, I must then leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The <hi>method</hi> of my <hi>Creed</hi> doth perswade me otherwise; which from the <hi>Resurrection of the Body</hi> leads me on immediately unto the joys and glories of <hi>eternal everlasting life</hi>; to which now I hasten.</p>
                     <p>I know it doth much trouble many pious and sober men to finde the force and efficacy of our <hi>Saviours</hi> Argument, in the place foregoing, which seems more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to assert the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> than the <hi>Resurrection of the Body</hi>; the bodies of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> being dissolved into dust in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> though their souls were living with their God.</p>
                     <p>Concerning which we are to know, 1. That the <hi>Sadduces</hi> by whom this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was propounded, did not alone deny the <hi>Resurrection of the dead,</hi> but so as to affirm withal,<note place="margin">Antiq. Jud. l. 18. c. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Animas cum corporibus extingui,</hi> That the Soul it self did also perish with the body, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us, <hi>They said, that there was neither Angel nor Spirit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 23.8.</note> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> says of them. 2. That though the <hi>Pharisees</hi> who were their opposite faction, in the latter end of the <hi>Iewish</hi> state, did grant a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> or <hi>Reviviscency</hi> from the dead, yet was it after such an <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Carnal</hi> sense, in <hi>eating, drinking,</hi> and conversing with <hi>women,</hi> (<hi>In qua cibo &amp; potu opus esset, &amp; conjugia rursum jungerentur, &amp;c.</hi> saith my Author of them) as the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> now dream of in their <hi>sensual paradise.</hi> And against this absurd opinion (as indeed it was) the <hi>Sadduces</hi> had found out that Argument about a <hi>woman</hi> which had or might have had seven Husbands by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> whose writings onely they received as <hi>Canonical Scripture,</hi> desiring to be satisfied in their curiosity, to which of the seven she should be wife at the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Which when the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> could not answer (as keeping to those principles indeed they could not) they thought to put our <hi>Saviour</hi> to it at the self-same weapon. But they found there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other manner of <hi>Spirit,</hi> than what had spoken to them, by, and in the <hi>Pharisees:</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> who knew their <hi>hearts,</hi> found their cunning also. And therefore did so shape his answer, as by declaring the true nature of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> against the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> to justifie the <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi> against the <hi>Sadduces.</hi> 1. Then, he tells them how much they were mistaken in the nature of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> for want of a right understanding of the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> (<hi>Erratis nescientes Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 22.29.</note> as the <hi>Vulgar</hi> reads it.) The <hi>Scriptures</hi> which do speak of a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> not being to be understood in such an <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Carnal sense,</hi> as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did understand them. Those bodies which were <hi>sown in corruption,</hi> were to be raised again <hi>incorruptible,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> and therefore not to live by the <hi>food which perisheth</hi>: Those bodies which were sown in their <hi>mortality,</hi> by reuniting with the Soul, should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>immortal,</hi> and therefore not to stand in need of any <hi>Seminal</hi> or <hi>Carnal way</hi> of Propagation;<note place="margin">Luk. 20.36.</note> 
                        <hi>For in the Resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; neither can they die any more, but are as the Angels of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> in the condition of their being, as to those particulars. This said, and so much of their doubt resolved, as concerned the error of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> he lets them see the weakness of their own opinion, touching the <hi>annihilation</hi> or <hi>extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Immortal soul of man:</hi> And that too from the works of <hi>Moses,</hi> which themselves embraced, without consulting any other of the <hi>holy Pen-men:</hi>
                        <pb n="480" facs="tcp:59300:263"/>
For when God said to <hi>Moses</hi> in the present tence, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Isaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob, it must needs be, that <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> must be accounted of as living at that present time, and living otherwise they were not at that present time, but as their blessed <hi>Souls</hi> did live in the sight of God, their <hi>Bodies</hi> being long before consumed and perished; though even those <hi>bodies</hi> by the <hi>infinity</hi> of <hi>comprehension</hi> which is in God, might be looked upon as <hi>living</hi> also, in reference to that <hi>eternal life</hi> which was prepared for them in the day of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And this I take to be the meaning of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who doth not onely say in the present tence, <hi>That the dead are raised,</hi> but addes these following words to the other <hi>Evangelist,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 20.38.</note> viz. <hi>For all live in him</hi>; that is to say, All men, though buried in their dust, are <hi>living</hi> in the sight of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> who sees at once all things that have been, are, and shall be unto all <hi>eternity,</hi> as if present with him; and consequently beholds the <hi>Souls</hi> of his righteous servants, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the rest, in the bliss of <hi>Paradise,</hi> as if apparrelled with those <hi>bodies</hi> which before they had. So then, the <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi> being so fully proved by our <hi>Saviours</hi> Argument, <hi>The Resurrection of the dead</hi> (being the thing which seemed to be scrupled by the <hi>Sadduces</hi>) was concluded also, and yet not such a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> the <hi>Pharisees</hi> dreamed of, in which there should be <hi>marrying, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in marriage</hi> (that is to say, In which things should be ordered by the rules of this present life) but such a one, wherein the <hi>Saints</hi> of God should be like the <hi>Angels,</hi> discharged from all relations incident to flesh and blood, exempt from all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affections of what sort soever. For certainly, had not the Argument concluded strongly and convincingly to the point proposed, neither the <hi>Scribes,</hi> men better studied in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> than any of the rest of the <hi>Iewish Nation,</hi> had given this testimony to it,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.9.</note> 
                        <hi>Magister dixisti benè,</hi> as we see they did, nor had the mouths of such curious and captious <hi>Sophisters</hi> been muzzled, as we see they were from ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the like <hi>Questions</hi> for the time to come, both which the story tells us in the close of all.

                           <hi>Niceph.</hi> Eccl. hist. l. 5. c. 23.</note>.

as I hope it will be, we must next fit it with an <hi>Ubi,</hi> with a constant place, of as great perpetuity as a <hi>soul</hi> it self; and with a <hi>life</hi> as permanent, as the place can be. Which place or life, being we cannot finde it in this present world, we must look for it in another; and therefore, that which in this <hi>Creed</hi> is called <hi>Life everlasting,</hi> is called in the <hi>Nicene Creed, The life of the world to come.</hi> And if it be a <hi>Life of the world to come,</hi> this world, and all the beauties of it, must first pass away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can possess our estates in that; even as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us of our <hi>Saviour Christ, That he took away the first Covenant to establish the second</hi>

What need it be added unto this, That there we shall enjoy those <hi>favors</hi> which the frown of <hi>Princes</hi> cannot ruine, nor the riot of posterity impair, nor the tongues of evil people blemish; those <hi>riches</hi> which the rust of pleasure shall not eat into, nor the moth of vanity consume, nor the <hi>great thief</hi> of Hell steal from us? In a word, What need be added unto this, That there we shall attain such an height of bliss, <hi>Vt ne voto quidem o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus sit,</hi> that there shall be no need of <hi>prayers,</hi> but we shall spend our whole <hi>eternity</hi> in no other office, than singing <hi>Hymns</hi> of praise and glory to the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God</hi>? All this, and more than can be added, is comprehended in the <hi>glory</hi> of that <hi>blessed Vision,</hi> which is all in all. But of the glories and felicities of <hi>eternal life,</hi> it is enough to say a little, because it is impossible we should say enough.</p>
                     <p>Two things there are which may deserve a further, and more punctual search, because they have been much debated amongst the learned: The one about the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees</hi> in <hi>eternal happiness</hi>; the other about the <hi>knowledge</hi> which the Saints shall have of one another, whether they lived with us, or in other ages. Of both these I shall venture a word or two in a <hi>positive way,</hi> rather than <hi>traverse</hi> and <hi>debate</hi> them in the way of Argument.</p>
                     <p>And first beginning with the last, It is apparent that the <hi>Apostles</hi> knew our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> after his <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the grave of death; and that the people of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> the <hi>holy City,</hi> did know those <hi>Saints,</hi> who rose together with our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>appeared</hi> unto them; though both our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and those <hi>Saints</hi> rose in <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied bodies; Bodies</hi> not subject any more unto putrefaction.

                           <hi>August.</hi> Epl. 6.</note>. Nor shall we onely <hi>know and be known</hi> of those, with whom we took sweet counsel together, or <hi>walked together in the House of the Lord as Friends</hi>; but at the first sight shall be able to say, that this is <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob</hi>; these are the <hi>Saints</hi> that went before us, these are they who came in the <hi>arrere</hi> many ages after. For <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells the <hi>Iews, That they should see</hi> Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, <hi>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God</hi> 
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 13.28.</note>: Not see them, as men see a stranger whom they did not know, but see them so, as to know who they were by their <hi>names</hi> and <hi>qualities</hi>; Else could not the discomfort be so great unto them, to see their <hi>Fathers after the flesh,</hi> and all the <hi>Prophets whom they murdered,</hi> in a state of <hi>glory</hi>; and they, their miserable and unhappy children, to be quite excluded from the same. And the same <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth assure his <hi>followers,</hi> That they should <hi>sit at the same Table</hi> with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> 
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Id. 22.30.</note>; that is to say, They should commerce as freely, and as knowingly with those antient <hi>Patriarks,</hi> as men that use to eat together in the self-same house. Besides, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do affirm in several places, That at the last day, shall be a manifest declaration of the just judgment of God, when he shall <hi>reward every man according to the works which
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:59300:268"/>
he hath done in the flesh, whether good or evil.</hi> And if the <hi>works</hi> of every man shall be brought to light, then much more shall the <hi>workers of those iniquities</hi> be made known to the Saints their Judges; for if the <hi>persons be not known,</hi> where would be that confusion of the face which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> speak of, which shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the wicked and impenitent sinner, upon the manifestation of his deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Many a <hi>malefactor</hi> hath been hanged more chearfully in places where we was not <hi>known,</hi> where he could be no shame to his <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>kinred,</hi> than if he had been executed in the sight of those who knew him, and the <hi>parentage</hi> whence he came. And to this purpose are the words of our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> unto his <hi>Apostles,</hi> when he informeth them, <hi>That they should sit upon twelve seats, judging the twelve Tribes of</hi> Israel <note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 19.28.</note>. By which it is apparent that they shall be <hi>known by the Tribes of Israel,</hi> to be the poor despised <hi>Apostles</hi> of a more despised and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>Saviour.</hi> It followeth consequently upon good deduction, not onely that the <hi>twelve Apostles</hi> shall know those of the <hi>Tribes of Israel,</hi> whom they are to judge; but that they shall be also known of <hi>one another,</hi> and of all the <hi>Saints,</hi> who shall rejoyce in that preferment of their Chiefs and Leaders, though raised unto an higher pitch and degree of <hi>glory,</hi> than others of their <hi>Brethren</hi> are advanced unto.</p>
                     <p>For that in <hi>Heaven</hi> there shall be <hi>different degrees</hi> and <hi>estates</hi> of <hi>glory,</hi> I take to be a point so clearly evidenced in <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> that little <hi>disputation</hi> needs be raised about it: Though some too much affected to <hi>a parity</hi> in this present life, expect to finde it also in the <hi>life to come.</hi> The <hi>Fathers,</hi> I am sure, did all look this way. And so much <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> doth confess ingenuously, although himself no friend unto their opinion. <hi>De Patribus fatemur ingenuè quod praemiorum discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina statuerunt,</hi> which is plain enough <note n="g" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pet. Martyr.</hi> Com. Loc. cl. 3. c. 17.</note>. And as he doth affirm this of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> generally, so he affirms particularly of St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> that he was <hi>istarum diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentiarum acer propugnator</hi>; a great <hi>assertor</hi> of those <hi>different degrees</hi> and <hi>estates</hi> of <hi>glory,</hi> as indeed he was. And certainly they had good warrant to resolve so in it. <hi>Daniel,</hi> a Prophet of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and one in more than ordinary favor with him, hath assured us this, <hi>That they which be wise, shall shine like the brightness of the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, and they which turn many unto righteousness like the Stars for ever</hi> 
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Dan. 12.3.</note>. In which we see two <hi>different duties</hi> recommended to us, to learn the <hi>rules of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> first, to be <hi>wise</hi> our selves, and then to teach them unto others, to <hi>turn them to righteousness</hi>; accordingly the <hi>rewards</hi> proportioned, to <hi>shine like the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the firmament,</hi> like the <hi>stars of Heaven.</hi> And who seeth not how much the splendor of the <hi>Stars</hi> exceeds the brightness of the Sky, of the clearest <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>? The like St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> That there shall be a <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> in it; <hi>that there is one glory of the Sun, another glory of the Moon, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other glory of the Stars</hi>; and of the Stars, <hi>that one Star differeth from another Star in glory</hi> 
                        <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.41.</note>. Now our <hi>Astronomy</hi> doth teach us upon very good inferences, that the <hi>Sun</hi> is One hundred sixty and six times bigger than the Earthly Globe, whereas the <hi>Moon</hi> hardly amounts unto a fortieth part thereof; and that the <hi>fixed Stars</hi> of the first magnitude, are found to be One hundred and seven times bigger than the Body of the Earth, those of the least, coming but to the sixth part of that proportion. Which sheweth the <hi>difference in glory</hi> to be very great, though possibly the Rules of that Art may fail us in the proportioning of that difference: But whatsoever be the error in those Rules of Art, assuredly there can be no etror in the words of <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> do concenter and meet together. And he hath told us in plain terms, <hi>That in his Fathers house there are many mansions</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 14.2.</note>; that is to say, as <hi>Denys</hi> the <hi>Carthusian</hi> states it, conform unto the minde and meaning of the antient Fathers, <hi>Multi praemiorum gradus, &amp; variae distinctiones,</hi> many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of happiness and estates of glory, though all most glorious in themselves. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which Rule of our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> we finde a difference made in his <hi>holy Gospel,</hi> between those men which had been <hi>faithful over much,</hi> and those which had been <hi>faithful over a little onely</hi> 
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Matth. 25.21, 23.</note>; the one being made the Ruler of Ten Cities, the other but of Five alone <note n="m" place="margin">Luke 19.17, 19.</note>; between the recompense and <hi>reward</hi> of a <hi>righteous person,</hi> and that which is laid up by <hi>God</hi> for the <hi>reward</hi> of a Prophet.
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:59300:268"/>
                        <hi>He that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteoas mans reward. And he that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward</hi> 
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 10.41.</note>, saith our Lord and Saviour. And to say truth, besides the warrant and <hi>authority</hi> of the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that so it should be, it stands with very good <hi>Reason</hi> that so it should be; and is most consonant to the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>distributive Iustice,</hi> that so it must be. For if that <hi>faith in Christ,</hi> and a <hi>conformity</hi> to the words of his <hi>holy Gospel,</hi> be, in the merciful construction of the Lord our God, thought worthy <hi>of a crown of glory</hi>; then certainly a greater and more lively <hi>faith,</hi> and a more <hi>conscionable walking</hi> in the sight of God, must be rewarded with a richer and more <hi>excellent Crown.</hi> And so it also followeth by the <hi>rule of contraries.</hi> For if <hi>he that knoweth the will of his Master and doth it not, shall be beaten with more stripes</hi> 
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Luk. 12.47.</note>, than the ignorant man, as the truth it self hath said he shall; it must needs follow by that <hi>Rule,</hi> that they which know Gods will exactly, and conscionably apply themselves to observe the same, shall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with more blessings at their Masters hands. And so the old <hi>Carthusian</hi> whom before I spake of, doth resolve the question. <hi>Many</hi> (saith he) <hi>are raised above their brethren in the house of God, Secundum quod aliqui ferventius Deum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexerint</hi> 
                        <note n="r" place="margin">
                           <hi>Dion. Carthus.</hi> in Joh. 14.</note>, as being far more zealous in their love to God, more constant in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute of their way to Heaven, than others of their Brethren are, which yet by Gods great mercy shall come thither also. As therefore the Apostle advised those of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> so must I also counsel those which shall read these papers, that they do <hi>covet</hi> earnestly <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <note n="s" place="margin">1 Cor.</note>, that so they may possess the most eminent places. Or if they dare not look so high, to be sure of this, that they do so conform their lives unto Gods commandements, that when <hi>their earthly Tabernacles are dissolved</hi> into dust and ashes, their soules may be disposed of in the place of rest, there to expect <hi>the Resurrection of their Bodys</hi> to <hi>Eternal life,</hi> and lodged for ever in some one of those <hi>heavenly Mansions</hi> reserved for them in the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>And this indeed is that which we all must aim at, if we have any of that zeal to <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which was so eminent in the <hi>Patriachs, Apostles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Confessors,</hi> as to be left upon record for our instruction. Of <hi>Abraham</hi> it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of God, that he <hi>left his own Country, and all his kindred,</hi> in search of a far <hi>better Country,</hi> that is an <hi>Heavenly</hi> 
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note>; that he left <hi>Vr,</hi> one of the chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> but one <hi>made with hands,</hi> to look for an <hi>house not made with hands, whose builder and maker is the Lord. David</hi> preferred <hi>one day in the house of God,</hi> before a <hi>Thousand years</hi> consumed in his earthly Palaces <note n="u" place="margin">Psal. 84.10.</note>, yea, though he were advanced no higher in that House of God, than to be a <hi>door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> was so rapt with the sight of those <hi>Heavenly glories,</hi> in which he did behold our Saviour in his <hi>transfiguration,</hi> that he set up his resolution with <hi>Bonum est nobis esse hic</hi> 
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Matth. 17.4.</note>, that it was best for him to abide there alwaies. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had seen a glimpse of the joyes of <hi>Paradise,</hi> to which he had been taken up in an heavenly rapture, how willingly did he <hi>indure the cross, and despise the shame, in reference to the joy which was set before him</hi> 
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Hebr. 12.2.</note>? how earnestly did he come out with his <hi>cupio dissolvi,</hi> that he desired to be <hi>dissolved and to live with Christ</hi>? With what a gallant zeal did the old <hi>Father Ignatius</hi> contemn the fire, Gallows, fury of wild Beasts, the breaking of his bones, quartering of his members, and the crushing of his body into peeces, <hi>tota Diaboli tormenta, nay all the torments of the Devil and Hell,</hi> onely upon this bare hope, <hi>ut Christo fruar</hi>

                           <hi>Hierom.</hi> in Catal. Script.</note>, <hi>That he might come at last to injoy his Saviour</hi>? Such an Heroick zeal was that of the good <hi>Father</hi> St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who declared himself <hi>to be contended to indure the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, so he might thereby gain the joys of Heaven</hi>

                           <hi>Aug.</hi> Serm. 31. de sancti.</note>, rather than lose the same for want of those dreadful sufferings. And not much short of this was the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution wherewith St. <hi>Basil</hi> answered his <hi>Persecutors,</hi> when they did think to terrifie him with the fear of death; <hi>I will not fear that death,</hi> saith he, <hi>which can do no more than restore me unto him that made me</hi>

                        </note>. Infinite more of these examples might be laid before us, were not these sufficient to let us see how high a price they set on the <hi>joyes of Heaven,</hi> the glories of this <hi>Life eternal,</hi> of which they had no

more <hi>assurance</hi> than what was made <hi>unto them</hi> by <hi>the Word of God</hi>; which <hi>Word of God</hi> we have for our <hi>assurance</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> also, besides the conduct and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their good example.

                     <p>But so it is not with those men, who either <hi>wilfully</hi> shut their eyes against the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> or, who confess him with their <hi>mouths,</hi> but <hi>scornfully</hi> deny him in their words and actions, leading a life conform to their sensual appetite. There is another habitation reserved for them, even that <hi>prepared for the devil and his angels</hi>

                     <p>First then the names by which it hath been delivered and made known unto us by the sacred <hi>Penmen,</hi> are these four especially, that is to say, <hi>Hades, Abyssus, Tartarus,</hi> and <hi>Gehenna</hi>; of which, the three first are meerly <hi>Greek,</hi> and the last an off-spring of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Of <hi>Hades</hi> we have spoke already in the <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Christs descent into Hell</hi>; as also of the <hi>Latine Inferi</hi> or <hi>infernum,</hi> which they use to express it, and shall not here repeat what was there delivered. By that which was delivered there, it appears to be a <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>disconsolate place</hi> in the deeps of the Earth, a place appointed for the punishment of ungodly men; not onely in the judgment of the sacred <hi>Penmen,</hi> and the old <hi>Ecclesiastical writers</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but also of all <hi>learned men</hi> amongst the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whether <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Latines.</hi> The same is signified as plainly in the name of <hi>Abyssus,</hi> which is thrice used by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to signifie <hi>the bottomless pit,</hi> or <hi>the pit of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>: from whence the <hi>smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace,</hi> Chap. 9.2. from whence the <hi>Beasts ascended to make war against the Two Witnesses of the Lord,</hi> Chap. 11.7. from whence that <hi>Beast ascended also to his just perdition,</hi> on which <hi>the woman sate,</hi> which made her self <hi>drunk with the blood of the Saints,</hi> Chap. 17.8. And is indeed no other than that <hi>Stagnum ignis &amp; sulphuris,</hi> that <hi>lake of fire and brimstone,</hi> mentioned in the twentieth Chapter. Nor is the word used onely in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to signifie <hi>Hell,</hi> or <hi>the place of torments,</hi> but in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> also, where it is said, <hi>Say not in thine heart, who shall ascend up into Heaven?

                        <hi>to torment them before their time</hi> 
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Matth. 8.29.</note>, desired him that they might not go. <hi>And they besought him</hi> (saith St. <hi>Luke</hi>) <hi>ne imperaret illis ut in Abyssum irent, i. e.</hi> That he would not command them to go into the <hi>deep</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 8.31.</note>, or rather into the <hi>Abysse,</hi> or <hi>the bottomless pit,</hi> as the word is rendred thrice in the <hi>Revelation. Abyssus</hi> therefore must be <hi>Hell,</hi> or the house of torments prepared for the <hi>Devil and his Angels,</hi> against the judgment of that <hi>great and terrible day</hi>; which they were so afraid to enter, that they besought the <hi>Lord</hi> not to send them thither. The third word used for <hi>Hell</hi> in the <hi>holy Scripture</hi> is <hi>Tartarus,</hi> used onely by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that but once. <hi>God spared not</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Angels that sinned, but having bound them with chains of darkness,</hi> detrusos in <hi>Tartaro</hi> tradidit cruciandos <note n="g" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.4.</note>, <hi>cast them down into Hell, to be kept there to the day of judgment.</hi> Where <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarus,</hi> though Englished <hi>Hell,</hi> is not that <hi>very place of torment</hi> to which they shall be doomed in the <hi>judgment day</hi>; but the <hi>out-skirts</hi> or <hi>suburbs</hi> of it, the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> in the which they lie bound in the <hi>chains of darkness.</hi> But whether it be <hi>Hell</hi> it self, or the <hi>dungeon</hi> to it, the antient <hi>Gentiles</hi> who best knew the true meaning of it, have made it a dark place in the deeps of the Earth; and therefore called by <hi>Ovid, Tenebrosa Tartara</hi>

                     <p>These are the several words used by the sacred <hi>Pen-men</hi> of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when they speak of <hi>Hell.</hi> And all being laid together, will amount to this, <hi>That it is a dark and dismal place in the deeps of the Earth, prepared by God originally for the devil and his angels, and secondarily for impenitent sinners, where they shall fry for ever in unquenchable flames, and see no other light but the fire that burns them.</hi> And this being properly the punishment reserved in <hi>Hell,</hi> for those who are condemned to that <hi>bottomless pit,</hi> I shall insist the more upon it: Not looking here upon the <hi>separation</hi> of the wicked from the love of God, or the <hi>despair</hi> which they grone under, or the <hi>guilt</hi> of conscience; which either are but <hi>poena damni,</hi> the loss of that which Gods beloved do enjoy in the Heavenly glories, or are in part inflicted on the wicked man in this present life.

Christ. l. 3. c. 10.</note>) we shall leave nothing safe nor sound in the Book of God. And then it is to be considered, That <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this sentence in the day judgment, <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, prepared for the devil and his angels</hi>; Which if it be not spoken in the <hi>literal sense,</hi> according to the plain meaning of the words, neither the <hi>guilty</hi> can perceive what they are to suffer, nor the <hi>Ministers</hi> what they are to execute, nor the <hi>Saints</hi> what belongs to them to approve and applaud; but all things will be left in most strange perplexities. Besides, it was the custom of our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he had spoken to the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>Parables,</hi> to make an exposition of them to his own <hi>Disciples</hi>; and in that exposition to speak so plainly, that every one might be able to understand him: As in the <hi>Parables</hi> of the <hi>Tares,</hi> and the <hi>Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Net,</hi> delivered in the thirteenth of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel, the <hi>Disciples</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not what he meant by either, but were as ignorant of his scope and purpose, as the rest of the <hi>Iews</hi>; But when he did expound himself unto them in private, touching the sending of his <hi>Angels in the day of judgment</hi> to sever the wicked from the just, and to cast them, being severed so, into the <hi>furnace of fire</hi>; and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, if they understood what was said unto them, they made answer, <hi>yea</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 13.51.</note>. It must not therefore be a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> but a proper Speech, by which our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> did expound his meaning, and open the obscurity of the said two <hi>Parables</hi>; for to expound a <hi>Parable</hi> by a <hi>Trope</hi> or <hi>Metaphor,</hi> had neither been agreeable to our <hi>Saviours</hi> goodness, nor any way conducing to their <hi>Edification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then, the <hi>fire of Hell</hi> shall be true and real, not <hi>Figurative</hi> and <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi>; and as it is a <hi>real fire,</hi> a <hi>devouring fire,</hi> so is it <hi>ignis inextinguibilis,</hi> an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire</hi> in the third, and <hi>ignis aeternus,</hi> an <hi>everlasting fire,</hi> in the five and twentieth of <hi>Matthew; The smoke whereof goeth up for ever,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
