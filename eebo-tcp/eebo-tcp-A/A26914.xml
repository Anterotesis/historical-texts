            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE DIFFERENCE Between the POWER OF MAGISTRATES AND CHURCH-PASTORS, AND THE ROMAN KINGDOM &amp; MAGISTRACY Under the Name of a CHURCH &amp; CHURCH-GOVERNMENT Usurped by the Pope, or liberally given him by Popish Princes: Opened by <hi>Richard Baxter.</hi> To the Learned and Sincere <hi>Ludovicus Molinaeus</hi> Dr of Physick, and Author of <hi>Jugulum Causae, Papa Ultrajectinus,</hi> and other Books on this subject. For the Vindication of the true Pastoral Discipline, exercised by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches, and <hi>claimed,</hi> but alas, <hi>too little exercised,</hi> by the Churches called <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Reformed.</hi> And to acquaint Posterity what we hold in this, that false accusations misinform them not.</p>

            <p>THE first Epistle is now written upon the sight of <hi>Jugulum Causae:</hi> The other with the Propositions was written about a year and half ago, upon the sight of <hi>Papa ultrajectinus,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Paraenesis contra Aedificatores Imperii in Imperio:</hi> And the design of all is, to shew how little or nothing at all the sober mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Protestants, called Episcopal, Presbyterian, Independent, and Political or Erastian are disagreed in all this business, whilst I name you near a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Propositions in which they commonly consent: That Princes and all Magistrates may see, that they have no cause to be offended at the <hi>Christian and Protestant Doctrine,</hi> or to judge the <hi>true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of any of these parties, as such,</hi> to be contrary to their interest; when in very truth they are in that all one: But that among all Sects and Parties, there will be still some injudicious, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and unpeaceable men; especially those whose <hi>Interest</hi> in the world is <hi>Great,</hi> and cannot be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, without encroaching on the rights of others: As Great Trees must have much room, and suffer

               <pb facs="tcp:59351:3"/>
nothing to prosper under them, but Weeds and Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars. And it is to tell Politicians, that the true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal Power (being a Power to <hi>labour and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> in <hi>patient self-denyal</hi> for the Church of Christ and the souls of men) is past all doubt of Christs appointment: And to diminish that Power, is but to diminish our obligation to <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> and to gratifie our sloth and fleshly interest. But to diminish that Secular Church-power which Clergie men claim as of Divine Right, is but for Princes to be Princes, whether the Clergie will or no.</p>
            <p>And as to the Learned Author, Dr. <hi>Lud. Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> my meaning is to second him in awakening Magistrates to reassume their proper power, and to leave it in no Clergie mens hands, of what party soever: But as to his reflections on the Protestants Discipline, lovingly to chide him for making the difference seem wider than it is, and to RECON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CILE the four Parties, while I distinctly open the common Doctrine of them all, excepting the rigid Opinions of some interessed or intemperate indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I had hastily set down my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Cause which I found handled in your <hi>Papa Ultrajectinus</hi> and other Writings which you sent me, I cast by that Script (which I intended at the writing of it, for your view) that I might surely keep it from the notice of others, in this Age wherein the prevalency of <hi>Interest, Faction, Passion</hi> and <hi>Injudiciousness,</hi> doth make it so great a difficulty, to say any thing for the cure of any mens <hi>errors, enormities</hi> or <hi>impieties,</hi> which shall not be charged with the same crime (or greater) which it would cure, and be taken for a disturber of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> which it would save or heal. But now seeing that you renew your endeavours in the same Cause, and finding your <hi>Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Causae</hi> directed to so many hands, by seventy particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Epistles, and that you have honoured me with a place among those great and worthy persons, I take my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to render you some account of my judgement of your Writings, and especially of the whole Cause, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the open light, those hundred Propositions which I had purposed to conceal: And withal to tell you,</p>
            <p>1. That (though you have much overvalued me in your recitation of their report, who would have joyned me with so <hi>Great,</hi> so <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> a man as <hi>A</hi> Bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> and that in so great a work; and experience may tell you, that other men have other thoughts of me, as one unmeet to preach the Gospel in the Land of my Nativity, much more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59351:4"/>
unmeet to be a decider of the Churches Controversies) yet you have truly described my judgement of your self and your undertaking. I confess I hope not that ever you should make the <hi>Roman</hi> Usurpation, more palpable, than the falshood of their Doctrine of Transubstantiation; where they maintain (not only the Corporal Presence, which is not it that I now mean, but) that <hi>Bread is not Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine is not Wine,</hi> when all men <hi>see, taste, smell</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> them: And if the Princes, Doctors, and great men of the world, can thus obstinately deny (or take on them to deny) the judgement which is made of sensible objects, by all mens senses, you may gather what fruit you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of your labours, or of any Cause how plain soever, where <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>seeming interest</hi> are against you? Can all the Writings or Reasonings in the world, bring any thing to a more <hi>clear and sure</hi> decision, than that of all the senses of all men in the world, about the proper objects of sense? If <hi>flesh</hi> so far conquer <hi>flesh it self,</hi> and the interest of <hi>sensuality</hi> can cause such men, and such multitudes to renounce the apprehension of all their senses, what have we to do more for the cure of mankind?</p>
            <p>You have made it plain enough, that it is really a part of the Secular Government of Kings and States, which is now commonly called <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> among the Papists, and as such is challenged and usurped by the Pope, and that Princes that subject their Kingdoms to his Usurpation, do take in a <hi>joint Ruler</hi> with them, and divide their <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> between themselves and him. But so they <hi>have done,</hi> and so they <hi>will do,</hi> till the Time of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches fuller Reformation, and of the Coalition of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world is come.</p>
            <p>I know you may think that as <hi>Interest</hi> blindeth them, so this great detection of the Invasion of their <hi>Interest</hi> is the way to bring them to the truth. For who will have a Co-partner with him in his Kingdom, that may choose? Who had not rather Rule alone, than divide his Kingdom with the Pope? Undoubtedly they give away more of their own Interest hereby, than you have opened? When they deliver part of their power to one, who by an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi>

            <p>Do you think this is not plain dealing enough, if men are willing to understand?</p>
            <p>I know that there were Emperours and Princes that strugled hard, before they suffered themselves to be thus subjected; And these Emperours had Lawyers, Statesmen and Divines that took their parts; as all the Treatises in <hi>Goldastus</hi> his three Volumes <hi>de Monarch.</hi> and his <hi>Imp.

And, alas, <hi>Occham,</hi> and <hi>Marsilius Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavinus,</hi> and <hi>Widdrington</hi> and <hi>Barclay</hi> came all too late. For all that <hi>Secular Power</hi> which was cloaked with the name of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so deeply rooted in the Papacy, that they durst plead for no more, than that Princes are not subject to the Pope in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals: But as you truly note, abundance of Temporals, and of the Magistrates proper work about things Ecclesiastical, was still vailed under the name of <hi>Spiritual:</hi> And at last, even the <hi>Temporal Power</hi> again claimed more subtilly, and indirectly, as <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia.</hi>

            <p>But you'l say, that <hi>All men are naturally so regardful of their own Interest, and especially Princes, that it is not possible they should be so servile, tame and self-abasing, as to give

away so great a part of their Kingdoms to a Forreigner, yea, to one that claimeth all, (by himself, or by his most famous Writers) and by his Councils claimeth a power to depose them; They that with their own Nobles and other Subjects, are so jealous of their Prerogatives, would never so far depose themselves, if they did but know what they do: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Popish Princes understand the matter, they will shake off the yoke, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It's true, that Protestant Princes and States have done so; And the true meaning of our Oath of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is the same with your main design: And though some have stumbled at those words, that the King is <hi>Supream Governour in all Causes Ecclesiastical,</hi> the meaning is only (as hath been oft publickly declared) that <hi>he is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Civil or Coactive Governour by the Sword, in all Causes Ecclesiastical,</hi> so far as they fall under that Coactive or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive Government. And hereby the King doth but reas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Royal Power over the Clergy and the affairs of Religion, which the Pope had usurped under the name of <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi> For its well known what was called <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Power</hi> in <hi>England</hi> in the times of Popery: so that this much of the Vail is removed long ago among all Protestants. And if you peruse but Bishop <hi>Bilsons</hi> excellent Tract of <hi>Christian Subjection,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> his <hi>Tortura Torti</hi> (to pass by all others) you will see that this Case is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opened, than I for my part am able to open it. And it is seldom heard of (for all the industry and subtilty of <hi>Rome</hi>) that any Prince or State doth Voluntarily turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, that is once delivered from the Yoke, and that ever again parteth with his power when he hath recovered it.</p>
            <p>But yet that even this Argument from <hi>Notorious Interest,</hi> doth not recover the Liberty of Countreys subject to the Pope, you will the less wonder, if you consider these three things.</p>
            <p>1. That the Papal Interest hath got such rooting in their Subjects minds, that it is not in their power to reassume their right. The Clergy are so numerous, subtile, ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and potent, and the people so commonly deceived, and so tenacious of ancient Customs, that to make this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59351:6"/>
Change, might cast all into a flame: And they think it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to lose part, than all. And no doubt but the examples of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> maked some think, that if they displease the Pope and his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, they have not sufficient security for their lives.</p>
            <p>2. And Princes stand usually on such terms of danger or jealousie from one another, that they are fain to keep such a Peace at home, lest they expose themselves to a greater mischief from abroad. And they are broken by the Papal subtilty, especially in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> into such Fractions, and petty Principalities, that few of them are strong enough to defend themselves against the Confederates of the Pope (when potent Emperours heretofore could not do it.) And many of them, especially the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> do take this Copartnership of the Pope, to be a great part of their strength: And as anciently many Emperours were forced to choose their <hi>Caesars</hi> and Copartners, when the defence of the Empire was too hard for themselves alone; so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Princes are glad to make use of the Papal interest and power for their own security; though upon terms that else would never be submitted to.</p>
            <p>And in some Countreys the Rebellious disposition of the Subjects driveth them to accept of this dear remedy; and they choose rather to strengthen themselves by a Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than to stoop to the wills of their inferiours.</p>
            <p>For here you must take notice, that the pretence of a <hi>Jus divinum</hi> and of <hi>Spirituality,</hi> and the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of the <hi>safety</hi> of their souls, doth make this kind of servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude much less dishonourable, than it is to be overtopt by a neighbour Prince, or to be curbed by their subjects. For what dishonour is it for a man to be subject to his Maker and Redeemer? Nay, what greater honour can there be? And the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy have used themselves to Canonize those Princes that have been most zealous for their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and to raise the fame and praises of such, as have raised that which they call the Church, that the very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Clergies Praises, doth do much to tempt some to a tame acceptance of a Copartner, who pretendeth to be the Vicar of Christ: When this servitude goeth for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59351:7"/>
sanctity, and carrieth not with it the reproach of other sorts of servitude.</p>
            <p>3. And it greatly furthereth their success, that the Popes Agents are commonly bred up in Learning, and so are made able to over-wit the Laity; And that it is their great design, to gratifie the Lusts of Princes, by indulging their voluptuous sensual lives, that so they may spend their dayes in such things, as will never advance their understandings to an ability to discern the cheats of their Copartners: And they detestably cherish the Ignorance of the Common Laity, that they may be the fitter to be led and mastered by them; even as men keep women from Learning and great attainments, lest they should be the more uncapable of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. And thus as Satan leadeth men to Hell, so the Papal Usurper bringeth the Laity into their power, by their <hi>own consent,</hi> by such <hi>pleasing baits,</hi> as make their servitude easie to them. And it is not your telling them of their interest, that will prevail against all these temptations. They that will lose Heaven, and their salvation by such cheats, may lose half of their earthly Dominions by them, as long as the other half sufficeth to satisfie their concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, and to maintain their honour and pleasure in the world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Usurpation consisteth of two parts. 1. The Usurpation of such a <hi>Pastoral Power</hi> as they have no right to. 2. The Usurpation of a great part of the Magistrates power, sometime <hi>directly,</hi> and sometimes indirectly <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ad spiritualia;</hi> and constantly by the cheat of the false name of Church <hi>power,</hi> put upon the Magistrates part of Church Government, as if it were the Clergies part.</p>
            <p>I. The Usurpation of a Pastoral power which belongeth not to them, is the chief part of their Iniquity. And it consisteth in these, among other particulars.<list>
                  <item>1. In the impious, and arrogant claim of an Universal Pastorship over all the world. The <hi>Roman</hi> Prelate must be the Teacher of all the world, the High Priest of all the world, and the Spiritual Ruler of all the world; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he cannot do by himself, he must do by others, as far as he can to uphold his usurpation. He must be the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59351:7"/>
and the Judge of all the world, even at the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes, and where he hath no acquaintance nor access.</item>
                  <item>2. By this he undertaketh to be a Bishop in other mens Diocesses, and to rule in all matters, where he hath no more power, than any Pastor hath in another Pastoral Charge.</item>
                  <item>3. And by this he undertaketh to be the Spiritual Father and Governour of all the Kings and Rulers of the Christian world, and so to have the power of excommunicating them when he thinketh there is cause, and to brand them as uncapable of Christian communion with their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; or with any other Christians.</item>
                  <item>4. By this he usurpeth authority of imposing what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors he please (even such as will carry on his interest) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Churches in the world, and depriving both Princes and people of their just liberty of choice.</item>
                  <item>5. By this also he usurpeth the power of deposing what Bishops or Pastors he please, and depriving the people of their necessary helps, and faithfullest Teachers. Yea, of putting whole Nations under Interdicts of serving and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God in Church-assemblies; commanding all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors to shut up the Church doors, and forbidding them to perfom their office, and to preach Christs Gospel, or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister his holy Sacraments.</item>
                  <item>6. By this he sendeth forth his Missionaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and setteth up Societies of Jesuits and Fryers to do his work, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all Princes and people to receive and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance them.</item>
                  <item>7. By this he layeth claim to a right of maintenance for Himself and his Missionaries in all parts of the world, in the name of Christ, who hath said, that the labourer is worthy of his hire.</item>
                  <item>8. By this he granteth Dispensations, Pardons, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, commandeth praying to Saints and Angels, and praying for the Dead, as being in Purgatory, and by this he setteth up his whole new frame of self-devised Worship and Religion. Now I call not all this an Usurpation of Magistracy, so far as he useth no Corporal force, and threatneth no penalty but excommunication and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59351:8"/>
For every true Pastor with his own flock hath the Power of Guiding them by delivering Christs Doctrine and Precepts, and commanding obedience as his Servant or Embassadour in his Name, and of denouncing his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of judging obligingly who are fit to be taken in to the Church by Baptism, and who to be cast out as Impenitent by excommunication in his own particular Charge or Society. And if the Pope usurp a power of doing all this and more, as an Universal Pastor only, this is an Usurpation of a <hi>Church Power,</hi> and not of a <hi>Magistracy.</hi> And indeed if you will acquit him from the guilt of the Mysterie of Iniquity any further than he invadeth Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy it self, you will do him a great deal of wrong: For he is the <hi>Vicarius Christi,</hi> and the <hi>Vice-Christ</hi> more notably by his <hi>Spiritual Usurpation</hi> of a power proper to <hi>Christ himself,</hi> or at least of a power that Christ never gave him.</item>

            <p>II. His setting up a KINGDOM, and invading the MAGISTRACY is done I. Directly, II. Indirectly and Consequentially.</p>
            <p>I. Directly; <list>
                  <item>1. By holding a Secular Jurisdiction, as the King of <hi>Rome,</hi> where he exerciseth the Supream Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, acknowledging no Superiour Civil Governour; either as to the Legislation or Execution, in all the parts of his own Dominions.</item>
                  <item>2. By his laying claim to many Kingdoms as his own (among which <hi>England</hi> is one, as pretended to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him by King <hi>John</hi>) and supposing that the Kings do hold them as under him, and by his Grant.</item>
                  <item>3. By laying claim to the Temporal or Corporal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of all the world (say some) or of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world (say others): Of which you may see a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Volumes written in the defence of his pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: In particular all those aforesaid were of this subject, which all <hi>Goldastus</hi> his Collected Treatises, for the Right of Princes do confute. I gave you Cardinal <hi>Bertrands</hi> words before.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And though some of their Clergy who live under Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are not willing to resign their Crowns, do disclaim
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59351:8"/>
the <hi>Popes direct Title</hi> to the Universal Civil Soveraignty, yet he himself disclaimeth it not, nor condemneth the Books as such, that have been written to defend it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Jesuits Morals</hi> the last Chapter hath this Title [<hi>That the Jesuits teach, that the Church cannot command spiritual and internal actions; That its Laws and guidance are humane, and that it is it self only a Political Body</hi>] Where the <hi>Jansenist</hi> chargeth them with destroying the Church from its foundation, and making it altogether external, humane and Politick; and that which needeth only Politick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues for its Government, and the exercise of its principal offices, and that they make its Laws but humane and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, which oblige only to things external: and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did the <hi>Novatians, Quod Ecclesiam humanam faciunt</hi>] So that if he accuse them justly, here is no room for any <hi>subterfuge:</hi> It is not the Spiritual and Temporal power that he makes them claim, but the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or External only: But what! doth the <hi>Jansenist</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self therefore disclaim all Temporal Power in the Church, or is he just to Kings? Judge but by <hi>pag.</hi> 388. where he boasteth of <hi>Laymans</hi> Confession of the Truth, that [<hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick power is instituted immediately from God, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power comes immediately from men: And that Civil power regards properly and directly wealth and peace temporal only:</hi>] And he adds [<hi>For the Civil power regards the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward order and Civil tranquility alone; and prescribes none but outward and humane means to attain this end.</hi>] Which is all false, and most injurious to Kings; whom this mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Jansenist</hi> would hereby set as far below every Priest; in real dignity and amiableness to the Subjects as a Humane Creature is below a Divine, and the interest of the body is below that of the soul. Whereas indeed God is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Original of Civil and Church power, though in both <hi>the Persons</hi> are designed by the means of men. And both have God himself for their ultimate end, and the Common Good of the Society for their Common End; which ever consisteth most in spiritual felicity, referring to Eternal. Though the Magistrates weapon be the Sword, and the Pastors only the Word, by which all this is brought to pass.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59351:9"/>Indeed it is not possible that the Papacy in its present State can be defended by any man how moderate soever, without Injury to Princes and States, whose Power the Pope hath so notoriously invaded and usurped: For how can they defend him, that usurpeth the Power of Kings, or usurpeth a false <hi>Power</hi> over Kings, and not be injurious to them that the Usurper injureth?</p>
            <p>But it is most wonderful to me, that when <hi>W. Barclay</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth the right of Monarchs in such a Kingdom as <hi>France</hi> that hath <hi>power and will</hi> to hold fast its own, he should complain as if he undertook a Cause which most were against him in, and in which he expected to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at for his singularity.</p>
            <p>4. By their Inquisition, and by their Decreeing Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Penalties in their Councils, and Decreeing the deposition of Princes, and the giving away their Dominions to others, as in the two fore-cited Councils, <hi>Roman. su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>II. But the more successful Usurpation of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> of Princes is <hi>Indirectly,</hi> and as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> defendeth it, in <hi>ordine ad spiritualia;</hi> By using their Ecclesiastical Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power upon mens Consciences, in such a way as shall overtop the Magistrates power of the Sword: when they decree that all are Hereticks that <hi>believe their senses,</hi> and deny Transubstantiation, and that all such Hereticks shall be banished or burnt; the Clergy is not to do this them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but to deliver them over to the Secular Power: The Pope and Clergy do but charge it on their Consciences in the name of Christ. And if Princes obey them not, or Temporal Lords will not burn or banish all such <hi>Hereticks for believing sense,</hi> the Pope is not to touch their bodies, but to <hi>excommunicate</hi> them. And if they will not <hi>yet obey the Pope,</hi> when they are excommunicate, the Pope, Good man, will not draw a Sword against them, but only use the <hi>Spiritual Sword,</hi> by <hi>giving their Dominions to others,</hi> which is but by <hi>word of mouth;</hi> he doth but declare such a Temporal Lord to be dispossest of his Title, and require
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59351:9"/>
another to take his Lands, and let his great Divines pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish that an Excommunicate King is no King, and that to kill him, is not to kill a King: And if Princes will defend themselves by Arms, the Pope will not send his Clergy in Arms against them, but only by the Spiritual Sword, or Word, command other Princes, States and people to arm themselves against their Emperours, Kings and Governours, and to defend those to whom he hath given their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. How oft these Games have been seriously acted, the <hi>German</hi> Histories lamentably tell us: and <hi>Guicciardine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Italian,</hi> and the <hi>English, French</hi> and others are not wholly silent.</p>
            <p>So if the Clergy be exempt from paying Taxes, from Secular Judgements, if their Lands and Estates be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of Kings, if they set up Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Offices like a Civil Court, if they assume to themselves the sole judgement of Hereticks, and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Apostates, and also of Testaments of the dead, and of Causes of Adultery and Fornication, of lawful or unlawful degrees of Marriage, and of Divorce, if the Pope lay Taxes on the Clergy that are Subjects in all Princes Dominions, if he dispose of Buildings, Tythes, Glebes, Monasteries, Lands, Almshouses, Colledges, and abundance such like; all this is not by the <hi>Sword,</hi> but by perswading Kings and States that they are bound in Conscience to promote all this, and obey the Pope as their Ghostly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herein: And that if they be stricken with the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt of Excommunication, they are in a state of damnation, and if they so dye, are undone for ever: And by perswading other Princes and people, that the Arms taken up against such Princes at the Popes Command (according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Councils) are meritorious, and shall procure their salvation.</p>
            <p>And if Princes and people will believe all this, and will be deceived, and will voluntarily subject themselves to such an Usurper, who can help it? Though it excuse not the Pope, yet they have little reason to complain, that they lose that power which they voluntarily give away, and that the Pope shall exercise that power which they

give him. And so much to your Cause against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
            <p>II. But in your Epistle to Mr. <hi>Areskin</hi> and several others, you lay much of the like charge upon the Reformed Churches, and you take our great Reforming Divines, to have kept up the Mysterie of Iniquity in their Discipline. Concerning which give me leave to deal freely with you, and to tell you, that I am perswaded that your meaning is sincere and good, and that it is an <hi>usurpation</hi> or devised <hi>imitation</hi> of Secular Government by the Clergy which you condemn; and that too great a part of the Protestant Clergy have given you some occasion for these complaints: But that really you deal <hi>not accurately</hi> in the Controversie, and <hi>Accurateness</hi> is the thing you want. You do not here <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly describe</hi> the <hi>true difference</hi> between the several powers where you <hi>seem</hi> to describe them; you leave out much that should be said. It is a more distinct way of handling this point, that must decide the Controversie. To which end I have laid you down an hundred Propositions, on occasion of your former Writings sent me.</p>
            <p>And as you say in <hi>Epist. ad D. Russellum, p.</hi> 248. that in this you would believe one Physicion, one <hi>Coxe, Goddard; Lower, Ridgley, &amp;c.</hi> (Though I have reason to think that the first and last of these are more of my mind about Church Government than of yours) before a thousand <hi>Augustines, Hieroms, Gregories,</hi> yea, <hi>Jewells, Davenant, Ushers, Dallees;</hi> so my opinion is, that usually all men are <hi>wisest</hi> in their own Profession. And though I am natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly somewhat unapt to take more than needs I must up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trust from any (since I have had great experience of humane ignorance and vanity) yet I had rather take a Physicions judgement in Physick, and a Lawyers in points of Law, and a Souldiers in Military matters, and a Divines in Theology, than any of their judgements about the matters of an aliene Profession. Not but that now and then a man may arise, that shall know more on the by, than others that make it the study of their lives: But that is not usual. And <hi>that one man</hi> would have been <hi>yet wiser,</hi> in those things if he had been of that Profession.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59351:10"/>
For surely <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> he that bestoweth twenty years, or thirty, or forty, or threescore in the Study of Divinity alone, with its subservient helps, is liker to understand it, than he that alloweth it, but now and then a spare hour, in the midst of other diverting Studies. For my part, if I follow not one thing only when I am upon it, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide my thoughts among things heterogeneal, I cannot pierce deep into any great difficulties, nor make any thing of distracted Studies; <hi>neque quicquam recte fit, quod fit praeoccupato animo.</hi> God doth not use to give wisdom now by the way of Miracles; but <hi>they that seek</hi> most, are likest to <hi>find.</hi> And therefore pardon me for telling you, that though I am deservedly a great honourer of the Physicions you name, yet I set more by the Judgement of one <hi>Usher,</hi> one <hi>Davenant,</hi> one <hi>Jewell,</hi> one <hi>Dallaeus,</hi> one <hi>Blondel,</hi> one <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,</hi> one <hi>Le Blank,</hi> one <hi>Petrus Molinaeus</hi> in matters of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, than of abundance of Lawyers and Physicions. And of one Lawyer and Physicion in matters of their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than of many Divines. Being still of <hi>Pembles</hi> mind, that one clear eye can see further than a Council of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind ones.</p>
            <p>And as to the matter of <hi>Partiality</hi> of which you suspect Divines, it is not without cause as to all <hi>that party</hi> who seek for <hi>Riches, Ease and Honours, or Domination and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments and Preheminency in the world:</hi> But such as that St. <hi>Martin</hi> whom you mention out of <hi>Severus,</hi> who so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently opposed the <hi>Ithacian</hi> Violence, <note n="*" place="margin">You are mistaken when you twi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

And he is like to be most a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who doth sincerely give up himself to the closest study of it all his dayes. Deny this, and your suspicions will fall upon Christianity it self.</p>
            <p>But yet I will allow you to be moderately suspicious
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59351:11"/>
where you see that there is any <hi>great bait of carnal interest</hi> to tempt men: A <hi>Popedome,</hi> a <hi>Cardinalship,</hi> (I must name no more) may make the <hi>Roman</hi> Heathen say, I will turn Christian, if you will make me Bishop of <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> But will you suspect that a good man, yea, and all such good men, should be <hi>Partial</hi> where they put themselves on the greatest <hi>self-denyal?</hi> Where they have no profit, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment, no man-pleasing, no worldly honour to invite them? Yea, where it is like to diminish their gain, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from preferment, to make them hated by most on whom their discipline is exercised? If a <hi>few</hi> out of a pang of Factious or Phanatick zeal, may cast themselves on such a self-denying life, it is not like that this will be the <hi>ordinary</hi> Case, of Learned, sober, godly men. If it be, with whom shall the ignorant trust the conduct of their souls, that will not make merchandize of them? <hi>Would you</hi> be partial and false to the Truth of Christ <hi>your self,</hi> if you were the Pastor of a Church? Is the Office so malignant to infect all that undertake it? If it be, how can our Religion be good? If not, why should you think that <hi>others</hi> will not be as just and impartial as <hi>you</hi> would be? Do you consider what excellent persons in all respects for Wisdom, and Piety, and Integrity, were <hi>Melanchthon, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choltzer, Sohnius, Kimedontius, Olevian, Ursinus, Zanchius, Paraeus,</hi> and those English men you named, and many hundreds more; who more unlikely through Ignorance or partiality to betray the truth?</p>
            <p>But they say, that <hi>Interest will not lye.</hi> Do you not know that an able Preacher, may better by many degrees consult his own <hi>Ease,</hi> his <hi>Profit,</hi> and his <hi>worldly honours</hi> by <hi>Preaching</hi> only, than by this troublesome ungrateful work of Discipline? I am confident that you and I do take one another for true plain dealing honest men, and therefore can believe each other. And if you will believe me, I did, in my Pastoral Charge (in those times when I was thought tolerable in the Sacred Office) for about ten years (of the twenty that I had leave to preach) exercise some Discipline upon some particular offendors, according to the common judgement of Protestant Divines; And it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59351:11"/>
was so much to my <hi>labour,</hi> to my expence of time, to the grievous displeasure of those that fell under it, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so much self-denyal, that when I consulted with flesh and blood, if I might but have forborn it, and only preached, and given the Sacraments to all that came, I should have thought my self so greatly disburdened, as would have made my life to be sensually pleasant: so that, though I had not any maintenance of my own, I think I could gladly have given up all that I received for my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and made what other shift I could for food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so I might but have been freed from the trouble of this particular Discipline: I speak only what it was to flesh and blood, and not what it was to faith, which saith God cannot be served too dearly. Till I speak this to one that hath tryed the thing I talk of, I shall take it for granted, that my words are not half understood.</p>
            <p>If you say, Why then did you not forbear a work so ungrateful? I now only answer, Why doth not the Judge and Sheriff forbear hanging Murderers and Thieves: The rest of my Answer you shall have anon.</p>
            <p>Though my following Propositions seem full enough in opening the difference between the two Powers; yet I will here also briefly tell you, 1. <hi>Somewhat of the nature of Church Power:</hi> 2. <hi>Somewhat of the certain Truth</hi> that Jesus Christ did institute it: 3. Somewhat of the Necessity of it <hi>sub ratione m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dii ad finem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. For the first, take these few things together, and you may clearly see what power we claim.</p>
            <p>1. Our Office for the <hi>Original</hi> of it, is as immediately from Christ as that of Magistrates, and is not made by Kings or any Monarchs. Therefore we hold it as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Christ.</p>
            <p>2. For the Matter of it, it is only to expound and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Word of God, both commonly in Sermons, and particularly to each mans several<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Case, as Physicions look to the Cure of individuals: And also to exercise the Keys of the Church or Kingdom of Christ; that is, 1. To be the ordinary Judges who is to be taken in by Baptism; 2. And also who is to be publickly admonished as scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59351:12"/>
in our particular Charge: 3. And also who is to be absolved as penitent: 4. And who is to be declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet for Church-communion, as obstinately impenitent, and to be forbidden Communion with the Church, and the Church with him, and consequently denyed the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church, and signs of Communion in the Lords Supper, which it belongeth to the Pastor to deliver only to the capable, and by the peoples familiarity and brotherly Society, which they are obliged to deny them. And this Sentence of the Pastor, if it should proceed on mistake, doth not make the mans Case the worse before God; but yet (till the Church have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought its due reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against mistaking Pastors) it remaineth so far valid, as that none against it may obtrude himself on the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that Church. For, I pray you tell me, if <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Zen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> mistake in their judgement of a Disciple whom they refuse, or any Free Schoolmaster in judging of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of a Scholar, shall others so misjudged intrude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Schools, and make themselves their Scholars against their wills? Or shall he whom by mis-information you refuse or reject from your family or service, become your houshold servant in despight of you?</p>
            <p>3. And as to the Instruments and manner of exercising our Office, we professedly disclaim all pretensions to any power of the Sword, or of corporal penalty, that is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active or coercive. You confess this once your self. We claim no power but by the <hi>Word,</hi> either generally preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or particularly applyed to the case of those that are of our charge. No other power of <hi>Excommunication</hi> do we claim: If men will despise our Ministerial instructions, reproofs and censures, we have done with them. Shall they force themselves into our familiarity or communion in spight of us? Your <hi>Epist.</hi> 54. <hi>ad Mettagerium</hi> openeth the matter so fairly, that we little differ from it. If you say that Presbyterians and Episcopal set up Courts, Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, with Officers like Civil Courts: I answer, 1. The more pomp and likeness to the Magistrates coercive way, the worse I like it. 2. But how shall men be heard, if they be not cited? How shall such things be Justly and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59351:12"/>
transacted, if there be not a known <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> and if Accusers and Witnesses be not summoned? Are not such regular proceedings necessary even in Cases of meer arbitration? If this be all, here is no more Sword, no more force, than in a Pulpit. And how doth Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (that is, declaring an Impenitent person unfit for Church Communion by Christs Laws, and binding him over to the great day) I say how doth this touch mens bodies or estates, or work any otherwise than a Pulpit-Sermon on the consciencious Volunteers? 3. And if horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Writs <hi>de Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi> or imprisonment, or burning men as Hereticks follow this, all this is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates own doing? If it be <hi>well,</hi> praise him for it. If it be ill, blame him for it. If Rulers <hi>will</hi> make such Laws, and if they <hi>will</hi> so far be Executioners of the Clergies De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, who can hinder them? If it be against <hi>their right,</hi> it is their <hi>own act,</hi> who give so much of their right away. If you say, that Clergy men are too blame that urge them to it; you shall not easily think worse of their so doing, than I do: It is greatly against our wills that the Sword so closely followeth Excommunication. I think it is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Carnal Clergy mens base conceit of their own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Office, as if it were a Leaden unpowerful Sword which Christ hath put into their hands, and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation were invalid, when the Sword forceth not the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent to dissemble Repentance and Submission. When great worldly baits have enticed worldly men into the Sacred Office, as to a worldly preferment and Trade, they will judge accordingly and manage it like themselves (which is and hath been the Churches Pest) We would beg on our knees of Kings and Magistrates, if it would prevail, to leave Church Censures to our Lords intended use; and <hi>valeant quantum valere possunt;</hi> and to keep their Sword out of Church-mens hands, and to punish men in their own Courts for every crime that deserveth it; but not <hi>quatenus excommunicate,</hi> or meerly because the Clergy hath judged them unmeet for Church Communion. He that taketh Excommunication alone for no punishment, is not fit to be in the Communion of the Church, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59351:13"/>
therefore should not be driven for fear of a Prison to that which he hath no right to. So that you must not charge the acts of Princes, nor of ambitious Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither on <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> or any such as them.</p>
            <p>And as to <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> or <hi>Lay-Chancellors,</hi> I am no more for them than you are; that is, as the Magistrates Officers, or as the Churches Sub-Officers <hi>circa sacra &amp; non in sacris:</hi> But sure those of them who <hi>are</hi> introduced on a <hi>mistaken</hi> conceit of <hi>Divine right,</hi> and do no more than the Pastors do, are no Usurpers of <hi>Coercive</hi> power.</p>
            <p>You see by the late Acts of King and Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that all <hi>External Church power</hi> is declared to be in the King: And what would you have more? No doubt the meaning is not, <hi>All power about external things:</hi> For the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper, and the persons baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are external objects: Nor can it be all power that is exercised by the external parts of the body. For the Tongue of the Preacher, and the Hand of the Baptizer, as well as the Ear of the Hearer is an <hi>external part.</hi> But in these two senses it is true, and commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to, by all that I remember of my acquaintance that are Christians. 1. That all the power of the <hi>Sword,</hi> or of forcing by Mulcts or bodily punishments, as distinct from the power of the Word, that worketh directly upon the soul alone (by the senses) is in the King, and not in any of the Clergy, though it be about the matters of Religion. 2. And that all power in Church matters and Religion. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal to the Pastoral Office</hi> as instituted by Christ, is of right the Kings, and his inferiour Magistrates. And what would you or any man have more?</p>
            <p>4. And as to the exercise of our Office, we all confess (except the Papists) that we are responsible to the King and Magistrates, for our faults, yea for our injurious mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>administration. And that though the King be not the Chief Pastor, nor hath the power of the Keys which Christ gave to his Ministers, yet he is the Ruler of all Churches and Pastors by the Sword, as well as of all Physicions. And is not all this enough to satisfie you, that we claim no part of the Magistrates Office?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59351:13"/>As you say, our power is but <hi>Perswasive.</hi> It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>By the Word;</hi> It is but on the <hi>Conscience;</hi> It is under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates coercive Government: And so it is like a Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or a Tutors in a Colledge. But that I pray you leave not out 1. That it is not under the Magistrates, as to the <hi>derivation of the office or power,</hi> that is, <hi>It is no office which the Magistrate made or may unmake:</hi> 2. That it is as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately of Divine Institution as the Magistrates. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in your similitude you must suppose your Physicion and Tutor to have a Commission from God. 3. That God hath <hi>described our office, and limited the Magistrates office,</hi> so that he hath no power from God to <hi>hinder the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</hi> 4. But if he do it injuriously we must not resist, but patiently suffer for obeying God. So much of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the office.</p>
            <p>II. Now that it is certain that God hath committed to Pastors, such a Government of his Church by the Word, as to stated commissioned Officers, because I have past by the proofs in my following Propositions, I will add some here. Supposing what Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath said of the Power of the Keyes, and that no man with common sense can take the Power of the Keyes, for any thing less than a power of Church Government, or Authoritative Guidance, and so a Power of receiving in and putting out as there is cause; It is plain in that Christ first reciteth his own Commission and Power, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. and thence dateth the Commission of his Apostles, as it was to endure to the end of the age or world.</p>
            <p>See <hi>Isa</hi> 22. 22. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 7. &amp; 1. 18. compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 20. 23. The word <hi>Presbyter</hi> and Bishop can signifie no less: as <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 2, 4, 6, 22, 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. 17, 28. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. <hi>James</hi> 5. 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And nothing less can be meant by 1 Tim. 5. 17. <hi>The El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that Rule well are worthy of double honour, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 13. 17. 24. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, for they watch, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 12, 13. <hi>Know them that labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 1, 4, 5. <hi>If a man desire the office of a Bishop, he desireth</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59351:14"/>
               <hi>a good work—One that Ruleth well his own house, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his children in subjection.—For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the Church of God.</hi> So <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. Many other I pass by.</p>
            <p>And for the act of <hi>excommunication,</hi> or <hi>excluding</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet persons from <hi>Christian Church Communion,</hi> it would be tedious to stand to <hi>vindicate</hi> all those plain Texts from any mens exceptions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>per totum. Titus</hi> 3. 10. 2 <hi>John</hi> 10, 11. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 6, 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 20.</p>
            <p>But while I am writing this, I remember that I have long ago written a small Book called <hi>Universal Concord,</hi> in which I have described all the <hi>Pastoral Office</hi> and <hi>Work:</hi> If you can prove it less than I have there named in any one point, you will so far ease us, and take nothing from us at all that gratifieth our flesh: If you can deny none of that, we are agreed. And in the Preface to the same Book I have given you twelve Reasons of the great use of Church Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; which shall save me the labour of the third point which I intended next to speak to; save only that I will briefly ask you,</p>
            <p>III. Would you have any difference made between the Christian Church and the Pagan and Infidel world? If not—If you would, it must be such a difference as Christ hath appointed us to make? And doth our Baptismal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant contain no promise and profession of godliness and obedience, as well as of Belief; and so of Repentance and a better life?</p>
            <p>2. Who would you have to be Judge in this matter? Shall every one be Judge himself? Then all Pagans, Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Blasphemers may come in and turn Religion and the Church into a scorn. If <hi>any</hi> must <hi>judge,</hi> you would not sure set the <hi>Magistrates</hi> or <hi>people</hi> such a task (on pain of damnation) to leave their Calling, to try and judge of the qualifications of expectants or Church-members.</p>
            <p>3. Whom do you think <hi>Christ</hi> committed this business to? Who were the Judges of the Capacity of persons to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, or the desert of persons to be rejected? <hi>Diotrophes</hi> could not have rejected Christians injuriously, if he had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59351:14"/>
not then had some Governing power.</p>
            <p>4. Hath not all Christs Church exercised such a Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline as I have described since the Apostles days till now? (saving the corruption of it by ill additions, or carnal neglects) And hath all this Church been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under a false Government in the main? Or is not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> a righter way than <hi>extirpation,</hi> of <hi>Discipline</hi> as well as of <hi>Doctrine and Worship?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Is it not <hi>the wickedness</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> that is the chief hardening of <hi>Turks</hi> and other Infidels against Christianity? And would they not encrease this pollution that would have the most vicious to be equally received with the best?</p>
            <p>6. Is not <hi>Faith</hi> for <hi>Holiness,</hi> and did not Christ come to purifie a peculiar people, and restore us to the Image of God? And if for want of Discipline Saints and Swine be equally Church-members, and partakers of holy things, is that agreeable to this design of our Redeemer?</p>
            <p>7. If Oeconomical Government and School Government and Colledge Government be no wrong to Kings, neither is the Church Government which Christ hath instituted.</p>
            <p>I do not say all this to intimate that <hi>you say the contrary.</hi> But because your Charge on <hi>Luther, Calvin</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants sheweth that you do sure mistake them: And to tell you that I joyn with you in disowning the KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM and Magistracy of the Mock-Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and of all that will imitate them; But that I take the <hi>Enmity to</hi> and <hi>grosse neglect of true Church-Discipline,</hi> to be one of Satans principal services that is done him upon earth, against true Godliness.</p>

            <opener>To my very Learned, sincere and worthy Friend <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus Molinaeus</hi> Dr. of Physick (The Author of many Treatises on this subject.)
<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>PON the perusal of your Writings which you sent me, the love of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> doth command me to tell you as followeth;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I make no question, but that the Pride of the Clergy (with their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness) hath for above twelve hundred years been a greater plague to the Churches throughout the Christian world, than all the cruelties of the Laity: And that the sensless forgetting the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of Christs decision of his Apostles Controversie, <hi>Which of them should be the greatest,</hi> hath divided the East and West, and corrupted and kept down Religion; whilest that the lives of the Prelates have perswaded the observers, that they still took it for a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59351:15"/>
more important Question, <hi>Which of them should be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est?</hi> than, <hi>Whether they or their people should be saved.</hi> And it hath ever been a matter of easie remarque, that there have been seldom any dangerous <hi>Schisms</hi> on one side, or any cruel <hi>Persecutions</hi> on the other side, which the Clergy have not been the principal causes of: And that the Laity would be more quiet, if the Clergy did not delude them, or exasperate them; And that even the more mistaken and violent sort of Magistrates, would have some moderation in their Persecutions, if the Clergy did not make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a burning killing Zeal is the mark of a good Christian, and is the same that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. is called a <hi>zeal of good works;</hi> and that to destroy the bodies of men truly fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, is the way to save their own souls, or their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions at least; when indeed, the zeal of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, is a <hi>zealous Love to one another,</hi> and a <hi>zealous doing good to others,</hi> and the <hi>Devilish zeal</hi> (as St. <hi>James</hi> distinguisheth it, <hi>James</hi> 2. 15, 16, 17.) is an envious, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, hurting zeal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That in all this the Laity are not innocent, but must thank themselves for the evil that befalleth them; and that on two notable accounts: 1. Because <hi>they</hi> have ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the <hi>choosing</hi> of the <hi>dignified</hi> and <hi>beneficed</hi> Churchmen, and they have but such as they choose themselves: They think it is their <hi>wisdom</hi> as well as <hi>piety,</hi> to make the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Profit</hi> so <hi>great,</hi> as shall be a <hi>very strong bait</hi> to <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Covetousness:</hi> And when they have so done, the <hi>Proudest</hi> and most <hi>Covetous</hi> will certainly be the <hi>Seekers;</hi> and that with as much craft and diligence, as an ambitious mind can use their parts to: And he that <hi>seeketh</hi> (by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and friends) is likest to find: And the more humble and heavenly any one is, and consequently most honest, and fit to be a Pastor of the Church, the further he will be from the <hi>Seekers</hi> way! So that except it be where the world hath Rulers so wise and strangely pious, as to seek out the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy who seek not for themselves, its easie to prognosticate what kind of Pastors the Church will have: And verily they that choose them, are the unfittest to complain of them. Whereas if the Churches <hi>maintenance</hi> were such,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59351:16"/>
as might but <hi>prevent the discouragements</hi> of such as seek the Ministry for the <hi>works sake</hi> and for the <hi>love of souls,</hi> that so Students might not make it a Trade for wealth, but a <hi>self-denying dedication</hi> of themselves to God, the Churches would be accordingly provided; And they that <hi>intend the saving of souls,</hi> would be the Candidates, (by their own and their Parents dedication) as now they that <hi>intend a Trade to live and serve the flesh by</hi> (in an <hi>honourable</hi> way) are too great a part of them. Or men might be <hi>further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded ex post facto</hi> for their <hi>Merits,</hi> without being tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>study principally</hi> for that reward. And if we will needs <hi>have carnal men,</hi> let us not wonder if they <hi>live car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</hi> And if the <hi>carnal mind be enmity to God, and neither is nor can be subject to his Law,</hi> Rom. 8. 6, 7. we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily prognosticate how <hi>Christs enemies</hi> will do <hi>his work,</hi> and guide his Church, and whether <hi>their wills and wayes</hi> will be such as the conscionable can conform to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And the Laity are unexcusable, because it is they (in all those Countreys where <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Church-tyranny</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth) who put their Sword into the Clergies hands, and give away their own authority, and set up men to vie with them, and to overtop them: of which more anon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I grant you also, that in all such Countreys as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said (where <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Church-tyranny</hi> prevaileth) the name of <hi>Ecclesiastical Courts and Discipline,</hi> is applyed to that mungrel power, which is neither Fish nor Flesh; and that the true <hi>Spiritual Power</hi> set up by Christ, is corrupted and turned into a secular thing, or by confusion, a third sort arisen out of both. And that Popish Princes are woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abused by this deceit: while that the reverence of the name of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Church-Government,</hi> doth perswade them to ruine the Church indeed, and to set up their Subjects to be the Governours of themselves, and to give away their own power to their servants, and then to stoop to the power which they have given.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And I grant you, that all this mischief would much be cured, if Magistrates would keep the Sword to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and use it only according to the judgement of their proper Courts; and would leave the Power of the Church
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59351:16"/>
Keyes to the Pastors, <hi>&amp; valeant quantum valere possunt;</hi> and let it be thought penalty enough for an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate person <hi>qua talis</hi> to be excommunicate: And not to take him to be a penitent, or worthy of the Communion of the Church, that had rather be there than in a Gaol. There be wiser wayes of bringing men to Repentance and to the Communion of the Church, than by saying [Choose this or the Goal: You are worthy to be in the Church, if you had but rather be in it than in a Prison.] Christ said, [<hi>Forsake all, or ye cannot be my Disciples;</hi>] And some say, [Be Christs Disciples, or forsake all: The Church will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, if you will but accept her communion rather than imprisonment or beggary.] A kind Church indeed! of which more anon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But notwithstanding all these concessions, I must fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell you, that it is the Pastors of the Churches that must keep up the interest of Christianity in the world; and that as the bad ones are the greatest plagues, so the good ones are the greatest blessings of the earth; even the salt and lights of the world: And none but the enemies of Christ are their enemies, (as such.) And as the Ministry hath grown better or worse, so hath Christianity either risen or fallen, in all times and places of the Church on earth. (Of which see Two Sheets which I have written for the Ministery, against the <hi>Seekers</hi> and <hi>Malignants</hi> long ago.)</p>
            <p n="6">6. And though the Carnal Clergy afore described, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all the invectives in your Books, and their Usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and turning Church Discipline into a secular thing, do call aloud for a just detection and rebuke, and it would be the happiness of the world, if the eyes of all Christian Princes and Rulers, were opened in this point; yet I must tell you, that I believe most sober, pious Protestant Divines are really agreed in the main things that you desire and intend; And that both <hi>you</hi> and some of <hi>your adversaries both do amiss,</hi> to make the difference <hi>seem wider</hi> than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is: And that making <hi>Verbal</hi> differences seem <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>small</hi> ones seem <hi>great,</hi> is an ill employment; when a <hi>few distinctions</hi> and <hi>clearer explications,</hi> would make both
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59351:17"/>
sides see, that they are <hi>almost of one mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all that I shall do in this business is, to lay down my own judgement, and I think the judgement of all the pious and sober part, of the <hi>Episcopal, Presbyterian, Independents</hi> and <hi>Erastians</hi> (or <hi>Politicians</hi>) in certain brief Propositions, which shall carry their own evidence past all contradiction of Learned and Considerate Christians.</p>

               <p n="8">8.

               <p n="11">11. Christ made these Officers the <hi>Key-bearers</hi> of his Churches, that is, the Rulers or Guides, who have authority under him over Church communion, to judge what mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers shall be taken in, and who shall be put out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17, 24. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The first and great act of this Key-bearing power (never denyed them from Christs time to this day) is the power of <hi>Baptizing</hi> and of <hi>judging who</hi> shall be admitted by Baptism into the Church or number of visible Christians, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. 12, 13, 38.</p>

                  </gap>se; and must do that which most of them are unfit to do: And Christ hath put all out of doubt, by putting the Keys into the Pastors hands, and commanding their study and attending to this work, and calling them the Rulers, Guides, Pastors, Fathers, Stewards, Overseers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and commanding the people to obey them with submission; and telling (not the people or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates) but the Pastors of the great and dreadful account that they must give, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 45, 46, 47. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="20">20. He that will lay this work upon people or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, is their cruel enemy; and brings on them a most heavy burden, and consequently makes it their duty to <hi>prepare</hi> and <hi>study for it,</hi> and to avoid all <hi>other business</hi> that hindereth it, and would lay them under the terrors of a most tremendous reckoning unto God.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Seeing it is a trust that <hi>must</hi> be committed to <hi>some</hi> or <hi>other,</hi> common reason tells us, that it is better in their hands that Christ hath put it in by Office, and who spend their lives in preparation for it, than in theirs that neither have the preparations nor the Office, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 2.</p>
               <p n="22">22. It is the great end of Christs coming into the world to destroy the works of the Devil, and to purifie to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works, and to save his people from their sins, and to vindicate the Holiness of God: And the world is so apt to judge of Christs doctrine by his followers, that the Holiness and Concord of Christians is one of Christs great appointed means, for his own and his Fathers glory in the world: That as Gods <hi>greatness</hi> shineth forth in the frame of <hi>nature,</hi> so might his <hi>Holiness</hi> in the

               <p n="23">23. Travellers well know, that the great hinderance of the Conversion of Infidels and Heathens, Turks, Persians, Indians, Tartarians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the wicked lives of the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christians that are next them; when they see that Christians are more false, and cruel, and drunken, and beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and divided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than themselves.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Those therefore that would have the Church lye common (without Christs Discipline) to all the most prophane and wicked that will come in, and have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with it, are indeed Antichristian, even open enemies to the Church, to holiness, and to the saving of the Infidel and Heathen world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6, 11, 12, 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p n="25">25. The Devil hath fought in all Ages as subtilly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently against the holy Discipline of Christ, as against the Christian Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="26">26. True Discipline doth so wonderfully displease the guilty, and lose mens love, and especially the Richer sort, and all mens carnal interest and nature inclineth them so much to man-pleasing and flattery, that Ministers have abundance more need to be <hi>driven</hi> to the exercise of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, than <hi>restrained</hi> from it; except it be the corrupt and carnal Discipline which the Popish and tyrannizing Clergy do exercise, where the Magistrate himself upholdeth them in Grandure, and lendeth them his Sword. Let Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be but such as Christ appointed, and stand of it self, and then it is but few that will have any more cause, to be restrained from it, than from too much preaching: Though still I yield, that there must be limits for the wilful and the indiscr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>7. By this means the Church is mostly constituted, in such Countreys, of the grossest wicked hypocrites: And it is made a scorn to Infidels and Heathens, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version hindered thereby, when they see that Christians are worse than they.</item>
                  <item>8. And by this means these hypocrites ruine the Church it self (as an enemies Souldiers in an Army): And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Christians and Pastors, that are heartily enemies to Christ, do him more wrong, and cause more divisions and ruines in the Church, than they could have done, if they had staid without.</item>
                  <item>9. It destroyeth most of the hopes or the success of <hi>those Pastors,</hi> as to the converting and saving of mens souls: Because when the Magistrate is made but <hi>their</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner, the people take all their sufferings as <hi>from them:</hi> And they will bear that from a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> which they will not bear from a <hi>Minister,</hi> whose Office is to Rule them by <hi>Reason and by Love:</hi> And so such Pastors are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>feared</hi> and <hi>hated</hi> by the people, whereby they are disabled to do them that saving good, which can be done on none against his will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. &amp; 9. 22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16.</item>

The King and Magistrates have <hi>curam animarum,</hi> though not in the same sense as the Pastors have: They have the charge of Government, not only in order to the <hi>corporal</hi> case, and peace and prosperity of their subjects, but also in order to mens holy, sober and righteous living, and to the saving of mens souls. And their <hi>Calling</hi> must be <hi>sanctified,</hi> by doing all in it to these high and holy ends, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="71">71. Yet have they a power which <hi>we must submit to</hi> as <hi>from God,</hi> even when it is <hi>used</hi> by accident against him, in some points of his will and interest; so be it that we obey it not in doing any <hi>sin</hi> our selves.</p>
               <p n="72">72. They that make Kings and Magistrates to have no charge of Religion, (but only as the Clergies judgement leads them,) but only to preserve mens bodily power; and say that the <hi>Church</hi> hath the care of mens <hi>souls and Religion,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> only of the <hi>Body</hi> and our <hi>outward wealth,</hi> do debase the Magistrate as far below the Minister, as the body is below the soul; and teach the people to esteem, love and honour the Minister as much above the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, as the <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> are better than the <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>earth:</hi> And they make the difference so great, as that the <hi>holier</hi> any of the people are, the more they must prefer their Minister before their King: which is a Popish and most unsufferable debasing of the highest Officers of God.</p>
               <p n="73">73. The same points of Religion, the same sin and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, come under the judgement of the Magistrate and the Pastors; though to several ends. The Magistrate is the Judge of Heresie, and the Pastors are the Judges of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: The Magistrate is the Judge of Murder, Adultery and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59351:25"/>
Theft, and so is the Pastor: That is, the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is <hi>Judge, who is to be corporally punished for Heresie and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. And the <hi>Pastors</hi> are <hi>Judges, who is to be excommunicated as Impenitent in such guilt,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="74">74. Yet there are some faults, and some sorts of inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into faults, which the Magistrates may prudently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the Pastors from medling with, for the safety of the publick peace: especially when they would indirectly make themselves Judges of mens Titles and Estates; or in controverted cases, where the Magistrate must first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, and the Pastors only follow, if the Pastors will be the first deciders, and prevent the Magistrate and assume his work, or otherwise wrong the publick peace, or private right, they are to be restrained.</p>
               <p n="75">75. The Magistrate hath all the Coactive Government, over Ministers as well as over any others of his Subjects: And to exempt the Clergy from his subjection without his consent, as traiterous. (And if he <hi>will consent,</hi> he may thank himself.)</p>
               <p n="76">76. Magistrates may (by moderate penalties) drive on negligent Pastors to their duty, and restrain them from mischieving the Church, and punish them for notorious pernicious mal-administration: As <hi>Solomon</hi> deposed <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ather,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="77">77. But they must not on this pretence invade any part of the Pastors Office; as to ordain, degrade, baptize, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate ecclesiastically, nor impose on the Pastors any of the circumstantials, which it is their own Office to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of.</p>
               <p n="78">78. Pastors must obey the Magistrates in all Lawful things, which belong to his Office to command.</p>
               <p n="79">79. Many things are sinfully commanded (because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out necessity or cause, or because to ill ends, or with ill cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in the Commander) which yet it is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects duty to obey in: Because one Law may be for a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and another for a Subject, and their duties various.</p>

               <p n="82">82. Magistrates may make Laws for the Church in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstancials <hi>circa sacra,</hi> which belong to their proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: And also to enforce obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, as far as prudence shall justly direct them: of this see <hi>Grotius de Imp. sum. pot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="83">83.

               </p>
               <p n="84">84. In a time when Blasphemy, or Heresie, or Sedition prevaileth, the Magistrate may name certain Blasphemies, Heresies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he may forbid his Subjects to preach up.</p>
               <p n="85">85. And he may restrain all utterly unable persons, or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical false Teachers, or any that notoriously do more harm than good, from the liberty of preaching in his Dominions, till they are proved fitter; that is, from abusing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel and mens souls.</p>
               <p n="86">86. But if on this pretence he should forbid Christs faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful able Ministers, to preach the Christian faith, and call men to repentance, and save mens souls, (when there are not enow more, especially to do that work, as proportioned to the number and necessity of souls) it would be a sin so heinous against Christ, and against the souls of men, as I think it not meet now to aggravate or express, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="87">87. If faithful Ministers break good Laws, they must be punished as other Subjects, in Purse, or Body, or Name, so as may least hinder them in the work of Christ.</p>
               <p n="88">88. They that silence faithful able Pastors, for such faults as may be otherwise punished, do grievously punish the <hi>faultless people</hi> (even in their souls) for the fault of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

As if a man that hath a family of an hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, were forbidden to give them bread to save their lives, because he was drunk, or swore an Oath, which might be punished on himself alone.</p>
               <p n="89">89. The Magistrate may <hi>excommunicate in his way,</hi> as well as the <hi>Pastors do in theirs.</hi> That is, the Magistrate may as a penalty for a crime, lay Subjects under a note of infamy, and Outlaw them, and command all men to avoid famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with them; (And this as <hi>bad Subjects,</hi> whether they be Church-members or not.) And he may as a <hi>Keeper</hi> of the Churches Priviledges and Peace (till forfeited) restrain all excommunicate persons from forcing themselves into the Communion of the Church which did excommunicate them.</p>
               <p n="90">90. So contentious are Pastors oft times, and so necessary is the Magistrates Office to the publick peace, that every Church should be under the eye of some Justices of the Peace, or Censors appointed by force to silence intruding Bawlers and Railers, and to restrain Ministers from making it their publick work, unpeaceably to traduce and revile their Brethren, and represent dissenters as odious to the flock. And if such Magistrates had kept the Churches <hi>Order and Peace</hi> according to <hi>their Office,</hi> it had prevented abundance of the Papal Usurpations, which were the fruit of Magistrates neglects.</p>
               <p n="91">91. <hi>Lay Chancellors</hi> exercising the <hi>Spiritual Power</hi> of the <hi>Keyes</hi> (though they should <hi>pro forma</hi> use the stale of an <hi>Ordinaries pronunciation</hi>) is such a sort of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I will never swear that in my place and Calling I will not at any time endeavour to alter by lawful means.</p>
               <p n="92">92. The Parents are put in the fourth Commandment, rather than the Magistrate or Pastor, because their authority is the most plenary Image of the Divine Authority in these respects. 1. Their Authority is not by Contract, but by Nature. 2. It is the primary radical power. 3. It is most universally necessary to mankind. 4. And it <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth Gods Government.</hi> 1. In that it is founded in <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as Gods in <hi>Creation.</hi> 2.

The Magistrate bids you pray by one form, the Bishop by another, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents by a third or none.

No contrary commands of <hi>Church-men</hi> (as they are called); nor any of our <hi>own Vows</hi> or <hi>Covenants,</hi> can excuse us from obedience to the Higher Powers, in lawful things, which God hath authorized them to command; that is, which are belonging to their place of Government to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.

               </lg>
               <p>(though indeed he might as well have named more.) As <hi>Tyranny</hi> is in the greatest part of the whole world, (which is Heathen, Infidel and Popish) the principal sin, which hindereth the Gospel and Kingdom of Christ, forbiddeth the preaching of the Word of life for mens salvation (And therefore a sin which no Christian Magistrate or Preacher, should think of, but with great abhorrence, and none by any palliation should befriend it); so <hi>Prudent</hi> and <hi>Good Princes</hi> are under God the Pillars of the world; For they are the Chief Officers of God, to shew forth his <hi>Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> Truth and Holiness, Justice and Mercy, in their Government; And by <hi>their Laws</hi> to promote the obedience of <hi>his Laws;</hi> And to encourage the Preachers and Practicers of Godliness, Sobriety and Righteousness; And to defend them against the Malignity of those that would silence, oppress and persecute them on earth; And by their examples and punishments, to bring all <hi>ungodliness, intemperance</hi> and <hi>injustice</hi> unto shame. None therefore that possess so great a mercy, should undervalue it, or be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful.</p>
               <p n="96">96. Wise Rulers will watch the Plots of such enemies, as would use them as the Devil would have used Christ, who carried him to the Pinnacle of the Temple, in hope to have seen his fall the greater: who would have them with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> arrogate the praise of God unto themselves, or with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> or <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to disdain to be under the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of their Maker? and ascribe to them the Divine

Prerogatives; And would make it seem their honour to have <hi>Power</hi> to do the greatest mischief; that the pretence and claim may make them odious, and so may debilitate and undermine them. That like a draught of cold water to one in a Pleurisie, they may kill them by pleasing them.</p>
               <p n="97">97. It is an unchristian carnal craft for the Protestant Clergy of several Opinions, to lay false charges on one another, as being enemies to the Civil Government, when really their principles therein are all the same; Or to make the differences of Statesmen and Lawyers, to be taken for differences in Religion: purposely to make one another (and their Religion) odious, and to strengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by the errors and passions of Princes; till at last they have tempted the world to think as bad of all and of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it self, as they have said of one another, and by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining others fall themselves.</p>
               <p n="98">98. But yet that Party who really make a Religion of the Doctrine of Rebellion, are to be disowned by all that will be true to God and to his Officers: In my Sermon to the Parliament the day before they Voted the Restoration of the King, I said somewhat of the difference of the Protestant and Popish Religion, in this point. And a Papist Gentleman first wrote an Invective against me, as if I had given no proof of what I said; And several persons of unknown names wrote Letters to me to urge and challenge me to prove it: Blindly or wilfully overlooking the undeniable proof which I had there laid down, from one of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Decrees of approved General Councils are the Papists Religion: The Decrees of approved General Councils are for the Popes deposing Temporal Lords, if they exterminate not such as deny Transubstantiation, and giving their Dominions to others:</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Popish Religion is for the Popes deposing Temporal Lords in that case, and giving their Dominions to others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Major is not questioned. The Minor, (besides the <hi>Concil. Rom. sub Greg.</hi> 7. which determineth that the Pope may depose Emperours) I there proved from the express words of <hi>Concil. Lateran. sub Innoc.</hi> 3. <hi>Can.</hi> 3. which ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth

            </head>
            <p>LEst you should wrong the sober Episcopal Divines, so as to think that they claim as <hi>jure Divino,</hi> and as Pastoral, any Coercive forcing power, but only an authoritative per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading power, and that of the Keyes of the Church, I will transcribe some of the words of that Learned, Judicious Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> in his <hi>Tract.</hi> of <hi>Christian Subjection;</hi> By which you will see, that all forcing power claimed by them, is only Magistratical, as they are the Kings Officers, and not from Christ.</p>
            <p>Note also that constantly he distinguisheth the Magistrates power from the Pastors, by the [<hi>Sword</hi>] as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of execution, which even about Ecclesiastical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is proper to the Magistrate; As the power of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or <hi>Keyes</hi> of the Church, is the Pastors: And these are the shortest, plainest, and least ambiguous terms; and more clear than [<hi>Internal,</hi> Ecclesiastical and Civil] which have all much obscurity and ambiguity.</p>
            <p>Pag. 238. <hi>Princes only be Governours in things and Causes Ecclesiastical, that is, with the Sword—Bishops be no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in those things with the Sword.</hi>] Pag. 240. <hi>We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Princes to be Supream Governours,—Supream bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Sword—We give Princes no power to devise or invent new Religions, to alter or change Sacraments, to decide or debate doubts of faith, to disturb or infringe the Canons of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of these two last I must tell you, what we Puritans (as they call us) hold 1. That the King may and must decide doubts of faith, in order to execution by the Sword (as, who shall be banished or imprisoned as a Teacher of Heresie) 2. And that Canons <hi>circa sacra</hi> not take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pastors proper work out of his hand may be made by the Magistrate even if he please without the Prelates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Pag. 252. <hi>And if Princes shall not bear the Sword, in things and Causes Ecclesiastical, you must tell us who shall— Since by Gods Law the Priest may not meddle with the Sword, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is inevitable, that Princes alone are Gods Ministers, bearing the Sword, to reward and revenge good and evil in all things and causes, be they Temporal, Spiritual or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: unless you think that disorders and abuses Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal should be freely permitted</hi>—Page 256. <hi>This then is the Supream power of Princes, which we teach—That they be Gods Ministers in their own Dominions, bearing the Sword, freely to permit and publickly defend that which God commandeth—So may they with just force remove whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is erroneous, vicious, and superstitious within their Lands, and with external losses and corporal pains repress the broachers and abetters of Heresies and all impieties—From which subjection to Princes, no man within their Realms, Monk, Priest, Preacher or Prelate is exempted: And without their Realms no mortal man hath any power from Christ ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially to depose them; much less to invade them in open field, least of all to warrant their Subjects to rebell against them. These be the things which we contend for; and not whether Princes be Christs Masters, or the functions to preach, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, impose hands, and forgive sins, must be derived from the Princes power and Laws; or the Apostles might enter to convert Countreys, without</hi> Caesars <hi>delegations; These be jests and shifts of yours.</hi>

            <p>Page 258. <hi>His Word is Truth: and therefore your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops cannot be Judges of the Word of Christ, but they must be Judges of Christ himself that speaketh by his Word, which is no small presumption.—My Sheep hear my voice—They be no Judges of his voice.</hi>—</p>

            <p>Page 358. <hi>The Watchmen and Shepheards that serve Christ in his Church, have their kind of Regiments distinct from the temporal Power and State: But that Regiment of theirs is by Counsel and perswasion, not by terror or Compulsion; and reacheth neither to the goods, nor to the bodies of any men</hi>—</p>
            <p>Page 366. <hi>As for your Episcopal Power over Princes, if that be it you seek for, and not to take their Kingdoms from them, I told you, If they break the Law of God, you may reprove them: If they hear you not, you may leave them in their sins, and shut Heaven against them. If they fall to open He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie or wilful impiety, you may refuse to communicate with them in prayers and other divine duties; yea, you must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yield your lives with submission into their hands, than deliver them the Word and Sacraments, otherwise than God hath appointed.</hi>]</p>
            <p>(Say you so; I promise you Sir, if Kings must be dealt so strictly with, though it cost you your lives, I will be a Non-conformist a little longer, though it cost me my live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, rather than give Baptism, the Lords Supper, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and the justifying assertions at Burials, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly as I must do, if I conform.)</p>
            <p>P. 525. <hi>Pastors have their kind of Correction even over Princes: but such as by Gods Law, may stand with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors Vocation; and tend to the Princes salvation: and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not the Word and Sacraments: Other Correction over any private man Pastors have none; much less over Princes—Princes may force their Subjects by the Temporal Sword.—Bishops may not force their flock with any corporal or external violence.</hi> Pag. 526. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith—<hi>For of all men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian (Bishops) may least correct the faults of men by force: Judges that are without the Church—may compell—But</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59351:31"/>
               <hi>here (in the Church) we may not offer any violence, but only perswade. We have not so great authority given us by the Laws as to repress offenders: And if it were lawful for us so to do, we have no use of any such violent power; for that Christ crowneth them which abstain from sin, not of a forced, but of a willing mind—Hilary</hi> teacheth the same Lesson; <hi>If this violence were used for the true faith, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Bishops would be against it. God needeth no forced service: He requireth no constrained confession: I cannot receive any man but him that is willing</hi> ☜ <hi>I cannot give ear, but to him that intreateth. I cannot sign, (that is, baptize any but him that (gladly) professeth.</hi>—So <hi>Origen—For all the crimes which God would have revenged, he would have them revenged not by the Bishops and Rulers of the Church, but by the Judges of the world—Bishops by vertue of their Callings cannot command others, or authorize violence or arms.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Pag. 541. <hi>Parliaments have been kept by the King and his Barons, the Clergy wholly excluded; and yet their Acts and Statutes good. And when the Bishops were present, their Voices from the Conquest to this day, were never Negative. By Gods Law you have nothing to do with making Laws for Kingdoms and Commonwealths: You may teach, you may not command. Perswasion is your part: Compulsion is the Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page 245. Far better St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith [<hi>If the Emperour ask for Tribute, we deny it not: The Lands of the Church pay Tribute: If he affect the Lands themselves, he hath power to take them: no man among us is any let to him. The alms of the people is enough for the poor. Let them never procure us envy for our Lands: let them take them if they please: I do not give them to the Emperour, but I do not deny them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far <hi>Bilson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this we allow: And if all this be the concurrent judgement of all sorts of sober Protestants, called Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal or Presbyterians, what reason hath any Erastian upon the account of the Magistrates interest to quarrel with them. If any <hi>practise</hi> not according to these principles, let them hear of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59351:31"/>Indeed in point of <hi>convenience</hi> we greatly differ from some men: That is, 1. Whether it be <hi>convenient</hi> for the King to make Church-men <hi>Magistrates,</hi> or not? 2. And whether it be <hi>convenient</hi> immediately to back their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, with the <hi>Sword;</hi> And for the Magistrate to be the Clergies Executioner, or to imprison men <hi>eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> because excommunicate and not repenting. 3. And whether it be <hi>convenient</hi> to make the <hi>same Court</hi> called Ecclesiastical, so mixt of <hi>Pastoral</hi> and <hi>Secular Power united,</hi> in one Chancellor (who is no Pastor, but a Lay man) or in a Bishop, as that in and by it, the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government shall be either confounded, or so twisted as to be undiscernable, or become one <hi>tertium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for this, as we love not to be too forward in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Magistrates what is <hi>convenient,</hi> (though many of the ancient Fathers have done it plainly, and spoken against the Magistracy of Priests; and <hi>Cy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

(Though I excuse none that urge him to it, or voluntarily assume his Power.)</p>

            </p>
            <p>Here you see what Church Government is in Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> sense, and how far the Bishops hold the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be restrainable even by a Deacon; And yet but (I think) according to your own sense, I pray you judge then whether the Bishops and you differ as far as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and whether the Courts and Church power which offendeth you, be not set up by Kings themselves, who make the Bishops their Officers therein. To which add what <hi>Bilson</hi> proveth that Patriarchs, Metropolitans and Archbishops Dignities are the gift of Princes, and not the institution of Christ, and then you will see more, that it is the Princes own doing.</p>
            <p>I add to the like purpose more out of <hi>Bilson</hi> pag. 313. [<hi>We grant, they must rather hazard their lives, than baptize Princes which believe not,</hi> or <hi>distribute the Lords mysteries to them that repent not, but give wilful and open signification of iniquity,</hi> &amp;c.] This is Church Government, which none can contradict.</p>
            <p>This is it that <hi>Chrysostom</hi> so often professeth also, as that he would rather let his own blood be shed, than give the blood of Christ to the unworthy.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Beda Hist.

            <p>(And by the way, if Bishops say that <hi>Kings</hi> must be used thus, the Non-conformists are not such intolerable Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, as some now represent them, for desiring, that every Presbyter may not be compelled against his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to give the Sacrament to the basest of the people that are ignorant what Christ or Christianity is, and to them that are not willing to receive it, but are forced to take it against their wills for fear of a Prison; nor to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize the Children of such Parents as know not what bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is, or as are professed Infidels, having not so much
