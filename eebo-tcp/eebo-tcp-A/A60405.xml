         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is given in charge by the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> That we <hi>mark
them that cauſe diviſions, contrary to the Doctrine which we
have learned, and avoid them;</hi> Sure then, we ſhould obſerve them
that have it in deſign, to promote union, according to the Doctrine
we have received and acknowledge and embrace them, and eſteem
them very highly in love for their works ſake. Such is the worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this enſuing Subject, who (with others of his brethren) lookes
with a ſad heart upon the heart-diviſions of our times, and laments to
ſee ſuch as are happily divided from the world, unhappily divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves. The work and labour of love, which he hath here
performed, is a labour for Love that's the ſubject-matter of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
a lovely argument worthy the handling, a precious grace moſt
worthy the poſſeſſing; ſo much as we have of it, ſo much we have of God;
ſo much as we expreſſe of it, ſo much we expreſſe of God; for God is
Love. High and honourable are the Elegies and Encomiums given of
it in Scripture, ſuch as ſet forth the excellency, and uſefulneſſe of it;
to account them then here, would be to anticipate what the following
Subject will more fully and fruitfully perform: This only would I ſay,
it is the ſpirituall Cement, by which believers, as Materialls in a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
are compaginated; that ſpiritual Ligament, by which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as members
in a body, they are united: And this is the happy agreement between
Faith and Love, as touching union that Love ſhould y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eld it up to Faith,

The Author holds out love in the enſuing diſcourſe, according to the
guidance of the Text he handles, under the notion of a way wherein we
are to walke; a good way it is, the good old way, or if you muſt have
a new way, the Goſpell new way. The old Commandment is for it, the
new Commandment is for it alſo. It is a right way, a ſafe way, a plain
way, a pleaſant way, and in a good ſence, a broad way, large enough:
were we in it, we ſhould not need to juſtle and ſhoulder one another as
we do. Pity it is that ſuch a way is not better known, more travelled.
But ſo it is, we may juſtly compl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine, as of old, many walke, but ſo
as they wander from the right way. I ſay, as the Prophet of old, This
is the way, walke in it. Every ſtep we take in this way, is a part of
payment of a debt we owe, which though we are required to be ſtill ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and never in paying, we are too far in arrears one to another al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
let us take heed leaſt our uon payment bring us under an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and caſt us into priſon.</p>
            <p>A wordmore, and the part<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtall ſpeake, We all profeſſe to be for
heaven, Love muſt be our way to bring us thither, Love muſt be our
buſineſſe, when we come there, the work in heaven to all eternity ſhall
be to be reciprocally acting and expreſſing love. Let us doe that now
which we hope to do for ever, But I forbeare to inlarge in this kinde,
referring you to the following diſcourſe, which I heartily commend to
the peruſall and practiſe of t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and bleſſed be the name of the moſt High God, who

requiſite and ſitting in his Divine Power and Wiſdom;
for, indeed, you know that it is the uſual way of the Lord
to take away from off the Earth his precious Saints and
Servants, before the caſting down of his judgments; and
to remove thoſe bright Stars (whom the World are not
worthy of) to a higher Orb. And truly thus much I
dare divine, That when you are gone, I ſhall not ſtay

and Officers, may be <hi>Jethroes</hi> Juſtices, men of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
fearing God, dealing truly, and hating covetouſneſs.
Alas! We ſee that the Ax is even laid to the Root, and
many thereby have undergone an untimely death: But
happy are all thoſe that ſuffer for the Cauſe of Chriſt;
nay, thrice happy are they who ſuffer for Him, that ſo
willingly laid down his life for them. O! conſider, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, the torments he indured:</p>
               <p>1. Jeſus Chriſt died a ſhamefull death, he died as a
Malefactor, among Malefactors, and yet innocent; <hi>Iſa.</hi>
53. 12. <hi>He was numbred with tranſgreſſors.</hi> Crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Theeves, as if he had been the Captaine or
chief over them, yet the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>He
did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth,</hi> though he
were ſlaughtered, yet he was a Lamb without blemiſh,
and without ſpot.</p>
               <p>2. Jeſus Chriſt died an accurſed death, and that not
only according to mans conceit, or opinion, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the decree of the divine Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 23. <hi>he that
is hanged, is accurſed of God:</hi> Which the Apoſtle brings
in applying it to Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Who was made a curſe
for us: for it is written, curſed is every one that hangeth on
the tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Jeſus Chriſt died a painful death, and this wil appear
in ſeveral particulars: 1. He was ſcourged, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27: 26.
<hi>When he had ſcourged Jeſus, he delivered him to be crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
This ſcourging was painful; for Chriſt was not ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>virgâ</hi> with a rod, but <hi>ſtagello</hi> with a whip or ſcourge,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53657:4"/>
which pierced the more, &amp; put him to more pain. 2. His
head was crowned with thorn, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 29. <hi>They platted
a Crown of thorns, and put it upon his head:</hi> Theſe thorns
pierced his temples, &amp; this muſt needs aggravate his pain
and miſery. 3. His hands and feet were nailed, which was
very grievous, for thoſe members being full of nerves,
and ſinews, they feel torture ſo much the more. 4. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a lingering death, ſudden death is not ſo painfull as a
lingering death; to be dying, but not dead, is painfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
when he was nailed to the Croſſe he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
dead. Secondly, Let us conſider his inward ſoul-ſufferings,
and theſe we ſhall look upon under three
heads.</p>
               <p>1. Conſider what temptations he lay under, as ſoon as
he was baptized and ſet apart for his office, Satan temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. But now he being ready to depart the
world, and to compleat his conqueſt, Satan ſet upon him
with freſh force, this was in his Agony, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 44:</p>
               <p>2. Conſider what ſence of wrath he went under, he
was wont always to have his Father ſmiling on him, now
he finds him frowning on him, diſcovering nothing but
anger and wrath, <hi>On him was laid the iniquitie of us all,</hi>
and the wrath that was due to all the Elect for all their
ſin; yet all this Chriſt bears, even all the wrath that the
Father had to lay upon all the elect; yea, and he cries out,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 28. <hi>I thirſt:</hi> That i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

more to be charged upon them, I thirſt to have it laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

him, he cries out, <hi>

               <p>Now, let us put all theſe together, and we muſt needs
conclude, that Chriſt loves us dearly. Jeſus Chriſt the
Son of God in whom was no iniquity; looks upon us
polluted creatures, that were his enemies; and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to ſuffer a <hi>ſhamefull, curſed, prinfnll death,</hi> and to

and to be forſaken of him alſo, and all this to do us
good, that we might eſcape theſe things, Oh inxpreſ-love.
If Chriſt love us dearly, then <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

we are not worthy of his love, but he is worthy

ſhall we not ſo loue him, as to give our ſelves to him.

we love one another? Did he that is ſo high above us,
