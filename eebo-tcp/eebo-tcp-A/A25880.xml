         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Jury, you have heard the ſeveral Witneſſes, and I think
this whole Countrey cannot but plainly ſee the malice of my
Husbands Father againſt me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how he cauſleſly hunts after my
life, when his Son, my Husband, came and addreſſed himſelf
to me, pretending himſelf a perſon of honor, and upon firſt
ſight preſſed me to marriage: I told him, Sir ſaid I, I am a
ſtranger, have no acquaintance here, and deſire you to deſiſt
your ſuit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

ſome thredbare Complements) replied. <hi>Madam,</hi> your
ſeeming vertues, your amiable perſon, and noble deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
renders you ſo excellent, That were I in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
in you, I cannot doubt of happineſs; and ſo with
many words to the like purpoſe, courted me, I told him, and
indeed could not but much wonder, that at ſo ſmall a glance
he could be ſo preſumptuous with a ſtranger, to hint this to
me; but all I could ſay, would not beat him off: And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
afterwards he having intercepted my Letter, by which
he underſtood how my affairs ſtood, and how conſiderable
my means were, he ſtill urged me to marry him; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by the contrivance of his friends, gaping at my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
I was hurried to Church to be married, which the
Parſon at firſt did without Licence, to ſecure me to my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and ſometime after had a Licence.</p>
               <p>And my Husbands Father afterwards conſidering I had a

Husband; it will be much for your honour, ſatisfaction of
the world, and for which you will be Chronicled for a rare
woman: and perceiving he had not baited his hook ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
(with ſome fair pretences) to catch me then, he and
his Son, who were both willing to make up ſome of their
former loſſes in circumventing me of what I had, they
rob'd me of my Jewels, and Cloths of great value, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
pretended they were counterfeit Jewels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that I had formerly been married to one at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
which place I know not; and this grounded on a
Letter (of their own framing) ſent from <hi>Dover,</hi> with a
deſcription of me; that I was a young fat woman; full
breſted; that I ſpoke ſeveral languages; and therefore they
imagined me the perſon; and ſo violently carried me from
my lodging before a Juſtice of Peace, only to affright me,
that I might make my Eſtate over to them. The Juſtice ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard their ſeveral allegations, could not commit me,
unleſs they would be bound to proſecute me; which my
Husband being unwilling to, the Juſtice demanded of his
Father whether he would proſecute me, ſaying, they muſt
not make a fool of him; and ſo after ſome whiſperings, the
Father and his Son were both bound to proſecute, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I was committed to priſon: And ſince that, theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have been up and down the Countrey, and finding none
there that could juſtifie any thing of this matter, they get
here an unknown fellow, unleſs in a priſon, and from thence
borrowed, you cannot but all judg to ſwear againſt me. My
Lord, were there any ſuch marriage as this fellow pretends,
methinks there might be a Certificate from the Miniſter, or
place; certainly if married, it muſt be regiſtred: but there
is no Regiſtry of it and ſo can be no Certificate no Miniſter
nor Clerk to be found: and if I ſhould own a marriage, then
you ſee that great witneſs cannot t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

a paultry fellow may be believed) to ſay, I was married.
I was never yet married to any but <hi>John Charlton,</hi> the late

take away my life, bring perſons to ſwear againſt me, one

hired with Five pounds, and another old fellow perſwaded
to own me for his Wife; who came to the priſon, and
ſeeing another woman, owned her, and afterwards my ſelf,
and indeed any body. If ſuch an old inconſiderable fellow
had heretofore woed me, it muſt have been for want of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,

               </speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you ſee this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is againſt <hi>Mary Moders,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Stedman,</hi> and it is
for having two husbands, both at one time alive; the firſt
<hi>Stedman,</hi> afterwards married to <hi>Charlton,</hi> her former hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
being alive. You have heard the proof of the firſt
marriage, and the proof doth depend upon one witneſs, that
is <hi>Knot;</hi> and he indeed doth ſay, he was at the marriage,
gave her, and he names one <hi>Man</hi> the Parſon that married
her, that he is dead; none preſent there but the married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that muſt needs be there, the Parſon, this witneſs, her
ſiſter, and the Sexton; that he knows not what is become of
the Sexton. All the Evidence given on that ſide to prove her
guilty of this Indictment, depends upon his ſingle teſtimony.
It is true, he ſays ſhe was married at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but the
particulars or the manner of the marriage he doth not ſo
well remember; whether by the Book of Common Prayer,
or otherwiſe, but they lived together for four years, had two
Children. If ſhe were born there, married there, had two
Children there, and lived there ſo long, it were eaſie to have
brought ſome body to prove this; that is all that is materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
for the firſt marriage.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, there is little proof neceſſary, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
her ſelf married to <hi>Charlton,</hi> and owns him; the
queſtion is, Whether ſhe was married to <hi>Stedman,</hi> or
not?</p>
               <p>You have heard what defence ſhe hath made for her ſelf,
ſome Witneſſes on her behalf; if you believe that <hi>Knot,</hi> the
ſingle witneſs, ſpeaks the truth ſo far forth to ſatisfie your
Conſcience, That that was a marriage, ſhe is guilty. You
ſee what the Circumſtances are, it is penal, if guilty, ſhe
muſt die; a Woman hath no Clergy, ſhe is to die by the
Law, if guilty. You heard ſhe was Indicted at <hi>Dover</hi> for
having two Husbands, <hi>Stedman</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Day</hi> the ſecond.
There it ſeems by that which they have ſaid, ſhe was acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
none can ſay this was the Woman, that there was a
tryal, may be believed; but whether this be the woman tried
or acquitted, doth not appear? One here that was of that
Jury, ſays, there was a tryal, but knows not that this is the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95782:10"/>
Woman. So that upon the whole. It is left to you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of the Evidence you have heard, and ſo to give your
Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>The Jury went forth, and after ſome ſhort Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

            </sp>
            <p>Afterwards ſhe deſired, that her Jewels and Cloaths taken
from her, might be reſtored to her: The Court acquainted
her, that they were her Husbands, and that if any detained
them from her, he might have his remedy at Law: She
charging old Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi> with them, he declared they were
already in the cuſtody of his Son her Husband.</p>
