            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe grand design of this Collection
of <hi>Popish Miracles,</hi> is to inform
thee of the Absurdities and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
her Members to believe such ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Stories, as are here related out
of Popish Authors, set out and own'd
by their Church; and some of them
very lately published to the World by
Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> in his <hi>Church History,</hi>
Printed, 1668, who has raked together
out of <hi>Bede, Capgrave,</hi> and others,
<pb facs="tcp:102702:3"/>
such stuff, as I am sure must needs fill
thee with admiration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for</hi> Ignatius, <hi>the Character given
of him in his</hi> Life <hi>denotes him to be
little better than a lunatick Person,
for</hi> pag. 146. <hi>this is related of him,</hi>
But that he had regard to the good
of his neighbour, (for which it was
necessary for him to uphold himself
and his authority) he would have
walked the streets half naked, in
a contemptible manner, that so he
might have been held and reputed a
Mad-man. <hi>And</hi> pag. 80. <hi>we have
an account of the</hi> Devils appearing to
him, endeavouring to fright and
distract him in his Prayers, and was
often with a little stick chased away
by him. <hi>And</hi> pag. 48. <hi>we have this
Vision,</hi> At such time as he composed
the Constitutions of his Society,
having one day consecrated the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Host, and offered to Almighty
God the Rules of his Society, God
the Father appeared most graciously
<pb facs="tcp:102702:3"/>
unto him, insinuating by some my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
signification, that it would
be a thing pleasing to his Divine
Majesty, that the Mother of God
should offer up her Prayers unto Him
for him; whereupon the Blessed
Virgin suddenly appeared, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the Eternal
Father; and demonstrating, that
her own flesh was there present in
the Eucharist, in the flesh of her
Son. <hi>At one time we have account,
that</hi> both Father and Son appeared
to him; <hi>and at another,</hi> the Holy
Spirit: <hi>And many such extravagant
passages, which are more probable to
be the Frenzies of a Mad-man, than
the Visions of a Saint: For God says,</hi>
Exod. 33. 20. There shall no man see
me and live. <hi>But it is in vain to bring
Scripture against those, that both deny
the Scriptures to be the Iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
and likewise make it their
business to derogate from it. In a Spanish
Catechism, entituled,</hi> Caton Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,
<pb facs="tcp:102702:4"/>
               <hi>composed by</hi> Geronimo de Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
<hi>a</hi> Jesuit, <hi>and Printed at</hi> Sevil,
1670. <hi>this plainly appears, for instead
of citing Siripture to confirm the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins
of the</hi> Roman Church, <hi>he
brings in forged Miracles for Examples:
As to instance only in one: To prove the
lawfulness of Praying to the Virgin</hi>
Mary, <hi>he tells this wonderful Story:</hi>
A great Sinner put himself into a
Religious Order, and being grosly
ignorant, he was not able to learn
the Christian Doctrin, no not so
much as the <hi>Ave Maria</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
but only these words, <hi>Hail
Mary full of Grace,</hi> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
many times. This man died,
and afterwards there grew on his
Grave a very handsome Tree, on
whose Leaves were these words
written, <hi>Hail Mary full of Grace:</hi>
The Miracle was divulged, the
Bishop came and caused the Tree to
be digg'd up, and they found that the
Root of this Tree came out of the
<pb facs="tcp:102702:4"/>
Man's Mouth. <hi>This is their way of
proving their Doctrins, as may be seen
throughout this</hi> Catechism.</p>
            <p>That most of these Miracles were
invented by the Romish Priests and
Monks, to make the ignorant Laity
have a more venerable esteem for them,
(than which nothing has more contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereto,) and to distribute their
Riches amongst them for Pardons, Masses
for freeing their Souls from Purgatory,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> needs no other proof, than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
and impertinency of the things
related, and the Doctrins they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>viz. Invocation of Saints,
Worshipping of Images, &amp;c.</hi> which
are quite contrary to the revealed Will
of God, and the Practice of the Holy
Apostles: And therefore if some
things of this nature have been mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
acted, it is not to be attributed
to our most holy God, since it tends to
the violating his Commands, by setting
up new Doctrins contradictory thereto;
but rather to the subtilty and power of
<pb facs="tcp:102702:5"/>
the Devil, who in all Ages has made it
his business to seduce Men to the most
abominable Sin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and for
that end did work many Miracles in
the Temples of the Heathen; so that it is
no new thing for him to work Miracles,
when it is to gain himself Proselytes;
and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has been
so far deluded by him, as to break the
Second Commandment, in giving Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship to Images, is learnedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Dr. <hi>Moore,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and
others, in their Books of the <hi>Idolatry</hi>
of that <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this, they may see what danger
they are in, whilst they communicate
with a Church, that imposes such noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Lies on her Members to support
her false Doctrins. God give them grace
to see their Errours, that so they may
withdraw themselves from that <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Church,</hi> and cast anchor in the
true <hi>Protestant,</hi> grounded on Scripture,
and the Practice of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
which is the hearty desire of the
Publisher.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102702:6"/>
It fell out at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> that two
Brothers, about their Patrimony;
had long sued one another, and he,
in fine, whose fortune it was to lose
the Suit, falling through too vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
apprehension into despair,
hung himself with a Halter upon a
Beam in his Chamber: The bruit
of which came no sooner to the Ears
of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but suddenly he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
himself to the place, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
asunder the Halter from that
unfortunate Rafter, gave order that
the dead Body should be laid upon a
Bed; which done, falling a part upon
his Knees, he began with many
tears to demand the safety of that
miserable Creature at the Hands of
Almighty God; but whilst <hi>Ignatius</hi>
(being at that time but a Student in
the Grammar School) was thus ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in his Prayers, they who were
there present standing in suspence,
with their Eyes fixed upon the Bed,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102702:6"/>
(a thing full of miracle) the dead
Man returned suddenly to life, and
had the use of his Voice so long, till
calling for a ghostly Father he had
confessed his Sins and received Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
and then at last gave up
the Ghost, lately redeemed from
out the Jaws of Hell, into the
Hands of his Creator.</p>
               <p>He recovered immediately a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Man called <hi>Bastida,</hi> who had
been many years sick of the Falling-Sickness,
by casting up his Eyes
and Prayers for him to Heaven.</p>
               <p>He often chased the Devil out of
possessed Persons, by the Sign of the
Cross.</p>
               <p>He restored a Woman to health,
who lay half dead of a Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
               <p>He delivered one <hi>Simon Rodriguez,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102702:7"/>
being also at Death's door, from his
Disease, by a pious Embrace.</p>

                  <hi>Iohn Baptista Coco,</hi> who by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
one Evening had so burnt his
Hand, that it became utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable,
and disabled for any
manual Function, the next day by
his Prayers had his Hand healed and
restored.</p>
               <p>Returning sick into his own
Countrey of a quotidian Ague, and
Preaching often in the open Fields,
(because the Churches were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the Concourse of People)
howbeit his weakness would not
permit him to raise his Voice aloud,
yet every word of his Sermon was
perfectly and distinctly heard and
understood by all Men for the space
of more than 300 Paces.</p>

and close Chamber and Bed, in
regard the Windows and Doors
were kept shut to keep out the light,
he replenished the Room with the
supernatural splendour of his Face,
and recovered the sick Person.</p>
               <p>He freed one <hi>Elutherio Pontano,</hi>
who had been grievously molested
for the space of more than two years
with certain foul tentations of the
Devil, by his only seeing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing

               <p>The College of <hi>Loretto</hi> being fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

the Rector of the College ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
himself by Letters to St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
commending the business to
his holy Sacrifices and Prayers, who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102702:8"/>
no sooner received news of it, but
he absolutely freed the House from
those haunts of ill Spirits by his
Prayers and Letter, not for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
only, but for ever after.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Linnen, being

not being able by gentle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
to cure his diseased Mind,
changing at last his stile, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to call upon the Justice of God,
and represent unto him the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of Heaven, he did it with
such a feeling, and expression of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that the Walls and House
appeared to him to tremble and
shake with horrour; with the sight
of which, the standers by, being
stricken, immediately fell upon
their Knees, imploring the Mercy
of God by their Prayers and Vows;
and the Delinquent, prostrating
himself at the Feet of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
and with a Voice of Confusion beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
pardon for his offence, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from thence forward an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himself.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Leonard Kesselius,</hi> residing
at <hi>Colen,</hi> had a vehement desire to
see St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> then at <hi>Rome,</hi> above
300 Leagues distant from thence;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102702:9"/>
and having besought the B. Father
by Letters, that it might be lawful
for him to travel on foot to <hi>Rome;</hi>
he made answer, that his presence
was necessary at <hi>Colen</hi> for the good
of others, enjoining him besides not
to stir from thence, for that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God peradventure by some
other course might so provide, that
he might see him without the pains
and toil of so tedious a journey; the
Father therefore being one day at
his Prayers, St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> appeared
unto him, being yet alive and
breathing, and discoursed long with
him, to his infinite contentment.</p>
               <p>The B. Father lying often sick,
if in the mean time any difficulty
hapned, for the solving of which his
virtue and wisdom was required,
he seemed in a manner to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
recovered, and his Mind
guiding his Body, appeared a sound
Man; so that it became familiar
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102702:9"/>
to them of the Houshold, as often as
he fell sick, to desire that some Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of Consequence might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
for the facilitating of which
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> might rise, and be quit
of his Disease.</p>

I will relate some few, because my
brevity promised will not permit
many.</p>
               <p>When the Body of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> lay
exposed upon the Bier, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his Funeral Rites, one
<hi>Bernadina,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> had a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
desire to bring a Daughter of
hers, who had been long troubled
with the Emcroids, so grievously,
that no Art of Physick could cure
her, to kiss the Hands of his dead
Body, assuring her self the recovery
of her Daughter by that touch;
but the Daughter, transported often
times by the press of People, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able for the throng to approach
near the Body, her Mother laid hold
of a piece of his Garment, and had
no sooner applied it to her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102702:10"/>
Body but she was quit of her
Disease.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Nicholas Bobadilla,</hi> having
been long sick of an Ague, was
recovered by lying in the Bed of
St. <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Manresa,</hi> a certain Lady of
Quality feeling no living motion of
her Child in her Womb, for the
space of three hours before she was
brought to Bed, at last was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of a dead Child; the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
success of which, being
much lamented by the standers by,
the rather because the Child had
not been Christned; the Midwife
about half an hour after the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the Woman, implored with
confidence the help of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
and had scarce begun her Prayers,
but the Child, before pale and black,
returned now to Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:102702:11"/>
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> being besought for the
Life of a little dead Intant of an
<hi>Indian</hi> Woman, restored the Child
to Life.</p>
               <p>He restored many blind Men their
Sight, deaf Men their Hearing,
lame Men their Limbs, cured Men
stricken with the Palsie, others gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
over by the Physicians and lying
at deaths door he restored perfectly
to their Health. He appeared to
many after his decease, either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
them from grievous tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or freeing them from their
Diseases or other dangers, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them good Counsel, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
things to come, or comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
such as served him with divine
Consolations; and in his Journey
to Heaven, at the very instant of
his decease at <hi>Rome</hi> (as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appeared by computation of
Hours) he appeared in Glory to that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102702:11"/>
Noble and Religious Lady <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reta

               <p>Many Devils have been cast out
of possessed Persons, and out of
Houses which they haunted, by the
Relicts of the Holy Father, or by

               <p>The Oyl of the Lamp which

of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> by which the Child
was suddenly not recovered only 
but so recovered that his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
became chearful and fair.</p>
               <p>He cured divers of the Pleurisie.</p>
               <p>He protected many Men from the
fury of their Enemies; others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fallen head-long from some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
precipice, were defended
from all hurt by invoking his Name.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Cesenza,</hi> one <hi>Angelo Lopez,</hi> upon
the Eve of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in expression
of his affection, had filled his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
with many Paper-Lanthorns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
adding to each Lanthorn the Picture
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102702:12"/>
of the Saint, and with infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of gratulation, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
often these words, <hi>Io Loyola, B.
Pater io!</hi> but in the midst of this
triumph, by chance it came to pass,
that by the greatness of the Wind
the Fire had taken hold of his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns,
which when it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by some Raskallity of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
they began to scoff at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
upbraiding the Man for his
superstition, and with a bitter allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to his Motto of Triumph, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the words of it thus; <hi>At, at,
Beatus uritur: at, Loyola crematur!</hi>
At which the Man growing insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
out of patience, out of his
sense of this irreligion used to St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius;
And I for my part,</hi> quoth he,
<hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ave so high an esteem of the Sanctity
of the B. Father, that I believe him
to be able to protect his singed Picture
from the Fire:</hi> Neither was he decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in his belief, for the Flame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
consumed the Paper round
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102702:13"/>
about it, forbore to touch the Picture,
either in demonstration of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
of the B. Father, or in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancy
of the Zeal of him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
it.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Braga,</hi> a certain Woman ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been lately brought to Bed, was
so much weakned, for many days
after, with a continual Flux of
Blood, that life could hardly be kept
in her from following the Course of
the Flux; who drinking of the
Water into which her Child had
been dipped, having been wrapped
immediately before in the Garments
of Saint <hi>Ignatius,</hi> her Flux suddenly
stopped, and she recovered her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
strength.</p>
               <p>In the Town of <hi>Guimarent,</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Woman having lost the use
of her Sight and Hearing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the holy Oyl and other Rites
of the Church, lay utterly out of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102702:13"/>
her senses; and whilst some about
her, out of Devotion, were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to put her in mind of her
last words, a certain Woman who
in courtesie came to visit her, called
to remembrance, that a little piece
of the Girdle St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> used in his
life time, having lately been sent to
her by a Son of hers of the Society;
which she with great Confidence,
and Reverence towards God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
applied to the sick Woman;
which done, she began to recover
her senses by degrees, to Breath,
to stretch out her Hands, and make
signs for Meat, to the Admiration
of the Physicians, for the suddenness
of the Cure. All which things
were afterwards confirmed by the
Attestation of sworn Witnesses.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Caglari</hi> a certain elder Brother
snatching up a Knife at dinner time,
hurt his younger Brother in the Eye;
and at the same time, the Daughter
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102702:14"/>
of a certain Gentlewoman, carving
at the Table, was sorely hurt in like
manner, in one of her Eyes; both
which calling upon the Aid of Saint
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> were delivered from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
beyond expectation.</p>
               <p>Another Woman had been so
weakned, for the space of four
Months, with continual Pains, that
she was utterly deprived of the
Use of her Feet; but the Feast of
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> drawing near, she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to partake of the common
Jollity that day expressed in our
Church, was not frustrated of her
desire; for her Pain ceasing, and
her Feet being restored to their
wonted Strength, she came thither
with Joy, to have a share in the
Devotion.</p>
               <p>In the same place, upon the Eve
of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Artillery playing
round, a little Infant who could not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102702:14"/>
speak, and who had never heard
the Name of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> cryed out,
to the Admiration of all standers by,
<hi>To morrow is the Day of B.</hi> Ignatius.
But they who were present, hearing
a thing so full of Wonder, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
sake, demanded again of
the Child, What was to be done
to morrow, who Answered as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Majorca</hi> dwelt a certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who through the Contraction
of her Sinews, was become so Lame,
that she could not go without
Crutches; the whole Town there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being filled with the noises of
Trumpets, Voyces, and other Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Instruments, Almighty God
inspired her with a desire of Visiting
our Church; who put her self in
readiness to go, notwithstanding
the disswasions of her Sister, who
feared she might Miscarry by the
press of People, she nevertheless
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102702:15"/>
gave no Ear to her Disswasions, but
put her self upon the way, and was
suddenly Cured, and recovered
strength in her Feet; and throwing
away her Crutches, without any
help betook her self to the Church,
where in Thanks-giving she caused
a Mass of the B. Sacrament to be
said.</p>
               <p>Another Woman, who some
Years past had received her Sight
by the means of this B. Father, lying
now again desperately Sick, and
being given over by four Physicians,
not forgetful by whom she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Light before, now again
reposed all her Hopes and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the same Physician. One
Night therefore she called out upon
one of the Women, who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to Watch with her, <hi>Make
haste,</hi> quoth she, <hi>come hither with
speed and behold this Glorious Splendor!
O if thou hadst come sooner, thou shouldst
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102702:15"/>
have beheld my St.</hi> Ignatius <hi>visiting
me! for I am now Recovered, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Well.</hi> And the Event con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it to be true; for the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
themselves could not deny,
but that she was Cured by some
Secret Power.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Monte</hi> in <hi>Gallicia,</hi> a great Fire
raging for many Days together, and
consuming a certain Wood, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
still new forces, dispersing and
spreading it self far and near, there
being no Human means to stop or
restrain it, to which the Wind
rising upon a sudden, drove the
Flames towards the Barns and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Town, so that the Fire was
now advanced within three or four
Paces of the Corn and Houses; a
certain person therefore, taking the
Picture of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which he had
about him, and falling to his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
threw it into the midst of
the Flames, there where the Fire
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102702:16"/>
raged most, and threatned greatest
Ruin, and immediately the fury and
rage of it ceased, the Flames which
flew highest descended and vanished,
and the whole Fire returned upon
a sudden from whence it began. And
which is worth Admiration, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Woman, who had observed the
throwing in of the Picture, leaping
into the midst of the smoaking
Brands, raked away the Ashes with
her Fingers, and being unhurt,
brought away the Picture from the
midst of the burning Coals.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Friburg,</hi> a little Child of three
years of age by chance had broken
his Arm, the Mother of whom fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the displeasure of her Husband,
being then absent, invoketh the help
of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but she had scarce
ended her Prayers, when, to her
infinite contentment, she found her
Child before her eyes, whole and
without hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102702:16"/>
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> being invoked,
wrought a present Cure upon divers
who had been sorely wounded,
whose Cure would otherwise have
exacted a long time.</p>
               <p>Many Men by the presence of
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Picture, or by the
presence, or by the application or
touch of his Reliques, have cured
the Plague when it raged most sorely
and consumed multitudes.</p>
               <p>A certain Nobleman at <hi>Placa</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Sky to be overcast with
thick Clouds, and fearing a great
spoil of his Corn, lying yet open
in the Field, made a Vow to <hi>St. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
for the preventing of the
Tempest, so that when all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
Territories swell'd with
floods of Rain, not a drop had
touched or fallen upon his Fields.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:102702:17"/>
                  <hi>At Naples,</hi> one <hi>Vincentio Pagano</hi>
having prepared certain artificial
Fires for the Celebration of the
Feast of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> had dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
through his own folly scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
his Hand, upon which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
certain Women of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
began to flock about
him, applying to his burnt Hand a
Note or Superscription of St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
his Hand-writing, the touch
of which presently eased his pain,
and the raging of the burnt part,
which usually ceaseth not till a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
day, was out of hand appeased.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Catanzaro,</hi> a certain pious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
having a Son by one <hi>Gasper
Mariscano,</hi> her Husband, out of her
devotion to St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> had a desire
to have him Christned by the name
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> howbeit her Husband
(in regard the Reliques of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
were preserved in that City) had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102702:17"/>
rather the Child should have been
called <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> but in conclusion,
after much debate about the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
they concluded the Child
should be named <hi>Ignatius Irenaeus;</hi>
but this contention occasioned many
differences betwixt the Man and
Wife, for the Wife ever after called
her Child <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and gave a strict
command to them of her Houshold
to do the like; and <hi>Gasper</hi> on the
other side, commanded them to call
him <hi>Irenaeus:</hi> The difference had
continued thus betwixt them almost
three months, when arguing the
business one morning, they both
grew somewhat hot, till the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
at last, in jest; <hi>Well,</hi> quoth he,
<hi>let the strife be put to the arbitrement
of the Child it self;</hi> to which the
Mother was contented to agree,
whereupon the Father, in merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
demanded of his Child, at
that time but three months old, by
what name he would have himself
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102702:18"/>
called? when, behold! the Child
miraculously received the use of his
Tongue, distinctly pronouncing the
name of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> which Voice so
took his Father with admiration of
the Miracle, that from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he gave order his Child should
be called <hi>Ignatius,</hi> dedicating him
to the Service of St. <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Territory of <hi>Peru</hi> in the
<hi>West-Indies,</hi> one <hi>Christopher Martinez
de Peredes,</hi> for the space of four
years together, was forced through
the lameness of his Feet, to make
use of one Crutch in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and afterwards of two; who
hearing, upon the Feast of St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
the triumph of the People,
<hi>And shall I,</hi> quoth he, <hi>upon this day,
when all Men are in jollity, remain as
it were an unbidden Guest? shall I alone
remain destitute?</hi> which words he
had scarce uttered, when his Feet
recovered forces, and he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102702:18"/>
so strong, that early the next
morning, without any other help,
he betook himself to the College.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Benedicto Lopez,</hi> Prefect of the
silver Mines, pursuing a certain <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi>
Fugitive, was set upon by five
others at unawares, who stabbing
and butchering him in sundry places
dragged him from his Horse in a
most barbarous manner: In which
his extremeties he implored the aid
of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who presently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
himself to him in these exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
and laying hold of his
Cloak, bore off, with both hands,
the Blows of his Enemies, so that
at last (his Enemies being departed,
and the B. Father vanished) he found
himself safe, and without hurt, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that his Hat and other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were pierced.</p>
               <p>A certain Lady at <hi>Avignon,</hi> had a
Son much afflicted with a violent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102702:19"/>
continual Feaver, who besides the
Disease it self, with the violence of
it, had one of his Hands disjointed,
and in a deformed manner turned
the wrong side outward, so that in
the opinion of the Physicians he
was in danger of the loss of his
Hand, if not of his Life with it;
which lamentable case, a certain
Religious Woman, allied to the
sick Youth, compassionating, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
three Masses, and as many Wax
Candles to St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> for the
Health of her Kinsman; which
done, the Youth immediately reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and for a more infallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the Miracle, his Hand
was replaced in the right place.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Barcelona,</hi> one <hi>Elizabeth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles,</hi>
a Religious Woman, being in
some high place busie about her
work, upon a sudden unfortunately
tumbled headlong to the ground,
and received so sore a blow, that her
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102702:19"/>
Thigh-bone, which is the solidest
Bone of the Body, was utterly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
The Physician and Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
were immediately called, who
for more than forty days together,
with what diligence was possible,
applied all the Remedies their Arts
afforded, howbeit to little purpose;
in conclusion, the sick Woman was
brought to those terms, that in all
Mens judgments she was past reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and as it was conceived, could
not last longer than that day; yet
notwithstanding, as soon as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was applied to
her Heart, she presently recovered.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Hierome Humphrey,</hi> a Boy of
ten years of age, upon one of his
Eye-brows near the Temples, had
received a mortal wound, which
occasioned an inflammation in his
Eye, and cast him into a Feaver;
for which the Chyrurgeon had him
in Cure a month, not being able to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102702:20"/>
help him, for the wound did not
only not heal, but grew so wide,
that it received a tent of a finger
long, and voided so much filth as
amazed the Chyrurgeon: The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Child made a Vow to
St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> commending her Child
to him; and behold! when (another
Chyrurgeon in the mean time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been called, for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
about the Cure) the bands
of the sore were unfolded, they
found the wound perfectly healed,
closed up, and sound.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Ferdinando Pertel,</hi> having fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into a Tertian Ague, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
proved to be a double Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
and at last a pestilent Feaver,
with a kind of raving and fearful
horrour of his Senses, was forsaken
by the Physicians, and lay in his
last extremity; being prepared with
all the Rites of the Church, and
invoking St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whose Picture
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102702:20"/>
he held in his hand, he began sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
to recover, and was cured of
his Disease.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Anne Barzellona,</hi> a Woman
of sixty years of age, having for
about the space of two years been
so miserably strooken with the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,
that she was unfit for any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and unable without Crutches
to go up and down stairs, and with
her Crutches also seemed rather to
creep than go; to which when the
application of no Remedies would
serve, and she besides was taken
with an Apoplexy in her other side,
so that she became impotent, and
was confined to her Bed; finding
her self thus void of all Human help,
by the assistance of her Crutches and
one <hi>Margaret</hi> her Sister, she betook
her self to a Chappel of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
two hours travelling distant from
her Lodging, where making a Vow
in honour of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
she began to find her self better,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102702:21"/>
and was able to bow her Knee,
which before was grown stiff; and
having ended her Devotions, arose
full of contentment, and returned
a joyful Woman nimbly to her
Lodging.</p>
               <p>A Bone and Superscription of
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> being applied to the Eyes

Raised by him in his Life time.</p>
            <p>After his Death he restored al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as many to Life. In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of his Canonization mention
is made of above five and twenty
persons raised by him from death to

healed Lepers: calmed Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous

many things to come, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
mens concealed thoughts,
had a certain knowledge of Secrets
and things absent. He appeared in
divers places far distant at one and
the self same time; he spake several
Languages which he had never
learned, as readily, congruously and
eloquently as if he had been born
and bred among those Nations.
And it fell out often times, that at
such times as he Preached to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of people, men of several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
at the same time, heard him
utter their own Language; and
with one and the self-same Answer
he often satisfied the demands of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Infidels. He was so ravished
and transported with the desire and
love of God, that he was often and
miraculously raised from the ground,
with a countenance inflamed, Eyes
sparkling and fixed upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
and being surcharged with
Celestial joy, was forced to exclaim,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102702:23"/>
               <hi>Sat est Domine! sat est.</hi> By the sign
of the Cross he turned salt Water
into fresh, in several vessels at Sea.
Having dipped a brazen Crucifix
which he wore about his Neck into
the Sea, to appease a Tempest, and
by accident lost it, walking next
day upon the shore, he espied a Sea-Crab
miraculously bringing him his
Crucifix in his claws, which having
delivered it, suddenly returned back
into the Sea, from whence it came.</p>
            <p>He ended his life at <hi>Sancion,</hi> near
<hi>China,</hi> in the year 1552. famous for
many Miracles. His Body was found
entire long after his death, howbeit
it was neither bowelled nor balmed,
but buried in Quick-lime; and it
appeared many Months after its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease,
lively, full of juyce and fresh
colour, soft and tractable, sending
forth an admirable sweet favour,
and many times Bleeding, for which
he was honoured, and reputed a

               <hi>Saint</hi> immediately after his death.
It appeareth by the Process of his
Canonization, that many-dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were raised by him, after his
death; that many Lamps burned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Body with Water only put
into them, as clearly as if they had
only been filled with Oyl; which
being oftentimes extinguished, took
fire again of themselves without
Human help: that divers were
Cured by him, or by his Reliques,

            <p>St. <hi>Anthony</hi> was a corpulent man,

night would have strangled him,

Throat, so that he was in danger of
death; but recommending himself
to the glorious Virgin, and saying
the Hymn, <hi>O Gloriosa Domina,</hi> the
Devil left him, and vanished away.
<hi>See his Life,</hi> pag. 193.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> had the gift of
Tongues, with a pleasant, cleer and
ringing Voice; and though there
was at his Sermons many Thousand
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102702:25"/>
persons of different Languages, yet
they all understood him. As at <hi>Rome,</hi>
where the People of sundry Nations
listening unto him, and he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, yet they
all understood him.</p>
            <p>Preaching one time in <hi>France,</hi>
near <hi>Bruges,</hi> in the Field because of
the multitude of People, (it was
Summer) and whil'st he Preached
it began to Thunder and Lighten
grievously, wherefore the People
doubting to be throughly wet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to haste away to shelter; St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
bade them be quiet, for they
should not be wet; all the People
gave credit to his words, and none
stirred out of his place, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to Rain very much throughout
all the Countrey, but upon the
People that heard his Sermon there
fell not one Drop.</p>
            <p>It happened in the same Province
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102702:25"/>
in <hi>France,</hi> that a devout Woman
was desirous to go to the Sermon
of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> but her Husband
would not suffer her because she was
sickly; she went up unto the top of
her House, looking toward the place
where he Preached, and though
she was two Miles off, yet she heard
the words of the Preacher as if she
had been hard by. Of this the
Husband of the good Woman was
witness, who calling her, and she
answering, that she stayd there to
hear the Sermon; he scoffed and
derided at her words, and with
some pain he went up to the place
where his Wife was, and he also
heard the words as plain as if he had
been hard by.</p>
            <p>One time St. <hi>Anthony</hi> Preaching;
he saw a Traveller approach unto
a Noble Lady which was at the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and speak unto her; the <hi>Saint</hi>
seeing her much troubled, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102702:26"/>
change Countenance, bade her (as
he stood in the Pulpit) not to believe
that false Messenger, who brought
her news that her Son was dead,
for it was a lye without doubt, and
said withall, that he that told it her
was the Devil. The wicked Fiend
would by this Lye have disturbed
the Sermon, but seeing himself dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
he vanished away in all
their sights.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Anthony</hi> being in <hi>Padua,</hi> it
was revealed to him that his Father
was in danger of death at <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
being accused of Man-slaughter,
whereof he was innocent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he asked leave of his Guardian,
and having obtained it, he was
carried in one Night only (by an
Angel) from <hi>Padua</hi> unto <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
Being come thither he spoke with
his Father, and brought to pass,
that the Judges caused the dead Body
to be brought before him; St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:102702:26"/>
before much people asked him
if his Father had killed him, the
dead Body spake, and said No, and
that he was falsly accused thereof.
The Judge having seen the strange
Miracle set free the Father of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi>
who remained in his company
all night, and the next day he was
carried back from <hi>Lisbon</hi> unto <hi>Padua,</hi>
as he had been brought thither.</p>
            <p>One time St. <hi>Anthony</hi> Preaching
at the Funeral of a Rich man, and
among other things discoursed upon
these words, <hi>Where thy treasure is,
there is thy heart;</hi> to confirm these
words, the Father said, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
words be true, it is evident in
this Rich man, who was covetous,
for his Heart was to be found in his
Chest, where his Money lyeth;
forthwith some went and opened it,
and there they found the Heart of
the Covetous man indeed, as fresh,
as if it had been taken out of the
Breast of a Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:102702:27"/>
It happened often at the end of
the Sermons of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> that the
People departed with such desire to
be Confessed, that the Confessors
of his Order, and of the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
also were not sufficient to satisfie
them. He also heard Confessions,
among others he heard the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a <hi>Paduan,</hi> who told him that
he had kicked his Mother; St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
reproved him sharply, and told
him, that the Foot that had strook
his Mother was worthy to be cut
off. The words of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> were
of such force in the mind of him
that was Confessed, that when he
came home, he himself cut off the
same Foot: St. <hi>Anthony</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
thereof, caused him to be
brought unto him, and restored him
his Foot again, with the sign of the
Cross.</p>

               <head>The manner of St. Kentigern's Birth.</head>
               <p>A certain King of <hi>Britanny</hi> who
was a Pagan begot of his Wife a
very beautiful Danghter, she having
been a frequent hearer of Sermons,
became a Christian, and though she
had not been Baptized, yet she was
addicted to the duties of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Discipline, as much as the fear
of incensing her Father would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit:
she bore so great Devotion to
the fruitful Virginity of the blessed
Virgin, that mov'd with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish
presumption, she begg'd that
she might imitate her in her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102702:30"/>
and Birth. At length, as
she thought, she obtained her desire,
for she found her self with Child.
Now it is not to be conceiv'd that
this hapned without the embraces
of a man, notwithstanding who
that man was, or in what manner,
or when this was done, she oft pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
and with Oaths confirmed it,
that she was utterly ignorant. Her
Father perceiving this, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able by fair speeches or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
to wrest from her, who was
the Father of the Child; for she se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
protested, that she had never
suffered the unlawful embraces of
any man; hereupon in a rage he
determined to execute upon her the
Law established by his Ancestors,
by which it was enacted, That
whatsoever young Maid should be
with Child by Fornication in her
Fathers house, should be thrown
down headlong from the top of a
high Mountain, and the person
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102702:30"/>
corrupting her, should lose his
Head. In conformity therefore to
this Law, the young Woman was
placed on the highest point of a
Mountain in that Countrey, called
<hi>Dunpelder,</hi> from thence to be thrown
down and torn in pieces. She
therefore with deep sighs, looking
up to Heaven, implored Mercy:
After this, she was cast down;
but by the Fall was neither bruised,
nor received the least harm, but
sliding down easily and slowly, came
safe to the bottom. The <hi>Pagans</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
this to the Magical Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Christians, therefore they
carried her several Miles into the
Sea, and there left her, destitute
of all humane help, in a small Boat
made of Leather without Oars,
but the Boat was carried to a far
distant Haven with great swiftness;
being arrived there, the young Lady
went out of the Boat, and presently
after was brought to Bed of a Son,

without the assistance of a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife.
The next morning St. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus</hi>

               <p>St. <hi>Iustinian</hi> having reproved his
Servants for idleness, and mispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their time, they were inflam'd
with fury against him, insomuch
as rushing upon him they threw
him to the ground, and most cruelly
cut off his Head. But in the place
where his sacred Head fell to the
ground, a Fountain of pure water
presently flowed, by drinking of
which in following times, many
were miraculously restored to
Health. But Miracles greater than
these, immediately succeeded his
Death; for the Body of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
presently rose, and taking the
Head between the two Arms, went
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102702:31"/>
down to the Sea Shore, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thence on the Sea, past over
to the Port called by his Name, and
being arrived to the place where a
Church is now built to his memory,
it fell down, and was there buried by
St. <hi>David. Cr. p.</hi> 234.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>David</hi> being enjoined to
Preach, he commanded a Child
which attended him, and had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been restored to Life by him, to
spread a Napkin under his Feet,
and standing upon it he began to
expound the Gospel and the Law to
the Auditory. All the while this
Oration continued, a snow white
Dove descending from Heaven, sate
upon his Shoulders; and moreover
the Earth on which he stood, rais'd
it self under him, till it became a
Hill, from whence his Voice like a
Trumpet, was clearly heard and
understood by all, both near and
far off. On the top of which Hill a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102702:32"/>
Church was afterwards built, which
remains to this day. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 235.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>David,</hi> when Priest, went to
<hi>Paulens,</hi> who in a certain Island lived
a holy Life, with him St. <hi>David</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
many years; now it fell out that
his Master <hi>Paulens</hi> fell blind, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
calling his Disciples together,
he desired that one after another
they would look upon his Eyes, and
say a Prayer or Benediction on them.
When they had done this, and that
he received no ease or remedy, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
said thus to him, <hi>Father, I pray
you do not command me to look you in
the Face, for ten years are passed since
I studied with you, and in all that time
I never had the boldness to look you in
the Face. Paulens</hi> admiring his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
said, <hi>Since it is so, it will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
if by touching my Eyes thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
a Benediction on them.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
therefore, assoon as he touched
them, Sight was restored to them.

St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> a <hi>British</hi> Priest, avoided
the Sight of Men, confining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to a little Cell, where in a little
Orchard, cultivated by himself, he
had planted a few Lawrel Trees,
which are now so increased that
they afford a very pleasing shade,
his custome was, under these to sit,
read, or write, as he thought fit.
After his death, among the said
Trees there was one which through
age was withered; then he to whom
the care of the Place was committed
digg'd up the Roots of the said dry
Tree, and of the Body of it hewed
out a Seat or Bench, upon which he
used to sit. After he had used the
Seat for the space of above two
years, a thought of remorse coming
into his heart, he said, <hi>Alas, Sinner
that I am, why do I for my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
make use of a Seat framed of
the Tree which so holy a Priest planted
with his own hands!</hi> Having said this,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102702:33"/>
he presently took a Spade, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
a deep hole in the ground, he
put the Seat into it, after he had cut
off the Feet which supported it, and
then covered it with Earth. <hi>Now
behold a great wonder!</hi> The very next
Spring, this dry Bench, thus bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
sprouted forth into green
branches as the other Trees did,
which prospered so well, that at this
day there are proceeded from it seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
young Trees, five or six Foot
high, and some higher, which every
year do more and more flourish. <bibl>

               <head>The Miracle of St. Ivo's Translation.</head>
               <p>St. <hi>Ivo</hi>'s Body remained several
Ages in the place of his Burial, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that his Memory was lost in
that place; but at last, in the year
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102702:33"/>
1001. a certain Husbandman, as he
was plowing the ground, lighted
upon his Tomb, which being taken
up and opened, the Body of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
in his Pontifical Ornaments
was seen in it; whereupon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
of that Village being sent for,
they with his advice carried the
Body to the Church, and with
great reverence placed it near the
the Altar; the night following
St. <hi>Ivo</hi> appeared in a very reverend
form, and with great brightness, to
a Carpenter called <hi>Ezi,</hi> and told
him who he was, commanding him
to signifie to <hi>Ednoth</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi>
that he should translate his and
his Companions Bodies from thence
to his Monastery; but the poor
Man, not having the boldness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
this Vision, he appeared to him
the second time, repeating the same
commands; which he still neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to perform, at the third appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition
the Bishop smote him on the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102702:34"/>
side with his Crosier, telling him,
that the pain of that stroke should
remain till he had performed what
he had enjoined him. The Man
awaking, presently after found as
grievous a pain in his side as if a
Sword had pierced it. Thus was he
compelled to declare his Vision to
the Abbot, which assoon as he had
done he was freed of his pain: But
the Abbot would give no credit to
what the Man told him, but calling
him Clown and Fool, said, <hi>Must we
translate and venerate the Ashes of I
know not what Cobler?</hi> The night
following the Bishop appeared to the
Abbot, and said, <hi>Rise quickly, for I
whom thou scornfully call'st Cobbler, have
brought thee here a pair of Boots that
will last a good while, these thou must
put on and wear for my sake.</hi> Having
said thus, he seemed to draw on his
Legs a pair of Boots, with care to
make them sit smooth and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.
Presently the Abbot waking
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102702:34"/>
felt such horrible pain in his Legs,
that he was not able to walk or
stand, and fifteen years did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in this Infirmity. By this
Miracle, the sanctity of the Bishop
was approved, and his Body tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
to <hi>Ramsey,</hi> to whose honour
the Abbot <hi>Ednoth</hi> built a Church;
in which he placed his Tomb in
such manner, that half of it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
within, and half without the
Wall, to the end, that a Fountain
of Water that flowed thence might
be ready for the use of every one
who came in devotion, whether
the Church was shut or not; which
Water, by the Merits of the Bishop,
had the virtue to cure many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases;
one great Miracle wrought
there was on a Monk troubled with
a Dropsie, his skin was strangely
swell'd, and his breath so noisome,
none could approach him, and his
drought was so excessive, that he
thought he could drink whole bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102702:35"/>
on a time, by admonition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in his sleep, he went to Saint
<hi>Ivo</hi>'s Monument, where after he had
taken three draughts of the Water,
he cast up all the superfluous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
within him, and was restored
to perfect health. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 293.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Sebert</hi> having built St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
Church at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
it with many possessions;
now on the night before the day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for the Dedication of this
Church, St. <hi>Peter</hi> appearing to a
certain Fisherman in the habit of a
stranger, on the other side of the
River of <hi>Thames,</hi> demanded to be
wafted over, which was done;
being gone out of the Boat, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Church in the sight of
the Fisherman, and presently a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
light shone so clear, that it
turned the Night into Day. There
was with the Apostle a multitude of
Heavenly Citizens, coming out and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102702:35"/>
going into the Church, a Divine
Melody sounded, and an Odour of
unexpressible fragrancy shed abroad.
As soon as all things pertaining to
the Dedication of the Church were
performed, St. <hi>Peter</hi> return'd to the
poor Fisherman, who was so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
with his Divine splendor
that he almost lost his senses, but
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> kindly comforting him,
brought him to himself. Thus both
of them entring into the Boat, St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
asked him if he had any provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
who answered, that partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stupified with seeing so great
a Light, and partly detained by his
return, he had taken nothing, being
withal assured of a good Reward
from him: Hereto St. <hi>Peter</hi> replied,
let down thy Nets, the Fisherman
obey'd, and immediately the Net
was filled with a multitude of Fishes,
they were all of the same kind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
one Salmon of a wonderful
largeness. Having then drawn them
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102702:36"/>
to the shore, St. <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>Carry
from me this great Fish to</hi> Mellitus <hi>the
Bishop, and all the rest take for thy
hire; and moreover be assured, that
both thou all thy life time, and thy
Children after thee for many years shall
be plentifully furnished with these kind
of Fishes; only be careful you Fish not
on our Lords days. I who speak now
with thee am</hi> Peter, <hi>and I my self have
now Dedicated this Church, built to my
fellow-Citizens and to My Honour, so
preventing by my own Authority the
Episcopal Benediction. Acquaint the
Bishop therefore with the things thou
hast seen and heard, and the Sign yet
marked on the Wall will confirm thy
speeches. Let him therefore surcease
from his design of Consecrating the
Church, and only supply what I have
omitted, the Celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Instruction of the People.
Let him likewise give notice to all, that
I my self will oftentimes visit this place,
and be present at the Prayers of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102702:36"/>
faithful; and will open the Gates of
Heaven to all that live soberly, justly
and piously in this World.</hi> As soon as
he said this, he presently vanisht from
his sight. The next morning, as
the Bishop <hi>Mellitus</hi> was going in
Procession to the Church, with an
intention to Dedicate it, the Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erman
met him with the Fish, and
related to him whatsoever St. <hi>Peter</hi>
had enjoyn'd him: at which the
Bishop was astonished, and having
unlockt the Church doors, he saw
the Pavement mark'd with Letters
and Inscriptions both in <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin,</hi> and the Wall annointed in
twelve several places with Holy
Oyl; he saw likewise the remainders
of twelve Torches sticking to as
many Crosses, and the Church every
where yet moist with Aspersions.
All which being observ'd by the
Bishop and People, they gave thanks.
A further Testimony of this Miracle
is afforded by the whole Progeny of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102702:37"/>
this Fisherman, for his Children,
according to the command from
their Father, brought the Tythes of
all their gains by Fishing, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Priests
attending Divine Service in his
Church. But one among them
having presumed to defraud the
Church of this Oblation, presently
was deprived of the wonted benefit
of his Trade, till having confess'd
his fault, and restored what he had
reserv'd, he promised amendment
for the future. And moreover, the
Fisherman, who was very simple,
and as yet not a Christian, <hi>described
to the Bishop very exactly the Shape and
Lineaments of St.</hi> Peter, well known
to the Bishop by his Picture at <hi>Rome.

to him, <hi>O holy man! restore our Son
to us, that we may more firmly believe

               <p>On a certaim time he was rapt
from his body, and in that extasie,
which continued from evening to
Cock-crowing, he was favoured
with the sight of troops of Angels.
Three days after, being again in an
extasie, he saw yet more glorious
apparitions of Angels. Moreover
there were discovered to him, very
earnest contentions of wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
who by many Accusations of
a certain Sinner, lately dead, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to stop his passage to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but by reason the holy Angels
protected him, they could not effect
their desire. On a certain time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
elevated in spirit, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Angels which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
him, to look down upon
the Earth; whereupon, bowing his
Eyes downward, he saw as it were
a dark Valley under him, in a very
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102702:39"/>
low bottom: He saw likewise in the
Air four Fires, not much distant one
from another, and asking the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
what Fires those were, he was
told, that those were the Fires
which now inflamed the World, and
would in the end consume it, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Fire of Lying, the Fire of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
the Fire of Dissention,
and the Fire of Iniquity. Now these
four Fires increasing by little, at last
joyned together, and became an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Flame; and when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
near them, <hi>Fursey</hi> was
affraid, and said to the Angel, <hi>Sir,
behold, the Flames come close to us;</hi>
but the Angel answered, <hi>Fear not,
for since thou didst not kindle this Fire,
it will not burn thee; for though this
Flame seems to thee great and terrible,
yet it tryes every one according to his
Merits, so that the Concupiscence which
is in any one, shall burn in this Fire;
for accordingly as every one being in the
Body is inflamed by unlawful pleasures,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102702:39"/>
so being loosed from his Body shall he burn
by condign torment.</hi> Then he saw one
of the three Angels, which in both
Visions had been his Conductors, go
before the other and divide the
Flame, and the other two flying on
each side of him, which defended
him from the danger of the Fire.
He saw likewise many Devils flying
through the Fire, and kindling war
against the Just: These malign Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
pursued him likewise with Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations,
but the good Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
him: And after this, he
saw great numbers of blessed Spirits,
among which some were of his
own Nation, Priests who had well
discharged their Office, as he had
heard by report; by these he was
informed of many things, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
both to himself and all who
are willing to attend them. When
they had finished their speeches, and
were returned to Heaven with the
rest of the Angels, there remained
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102702:40"/>
only with St. <hi>Fursey</hi> the three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
mentioned before, who were
to restore him to his body. And
when he came close to the foresaid
great Fire, one of the Angels divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it as before; but when the Man
of God was come to a door which
stood open among the Flames, the
unclean Spirits snatching up one of
those whom they were tormenting
in the Flames, and casting him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him touched him, and burnt
his Shoulder and one of his Cheeks.
He knew the Man, and remembred
when he was ready to dye he had
received from him a Garment. But
the Angel, laying hold of him, cast
him back into the Fire; but the
Devil answered, <hi>Do not cast him
back, since you have once received him;
for as you have taken the Goods belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Sinner, so you must be partakers
of his Punnishment;</hi> but the Angel
replied, <hi>He took not that out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness,
but for saving the Mans
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102702:40"/>
Soul.</hi> After this, the burning cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and the Angel turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to St. <hi>Fursey,</hi> said, <hi>The Fire that
thou hast kindled has now burnt thee,
for if thou hadst not received Money
from this Man who is dead in his sins,
thou hadst not tasted of his torments.</hi>
St. <hi>Fursey</hi> being afterwards restored
to his body, carried visibly in his
shoulder and cheek, all his life time,
the marks of the burning which he
had suffered in his soul. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 354.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Eanswitha</hi>'s Monastery being
seated on the top of high Rocks,
they found this incommodity in
their retirement, which was a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury
of sweet water: The holy
Virgin was sensible of this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience;
and after she had by Prayer
sollicited our Lord, she went to
the Fountain more than a mile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the Monastery, and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the water with a Staff com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it to follow her; the deaf
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102702:41"/>
Element heard and obeyed the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Virgins voice, and against the
inclination of Nature followed her
steps, till overcoming all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the passage, it mounted
up to the Monastery, where it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
served all their uses. One
particular more increased the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

And likewise on a certain day, as he
was journeying alone, about the
third hour, he turned aside into the
House of a certain Matron, being
desirous to repose there a while, and
to get food not for himself but his
Horse: The Woman received him
kindly, and earnestly desired that
she might make something ready
for his refection; but he refused,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102702:41"/>
telling her, that he could not eat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was a day of Fast, for it was
indeed <hi>Friday,</hi> she notwithstanding
persisted in her desire, and told him,
that all the rest of his Journey he
would find no Habitation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I desire you would eat, lest you
should faint if you fast all day; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
out of love to fasting,
he would not be overcome by the
Womans importunity, but fasting
as he was he continued his Journey
till evening; when St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> saw
he could not finish his Journey that
day, neither was there any Lodging
near, as he was riding he saw cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Cottages, which in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time the Heardsmen had built
for their present use, but then the
Winter approaching, they were left
empty; thither he went with an
intention to stay all night, and tying
his Horse to the Wall, he gathered
up a bundle of Hay which the wind
had blown from the House-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102702:42"/>
and gave it him to eat, and
himself passed his time in Prayer.
But on a sudden he saw the Horse
lift up his head, and with his teeth
biting somewhat that was on the
House-roof, and presently after he
drew down a linnen Cloth wrapped
up; being desirous therefore to
know what that was, he took up
the linnen, and found wrapped up
in it half a Loaf of Bread warm from
the Oven, and so much Flesh as
would suffice himself for one refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
he blessed God, who vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to provide a Supper for him
and his companion; half of the
bread therefore he gave to his Horse,
and the other half he eat himself.

through a hole which the <hi>Danes</hi> had
made in the Sepulcher, and looking
in as curiously as he could, searched
round about the Tomb. And not
content with this, with the end of
a forked stick he endeavoured to
draw to him the Cloaths in which
her Body was enwrapped, and some
part of the Body he discovered;
when the H. Virgin, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
that a vile person should
presume to look upon her naked
Body, with great violence drew
back the Cloaths, insomuch as he
striving against her fell backwards,
and was forcibly dashed against the
Pavement; by which fall he became

was struck with Madness. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 383.</p>

of St. <hi>Withburga</hi> sister to St. <hi>Ethelre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
55</hi> years after her death, when
the bodies of these two Virgins were
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102702:43"/>
Translated, that doubt was put to
the tryal. As touching St. <hi>Ethelred,</hi>
considering the antient proofs of her
incorruption, none durst presume
to touch her body; but they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the body of St. <hi>Withburga</hi> as
far as her Breasts, and she was seen
perfectly entire, more like to one
asleep than dead, with a silk Cushion
under her Head, her Veil and Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
shining as if they had been
new, her Countenance chearful,
with a Rosie blush; her Teeth white,
her Lips a little opened, and her
Breasts exceeding small. One of
the Monks adventuring to touch
her body, a lively blush coloured her
Cheeks, as if she still had breath in
her. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 385.</p>
               <p>It hapned on a certain Sunday,
when St. <hi>Winefrids</hi> Parents were
gone to Church, some necessary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
detained her at home; at
which time a certain Young man
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102702:43"/>
named <hi>Caradoc,</hi> the Son of <hi>Alan</hi>
Prince of the Countrey entred the
House, where he found the Virgin
alone sitting by the Fire; she know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Prince, hastily rose up, and
desired to know his pleasure. His
answer was, <hi>You are not ignorant who
I am, and how I abound in riches and
honour; all these riches and honours
you shall partake if you will yield to my
will.</hi> The Virgin perceiving his
intent, held down her Head and
blushed extremely: At first she
seemed as if she were much troubled
that he should find her unadorned,
and she told him, <hi>Sir, you being a
Prince, there is no doubt but you are able
to heap upon me all wordly happiness in
abundance, if I were your Wife; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be pleased to expect here a while
till my Fathers return, in the mean time
I have some business in my Chamber,
and will return presently.</hi> This she
said to gain a little time, for she saw
the Young man burning with Lust;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102702:44"/>
with much ado he permitted her to
go to her Chamber, having hopes
she would return as soon as she was
dressed; she therefore entred hastily
her Chamber, and as hastily went
out at the other door, and ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Church. As soon as the
Young man perceived this, he drew
his Sword, run after her, and soon
overtaking her, with a stern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
strook off her Head; and
immediately in the place where it
fell to the Earth, a most pure and
plentiful Spring gushed forth, which
flows to this day, and by the Holy
Virgins merits gives Health to a
World of Diseased persons. It being
in the steep descent of a Hill where
the Virgins Head was cut off, it
lightly running down to the bottom,
slid into the Church, whereas the
Body remained in the place where
it first fell. The Congregation were
wonderfully astonished to see the
Head tumbling among their Feet,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102702:44"/>
they all went out, and found the
Murtherer near the liveless body, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his Sword on the grass: S. <hi>Bueno</hi>
therefore seeing his pride, and having
in his hand the Virgins Head, looked
on him and said, <hi>Impious Villain!
hast thou no shame of the stain where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
thou hast defiled thy high Birth?
and shewest thou no repentance of this
horrible crime? thou hast disturbed the
peace, thou hast polluted the Church,
thou hast provoked God: since therefore
it is so, I beseech him without delay to
inflict on thee a just punishment for this
thy detestable crime.</hi> As soon as he
had ended these words the Young
man fell to the ground, gave up the
Ghost, and which was more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
his Body presently disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and many say it was swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by the Earth, and with
the wicked Soul sunk into Hell.
But <hi>Bueno</hi> kissing the Head which
he had in his hand, joyned it to the
body, covering it with his Mantle,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102702:45"/>
celebrated Mass at the Altar, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and prayed that the Virgins
Soul might return to her Body; this
Prayer being ended the Virgin rose
up as from sleep, and cleansing her
Face from the dust and sweat, filled
the Congregation with wonder and
Joy. Now in the place where the
Head was rejoyned to the body there
appeared a white circle compassing
the Neck, small as a white Thred,
which continued so all her life;
and from that white circle she had
the name of <hi>Winefrid;</hi> and after her
death when she appeared to any,
that white mark was alwayes visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The place where her blood
was shed is at this day called St. <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefrids</hi>
Well. The stones likewise
both where the Springs gusheth
forth, and beneath in the Current,
having been sprinkled with her
blood, retain the redness to these
times; which colour neither the
length of many Ages, nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102702:45"/>
sliding of the water over
them, has been able to wash away.
And moreover a certain Moss, which
sticks to the said stones, renders a
fragrant odour like Incense. <hi>Cr.
p.</hi> 389.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Clare,</hi> an Hermit, when come
to years of maturity, was by his
Parents affianced to a beautiful Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;
but when the time wherein
the Marriage was to be solemnized
approached, the young Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
himself form his Parents
House, and out of <hi>Britany</hi> passed
over into <hi>France;</hi> but there a Noble
Woman dwelling near him, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with lust, impudently attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
his Chastity; but St. <hi>Clare</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
resisted the shameless Lady;
notwithstanding which resistance,
when her sollicitations still more and
more increased, he was forced to
forsake his Monastery; the lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Lady desperately inraged with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102702:46"/>
his departure, sent two Murderers
in search of him, who at last found
him in a poor Cottage, there they
set upon him with opprobrious spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and at last drawing out their
Swords they cut off his Head:
St. <hi>Clare</hi> presently after arose, and
with his Hands taking up his Head,
by the assistance of Angels, carried
it to a Fountain not far distant, into
which he cast it, and then carried
the same back to the Oratory of his
Cell, and going on a little further
towards a Village near the River
<hi>Epta,</hi> he there consummated his
Course. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 411.</p>
               <p>Two Kentish Princes, <hi>Ethelred</hi>
and <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> being murdered, and
buried under the Seat where the
King was wont to sit, the Murder
was most miraculously discovered;
wherefore taking up the Bodies,
and honourably putting them in
Coffins, the Arch-bishop <hi>Theodorus</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:102702:46"/>
commanded to carry them to <hi>Christ-Church</hi>
in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but in vain
they attempted this, for with all
the force they could use they could
not remove them out of the place;
whereupon, changing his purpose,
he advised to transport them to the
Church of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> but with as
little success as before; at last, it was
agreed they should be carried to the
Monastery of <hi>Wering,</hi> of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
in those days, which being
resolved upon, the Bodies were as
easily removed as if they had no
weight at all; being arrived at that
place, the Bodies were buried near
the great Altar, where many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Miracles are daily wrought.
<hi>Cr. p.</hi> 412.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Wilfrid</hi> entring into a Village
called <hi>Tiddafrey,</hi> there met him a
great multitude of Women, offering
their Children to be confirmed by
him. Amongst them, one Woman
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102702:47"/>
mingled her self, craftily carrying in
her Arms her dead Child, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that he should be Catechised,
but inwardly perswaded that by the
Bishops sanctity he should be restored
to Life; the Bishop therefore unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Childs face, to the end
he might perform the due Rites,
found that he was dead; then the
Woman perceiving that her fraud
did not succeed, betook her self to
prayers, earnestly beseeching him
for God and his Holy Mothers sake,
if he had any Faith or Pity, torestore
Life to her Child, saying this, she
cast her self at his Feet, and would
not be removed, thus offering an
importunate violence toward him:
All this while the Bishop continued
doubtful, whether he should seem
rash in attempting the Miracle, or
reject the Tears and Prayers of the
disconsolate Woman, but a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Pity at last got the victory;
therefore, after he had with a low
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102702:47"/>
voice repeated certain devout pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
out of the Psalms, he laid his
Right Hand upon the dead Body,
whereupon immediately the Soul
was restored, for by gasping, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Eye-lids, and stirring his
whole Body, he gave proof that he
was alive. The Child was called
<hi>Ethelwald,</hi> who was afterward a
Monk at <hi>Rippon.</hi>

               <p>Another Miracle wrought by

asunder all his Members, was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Health by the Prayers of the
Bishop and his Covent. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 422.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Ositha</hi>'s Head being cut off by
a <hi>Danish</hi> Pirate, at the very place a
clear Fountain broke forth, which
cured several kind of Diseases; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
assoon as her Head was off,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102702:48"/>
the Body presently rose up, and
taking up the Head in the Hands,
by the conduct of Angels walked
firmly the straight way to the
Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> about
a quarter of a Mile distant from the
place of her suffering; and when it
was come there, it knocked at the
door with the bloody Hands, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
it might be opened, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
left marks of blood; having done
this, it fell there down to the ground.

he made complaint to
St. <hi>Wereburga,</hi> whereupon she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him, saying, <hi>Go your ways and
shut them all up in a house.</hi> He won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
at so strange a command,
thought the Saint spoke those words
in jest: but when she renew'd the

a serious manner, he returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Corn, where seeing great
numbers of such fowl devouring the
grain, he with a loud voice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them in his Mistresses name
to follow him; hereupon immedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they all in one drove followed
him, and were shut up together in a
House. Now it hapned that a certain
servant privately stole one of the said
birds, which he kill'd and hid, with
intention to eat it. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
early the Holy Virgin went to
the house, where after she had in a
chiding manner reprehended the
birds for usurping that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
not to them, she commanded
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102702:49"/>
them to flye away and not return:
Immediately the whole army of
them took wing; but being sensible
of the injury done them, they flew
not away, but hovering over the
Holy Virgins head, with wonderful
noyse made complaint of their loss.
She hearing their importunate cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
understood by inspiration
the cause thereof; and after search
made, the Offender confessed his
theft; whereupon she commanded
the bird to be restored to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;
after which they all with
one consent flew away, so as not any
bird of that kind was afterward
seen in that Territory. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 427.</p>
               <p>After St. <hi>Wereburga</hi> was dead her
Body was carried to the Church of
<hi>Trickingham,</hi> where it was most
diligently kept, the doors of the
Church being carefully barred, and
a Watch moreover set upon it. But
one night a deep sleep suddenly seised

the same time great multitudes of

falling to the ground. Whereupon

carried it to <hi>Hambury,</hi> where it was

               <head>A wonderful Miracle, shewing the
efficacy of the Holy Sacrifice of the
Mass.</head>
               <p>In a Battel where Prince <hi>Elwin</hi>
was slain, among others there was
one of the Princes Souldiers named
<hi>Imma</hi> slain, (at least in opinion.) This
Souldier all that day and the night
following lay among the other dead
bodies, as if he had been slain; but
at last his Spirit returning he sate
up, and as well as he could, bound
up the wounds he had received;
then resting himself a while, he raised
himself on his feet, and began to
walk away, with an intention to
find out, if possible, some friends,
who might take care of him. As
he was going away, he was met
with and taken by some of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and brought to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102702:51"/>
their Captain, a principal Officer
of King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> who examined
him what he was. The poor man
was afraid to acknowledge himself
a Souldier, therefore he answered
that he was a poor countrey-man,
who had a Wife, and was come in
this Expedition with several others
of the like quality, to bring Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Army. Upon this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Officer commanded that
care should be taken of his Wounds,
and when they began to be almost
cured, he made him every night to
be put in Chains, to prevent his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away; but no Chains could
hold him, for after they were gone
which had put the Chains upon
him, they presently fell off. And
the cause of this Wonder was this;
He had a Brother named <hi>Tunna,</hi> a
Priest and Abbot of a Monastery in
a certain Town which at this day
from his name is called <hi>Tunnacestir.</hi>
This Abbot having heard that his
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102702:51"/>
Brother was slain in the late battel,
came himself to search for his body;
and having found another in all
regards very like to his, he carried
it to his Monastery, and there buried
it honourably. Moreover he took
care that several Masses should be
said for the pardon of his sins; and
by vertue of those Masses it came to
pass that no bands could hold him,
but they presently fell loose from
him. In the mean time the Officer
whose Prisoner he was, began to ask
him, How came it to pass that he
could not be bound? Whether he
had about him certain Charms,
which as some think, have a power
to untie all bands? His answer was,
that he was utterly ignorant of such
unlawful Arts; <hi>But,</hi> said he, <hi>I have
a Brother in mine own countrey, and
I am assured that he thinking I am
slain, says frequent Masses for me; so
that if I were now in the other World,
I doubt not but my Soul by his intercession
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102702:52"/>
and prayers, would be absolved from all
pains.</hi> After he had continued a
good space a Prisoner to the said Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
those who guarded him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by his countenance, gesture
and speeches that he was no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-peasant,
but a person of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Thereupon the Officer calling
him aside privately, enquired more
diligently who he was; withal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
him that if he would simply
declare his condition, he would not
use him any thing the worse. He
then plainly manifested to him that
he was a Servant of the King of
the <hi>Northumbers.</hi> Whereupon the
Officer replied, <hi>I did assure my self
by the manner of thy speech, that thou
wert not of a base condition: and now
thou deservest to dye, in revenge of all
my brethren and kinsmen who have
been slain in the Battel: but because
I will not break my promise, I will not
kill thee.</hi> As soon therefore as he
had recovered health and strength
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102702:52"/>
the Officer sold him to a certain
man at <hi>London</hi> called <hi>Freson.</hi> But
neither could he be bound by his
new Master; for after tryal of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sorts of Bands and Chains,
they became all unloosed. When
he therefore who had bought him
perceived that he could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by Fetters, he gave him
permission to redeem himself, if he
could. For commonly after nine of
the Clock in the morning, the usual
time of Masses, his Bands were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed.
Upon this offer the Prisoner
was suffered to depart, having first
given his promise by Oath, that he
would either send the money agreed
on for his Ransom, or return and
yield himself a Prisoner again. He
went therefore from <hi>London</hi> into
<hi>Kent,</hi> to King <hi>Lothere,</hi> Nephew to
the famous Queen <hi>Ethelreda</hi> by her
Sister, who likewise had formerly
been a Servant to the said Queen;
and from him the Prisoner received
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102702:53"/>
the Money appointed for his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
which according to promise
he sent to his Master. Being thus
free, after some time he returned to
his Countrey, and coming to his
Brother the Abbot, he related to
him particularly all the Accidents,
both good and bad, which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln
him; and then perceived, that
his Chains for the most part had
been loosed precisely at the Hours
in which Masses had been celebrated
for him, and moreover that many
other commodities and comforts
had befaln him from Heaven in his
dangers, by his Brothers Prayers,
and the Oblation of the Saving
Sacrifice. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 439.</p>
               <p>On a certain day St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> came
to the Village of a certain Count,
whose Wife at that time lay sick
at the point of death; the Count
himself met him in the way, and
conducted him into his House, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102702:53"/>
acquainted him with the desperate
state of his Wife, beseeching him
that he would give his benediction
to Water for sprinkling her; the
Bishop assented to the Mans request;
and Water being brought, he blessed
it, and gave it to a Priest, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to sprinkle the sick Lady
with it; who thereupon entred into
her Chamber, where she lay like
one deprived of sense and life, and
both sprinkled her face and bed,
yea withal, opening her Mouth,
distilled a few drops into it; the
Holy Water had no sooner touched
her, but <hi>O wonderful!</hi> though she
was utterly ignorant of what had
been done, she presently recovered
a perfect health of Body and Mind,
and without delay rising up, she her
self came to do service to the Bishop,
being the first of the whole Family
which presented to him a Cup of
refection. <hi>Cr. pag.</hi> 469.</p>

The Divine Disposition being
pleased to demonstrate in how great
Glory St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> lived after his
death, gave this Testimony: Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years after his burial his Brother
Monks, opening his Sepulchre to
take up his bones, found his body
perfectly intire, with a lively fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and all his limbs as flexible as
if he had been alive, so that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
like a person rather asleep
than dead; moreover all his Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were not only undecayed,
but appeared in their primitive fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and also with the addition of a
wonderful lustre. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 473.</p>
               <p>A Coffin of stone was prepared
for entombing the body of King
<hi>Sebbe,</hi> but when they endeavour'd
to put the body into it, they found
that it was a hands breadth too long
for the Coffin; whereupon paring
away as much of the stone at each
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102702:54"/>
end as they could, they thereby
lengthened it about the measure of
two fingers breadths, yet after all it
would not receive the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
finding so great a difficulty to
inter him, they intended, either to
seek out a new Coffin, or to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by hewing the body to shorten
it so much as to make it enter into
the Coffin; but by a wonderful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
which could proceed from
no less than an Heavenly Power,
both these designs of theirs were
prevented, for presently in the sight
of the Bishop, and <hi>Sighard</hi> Son to the

with his brother <hi>Seofrid</hi> Reigned
after him, a great multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

remained four fingers breadths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

seen. This Man was an honest
House-keeper, who with his Family
lived a Religious Life in a Region
of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> called <hi>Incunin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum;</hi>
who having been struck with
a Disease, the same growing more
and more violent upon him, it
brought him to extremity, so that
on a certain day towards evening he
died; but the day following early
he came to life, and suddenly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himself up in his bed, all those
who mournfully watched the body,
were terribly affrighted and ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
only his Wife, whose love
to him was excessive, though she
trembled at the sight, staid still by
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:102702:55"/>
The Man seeing his Wife, bid
her be of comfort: <hi>Fear not,</hi> said he,
<hi>for I am truly restored to life from death
which had seized me, and permission is
given me to live a while longer among
Men; but my conversation hereafter,
must be quite otherwise than formerly
it has been.</hi> Having said this, he
presently rose, and went to an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of that Village, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
a good while in Prayer:
Afterward having divided his whole
Substance into three Portions, one
Portion he gave to his Wife, a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to his Children, and the third
he distributed to the Poor.</p>
               <p>Not long after, having thus freed
himself from all worldly cares, he
went to the Monastery of <hi>Mailros,</hi>
where having received <hi>Tonsure</hi> he
entred into a Religious Life.</p>
               <p>Now the account which he gave
of his <hi>Visions,</hi> was on this manner:
A certain person brightly shining in
his face and vestments, conducted
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102702:56"/>
me, and we walked together silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as it seemed to me, towards the
place where the Sun rises in high
Summer: Thus walking together,
we came to a place where there was
on our left hand, a Valley of a vast
depth and breadth, and the length
of it seemed infinite; one side of
this Valley was terrible with its
burning flames, and the other no
less intollerable for the cold blasts,
hail and snow, driving through it;
and both these places were full of
mens souls, which seemed to be
forcibly tossed from one side to the
other, for those which were in the
fire, not being able to endure its
scorching, leaped into the horrible
cold, and not finding ease there,
they leaped back into the unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
flames. Having observed an
infinite number of deformed souls
thus tormented, with an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
vicissitude of tortures,
without any respite of ease, I began
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102702:56"/>
to think that this place was surely
Hell, of whose intollerable torments
I had oft heard Preachers speak. But
my <hi>Conductor</hi> who went before me,
answered these my thoughts, saying,
<hi>Do not entertain such an imagination;
for this is not Hell, as thou thinkest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when he saw me affrighted
with so horrible a spectacle, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
me leisurely somewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where I saw all places round
about me become obscure, and at
length filled with utter darkness.
Into which when we were entred,
the darkness was so thick, that I
could see nothing but the shape and
vestment of my <hi>Conductor.</hi> And as
we went on further in this shady
darkness, on a sudden there appeared
before us frequent globes of hideous
flames ascending out of a deep pit,
and again falling down into it.</p>
               <p>When I was come thither, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
my Guide vanished out of
sight, leaving me alone in the midst
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102702:57"/>
of this darkness and horrid specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
But when the said globes of Fire
without any intermission mounted
up, and again fell down, I perceive
that they full of were humane
Souls, which like sparks of fire car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up by the smoak, were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
cast upward, and then drawn
back by the vapours of fire. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
an unexpressibly noysom stink
belched out by those vapours filled
all the dark spaces round about. As
I was thus standing still in a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
fright, being uncertain what
to do, whither to go, and what
would be the end of all this, I heard
behind my back a most horrible
noise, as of persons wailing in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable
misery, and also at the
same time I heard others loudly and
scornfully laughing, as the rude vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
people are wont to do when
they insult over their captive ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
When this noise came nearer
to me, I perceived a troop of wicked
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102702:57"/>
Spirits haling into the midst of that
darkness the Souls of men which
wofully cryed out, whilst the others
burst forth into laughters. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
these Souls I could distinctly
see one that was shaved like an <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical</hi>
person, another was a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and a third was a Woman.
These unhappy Souls thus haled
along by those spitefully malicious
Spirits, at length were plunged into
the midst of that burning pit. Into
which after they were descended a
good way, I could no longer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
hear the wailing of Men, and
laughing of Devils, but only had
in mine ears remaining a confused
promiscuous sound.</p>
               <p>In the mean time certain obscure,
Spirits ascended out of that fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vomiting
pit, which approached me
on all sides, and with flaming eyes
and stinking fire issuing out of their
mouths and nostrils vexed me grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously.
Moreover, with fiery pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102702:58"/>
which they held in their hands
they threatned to catch me; but for
all that, though they frighted me,
they had not the boldness to touch
me. Being thus on all sides encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with darkness and enemies,
I turned mine eyes every way to see
if there were any one to deliver me.
At last there appeared by the way
which I had passed something that
shone like a Star, which increasing
and approaching nearer and nearer,
as soon as it came to me, all those
hateful Spirits which had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
with their fiery pincers to
lay hold on me, were dispersed and
fled.</p>
               <p>Now he whose coming drove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
these Spirits was the same who
at first had been my <hi>Conductor;</hi> who
presently after turning his steps
more southerly toward the East,
led me out of that darkness into a
clear and lightsom air; in which
after we had walked a while, I saw
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102702:58"/>
before us a mighty Wall, of the
length and height whereof every
way I could see no end, I began then
to marvel to what purpose we should
go to that Wall, in which I could
discover neither door, window, nor
any other passage. But being come
to it, presently, I know not by what
means, we found our selves on the
top of it. And there appeared to
me a most large pleasant Field, so
replenished with all sorts of odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
Flowers, that the sweet fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy
of them immediately took
away all the former stench of the
dark fiery furnace. And so great
was the light there on all sides, that
it far exceeded the brightness of
mid-day. Moreover there were in
that field innumerable assemblies of
men in pure white garments, all
rejoycing and singing. Now as he
led me among these happy Quires,
I began to think, that this might be
the Kingdom of Heaven, which I
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102702:59"/>
had oft heard preached of. But he
again answered to my thought, <hi>No,
this is not Heaven, as thou supposest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as we passed on in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
I saw before mine eyes a far
greater and more pleasant Light
than we had seen before, and in that
Light I heard a most sweet melody
of persons joyfully singing, and so
wonderful a fragrancy of a most
sweet odour issued from thence, that
the former sweetness, which before
seemed excessive to me, now I very
meanly esteemed; as likewise the
former Light compared with this,
appeared almost obscure. Now,
when I was in a hopeful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that we should enter into this
blessed place, my <hi>Guide</hi> made a stop;
and presently turning his steps, he
lead me back again the way that we
had come.</p>
               <p>And when in our return we were
come to the joyful mansions of those
Inhabitants cloathed in white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102702:59"/>
he said to me, <hi>Doest thou
know what these things are which thou
hast seen?</hi> I answered, No. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>That</hi> Valley which thou sawest
so terrible by the scorching flames
and horrible frosts, is the place in
which those souls are to be tried and
afflicted, which having delayed to
confess and amend their sins, at the
very point of death retire for safety
to repentance, and so depart out of
the body: These, because even in
the last moment of their lives, they
confessed and were contrite for their
sins, they shall all at least in the day
of <hi>Iudgment</hi> come to the Kingdom
of Heaven; and many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that day, are eased and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the <hi>Prayers, Fasting,</hi> and
<hi>Alms</hi> of the Living, and especially
by the celebrating the most <hi>Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
Moreover, that flame-vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and stinking pit which thou
sawest, is the very Mouth of Hell,
into which whosoever once falls,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102702:60"/>
he shall never come out of it for all
eternity.</p>
               <p>As for this pleasant flowery field
here before thine eyes, in which
thou seest such multitudes of youth
making merry, and cloathed with
white raiment, this is the place
which is the Receptacle of such
souls which have continued to their
death in the exercise of virtue, but
yet their works have not been of
such perfection, as to deserve their
present admission into the Kingdom
of Heaven; yet all these in the day
of <hi>Iudgment</hi> shall arrive unto the
Vision of our Lord, and the joys
of his heavenly Kingdom. But as
for those, who in their words, works
and thoughts, have attained to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
such assoon as they have left
the body shall enter into that <hi>blessed
Kingdom.</hi> To the Confines of which
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> that <hi>Place</hi> pertains where
thou sawest so great a <hi>Light,</hi> and
heardest so sweet <hi>Harmony,</hi> and wast
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102702:60"/>
refreshed with so admirably sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smelling
Odours.</p>
               <p>Thou therefore having seen all
these things, must presently return
to thy Body, and again as formerly
live among men. If then hereafter
thou wilt be diligent to examine all
thine actions, and to observe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness
and simplicity in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
and speeches, thou also
after death shalt receive a mansion
among these joyful troops of happy
Spirits. For I, having departed for
a time from thee, did it to this end,
that I might see what would in the
end become of thee. When he had
spoken thus to me, I had a horrible
aversion from returning to my Body,
being extremely delighted with the
sweetness and beauty of that place
which I saw, and the happy society
of the persons living in it. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
I had not the boldness
to make any such request to my
Guide. And whilst I was busie in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102702:61"/>
these thoughts, I know not how, I
presently perceived that I was again
alive among men. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 500.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Decumanus,</hi> when his Head
was cut from his Body, the Trunk
raising it self up, took the Head,
which it carried from the place
wher it was slain to a Spring
not far off, which flowed with a
most chrystalline Water, in which
with the Hands it washed the blood
away; which Spring, in reverend
memory of the Saint, is to this day
called St. <hi>Decumanus</hi> Spring; near
to which place the Body together
with the Head was buried. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 526.</p>
               <p>In those dayes there was in the
Territory of <hi>Worcester</hi> a certain place
wholly uncultivated, and almost
unpassable by reason of thorns and
bryars growing thick there. This
place formerly called <hi>Homme,</hi> was
in succeeding times named <hi>Eovesham,</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:102702:61"/>
for the reason which I shall now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
St. <hi>Egwin</hi> had appoinetd four
Shepherds to feed their flocks about
the said Wood for the sustenance
of his Monks. Now on a certain
day it hapned that one of the said
Shepherds, named <hi>Eoves,</hi> entring
deeply into the midst of the Wood,
there appeared before him a certain
most glorious Virgin, attended by
two others, her splendour darkned
that of the Sun it self, and her beauty
incomparably exceeded all wordly
features: she held in her Hand a
Book, out of which she with the
other two Virgins, sung Hymns of
praise to God. The poor man da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeled
with this splendor upon which
he durst not fix his eyes, stood a
while silent and trembling, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after in great fear retired
home, and repairing to the Bishop
acquainted him with his Vision.
The Holy Bishop considering the
matter advisedly with himself, on a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102702:62"/>
certain day after he had fasted and
prayed, taking three companions
with him, went toward the place
described by the Shepherd, walking
all the way bare-foot, praying and
singing Psalms; and commanding
his attendants to stop at a distance,
he himself passed further into the
Wood, and being come to the place,
he fell prostrate on the ground,
where with many sighs and tears he
remained a good space imploring
a merciful regard from our Lord.
After which he rose up from prayer,
and immediately there appeared to
him the three Virgins, with the
same majesty and glory as before;
among whom she who stood in the
midst seemed more tall and resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
than the other, in pure white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
infinitely excelling Lillies, and
in freshness Roses, and from her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
a celestial and inestimable
odour: she held in her hand a Book,
together with a golden Cross casting
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102702:62"/>
forth bright heams of light. Now
whilst he thought within himself,
that surely this was the Mother of
our Lord, the said glorious Virgin
as it were approving such his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
pious cogitation, stretching
forth the said Cross gave him a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction
with it, and presently with
that farewel disappeared. The Holy
man with great joy rendring thanks
to God for this favour, understood
thereby that it was God will that
the same place should be consecrated
to his Service, and dedicated to
the honour of the Blessed Virgin
Mother of Lord. For during his
former afflictions and persecutions
he had made a Vow, that if God
would vouchsafe to give a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
end to his desires, he would
build a Church to his Service. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
without delay he cleansed the
place, began the work, and shortly
brought it to perfection. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 528.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:102702:63"/>
St. <hi>Egwin,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi>
undertook a painful Pilgrimage to
<hi>Rome,</hi> thereby to satisfie for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
of his People, and withall
to do a rigorous Penance for some
faults committed in his youth: And
to render his Pilgrimage more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
he in the presence of a great
multitude bound about his Legs
certain Iron Chains, and cast the
Key which locked them together
into the River of <hi>Avon,</hi> publickly
protesting, that he would never
esteem himself secure of the pardon
of his sins, till either the Key were
restored to him, or the Chains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loosed
by a power supernatural. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with great pain performed his
Voyage, he at last arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi>
where, whilst he was performing
his Devotions in the Church of
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> his Servants going to the
Rivers side to buy provision for their
Master, they found in a Fishes belly
the Key which had formerly locked
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102702:63"/>
the Chains about his Legs, which
being brought to him, he in the
presence of a great multitude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked
the said Chains. So that he
who before was looked upon as a
Sinner, was afterwards honoured as
a Saint. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 528.</p>
               <p>In the year 711, when St. <hi>Swibert</hi>
went into a certain Village to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
Mass, a certain rich Man who
had been a Pagan, but converted
and called <hi>Peter,</hi> conducting a Cart
loaden with Materials for building
a Monastery; in the way by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the Devil <hi>Peter</hi> fell from the
Cart under the Wheels, and was
taken up dead, having his Head and
other Members grievously woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by occasion of which, there
assembled a great concourse of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when preparation was making
for his Funeral, St. <hi>Swibert</hi> came
to the place, and commanded the
Body to be carried to his Cell, which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102702:64"/>
being done, he with many sighs
and tears poured forth his Prayers
to restore to life the said <hi>Peter,</hi> who
was a Servant of his Monastery,
then rising up, and kissing the Body,
immediately the dead Man revived,
and rose up perfectly whole, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as there was not left on his
Body the least marks of any wounds,
nor no settling of any blood. <hi>Cr.
p.</hi> 538.</p>
               <p>In the same hour St. <hi>Swibert</hi> died
his Soul appeared to St. <hi>Willebrord,</hi>
requesting him that he would be
present at his Funerals in <hi>Werda;</hi>
whereupon he presently took Boat,
and with several others made haste
to <hi>Werda;</hi> where all these, as they
were the day following, according
to Custom, singing the <hi>Vigile</hi> of
the <hi>Dead,</hi> a young Man was brought
among them, who had been made
blind by Lightning, and with his
clamours interrupting the <hi>Psalmody,</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:102702:64"/>
and calling to the Saint to have his
sight restored, assoon as he had
touched the Coffin he immediately
recovered his sight. Another, who
was raging mad, being brought in,
and kissing the cover of the same
Coffin was presently restored to his
Senses. A third also, who was
possessed of the Devil, by the same
means was freed from the wicked
Spirit. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 556.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Boniface</hi> one morning celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Mass in St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Church
in <hi>Ordorf;</hi> after which, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that Dinner should be made
ready; but being told that there
was no Meat, <hi>Is it so,</hi> answered he,
<hi>how many thousand did God feed in the
Wilderness, forty years together? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
he provide for his Servant, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
soever, nourishment for one day?</hi>
Having said this, he commanded
the Table should be covered, and
presently a great Bird flew thither,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102702:65"/>
bringing in her mouth a Fish, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to satisfie all their hunger,
this Fish he bade should be dressed,
which having eaten, the remainder
was cast into the River. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 569.</p>
               <p>A certain devout Lady named
<hi>Irmgardis,</hi> attended only by two
Maids, and her Son <hi>Gocellin,</hi> a Child
of little more than eight years of
age, came to see the Solemnity of
the Canonization of St. <hi>Swibert,</hi>
(the first Saint that was solemnly
Canoniz'd,) and to demand the
Popes Benediction. Now it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that whilst the Boat in which
they came, was amongst others
turn'd about for landing, the young
Child who then stood near his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by reason of the rushing of
the Boats against one another, not
being able to keep his standing, fell
into the River; which his Mother
seeing, would have thrown her self
after him, if she had not been held
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102702:65"/>
back by such as were present. This
hapned about five of the Clock at
even. Presently one of the Maids
ran in hast to acquaint the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
with this calamity; who
came and found the Lady in the
Church, shreiking out, and almost
mad with grief; he with much ado
conducted her to his lodging, and
endeavoured to asswage her grief;
but all in vain, for the whole night
she spent in weeping, groaning and
praying to St. <hi>Swibert,</hi> by his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
piety to succour his afflicted
servant; vowing withal, that if she
might have her Child restored, she
would consecrate him for ever to
Gods service in his Church. The
day following about eight of the
clock in the morning the dead body
was found and taken up out of the
River: Which being presented to
his Mother, she became pale and fell
into a swoon; but being recovered,
she took the body in her arms, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102702:66"/>
attended with a great troop of men
and women weeping with her, she
carried it into the Church, and laid
it before the Sepulchre of St. <hi>Swibert.</hi>
After which the whole company
betook themselves to their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and within a very short time
the Childs Spirit returned into him,
so that he opened his eyes, and
standing upon his feet he looked
about with wonder on so great a
multitude, and spoke some tender
and kind words to his Mother.
<hi>Cr. p.</hi> 687.</p>
               <p>The Pagans having cut off St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s
Head, they cast it into a secret
place in a Thicket of the Wood ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning,
there it remained a whole
years space; after which the said Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
retiring out of the Countrey,
the first care of the Christians was
to honour their holy King and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.
Assembling themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
together out of their lurking-places,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102702:66"/>
they reverently took his
Body out of the unclean place where
it had been cast, and then with all
diligence sought for the Head; and
whilst every one of them with equal
affection searched each corner of
the Wood, there hapned a Wonder
not heard of in any age before. For
whilst they dispersed themselves in
all parts, and each one demanded
of his companions, where it was
that the <hi>Danes</hi> had cast the Head, the
same Head answered them aloud in
their own tongue, <hi>Here, here, here;</hi>
neither did it cease to cry out in the
same words, till it had brought them
to the place. And to add to the
wonder, there they found a mighty
and fierce Wolf, which with its
fore-feet held the Head, as if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to watch and defend it
from other beasts. When they were
come, the Wolf quietly resigned it
to them. So with joyful hymns to
God they carried and joyn'd it to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102702:67"/>
the body, the Wolf in the mean
time following them to the place
where they buried it, after which,
the Beast returned into the Wood;
in all which time, neither did the
Wolf hurt any one, neither did any
one shew the least intention to hurt
the Wolf. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 736.</p>
               <p>A certain <hi>Scotchman</hi> buried in the
Church at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> lay many years
there unknown, till the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards digged for the burial
of another, his Coffin was found,
but could by no force of Men be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
till the Pastor of the Place,
whose Name was <hi>Hildegarius,</hi> come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
opened it a little, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
ravished with the odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
smell issuing out of it; within
the Coffin he saw a Body intire,
cloathed with Priestly Vestments,
therefore not daring further to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Sepulchre, but laying
boards over it, upon those boards
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102702:67"/>
he placed the other dead Body. The
night following his Uncle, who had
been dead many years, and was a
Priest, appeared to him, telling
him, that he had much offended God
in violating the Sepulchre of a Holy
Man. The like did the Holy Man
himself make known to another,
commanding him to signifie to the
Priest, that unless he removed from
out his Grave the stinking Carkase,
he should quickly receive from God
a severe punnishment. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
without delay he caused a new
Grave to be made for the newly
dead Persons Body. Afterward the
same Holy Man in a Vision required
a Husbandman, and again a Priest,
to advise him in his Name to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
his Body from without into
the Church, withall signifying,
that he was of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation,
that his Name was <hi>Merilolan,</hi> and
had been murdered in his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Rome</hi> on the River <hi>Aisne (Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ona).</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:102702:68"/>
And least he should forget the
Name, he commanded him to write
it with Chalk, which he seemed
to give him upon the Cover of a
Chest standing by; which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
did, and writing it false, was
corrected by the Holy Man. The
next morning he found the Name
written in so perfect a manner, that
he could not write so well, though
waking and in the light. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 813.</p>
               <p>A debate happening between
the Secular Canons and the Monks,
about their Revenue and Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
the Canons pretentions were
supported by the Queen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on
the Monks side stood King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
Saint <hi>Dunstan,</hi> &amp;c. When
the debate was in the Assembly,
St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> was silent, and holding
down his head, he debated in his
mind what might be the best course
to proceed in this Affair. A great
silence was observ'd by the whole
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102702:68"/>
Assembly, every one expecting the
Archbishops answer and resolution;
when on a sudden an Image of our
Lord upon the Cross, which was
fastned aloft in the room, in the
hearing of all that were present,
spake these words distinctly; <hi>It
must not be, it must not be; you have
ordered things well, you shall do ill
to change them.</hi> This strook a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
into the whole Assembly, and
thereupon St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> said, <hi>My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
what would you have more? you
have heard the present Affair decided
by a Divine sentence;</hi> they answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
We have heard it. And upon
this the Monks of <hi>Winchester</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
secure. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 883.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Editha,</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi>
a little before her death built
a Church to the honour of St. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius;</hi>
at the Consecration whereof
by St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> he observed how the
Virgin frequently with her Thumb
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102702:69"/>
made the sign of the Cross upon her
Forehead; at which being much
delighted, he said, <hi>May that Thumb
never be corrupted.</hi> Thirteen months
after her death, St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sleep saw St. <hi>Dionysius</hi> holding
the Virgin by the hand, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that her memory should be
celebrated on earth; the Virgin her
self likewise admonished him to take
up her Body; withal telling him
that he should find her upper parts,
her Eyes and Hands all corrupted,
because in her childish age she had
employed them lightly and vainly;
but her Thumb which she had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
used in signing her self with
the Cross, and all her lower parts
remained uncorrupted, in as much
as she had been alwayes free from
impurity and gluttony; hereupon
St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> went to <hi>Wilton,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up her sacred Reliques, found
all she had said to be true. But
<hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Danish</hi> King, who made
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102702:69"/>
small account of <hi>English</hi> Saints, was
wont to say in jest, he could never
believe that a King so licentious and
cruel as K. <hi>Edgar</hi> could have a Saint
to his Daughter. And when Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Ednot</hi> defended the sanctity
of S. <hi>Editha,</hi> the King being then
at <hi>Wilton,</hi> in a passion commanded
her Sepulchre to be opened; which
being done, the holy Virgin was
seen to sit up, with a Veyl before her
face, in a posture as if she intended
to assault the King; at which he
terribly affrighted started back, and
fell half dead to the ground. But
coming to himself, he ever held the
holy Virgin in great veneration;
and once being endangered by a
Tempest at Sea, he implored her
assistance; upon which the Tempest
immediately ceased, and he came
safe to land. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 895.</p>
               <p>In the year of Grace a thousand
and twelve, the people of a Town
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102702:70"/>
of <hi>Saxony</hi> named <hi>Colewiz</hi> (or <hi>Colbec</hi>)
being assembled in the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to the Holy Martyr <hi>Magnus,</hi>
on the Vigil of our Lords Nativity,
the Priest named <hi>Robert</hi> according
to custom began the first Solemn
Mass. At the same time there were
fifteen men and three women in the
Church-yard dancing and singing
profane Songs, and they made such
a noise that they hindred the Priest,
for their voices were louder than
the Quire which sung at Mass. The
Priest therefore sent to them once
and again to be quiet, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
his command; whereupon
in great indignation he said, May
it please God and St. <hi>Magnus,</hi> that
you may continue singing thus till
a year be passed. Now what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed?
This imprecation of the
Priest had such force, that <hi>Azo</hi>
a Son of the same Priest taking his
Sister, called <hi>Ava,</hi> by the arm to
draw her from the rest, and she not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102702:70"/>
being able to leave them, he pulled
her Arm from her body, and yet
not a drop of Blood was seen. She
therefore with the rest remained
singing a whole year. No rain fell
upon them; neither cold nor heat,
hunger nor thirst, nor weariness
troubled them. Their cloathes and
shooes were not worn out, but they
continued incessantly, like mad peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
their singing. They by dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
so wore away the ground, that
they sunk into the earth first to the
knees, and afterward to the middle,
the trench became so deep. There
was by their friends a kind of pent-house
raised over them, to defend
them from the foul weather; but
there was no need of it. At last, when
the year was ended, <hi>Herebert</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Colen</hi> came to the place
and absolved them from their bonds,
and bringing them before the Altar
of St. <hi>Magnus,</hi> he there reconciled
them. The Priests Daughter with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102702:71"/>
two others presently gave up the
ghost; the rest slept three dayes
and three nights without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
Some of them dyed shortly
after; but some remained many
years alive, and by a trembling of
all their members published to the
world their sin and punishment.

                  <hi>Iudith,</hi> Wife of Count <hi>Tosti,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
of <hi>Agelwin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
to bestow on her some portion
of the Reliques of that glorious
Martyr St. <hi>Oswin</hi> King of the <hi>Deiri,</hi>
received from him a large lock of
his Hair, altogether incorrupted.
And being desirous to confirm in
Faith certain incredulous persons,
she caused a great Fire to be kindled
in the midst of her Hall, into which
she cast the same Hair, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no prejudice at all, but on
the contrary a great lustere. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

               <p>A certain Church being to be
Consecrated to the honour of Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist, devout King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor attended the
Procession thither; when upon a
sudden a Person in a strangers habit
pressing near the King, earnestly
begged an Alms of him for Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi>'s sake, the King having chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
given away all the Money he
brought thither, took a rich Ring
from off his finger and gave it to
the stranger, who returning him
many thanks, presently disappeared.
It happened afterward, that two
<hi>Englishmen</hi> went to adore the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre
of our Saviour at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
who at their return lost their way,
and the night coming on them, they
were in great pain what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of them. Being in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity,
they saw passing by them
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102702:72"/>
a company of beautiful young men
in white shining garments, before
whom went two carrying Torches
in their hands, which took away
all the obscurity of the night. After
them followed a comely Old man,
attended by two on each hand,
who looking aside, and spying the
two Pilgrims, he stay'd, asking
them, who and whence they were,
what Religion they professed, who
was their King, and what was the
cause of their journey thither? They
told him they were <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and
Christians, that their Kings name
was <hi>Edward,</hi> that they came to visit
the holy places of our Lords Passion
and Resurrection, and that the same
day having wandred out of their
way, they knew not where to find
lodging or entertainment. Then the
venerable Old man with a chearful
countenance bid them follow him,
conducting them into a most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
City, where they were most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102702:72"/>
nourished and lodged. In
the morning the same Old man
brought them on their way, and
being out of the City he said to them,
<hi>My Brethren, doubt not but God will
give you a prosperous journey homeward;
I am</hi> John <hi>the Apostle and Evangelist;
your King I affectionately love for his
chastity, salute him in my name; and
to take from him all doubt, restore him
this Ring which at the Dedication of
a Church to my name he gave me, being
then disguised in the habit of a Pilgrim;
tell him withal that the day of his death,
approaches, and that six months hence
I will visit him, and conduct him after
the Lamb, who is alwayes attended by
pure chast souls.</hi> As soon as he had
said these words, they presently
found themselves in their right
way; and with great joy returned
home. Whither being come, they
presented the Ring to the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him with the Oracle, and
taking him aside discovered to him

what was told them of his death.
As soon as they had mentioned the
Name of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> the King burst
forth into tears, and after he had
diligently enquired of them touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the things they had seen and
heard in their Journey, he dismissed
them with thanks. <bibl>
