         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

shulde spring therof: for there apereth an
ymage or rather a shadowe of the diuyne

to shyne more euydently and more purely
in the lyuynge and lawes of preestes. An
ymage dothe of another maner shewe in
a myrrour of glasse / than it dothe in yron.
And in the thyrde cyrcle<note place="margin">The thyrde Cyrcle.</note> must al the comen
people be / as the moste grosse parte of all
this worlde / but not yet so grosse but that
they pertayne vnto the mistycall body of
Christ: for the eyen be not only membres
of the body / but also the legges / the fete /

in their infirmyte / y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as moche as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syble
we do call them vnto those thynges
whiche be more approued of Christe. For
in the mistycal body he that but late was
the foote may be the eye. And lyke as the
princes if they be not al the best / must not
with chyding be exasperate / leste (as saint
Augustyne saythe) whan they be moued
they styrre vp more peryllous tragedyes / 
so the weake people lyke as Christ suffred

be suffred / and after a fatherly maner che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysshed

attayne and come vnto Christe. The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
haue euery one his propre place /

            <p>Nowe if any man wyll thynke this cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to be more conuenyent for princes / I
wyll not stryue greatly with hym. But
what so euer is without the thyrde cyrcle
is at all tymes and in all poyntes to be
hated and refused / as ambycion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre
<pb facs="tcp:5786:14"/>
of money / lechery / yre / vengeaunce /

whan they disgysed with the vyser

vnder the pretexte of executynge the lawe

those thynges be commaunded as
thynges pertaynyng vnto Christ whiche
be disagreynge moche from his lernynge.
Therfore the marke muste be sette before
euery man whiche they ought to shote
at: and there is but one marke<note place="margin">The marke maye not be chaunged.</note> / whiche
is Christe and his moste pure lernynge.
If thou sette forthe a worldly marke in

man ought to enforce hym selfe to that
whiche is best and moste perfyte<note place="margin">Al must labour to perfytnesse.</note> / that at
the leste we maye attayne and come to
the meane thynges. And there is no cause
whye we shulde put awaye any kynde

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5786:15"/>The perfectyon of Christ consisteth onely

There be amonge the monkꝭ whiche
be scarce able to be put in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thyrde cyrcle /

is best and most perfyte: Onlesse ye wolde
