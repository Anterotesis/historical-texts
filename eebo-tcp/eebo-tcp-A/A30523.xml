            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

What it is in it self, and who are

            <p>In opposition to all the false worship in this Nation,
which is Idolatry, which is discovered in its foundation,
and in its manifestation, not to be ever commanded of
God, or practised by his Apostles and Saints; but it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to consist chiefly of such things and practises as had
their first beginning and ordination in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> whereby the hypocrisie of this generation doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
in denying and crying against the Papists Idolatries,
and yet are found in the practise of the same thing in their
Church, Ministry, and Worship, which were first instituted
by the Pope's Authority.</p>

            <head>A faithful Testimony concerning the
true Worship of God, what it is in
it self, and who are the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers,
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as there is in the world a great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
among people concerning the Worship of
God, one crying, <hi>This is the right Worshp:</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>That is the right Worship;</hi> and People in these
Nations are divided about the Worship of God,
and divers one from another in their performances and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of Worship, one sort worshipping after this manner,
another after that, and there is great strife through the
whole Nation about this matter, and a great dis-satisfaction
among people, which is the right Worship, and who are the
right Worshippers, and thousands are desiring after the right
Worship of God, and to become Worshippers of him as he
requires: Therefore now it is upon me to shew unto all the
World what the true Worship of God is in it self, and who
are his true Worshippers.</p>
            <p>First, The Worship of God in it self is this; It is a walking
with God, and a living with him in converse and fellowship,
in spirit and truth; for he is onely worshipped therein; and to
do the truth, and speak the truth; This is the true Worship
of God, where the mind is guided with the spirit of Truth,
and the presence of the Lord felt at all times, and his fear in
the hearts of people, and his Councel stood in, and his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
felt, which unites to the Lord in spirit: This is the true
Worship of God, and it is without respect of times or things,
And now none upon earth can thus worship God, but who
are changed and renewed in heart and mind, and born of the
spirit, and led thereby, where the body of sin and death is
put off, such as are redeemed out of the world, and out of all
its wayes and nature, such onely can worship God in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104275:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in the truth, and such is the Father seeking to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him now in this present age; and there is never a one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth that can worship God as he requires, who remains
unchanged, and are in the transgression, unrenewed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted,
such cannot worship the true and living God, but
that which they perform and practise as the pretence of his
Worship, is idolatry and abomination, and the Lord hath
not required it at their hands; for none can walk with God,
nor have unity with him, but who are renewed and changed;
nor none can do the truth, and speak the truth in all things,
but such who are led by the Spirit of Truth, and such are in
the Covenant of God, and true Worshippers of him, and
all that is contrary, is not the Worship of God, but Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as I have said.</p>
            <p>And now as concerning this Worship practised in <hi>England</hi>
in these Steeplehouses, Churches, (so called) it is not the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the living God, but Superstition and Idolatry, for
people hath not learned it by the teachings of the Spirit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth the Spirit lead them therein, but it stands in form
without power, and in the inventions and traditions of the
Fathers, and there is not in it the manifest presence of God,
neither do you Worshippers meet with the Lord, nor
enjoy his pure life and presence in your practises; and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of your Worship (as it is now practised) is made up of
Inventions some part of your own, and some part brought
along from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> And is it not great hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
in you to profess a denial of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet
be found practising some of the same things as your Worship,
which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> first instituted and practised as her
Worship? Shall we instance unto you some particular things?
Was it not by the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
these houses in which you worship, which you call Churches,
were first set up and made worshipping places for them? and
is it not a little while since that the Mass, and the old Popish
stuff was therein exercised with as great zeal towards God,
(if not with as good sincerity) as you practice yours at this
day? And are there not the very signs and symptoms of the
<hi>Romish</hi> Idolatry yet upon these Houses, being full of Images
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104275:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on the Walls, and on the Pillars, and on the Glass-Windows
and Crosses about them, and many other things which were
Popish inventions, as also the names given unto them, and
consecrated Bells in them, and such like stuff? And was it not
a little while since that there was the Altars, and the Rails,
and the Font, and other such like things which lately were
broken down? But however though something there may be
altered, and changed, and converted to another use, and
something taken away, and other inventions brought in, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
thereof, yet still they are the same Houses which you
worship your God in, which Houses were set up by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Pope, and there remains yet the Popes sign
and symptome of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church upon them; and these
Houses you call your Churches, and thousand of thousands
of blind ignorant people esteeming and respecting in their
minds of these places more then of any other, supposing
them to be more holy and that other places are not so good
to worship in; alas poor, blind, ignorant people, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
your own souls in the traditions &amp; inventions of man,
which you live in the practise of, supposing it to be the very
Worship of God, which is no other in it self but Idolatry,
and you Idolaters; for doth not all unconverted people, and
unrighteous people, such who are not taught of the Lord,
nor led by his Spirit, but daylie rushes into iniquity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
evil, are not such found Worshippers here in Steeplehou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
conforming themselves to these things, and these practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?
And can such worship God? Or is God worshipped by
such? I tell you nay, the Lord God is pure, and they that
worship him, must be sanctified, and led by his Spirit which
leadeth into all truth:</p>
            <p>But now as concerning your present practises which your
Worship consists of, they are not such as ever the Lord insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
but such as men hath set up in their own wills and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and not in the Lords. As for your sprinkling of Infants,
which is a chief practise of your Worship, was not this first
ordained at <hi>Rome?</hi> Read the Records. And was it not a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
invention which you are thus zealously reforming, as if
it were indeed required of the Lord? Can the unconverted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104275:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and unregenerated be truly baptized into the faith of Christ?
No; but the unconverted and unregenerated are partakers of
your baptism into the faith which you profess: There was no
such practise in the Christians Church before the Apostacy;
but when the Apostacy came in, then came up these inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and imitations which you practise as the Worship of God,
whenas he never required it, neither did his Saints and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
ever give your example for it. And by it, nor in it,
God is not worshipped; neither is it in it self, nor as practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by you, any part of the Worship of God, but stands in
the inventions of man, and is after their traditions, and not
after the Commandments of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And as for your singing of <hi>David's</hi> Experiences in the
form and manner as you do, practising it as another main
part of your Worship; this is the same with the former, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever commanded of the Lord, nor (in the course and
manner as you do it) was it ever practised by the Saints of
old; and is it any better then a Popish Invention? For was
the Nation in any better state then Popery, when that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
was first instituted and begun to be performed; you your
selves will confess that it was in the time of darkness, and
through the ordination of the Bishops and Prelates, whom
you your selves say were little better then Papists in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and practise; and yet this you practise at this day as a
part of your Worship, which hath no better beginning then
as I have said, and from them you have received it, to wit,
from the Bishops and Prelates; yea, the chief part of your
Worship consists of the performances of such things as you
have received traditionally from them, and from <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome,</hi> for
all these things they instituted.</p>
            <p>And as concerning your Ministry, is it any other with that,
then with these particulars as I have mentioned? Is it not
the same Ministry in substance, though in some particulars al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
as was in the dayes of Popery and Prelacy? Have not
your Ministers the same Call to their Ministry, and the same
practise in their Ministry, and the same Maintenance at this
day, as was in generations past, when this Nation was under
the Cloud of darkness and ignorance, as your selves will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104275:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Are not they made Ministers now by natural learning,
receiving ordination from man, through the attainments of
such Arts, and Sciences, &amp; Degrees, through natural learning
and humane policy, not having their Ministry by the gift of
the Holy Ghost, no more then the Papists and Prelates had
before them, who were made Ministers by the same power,
and after the same manner as these are: And it was the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the Popish Authority, that Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Schools, to make Ministers by them, were first ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and set up; and as that Ministry was sent forth in the
time of Popery, by the same way and means (generally as to
substance) are your Ministers now sent forth, though in some
particulars differing in matter of form, yet the same for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
But Christs Ministers in the time of the true Church,
were not thus sent forth, but had received power from on
High, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, whereby they were
made able Ministers, and not by any other thing, nor by any
such means or way as your Ministers now are set up and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished;
and this Ministry is differing from the true Ministry
which Christ sent forth, and is not according, but contrary
in all things; and it is not the Ministry of God which brings
people to God; but by this Ministry people are not convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but such it is that the true Prophet cryed against; <hi>They
have run, saith the Lord, and I have not sent them, therefore they
shall not profit the people at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for this maintenance of the Ministry of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> is it not the same as was in the days of Popery &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy?
Was it not by the Popes Authority that Tythes were first
established &amp; set up to be the maintenance of his Ministry? &amp;
did not the <hi>Romish</hi> Church first ordain that the people should
give the tenth to the use of Religion, and to maintain their
Ministry? If you search the Records, you will find it so. And
was it not the very practice of the Papists and Prelates Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
to have hire, and great sums of money by the year, and
stipends, and large benefits for preaching; and the same
things are practised by these Ministers, which they have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from the Papists and Prelates which went before them;
for are not these Ministers maintained by Tythes as the Popes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104275:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ministers were? And have they not hire and great sums of
money by the year, or quarterly, even as the Papists and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
had? Wherefore it is plain, that the maintenance of
your Ministers is the very same for substance as theirs were
that went before you, which you your selves say were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and if they were Idolaters, how can you Ministers be
free which doth practice the very same things, unto the very
same end? And doth not the Priests of this generation far
exceed the Papists and Prelates? Was there ever in generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
past such casting people into prison, and spoyling peoples
goods, as is at this day through the means of these Priests,
and all about their maintenance, and for their Tythes and
Hire, and yearly stipends, and quarterly gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Did ever the

               </gap>hem Oh!
great blindness and ignorance is over your hearts, and great
hypocrisie among your Ministers, who profess a denial and
dissenting from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and cryes against them
as Hereticks, and that they are in ignorance, and yet practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the very same things; their Call is the very same to their
Ministry, and their Maintenance the same, and practise in
many things the very same as theirs were, which they seem
to deny; and this is great hypocrisie, to cast out and kill their
persons, and yet to uphold in many things their practise, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to their Worship and their Ministry: Oh abominable
Idolatry! the hand of the Lord is against it. But this is not the
way that Christs Ministers were maintained, they had no such
hire nor great sums of money, nor yearly Tythes, as these
Ministers have through the Popes Institution; but into what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
house they entered, that was worthy, they might eat
such things as were set before them, and the Apostles might
freely reap carnal things, where they had sown spiritual
things; but this was after another manner, and after another
nature; for if they had not that, yet did they not cast men
into prison, and spoyle their goods that would not give it
them, as this generation of Teachers do; and the Lord God
is risen to confound this Worship and this Ministry, which is
Idolatry, and this Church, which is but a false feigned imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104275:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and he will establish his true Worship that is in spirit
and in truth; and his true Ministry that is by the gift of the
Holy Ghost, and his true Church; and this shall be brought to
pass in his day.</p>
            <p>But again, there is another practise which you have, which
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Prelates had, (your predecessors)
if any come in the Name of the Lord to declare against you,
and against your abominations, to cry against your sin, and
cry repentance among you, that you may be converted to
God, this you account a great Transgression, and persecutes
them that doth it, by imprisoning, and whipping, and stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and by imposing great fines upon them, and causing them
to suffer cruel things, and this did the Papists and Prelates in
like manner as you do, if any was moved to cry against them,
they indeed rewarded them even as you do at this day, the
same thing you do against such as are moved of the Lord to
come among you; and herein you succeed them, and brings
forth the same persecution in your Churches, as they did in
their Churches; and this is the defence of your Church, and
of your Ministry, Carnal Weapons, Imprisonment, and
Whipping, and Stocking, and causing the bodyes of people
to suffer through cruelty and injustice, and by this means is
your Church &amp; Ministry defended &amp; preserved, or otherwise
it would presently fall, as not being able to continue nor resist,
nor gain-say the spirit &amp; power of God, which now is risen to
oppose them, if they had not carnal Laws, and Earthly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and Gaols, and Houses of Correction to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by: And is this the Church of Christ? And is this
Christs Ministry that have need of such weapons as these?
The Apostles nor true Churches never did thus, neither sent
people to prison that opposed them, nor had such cruelty to
execute upon the bodyes of people, though many did oppose
them out of wickednesse, but the Spirit and Authority of the
Lord did defend them from all their Enemies. But your
Church and Ministry is manifest to be another then that was,
and to be defended by another means, even by the same
means that the Papists and Prelates of old were of a long
time defended by; but when the measure of these things
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104275:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are fulfilled, they will come to an end: as the measure of that
generations iniquity was fulfilled which went before you, so
in the Lords season will your measure be fulfilled, and the
Lords people shall be free, and all bonds of iniquity bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>And thus it is manifest that this Church and Ministry suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and her Ministers, far more then
the Church of Christ and its true Ministers, &amp; to that it is not
equal in any thing, but to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in many things; so that it is manifest, that this Church
and Ministry are not quite another then the Church and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of <hi>Rome,</hi> but such as hath dissented from them, and
are truly sprung out of that root, and is the same still in
substance, though differing in some practises, having cast out
some old inventions, and brought in some new, but as I have
said, remains still the same in nature and substance, though
dissented in some particulars, yet succeedeth in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
as I may shew more fully hereafter. And though you
bare the Name, and stile your selves, <hi>The reformed Churches,</hi>
you mean, reformed from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but how are
you reformed? but by some visible appearances, and not in
the ground, having put off but some of her garments, and
remains the same body for substance, in nature and matter,
though differing onely in appearances? For the Church
which is the true Church of Christ, is not thus reformed,
onely changed in part, and altered in degrees, but the true
Church denies the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her very being and
ground, and in all her practises whatsoever; for though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sects have risen one from another, yet all the same for
substance, onely differing in particulars: But as for you to
whom this particular is written, that worship God in Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plehouses,
you are not so much differing from the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as many others are, which are not true Churches nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but the Lord God is now gathering his people; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
come out of your Idol-worship, and Idol-Temples, for
God dwells not in them, nor is not worshipped there, but he
dwells and walks in his Saints, and is worshipped in spirit and
in truth, and his day is dawned, and his glory is risen, and he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104275:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will confound this Church and Ministry which bears the
marks of the Romish Whore, &amp; hath her symptoms and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
remaining upon them unto this day, as it is manifest.</p>
            <p>And though some may object and say, That <hi>God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Temple to be builded for the worship of his Name, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
to be practised in the time of the old Covenant.</hi> To which
I do say, Yea it was so, a Temple was builded by <hi>Solomon</hi> for
the seed of the <hi>Iews</hi> to worship in, and to come to sacrifice
to the Lord in, and there was an outward worship and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
But it is many hundred years since this Temple was
destroyed, and worship and ordinances thrown down, which
God once commanded, and his people once practised; and
Christ the life, the power, and wisdom of God, was the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thereof, and unto whom he was made manifest, and in
whom he was revealed in the spirit, they utterly renounced
and denyed the Temple, and the Worship therein, though
God once had commanded it; and the Saints after the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing
of Christ to them in spirit, and after that the Holy
Ghost was given, we do not find through all the Churches of
the Saints, that they worshipped in the Temple of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but
witnessed against it, and said that God dwelt not in Temples
made with hands, neither was he worshipped in Temples made
with hands, but in the spirit, and in the truth their worship
consisted, &amp; therefore were persecuted; but they bare witnesse
against the Temple, &amp; the worship, &amp; those Ordinances which
God once had commanded, &amp; which once his people practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
though it was to the peril of their lives; but as for these
Temples, and these Ordinances, and this worship which are
now on foot, they were never brought forth by any Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Commandment of God, but the foundation of them
was the inventions of men, and mens traditions taught them,
and not the spirit of the Lord, and therefore against those
things, those Temples, and those Ordinances, and VVorships,
much reason have we to cry against them all, as being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sign nor substance of good, but wholly inventions of
men. The Jews Temple and Ordinance was signs of good
things to come, and when the substance was come, the
Saints denyed the shadows and the figures; but as for these,
they are denyed wholly, as being Idolatry and Abomination
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104275:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the beginning to the end of them; for as I have shown,
these things (which are the matter of which your Worship
and Ordinance doth consist) had their rise and beginning in
the days of darknesse and ignorance, since the Apostacy
came in, and so in the Name and Authority of the Lord, we
do declare against them, even against your Temples and
whole Worship, to the intent to bring you to the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that is in spirit and in truth, and that you might know
your bodyes the Temples of God, and that he might dwell
in you, and walk in you, according as he hath promised in
the New Covenant. Wherefore all people, awake and come
out of your Idolatry, and Idolatrous Worships, seperate
your selves, touch no more of it, that the Lord may receive
you, and that you may come into his Covenant, which is life
and peace for your souls, for in those Worships, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and all your practises therein, you have not true peace
with the Lord, nor the refreshments from his pure presence,
but sin and death reigns amongst you, and great ignorance is
over your hearts, and Idolatry corrupts your minds, and the
Lord hath been forgotten by you, dayes without number;
God is not well-pleased, neither hath any delight
in your Worship; for your worship of him, and fear
towards him, is but taught by the precepts of men, and by
the traditions of the Fathers in the days of Popery, and if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he opens your eyes, you will see it, for it is with the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and contrite in heart that the Lord dwels, him that crem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
at the word of the Lord, whose heart is right in his
sight, and hath learned his judgements and fear, and such as
are changed and renewed, and born of the seed of God, and
begotten by his powerful Word, such are the true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
whom the Lord is seeking, and such will he find to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him.</p>
            <p>And whereas there is a great cry amongst you, and among
many people at this day, about deceivers, and being deceived,
and there are many deceivers, you say, and your cry is one
to another, <hi>Take heed you be not deceived by false Teachers and
false Doctrine.</hi> This is the cry of Parents to Children, and
of Children to Parents, and of Masters to Servants, and of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104275:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Servants to Masters, and chiefly, it is the cry of your Priests
to the people, <hi>Take heed you be not deceived, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to all this I do say, That there are many deceivers,
and many are deceived, this is certainly true, and plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest;
but now to shew what a deceiver is, and what it is to
be deceived, and who it is that are deceived. First, That is a
deceiver, that person, that spirit, or that thing, that leadeth,
or inticeth the minds of people into something, to do, or
practise, or speak something which the Lord by his spirit doth
not lead to. I say, That which leads the creature to take up
a joy, or a delight, or a happiness in something of this world
which is under the Sun, to place confidence or felicity in such
a thing; that which thus leadeth or draweth the mind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be person, or spirit, it is a deceiver, and deceiveth the
soul; and he, or they that doth follow this, and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the obedience of it, to do, or speak something
that is contrary to God, or which his spirit doth not lead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
nor guide in, this person is deceived of the presence of
the Lord, and of the comfort, and joy, and happiness that is
in him, and hath pleasure, and joy in something of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is not of him, but besides him, and this person is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and in deceit, who hath placed a joy, and happinesse,
and confidence in some creature or thing that is not perfectly
the Lord; and another spirit besides the Spirit of the Lord,
hath seated its self in the heart, and taken possession of the
mind, and the mind and heart is thereby captivated by that
way, in the works and pleasures of this world; and this is a
deceived estate; and thus much of a deceiver, and a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the ground, in that declared.</p>
            <p>But now you that are crying one to another, <hi>Be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
Be not deceived;</hi> And you not such as are deceived alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and that lyes wallowing in the deceit, and vanity, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of this world? For while sin hath power over you, and
that spirit that is not of God doth lead you, you are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and thus it is with you, being unchanged and unrenewed
in mind and heart; are not you deceived? For you want the
feeling of the presence, and of the comfort of the Lord God,
and you are deceived of that, for that you have not, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104275:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thing possesseth your mind, the joy and pleasure of
this world, and in your exercise spiritual and temporal, the
spirit that is of this world doth lead you, and guide you, the
spirit of unrighteousnesse that leadeth contrary to him; and
can you be otherwayes deceived, or more deceived? For you
are without God a ready, and wants his peace, and the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of life eternal that is in him, you want the possession
thereof, and you are following dead Idols and vanities which
steals away your mind, whereby it is manifest that you are
deceived; For all people upon the Earth that are not led by
the spirit into all truth, that hath not received the promise of
the Father, they are all deceived, and cannot be more decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
then they are; and so is the cry in general among people,
if any one forsake and deny their way of Worship and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and Profession, be it of what manner and nature, soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
presently there is a cry, (chiefly by the Priests) <hi>Take heed
you be not deceived, and you are in heresie and error,</hi> and such like:
Thus have the Papists cryed against them that have dissented
from them, and the Prelates cryed the same, and now you
cry the same to them that dissent from you; but your zeal is
not so much against Heresie and Error, simply so, as it is to
have your own Sect and Worship upheld, and against them
that doth dissent from you; and it hath been <hi>Antichrists</hi> way
since the apostacy, since the days of the Apostles, to cry He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
and Error, and you are deceived, to all that did decline
and dissent from him; for you may read in the Scriptures,
<hi>Power was given to the Beast to compell all to worship him, and all
that would not, he made war against, and had power to kill them.</hi>
And thus have the Papists done, warred against them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
their Church; and thus did the Prelates, and thus do
you, your cry is, Heresie, and Error, and they are deceived
who do sorsake your Church, and your Ministry; and this
cry have you learned of your fore-fathers, the <hi>Romish</hi> Church.
But cease all sorts of people to cry that others are deceived,
and that others are in Error, and see how your selves are led
with the spirit of unrighteousness, and blindness, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and a cloud of Error is over you, and between you
and the Son of God, who is appearing now in Majesty and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104275:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Renown, to exalt his Name over all the Earth; and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs</hi>
way you have been in, who would have all to bow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Power, unto his Worship; but now the eyes of people
are opened, and Life, and Righteousness, and Truth it self is
sprung forth over all the Clouds of Darkness and Error.</p>
            <p>Your worship is to the unknown God, and him you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
worship after the traditions of men, and not after the
Commandments of God, for the tradition of the Fathers is
seated in you above the Witness, and blinds the eye, and
quencheth the spirit; your old customs, traditions and forms,
and your exercise therein, feeds that part which is carnal, and
answers that in others, and your worship which is out of the
spirit of God, answers not the spirit of God in others, to
convert any truly to the living God; and the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
your worship, and confound it, and no more is the Lord
worshipped in Steeplehouses, they are lest desolate of Gods
presence, and no more in dayes, and times, and things, but
they that worship must be in the spirit changed by it, and led
by it into the truth; so when the Lord doth open your eyes,
you will see the worship of God to be another thing then
you suppose it; you cannot be educated naturally in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, nor learn it by traditions, for it stands onely in
the spirit, and is taught by the spirit unto all them that are
born of the spirit; and who comes to be born of that, are
the true worshippers of God, in which the Father is well
pleased. And as for your worship in Steeplehouses, God hath
no delight in, he savoureth it not, but it is an abomination to
him, it is not pleasing to him, because you be out of his spirit,
and worships after your own traditions, and not after his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and this worship hath stood all this long time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
while the Whore and the Beast hath ruled over Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and so one tradition after another hath been brought in,
and one false Worship hath risen out of another, and what
people hath had, it hath been by tradition, and not from the
immediate spirit of God and so the true God hath not been
worshipped in his spirit; and now all the world hath been
pleading for their traditions, and they be in respect above
the Commandments of God, among ye that worship in Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plehouses;
you are even mad against them that cryes against
the Steeplehouses, and pleads the Antiquity of your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104275:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and of your Traditions and Ordinances, now they are
ancient, even as ancient as since the false Prophets and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
came in, and put on the sheeps clothing, but inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are wolves; these killed the life, and slew the Prophets, and
they set up inventions of their own; and your traditions and
worships are as ancient as since power was given to the Beast
over kindreds &amp; peoples; &amp; the Lord God is bringing down
your worship, the original of which, came up when Antichrist
went into the world, as you may read in <hi>Iohn's</hi> Epistle, and so
you may plead Antiquity, yet not as ancient as the true Church
is, for when the true Churches were apostatized, then came up
your worship, &amp; your many traditions; &amp; this hath been while
the woman hath been fled into the wilderness, &amp; the Manchild
caught up to God, which when the woman returns again, your
Worship and Ordinance will be overthrown, &amp; the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
again established, &amp; liberty; but first you must know the
spirit to teach you, before you can worship in it, &amp; the spirit
must purifie your hearts, &amp; make them clean, before you can
offer to God an acceptable sacrifice; for your sacrifices are not
acceptable, but they are stained &amp; polluted in the sight of the
Lord, who now hath beheld what you are a doing, &amp; you are
in that which his soul hath no pleasure in, &amp; in the day of your
visitation the witness in your consciences shall answer it; so
you are to know God by his spirit, before you can worship
him; the word of the Lord must be felt in your hearts as a fire,
&amp; as a hammer, &amp; you must be created a-new, &amp; have another
spirit, before ye can worship God. <hi>So all you false worshippers,
you are called that you may return, &amp; may come into the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which is in the commandment of God, and not the traditions of
men, and in that Law written in the heart, is God known, who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
mans salvation, and which leadeth in the true and perfect wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
of the true and living God, where the Lord is all in all. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
return, why will you dye and perish in your iniquities? A lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is taken up for you, O! why will you perish through neglecting
your own salvation? Come into the spirit, and into the truth, that you
may worship God, and be accepted of him, who is now appeared in
power and great glory, to gather his people to himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is to go abroad among all people who are worshipping in Temples made with
hands, &amp; who are under this Ministry, &amp; are of this Church aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they may come to consider, and see the error of their way, of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and of their ministry, and this is a visitation from the Lord unto them all,
by a friend unto all your souls.</p>
