            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE buſineſs of your pleaſant Letter I can no
ways judge could be the motive of its jocular
ſtyle: Is conviction for Recuſancy ſo ſlight a
matter, that it is only to be laught at, or is it that you
have a mind to give his Majeſty two of your three
thouſand a year? I fear not but it may be then you
have been reading Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s Verſes out of <hi>Heſiod</hi>
lately.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy they to whom God han't reveal'd</l>
               <l>By a ſtrong light, which muſt their ſenſe controul,</l>
               <l>That half a great Eſtate's more than the whole;</l>
               <l>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy from whom ſtill conceal'd does lye</l>
               <l>Of Roots and Herbs the wholeſom luxury.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But truly, Brother, believe me, if theſe Verſes were
Canonical Scripture, yet would they be too little to
keep body and ſoul together, when the ſeiſure is made
by the Sheriff.</p>
            <p>Yet is not 2000 a year worth inquiring after, at
leaſt to know ſome ſmall reaſon for parting with it?
Methinks it ſhould be ſo; I'm ſure, if it was mine, I
ſhould cry two words to a Bargain before I parted
with a ſouſe of it, except ſome body would ſecure me
<hi>Terra firma</hi> in Heaven for Repriſals. And for your
ſake I am reſolved to argue the point with our Holy
Father the Pope, a little to know why we his poor
deſpiſed Children in <hi>England</hi> are bound to do ſome
things at his commands, he no ways expects from his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97636:3"/>
more indulged ones in other Nations; and ſuch things
too that practiſed produce our utter ruines.</p>
            <p>Now good honeſt Friend Mr. Jeſuit, mind not me,
but follow your more neceſſary Imployments of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
the Doctors <hi>Stilling fleet, Tilleſon,</hi> and <hi>Floyd,</hi>
with the reſt of the Papiſt-Grinders: For I am no ways
denying the Popes Infallibility, but will give him fair
play, and allow him to be a more conſiderable perſon
of Honour than conſiſts with the poſture of the times, or
my preſent affairs.</p>
            <p>Nay, if it will do him any ſervice, I will grant him
at preſent to be not only Supreme Biſhop, chief Ruler,
univerſal Head, or ſole Head of the univerſal Church;
but let him be as great, magnificent, and powerful as
his moſt flattering Courtiers would have him, that is,
as great indeed, as the Devil himſelf pretended, when
he proffered the whole Earth, and conſequently uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Monarchy to our Saviour for a little worſhip.
Let him be all this at preſent, if he pleaſes, ſay I, yet
I hope to prove that an Engliſh Roman Catholick, and
conſequently you, Brother, may go to Church as the
Law directs, nay ought to do it notwithſtanding any
commands or pretended commands from him or his
holy Predeceſſors to the contrary.</p>
            <p>For let us conſider, that this Omnipotency of his
power, be it more or leſs, muſt needs terminate in
this, that he has no power where he will have no
power, and cannot command where he will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
Nay, I may ſafely conclude, That a good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
may believe he does not command where he
plainly, openly, and ſolemnly ſays, he will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
till he unſays that ſaying.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97636:3"/>
This in plain terms is the Popes fate now in <hi>England;</hi>
they have long ſince by an unrepeal'd publick Act of
their Authority, Excommunicated in the higheſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
this whole Nation; interdicting to the very ground
that feeds us, and the air we breath, any ſpiritual
Bleſſings or Benefits.</p>
            <p>Now this ſolemn Excommunication not only caſts
out of the Fatherly protection and care of the Pope,
thoſe who fall under it; but deprives them of the uſe
of Sacraments, Maſſes, Indulgences, Churches, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Holy Orders, and
all other Chriſtian Rights and Priviledges whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as plainly appears from the very form uſed in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; as likewiſe in the practice of this Kingdom in
King <hi>John</hi>'s Time, as is proved by our Hiſtories, when
for ſix years this Kingdom remained under it; and
lately in <hi>Venice,</hi> when the Jeſuits left that State rather
than obey the Senate, in performing Holy Offices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Holineſſes intention, which Act of theirs
they to this day juſtifie.</p>
            <p>I might inſtance many more Examples, to prove the
ſad Condition of Countries Excommunicated, if the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alters
of the Popes Authority were Infallible, Heavenly
Oracles: But I having nothing to do in that point, ſhall
only glance at thoſe things neceſſary to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
which is, to ſave your Eſtate, Brother, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhall ſtill allow the Pope his moſt extended Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,
ſince that makes not at all againſt me in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
For 'tis not material to me that Father <hi>Paul,</hi>
Author of the Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> does in
his defence of the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Seventh, prove, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97636:4"/>
is a ſpiritual puniſhment, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
there ought to be an offence, and that except
there be, the Cenſure cannot reach the Perſon againſt
whom it was intended. I ſay, though this be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
nay, may be unanſwerable as to the thing then
pleaded for; yet it will be no ways ſatisfactory to the
point now in hand, which is, whether the Pope has
any Authority left in <hi>England</hi> or no, for that is plain
he has not; for though at firſt it may be all our Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
did not juſtly incur ſo rigorous a ſentence, as to
be wholly lopt off from the Catholick Church: yet that
Pope that excommunicated them, and thoſe ever ſince,
have abſolutely refuſed to have any Spiritual care of
them, and conſequently command over them; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
it then, and Annually renewing that Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
ever ſince; ſo that there has been no continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of Biſhops in this Kingdom, nor cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Inſtitutions of the Roman Catholick
Church, till that ſolemn Excommunication be taken
off.</p>
            <p>In this Condition is <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> put by the
Pope, whilſt <hi>Ireland</hi> our neighbour and fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Kingdom ſtill continuing in his Holineſſes good
Grace, enjoys all the Priviledges from him of the moſt
Catholick Country.</p>
            <p>So that I conclude, the Pope's Infallibility will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
reach this, at leaſt; That he has Power to refuſe
to Govern, Command, or Protect all he pleaſes, and
whereſoever he pleaſes: amongſt which Places, I take
<hi>England</hi> to be; ſince he, and all his Predeceſſors ſince
<hi>Pius Quintus</hi>'s Time, have ſolemnly declared it to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Then, Good Father <hi>Clement,</hi> ſince you will have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97636:4"/>
nothing to do, I deſire you will ſtill ſtand by, and let
us ſhift for our ſelves as well as we can. As for the
Gentlemen Miſſionaries you have ſent to convert us,
I hope we ſhall be able to deal with them well enough,
for all we go to Church; which I am about to prove
to you, Dear Brother, we may lawfully do.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The thing in it ſelf is by all Caſuiſts in the
World allowed to be no Sin, but wholly Indifferent;
as is plain from the Practice in <hi>France,</hi> and all other
Nations. But this is ſuch a Truth, that ſhould I bring
Arguments to prove it ſo, it would appear as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
in me, as a long Harangue would be to prove
there are ſuch things as Penal Laws againſt Recuſancy
in <hi>England:</hi> which, I ſuppoſe, to you, Brother, would
be very needleſs.</p>
            <p>Now this granted, That it is not <hi>Malum in ſe;</hi> how
then can it be a Sin? Certainly it muſt be againſt ſome
expreſs Command to the contrary; and ſo it will fall
under that Head of <hi>Malum Prohibitum.</hi> Now if I
prove it not under this laſt, then it can be no Sin at
all: And this will be no hard Task to perform.</p>
            <p>For, Dear Brother, do but beſtow a very little
thinking (Half as much as a Meditation before a
Maſs, will ſerve) of that Authority which the Pope
has left himſelf in <hi>England;</hi> and you will find, that all
Bulls formerly ſent, or hereafter to come from <hi>Rome,</hi>
during the continuance of this Excommunication are
to be lookt on here as fraudulent, falſe, and forged
ones, no ways binding the moſt zealous of his Holineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Children, nay rather as things that in a moſt abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
manner give the lye to the ſolemneſt Diſcipline
and Rights of holy Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97636:5"/>
For in no Action can his Holineſs ſo clearly expreſs
his intention and power as in thoſe of ſolemn Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
againſt Nations, they being the moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and publick demonſtrations of his pretended Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
in governing the Earth. Now is it not more
than Schiſmatical Inſolence to affirm, that his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
Empire and the Church is ſo divided in it ſelf,
as that one perſonal Act of his ſhould poſitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
and give the lye to another, as it muſt plainly
do, if he after the ſolemn Excommunication of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhall, during that cenſure, ſend any Bull of Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to guide the people thereof in their journey to
Heaven, whither he openly declares they never ſhall
arrive, having as much as in him lies, ſealed up the
Gates of Glory to them? For to this purpoſe or none
tend all Excommunications, which are purſuant to the
promiſe of Binding and Looſing. Therefore from
this reaſon I gather that ſeveral things done and taught
by the Jeſuits and Miſſionary Prieſts here, not only
fall under Proteſtant Laws of Treaſon and Catholick
National Laws of <hi>Praemunire;</hi> but are alſo contrary
to the Fundamental Rules and Practices of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick Church it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For an inſtance, Indulgences given by his Holineſs
to the Catholick Church in general, theſe are often
publiſhed at Maſs and in Sermons by Miſſionaries here,
and the means to obtain the benefits of them zealouſly
purſued and performed by Catholicks. Now allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the utmoſt benefit to be really in them that ever
Pardon-ſeller in <hi>Spain</hi> pretended, yet to Engliſh Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks they can be nothing worth; for by
that infallible power reſides in the Church beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97636:5"/>
in lawful general Councils, of which ſort we all
ſay the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was. I ſay by this infallible
Power and in that Council is taught, That the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Agent is abſolutely neceſſary to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
or end of any Religious Action, or the benefits
to ariſe thereby. Inſomuch that the intention of the
Prieſt, directed to the contrary, ſhall null or rather
make abſent the Sacrament of Baptiſm or any other
Rite, notwithſtanding all Ceremonies neceſſary were
performed.</p>
            <p>Now if this be truly ſo, as you and I, nay all Roman
Catholicks are bound to believe, how much more will
it operate in this trick of Indulgences, which flow on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Fountain of the Popes good pleaſure, and
can certainly operate no farther than he intends them,
which cannot be to <hi>England,</hi> or any Engliſh man, they
being put wholly out of his Fatherly care and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by his grand Interdiction, the beſt diſcovery of
his intention that can be, except when he expreſſes
himſelf in a general Council?</p>
            <p>Pardon this ſhort digreſſion concerning Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
it being only to illuſtrate this infallible Truth,
That theſe Indulgences or any other Bull in general
or directed in particular to this Kingdom, cannot be
ſuppoſed to flow from the Popes intention, ſince they
ſo palpably are againſt his more ſolemn declared plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
which he annually renews. Nor ought any Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick here look on them but as the tricks of
private Miſſionaries for their own advantage, ſince
they perfectly contradict, not only the Laws of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the Fundamental Laws of the Romiſh Church
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97636:6"/>
We may indeed ſpeak of Popes Bulls, Brother, as of
Letters Patents obtained from Princes of courſe, which
though, when according to Law, are binding, not only
to Subjects, but againſt themſelves and Succeſſors; yet
when they proceed contrary to the Fundamentals of
their Government, then are they of no value, but in
themſelves void, Mankind always in ſuch caſes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the Prince to be deceived in his Grant: So
ſtands the Caſe here. Till his Holineſs takes off the
Excommunication of this Nation, which is an effect of
his plenitude of Power, and accords with the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of his Regiment; no Bull ſent hither ought
to be taken notice of, they being in themſelves appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
void, as well as contrary to the Laws of the
Nation, made in Catholick times, near two hundred
years before the Pope caſt off it, or it the Pope: Bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Bull to this Kingdom without the Kings leave,
being then made <hi>Praemunire,</hi> which Law was for all that
time complied with by very many, and as we ſay,
Good Popes.</p>
            <p>To ſum up all, it comes to this: Things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
no ſins, cannot become ſuch, but by ſome lawful
prohibition. Going to Church in it ſelf is no ſin, nor
can it become ſo by the Popes Command to a Country
in which he renounces all Power: <hi>England</hi> is ſuch a
Country; therefore till he or his Succeſſors take off
the Excommunication, no Catholick is obliged to take
notice of that, or any other pretended Command ſent
from him hither, but perfectly <hi>(è contrà)</hi> Therefore
going to Church is lawful in <hi>England</hi> for Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</p>
            <p>But not to leave the point thus: I begin to doubt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97636:6"/>
extremely, whether we are not obliged in Conſcience
to go to Church as the Law directs, or at leaſt when
we omit it, freely to pay the penalty. For it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on all hands, that a thing not <hi>malum in ſe</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>malum prohibitum,</hi> if commanded by lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
which I hope none of us will deny the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in <hi>England</hi> to be: I'm ſure he that ſhould,
would deſerve the ſevereſt execution provided by the
moſt ſanguinary Law. Now the Government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
requires all the Subjects thereof to meet together
at ſuch a time and ſuch a place, no matter where,
ſuppoſe it <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain; doth any man think he would
deſerve the protection thereof that ſhould obſtinately,
without lawful excuſe, refuſe to come thither? no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he would not, only incur deſervedly the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
provided; but ſpeaking like Chriſtians, who are
directed to obey for conſcience ſake, he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a grievous ſin againſt God. Now what excuſe can
we make for our obſtinacy, in refuſing to go to the
Churches at times commanded? The Popes pretended
Commands will not do; for were they more binding
than the Laws of a Nation, which certainly they are
not, yet can we have none ſuch from him, having no
Biſhops or Spiritual Superiours left, whom we might
or ought to truſt for the truth of them when they
came, and we have his too too ſolemn promiſe, that
he will have nothing to do with us. This being ſo,
I am afraid the private diſcourſes and falſe pretences
of private mercenary Jeſuits and Miſſionaries will not
be a ſufficient Baſis to rely upon before the laſt Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
for ſuch obſtinate reſiſtance againſt lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in things in themſelves wholly indifferent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:97636:7"/>
Now, Brother, I know Mr. Politick the Jeſuit, if
you ſhew him this, will preſently bleſs himſelf with the
ſign of the Croſs, deſire all to joyn in a <hi>Pater noſter</hi> and
<hi>Ave Maria</hi> againſt the infection, and then dogmatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm I am turned a rank, nay dangerous Heretick.
Your Daughters muſt be deſired to viſit me no more,
for fear of perverſion; nay you will be perſwaded to
double my Annuity, on condition I never ſee your
face again. Well, if theſe afflictions ſhould happen, I
cannot help it; but for the mind I am in, it muſt be
ſtronger Arguments ſhall hinder me from avoiding
conviction, as long as with a ſafe conſcience I can. And
I think there are none ſuch; for I have conſidered all
I ever hitherto have heard, and to me they appear
weak and impertinent. But that I may not be thought
only to affirm this, I will ſum up all I know any thing
to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To begin firſt then with ſcandal, which is one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
mainly urged, I ſuppoſe it can never be intended,
that if a weak Brother, <hi>id eſt,</hi> perhaps a Fool, ſhall be
troubled in mind that I have ſix diſhes of meat at my
Table, and himſelf and many better Chriſtians than I,
have, it may be, ſcarce half a one; That I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for fear of being an eye-ſore to him, retrench
my ſelf to his fragments. And yet S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as to his
own practice, ſeemed to reſolve this, ſince he ſays, he
would never eat meat whilſt he lived, rather than of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the weak brethren: So I ſuppoſe, and reaſonably,
that his Doctrines of Scandals were calculated for the
uſe of Chriſtian Teachers, and thoſe that ſought to be
Rulers in the Church. For had he intended them for
all Chriſtians, I am afraid they would have proved
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97636:7"/>
heavier burdens on Believers than ever were impoſed
on the Primitive obſervers of the Moſaical Law, and
would have but ill accorded with the great Argument
for Converſion, which was Chriſtian liberty from duties
which they and their forefathers were not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo.
Nor is it reaſonable to think I am bound to
part with two thirds of my Eſtate, becauſe ſome fool
my neighbour may think me an Heretick by my going
to Church; no, let him think on, the ſin is his, not
mine, who do nothing but what in it ſelf is lawful, and
what becomes my duty by the Laws commanding it.
But he judges amiſs of my interiour Faith by my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
actions, though lawful, and therefore ſins in want
of Charity. Thus much I believe may ſerve for Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
though much more might be ſaid.</p>
            <p>The next Objection proceeds from this, that it is
made the ſign of Faith, and therefore he that complies
in it, owns the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Doctrine: but this
muſt be by all rational men poſitively denied, if they
will conſider theſe following Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when going to Church was commanded in
<hi>England</hi> by a Penal Statute, it was deſigned rather for
opportunity to inſtruct people, educated Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
in the Principles of the Proteſtants, than as
an Act of general Uniformity in Faith, which could
not ſo ſuddenly be expected. Next, it would have
been a vain way of trying the Faith of Papiſts by a
thing they might lawfully, according to their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
do: nor can we believe the people of <hi>England</hi>
aſſembled in Parliament could be ſo ignorant, had they
been minded then to have known the hearts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
as to have fallen upon ſo impertinent a teſt. For
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97636:8"/>
to my ſorrow we find, when they intended, that they
knew a ready and infallible way to do it.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe the worſt, that the Law deſigned it as a
tryal of Faith, and a diſcovery of perſons Popiſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
(permitting ſtill the thing in it ſelf to be no ſin)
that can no ways oblige you to the refuſal of it; for I
would deſire Mr. Jeſuit to tell me, why you are more
obliged openly to declare your ſelf a Catholick, than
he is to owne himſelf a Prieſt? fear of death I am ſure
ſhould not deter him, ſince, if he dyes, his Faith calls
it Martyrdom, which gains a Crown of Glory, a
temptation ſufficient, and much beyond what any of
them will ſecure you for your Eſtate. But if he, like
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> thinks it lawful to get down in a Baſket, you
may as adviſedly come to Chriſt by night. For is it
reaſonable, that becauſe the Law ſays, Every Popiſh
Recuſant ſhall be convicted, that therefore I ſhould be
bound preſently to run and confeſs my ſelf a Papiſt at
the next Seſſions? For 'tis as rational to affirm that, as
to ſay I am bound, when the Law preſcribes a thing to
be done for tryal of my Faith, which I may in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
do, preſently to cry out againſt it, and refuſe it
for that cauſe only. If that were ſo, then it would be
no hard matter, by another trick, to baniſh us all the
Realm, by declaring, whoſoever ſhould be within this
Kingdom on the 25 of <hi>March</hi> next, ſhould be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all intents and purpoſes no Roman Catholicks,
but good Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whether they
communicated in it or no.</p>
            <p>Now I am afraid, Brother, if ſuch a ſign of Faith as
this were by the Law made, yet Mr. Jeſuit would find
many excuſes for ſtaying after that time. But if he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97636:8"/>
would not, I wiſh with all my heart the Parliament
would make ſuch a Statute, that we might be rid of
them. But they know better their Principles, than to
hope ſo fair a riddance by ſo eaſie a way; no, theſe
are but weak Arguments to lead the too believing
Laity by the noſes, it muſt be ſtronger toyls that ſhall
catch their Elephant underſtandings. Therefore,
good Brother, let you and I be no longer held by them.
For 'tis plain, neither ſcandal nor <hi>ſignum fide</hi> ought to
be a hindrance to me from doing a thing in it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
and which becomes my duty by the Law's
commanding it.</p>
            <p>The next material Objection I have from ſome of
our Spiritual miſleaders met with, is, That as Faith
comes by hearing, ſo does Hereſie; therefore we ought
to avoid the place where it is taught, leſt we ſhould be
miſguided into it. If you anſwer this, by ſaying the
Argument would hold all the World over, and ſo make
it a ſin as well in <hi>France</hi> as here, then they reply, That
in Catholick Countries, though you hear Hereſie in a
Proteſtant Sermon, yet you have a Catholick Sermon
preſently clears the point, and makes it indubitable on
the Churches ſide. Now this by the Prohibition of
Religion is prevented in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore the
caſe very different.</p>
            <p>One would think this a very ſubtile Argument, ſo
notably put together, that there would be no poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of anſwering it, if one did but very much ſtand in
awe of the Magiſterial Mountebank, that it may be with
a world of Rhetorical flouriſhes, and grave Quotations
out of <hi>Scotus,</hi> doth poſitively affirm this to be the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all School-men, nay the Catholick Church it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97636:9"/>
elf. But Heaven knows, examine it a little, and you
will find it a meer rope of ſand, as ſolidly compacted
as their ridiculous, though politick Doctrine of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
and no better.</p>
            <p>For will not they, or any obſerving man confeſs, that
the Romaniſts of <hi>England,</hi> take them one with another,
are ten for one more learned and confirmed in the
Principles of their Religion, than thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> or
any Catholick Country indeed are? He that conſiders
that moſt of the Natives of this Kingdom, who are of
that Faith, be either Perſons of Quality, who have had
great advantages by Education, or Converts from the
Proteſtants, will eaſily believe there muſt be a great
diſparity between ſuch and the general herd of Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,
bred in Countries under a Religion no ways fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for making the common people too knowing.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it is not ſo, and that thoſe who have ſo
long ſtrugled under difficulties in their Fortunes for
Conſcience ſake, have done it more out of ignorance,
the Mother, as ſome ſay, of Popiſh devotion, than of
underſtanding; yet will the former Argument waſh
away in that part which ſays, thoſe in Catholick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
have more opportunity of being untaught what
they might prejudicially have ſuckt in. For none will
deny, but more Doctrine is collected from rational
diſcourſes <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> than from ſuch ſet Speeches as
Sermons are. Therefore conſidering there are few
Gentlemen in <hi>England</hi> of the Romiſh Religion, who
have 500 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> but keep a Prieſt in their Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;
How is it likely, if good Arguments be to be
found againſt every thing the Proteſtants teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Romiſh Faith, but that they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97636:9"/>
upon inquiry, have their new-raiſed ſcruples at
Church by ſuch ſooner and ſtronger wip't off, than a
perſon that it may be in a Catholick Country may go
to Church both Sunday and other Holy-day a year
before he hears any Sermon, caſually to glance upon
that point, whereon ſuch doubt of his aroſe? And I
dare affirm, ſo ſweet is the profit the Jeſuits and Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
find in <hi>England,</hi> that there reſides, and is like
to do conſtantly ſo many here, that few Papiſts need to
be a day from ſpeaking with one of them, and that is
an advantage equal to the moſt Catholick Nations.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe all here ſaid nothing to the purpoſe, but
that 'tis likely many would be changed in time, and
become Proteſtants; What is that to you or I, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or indeed to any rational Lay Catholick in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
for he whoſe caſe it ſhould be, need not much
repine that his conſcience ſhould lead him into a more
advantageous Religion as to this World: and for the
other, he would no doubt be as confident of a good
place there, if he acted purely upon the ſcore of Faith,
as ever he was whilſt he remained Papiſt.</p>
            <p>But I confeſs many ſuch accidents as thoſe would
ſhrewdly inconvenience the Prieſts, and in time leſſen
their number: But ſtill what is that to you or I, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
I find no Canon of any General Council com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
you to give two thouſand pound a year to
increaſe the number of Prieſts, or to maintain thoſe
that be. Nor can I believe Chriſtian Religion ever
obliged its Profeſſors to ſuch remote conſiderations.
No, all men were not bound, like S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to love to that
extremity, as to wiſh damnation for their Country-mens
ſakes. They that can, let them; but ſtill ſay I, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97636:10"/>
keep your money, you'l repent it elſe one day,
take my word for it.</p>
            <p>Another Argument I have heard ſtarted, which is,
that if Catholicks ſhould go to Church, yet the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would at laſt find out ſomething like the late Teſt
for Imployments, by which they would be found out,
and ſo conſequently be no ways the better, but ſuffer
equally to what they ſhould do by Recuſancy.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that I ought as a Chriſtian to obey
the Government, as far as I can in Conſcience, and that
for Conſcience ſake, and to truſt the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
in whoſe hands are the hearts of Princes and
Rulers, for any thing by them for the future to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
which if I cannot then comply with, I muſt
either follow the direction of flying in perſecution from
city to city, or patiently ſuffer for my ſins what God
ſhall pleaſe by the Law to impoſe upon me. But this
ſuppoſition, how well grounded ſoever it may ſeem,
ought not to hinder me from complying, as far as I am
able at the preſent; ſuch teſt, when, if ever, it comes, will
then with its penalties be time enough to ſubmit to.</p>
            <p>But I am of the opinion, and not without ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of reaſon, that ſuch a Teſt may never be, eſpecially
if Catholicks would leave off Recuſancy. The grounds
for my conceptions are theſe.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>England</hi> boaſt of this Priviledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
moſt <hi>European</hi> Nations, if not all, that no perſon
is bound by Torture or Oath to accuſe himſelf of any
thing, which by the Law is penal; but that proof ought
to come of matter of Fact before he ſuffer. Now this
ſo rational a Priviledge, which frees us from the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
ſubjection of thoſe governed by the Civil Law, all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97636:10"/>
Engliſh Parliaments hitherto have been extremely
tender of, as appears by thoſe Laws provided for
ſecurity of Religion ſince the Reformation. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
perſon knows, they who incur puniſhment by not
complying in Forms of Worſhip, or matters of Faith,
do it out of tenderneſs of Conſcience, though it may
be miſguided. Now ſuch perſons one may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
would ſcruple above all things a falſe Oath:
Therefore if our Law-makers had not been very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of this Engliſh Free-mans Priviledge, they might
have quickly left a latitude to Judges, and other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Magiſtrates by Interrogatories upon Oath to
have found out all perſons, that had through Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
offended againſt any Eccleſiaſtical Law; as, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have you heard Maſs within a year or no? have
you aſſerted or taught the Popes Supremacy, or
brought in Croſſes, Beads, or Images, &amp;c. But we
find no ſuch Method allowed; which can ſpring from
nothing but the care of this Sacred Engliſh Priviledge,
always firmly rooted in the breaſts of the Compilers of
Engliſh Statutes. For I ſhould think, if ever they
would have ſtrained the point, it would have been in
detection of Jeſuits and Roman Prieſts, a people they
have long ſtrove wholly to extirpate, as appears by
the puniſhment provided for them, which is not only
made capital, but of the higheſt nature any Engliſh
Law has yet preſcribed; yet they never went ſo far as
to force them that were ſuſpected upon Oath to purge
themſelves: which had they done, none could have
been left alive in the Nation. For I have this opinion
of them, not one would, upon ſuch examination, deny
himſelf, except he intended to deſert his Faith: And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97636:11"/>
this the Makers of thoſe Statutes as well knew as the
late Uſurpers over all the Laws, Rights, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of this Nation did, when they took that never-failing
Method of examining them upon Oath; and
detected, though not executed, all they tryed that way.
But the lawful Princes and Parliaments of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
have always avoided opening ſo dangerous a
gap to perfect ſlavery; for it would be leſs unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for men on corporal Oath to declare whether they
were guilty of Treaſon, Murder, Theft, Forgery,
Adultery, or any other notorious crime againſt the
Law of Nature and the Nation, than that they ſhould
be forced to diſcover thoughts, which if not reduced
into practice, could concern the good or ill of no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but themſelves, and yet when known, ſhould
bring them under heavier penalties than ſome of the
other crimes. For this reaſon, till I ſee it, I may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe there will never be ſuch a way appointed in
our Law for ſearching mens ſoles, whatſoever proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
there hath been of it lately.</p>
            <p>As for the late Teſt, that can no ways be brought in
objection againſt me, ſince Nations may preſcribe what
Gates they pleaſe, through which any perſon is to arrive
at preferment in it. And it is not at all unnatural or
unpracticable, that a proper Oath be provided for any
one that takes an Imployment; nay, it hath always
been the Law and Cuſtom of this Nation, ſince Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
if not before, for every perſon to ſubmit to ſome
ſort of Oath before he entred upon any truſt in the
Common wealth; inſomuch that the Kings themſelves
are not wholly exempted from it. Now it is not at all
more unreaſonable, that one general Form over and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97636:11"/>
above ſuch particular ones, ſhould be preſcribed by the
Law-makers at their directions, for all ſuch as ſeek
preferments to comply with, or not be capable of them;
for what I receive, but of Grace cannot be called a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
if I want: and under that head fall all imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in a Kingdom that are either of profit or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
For I ſuppoſe the being hindred from thoſe of
trouble will by no perſon be eſteemed a grievance. So
the impoſition of the late Teſt cannot be called a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of men by their perſonal Oaths, to bring them
under legal Penalties. Nor can indeed the Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
and Supremacy, it having been the Method of
all Common-wealths to preſcribe ſome Form to the
Subject, whereby to own the Government; and that is
in themſelves diſcretion all. Nor ought we to ſuppoſe
a Government can be malicious to its Members, or that
it would lay ſnares for them, but rather that whatever
they preſcribe, proceeds from the deſire of general
ſecurity, they ſtill framing their Oaths ſo, that they
know all good Subjects may take them: if any cannot
or will not, it lies upon ſuch to quit the Protection of
that State, and no ways obliges the State to comply with
their obſtinacy: And this laſt word for ought I know,
doth too much belong to thoſe that firſt brought up the
cuſtom amongſt Catholicks, of refuſing the two afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Oaths, of which more hereafter. In the mean time I
only affirm, that we ought not to omit doing our duty
to the Laws, as far as they now bind us, becauſe there
may come ſuch as we may no ways be able to comply
with. But it is an hundred to one too, that may never
happen from the reaſon aforeſaid; and it would be
more unlikely, if there was a general compliance in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97636:12"/>
mean time to thoſe things all rational men know Roman
Catholicks might do, nay which many known, wiſe,
and devout men of them have in former times, and do
at this preſent practiſe, as I could inſtance beyond all
controverſie, if I pleaſed, in this thing at preſent treated
of, which is going to Church. But, Brother, I know it
would be needleſs to you, as well as prejudicial to
them, and therefore I ſhall forbear names in a thing ſo
notorious; only be you as wiſe, and do not be led by the
noſe to infallible ruine, by the bold, nay ſawcy aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Fellows, whoſe buſineſs is to ſecure themſelves,
command over your conſcience no ways belonging to
them, that they may thereby be Maſters of ſuch part of
your remaining Eſtate, as ſhall be neceſſary to their
plenty or prodigality; which if they, contrary to their
duty and function, ſought not, why ſhould they ſtudy
falſe Poſitions, and impoſe them on you meerly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare
your Eſtate? They ought ſurely to open the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
way to Heaven at leaſt as wide as it might be, and
not lay ſtumbling-blocks in our ways, never found out
but in this miſerable nook of the World, nor no where
taught or thought on, but by our Miſſionaries from
<hi>Rome,</hi> and our traiterous Fugitives, that on Religions
firſt alteration fled thither. For ſuch being guilty of
hainous Treaſons againſt our Princes, ſought firſt to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
their villanies by pretences of Religion, having by
their pernicious, falſe, and damnable Doctrines and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
not only done vaſt hurt to the honeſt Profeſſors
of that, but have placed upon it ſcandals not to be wip't
off but with the end of time it ſelf. And theſe Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
being grown deſperate with the ill ſucceſs of their
damnable deſigns, daring not to return into that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97636:12"/>
againſt which they had ſo traiterouſly practiſed,
ſought to involve all the moderate Party, which ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
behind, into ruine, in revenge of their not unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
joyning with them in their black Attempts on
the Perſons of our lawful Princes and Governours.
Theſe were the perſons that ſuggeſted to the Popes
motives, for thoſe idle Bulls ſo ſent in contradiction of
their more ſolemn declared intention, if any ſuch did
come, which we are now ways obliged to believe, did or
could; but if they had or did, 'tis not at all material,
they being no more ſignificant in <hi>England,</hi> than a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Mandatory from the Grand Signior would be.</p>
            <p>And indeed ſome of theſe pretended Bulls contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuch Commands to their beloved Catholick Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
here (as they were pleaſed to call them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to their Excommunication) that they ſhould
unanimouſly have Petitioned the King, that both the
Original and all the Copies of them might have been
ſolemnly burnt by the common Hangman. Nay, any
perſon that knew him, ought upon pain of damnable
ſin, to have diſcovered the bringer of them; in that if
a Prieſt, he might have received the well-merited
death of a Traitor; or if a Lay-man, all the Law has
in that caſe too eaſily provided. I need not inſtance
which Bulls I mean, they are ſo often brought againſt
the Catholick Religion it ſelf by Proteſtant Writers,
and ſufficiently to the ſhame, though not of the Popiſh
Religion, yet of thoſe Popes who granted them, and
of thoſe Papiſts that adhere to, or defend ſuch Roman
Court Doctrines.</p>
            <p>But from ſuch Catterpillers of the Chriſtian Faith as
thoſe, did ariſe, amongſt many more dangerous new Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97636:13"/>
this of being not lawful for Roman Catholicks
to go to Church, as the Law requires in <hi>England</hi> And
for the ſakes and on the wiſe Authority of ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Caſuiſts, have many of our fooliſh Forefathers
loſt two thirds of their Eſtates, rendred themſelves
ſuſpected to the people, and incapable of ſerving, as
they ought to do, their lawful Prince in his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
occaſions; which when they have attempted
to do, this their open unneceſſary diſſention has caſt
an <hi>Odium</hi> unjuſtly both on himſelf and his actions for
imploying them.</p>
            <p>Now if it be inquired by you or your Confeſſaries,
what Arguments could move Pope <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> or
his immediate Succeſſor, to ſend a Bull of Prohibition
to the Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> for going to Church, the
thing being in it ſelf no fault, and as I affirm ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
againſt the Rules and Practices of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
nay againſt the Fundamentals of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
To this I muſt anſwer, There were divers
Motives in Policy, as they obſerved things of this Iſland
in <hi>Rome,</hi> though none in Religion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they were perſwaded by ſuch Traitors as fled
hence thither, that almoſt the whole Nation remained
Catholicks, notwithſtanding the Queen had altered the
Government. And that they would find them ſuch ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
ones too, as their Holy Predeceſſors had known
them, when they made this Nation the Pack-horſe to
their pride, and a perpetual Fountain of Money to
their Treaſuries, which ſome of them with admiration
boaſted could never be exhauſted. Upon theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
they were made to believe, that ſuch a Bull
would cauſe this mighty Party to be viſible, not only
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97636:13"/>
to their Enemies, but themſelves, to the terrour of
one, and incouragement to the uniting of the other
Party. This was one, and it may be the grand motive
of that Proceeding, ſo contrary to all Preſident.</p>
            <p>The next, and in all likelihood not the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
might be the perſwaſion of thoſe Traitors, that
there would be found in <hi>England</hi> many as deſperate as
themſelves to bandy together, take Arms againſt, or
aſſaſinate the Queen, when they ſaw their Party ſo
conſiderable as this would prove it, beſides the bleſſing,
muſt needs attends ſuch pious endeavours, warranted
by his Holineſſes care and direction.</p>
            <p>But all theſe Policies and Practices did by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of that Queen and her Council, only tend to the
diſcovering ſuch deſperates, as being of the like Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
thereon took Arms, and were for it deſervedly
executed, or forced to increaſe the numbers of thoſe
Fugitives in voluntary Baniſhment. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this might, like a Meſſage from Heaven, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have warned the Catholicks of <hi>England</hi> from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
any more after News from <hi>Rome,</hi> at leaſt till
the Popes ſhould have been ſo charitable to re-admit
them into the Congregation of the Faithful, by taking
off the Excommunication from them; yet have the
private Miſſionaries (being all ſent into the Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the title of Traitors by the Law) ſo adhered to
the Tenets of the Court, as well as Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
which ſends them, that they have by degrees inſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into the Laity here many Principles of Adherence
to the Pope, that would be laught at in <hi>France,</hi> and
ſome few other rational Catholick Kingdoms. Amongſt
which, this of thinking the Popes Commands can make
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97636:14"/>
that a ſin, which in it ſelf is none, ought to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one. Upon which ground alone they refuſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Law in the thing now in debate; for which I
think they are but juſtly puniſht with the loſs of their
Eſtates.</p>
            <p>But, Brother, be you wiſer, ſtudy the Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as it is taught by Fathers and Councils, and not
as it would fain be made by the novel Poſitions of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>'s
Followers, between whom and you there is a
vaſt difference; both in the duty you owe to the King
and his Laws, as likewiſe in thoſe you ſtand obliged
in to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt, they and all other Miſſionaries, being the
hour they ſet foot here, become Traitors, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
in all the buſineſs they come about, not only
out of the protection, but under the ſevereſt cenſure
of the Law; no wonder they have not the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
for it other Subjects ought to have, but dare pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
leſſer contradictions that offend in the greater.
Nay it may be againſt their going to Church Scandal
would prove a good Argument, ſince they pretend to
be ready always to lay down their lives for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of their Faith; but this is no ways your or
any other Lay Catholicks caſe, the Law, if you obey
in ſome particulars preſcribed, giving you equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
with others of the National Principles.</p>
            <p>Another thing to be conſidered, is, That the hour
they receive Holy Orders, they take an Oath of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Pope, and ſo by the ſame Act become
Renouncers of their Allegiance to the King, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to his Holineſs. Now how far this may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to Chriſtian Religion, I will not examine here;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97636:14"/>
but I am ſure it puts them in a very different po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
as to the Popes deſigns, to what any other
Catholicks are in: They being, according to their vow,
upon the leaſt ſummons to leave the Country, and to
go where his Holineſſes good pleaſure appoints them;
which I hope none of them will be ſo impudent to ſay
you are obliged to do, Brother, except it be ſuch as
hold the mad Doctrine of Popes having power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Princes. For though the other doth not ſound
ſo ill, yet is it in effect the ſame; for to be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a Princes Subjects out of his Dominions, doth
imply a power of leaving him none there, which would
produce an effectual depoſing of him in the end.</p>
            <p>Another conſiderable difference between Lay Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
and Miſſionary Prieſts in this Kingdom, ariſes
from the ones having Eſtates, and the other none. For
no body can blame the laſt ſort of Gentlemen to deſire
their power over the Conſciences of the other ſhould
be as far extended as might be, if one conſult, as moſt
of mankind does, their private intereſt. Alas, what is
it to Mr. Politick your Ghoſtly Father, that you ſhall
loſe by your Conviction 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a year? his Allowance
will be never the leſs, he knows, but his power will be
much more. For in the firſt place, that is a ſure ſign
you are as firmly reſolved to live and die a Catholick,
as if he ſaw you at the ſtake to receive Martyrdom for
it. Do you think after that he will not take upon him
to direct you what Servants it is proper you keep,
how many Horſes, and when you may uſe them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
and when not? At what hour Maſs ſhall be,
and what is the critical minute for Dinner, Supper, and
Bed-time in a well ordered Houſe? If I had not ſeen
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97636:15"/>
the domineering Domine's extend their ſpiritual Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
in a devout Family, much beyond theſe ſmall
matters, I would have been ſilent; but Heaven knows,
and ſo do you, Brother, that in ſuch Popiſh Families,
where the Hen crows, theſe are but the leaſt of their
inſolencies: For ſuch Women as are very ill-natur'd
to their Huſbands, and perhaps ſomething ugly, have
little to imploy their time in but Maſſes, Litanies. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
Jeſus Pſalters, and Juniper-Lectures; and theſe
are generally great Friends of the Prieſts, with whom
they ſhare the Dominion of the Hen-peckt Gentleman,
till poor man he is glad to make the Confeſſaries an
Advocate to his devout Bed fellow for a Play-day,
that he may have leave to meet ſome few Neighbours
to duſt a ſtand of Ale, which he wiſhes may prove bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs,
that he might not be forc't to return again to
keep company by ſtealth with his Fellow-ſervant the
Steward in his own Cellar, where he bribes the Butler
with a ſtollen Teſter to keep counſel.</p>
            <p>Now in this condition, dear Brother, on my next Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
I expect to find you. By that time I ſuppoſe all
things will be put in due diſcipline in your Houſhold,
where, no doubt, I ſhall be welcom'd with <hi>Friday</hi>-Fares,
and new appointed Faſting-days for my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
or at leaſt driving me out of doors again; but
be it as it will, I cannot for bear telling you, that the
Prieſts, who have nothing to loſe, will animate you by
falſe pretences to incur the Sequeſtration that will ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſucceed your late Conviction, whereby they will
confirm their yet doubtful Tyranny over your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and then ſee what will follow. Beſides the
loſs of that goes into the Exchequer, you will find a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97636:15"/>
ſtrange growing charge for Indulgences, Maſſes for
your Grandfathers, Fathers, Brothers, Siſters, and all
your departed Relations Souls. Nay, if I ſhould be
ſo unkind to you as to die too, 'tis not twice my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
would pay for all the conditional Maſſes they
would ſay were abſolutely neceſſary for my terribly
to be doubted Soul. Alas, Brother, you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what a chargeable thing devotion in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, if it be accompanied with viſible ignorance, and
that the Prieſt once know the blind ſide, all goes, and
there is no ſign of it neither, the Jeſuits having a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs
Bag, into which they throw all they ever have
or ſhall get from the fooliſh Penitents of their Order.</p>
            <p>I could, nay would, and if provoked, will name ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
particular Cheats acted by the Fathers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
on devout Catholicks that were their Penitents,
and had good Eſtates, but were almoſt undone by
them in theſe late times. But I am as loth to ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
them, as I am ſure they will think me by this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
willing to do it: and therefore I ſhall omit men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
any of them particularly, eſpecially to you
who I know are ſenſible of ſome of them your ſelf.
But leaving all theſe particulars, or any thing elſe that
may too much reflect, I will return to the matter in
hand, which is the lawfulneſs of going to Church, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they or any of their Predeceſſors have, or can
ſay to the contrary.</p>
            <p>I think I have made it plain, that neither the Popes
Commands, Scandal, ſign of Faith, want of Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to be ſatisfied in the ſcruples Sermons might raiſe,
nor the fear of ſome future Teſt, can oblige any Lay
Catholick to diſobey the Law by Recuſancy: But
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97636:16"/>
rather notwithſtanding theſe Prieſtly Inventions, they
are all obliged in Conſcience to go to Church, as long
as the Magiſtrates, who gives vigour to the Law, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it. Now I will a little touch upon thoſe things
that the Law farther requires to be done by Lay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
not ſeeking Imployments, and ſo leave you after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
Brother, to your prayers and tears, that
God would turn the hearts of the Rulers, if you ſhall
ſtill obſtinately perſiſt in your reſolution of rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in a crowd without reaſon, than ſave your ſelf
by it.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, let us conſider the Oath of Allegiance,
againſt the taking of which there want not numbers of
Jeſuits and Prieſts that do exclaim, nor many Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
that thereupon fear to take it, though as King
<hi>James</hi> well obſerved in the compiling it, there was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
care taken as well by himſelf as others, that
there might not be one word in it, which might raiſe a
ſcruple in a perſon willing to obey the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, this is ſo certainly true, that I
never yet could meet with one rational Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any ſentence, word, or ſyllable in it (except
ſuch as were grounded on that, not only Heretical, but
Diabolical Doctrine of the Popes having power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Princes) notwithſtanding this, I ſay, yet had and
have the Miſſionaries ſuch full dependence on the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that a great part of them, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Jeſuits and their Devotes did always both
then and lately ſtrive to raiſe ſcruples in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the more confiding ſort of Lay Papiſts, to
hinder them from taking it; by that means ſtriving as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97636:16"/>
much as in them lay, to keep ſome ready for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of any deſperate Attempt they might have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to deſign upon the State.</p>
            <p>Now, Brother, I deſire you would not take me to
be too uncharitable in this aſſertion of mine. For to
what purpoſe elſe ſhould they ſtrive to deter men from
taking an Oath, the refuſal whereof is of the direſt
conſequence, both to Life and Eſtate, and yet wherein
there is not the leaſt thing contrary to Religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the renouncing all rebellious deſigns be ſuch? I
wiſh with all my heart I could frame ſome other leſs
reflecting excuſe, both for thoſe Perſons of Quality
and leſſer perſons ſake, that have formerly and very
lately by their inſinuations, not only ſcrupled, but too
notoriouſly refuſed giving the Kingdom that ſmall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of their future Loyalty by taking it; but I
fear it is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Now what in the name of wonder can the meaning
be, that when the Law, Religion, Reaſon it ſelf, and the
Example of many noble, many wiſe, many devout,
many, nay moſt zealous Catholicks of the Kingdom's
readineſs to take it, ſhould concur to perſwade all to
do it, yet that there ſhould be ſtill a Party ſo led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the dogmatical Authority of the Jeſuits, that
without ſhewing a reaſon, dare boldly affirm it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
it may be, as a ſtrong Argument, adding a forc't
ſigh, with a <hi>Miſerere</hi> for thoſe that do take it? I ſay
that there ſhould be ſtill ſuch a Party amongſt us, that
on no better grounds have, and do refuſe ſo juſtifiable
and neceſſary an Oath, is not only a great wonder,
but a terrible ſcandal to all thoſe of a contrary Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97636:17"/>
They no doubt (and it may be not without Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice)
do believe there wants only opportunity for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
to renew all thoſe bloody Stratagems againſt
the State the Predeceſſors of the Refuſers of that Oath
did unſucceſsfully attempt, though we in our private
diſcourſes do never ſo much pretend to abhor them.</p>
            <p>For when they reflect, that few or none of us but hold
the Pope can abſolve us from any Oath we have or
can take, and that many of us reſolve not to ſtand in
need of that, but to refuſe all Oaths that ſhould oblige
us to the performance of our duty to the King; how
can ſuch, not having any violent propenſity of love to
us, but believe that there is ſome damnable deſign
lockt up in the breaſts of ſuch Refuſers, in which the
others may cloſe when it is ripe, there being no more
hold of them than of a wet Eel by the tail, ſince an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
Bull upon the Gates, or for a need on the ruines
of <hi>Pauls,</hi> makes the Government and us as much ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
as if we never had ſeen one the other?</p>
            <p>Now I proteſt, when I have ſeriouſly reflected on
ancient Popiſh Plots, on ſome ſorts of Tenets, which
we almoſt think Catholick, as this of the Popes Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Abſolving from Oaths, which Proteſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
nay and ſome Catholicks too, means from Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
and on the obſtinacy of us to refuſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Law in things indifferent; I ſay, when
I have reflected on theſe things without the prejudice
given me by my Education, I have wondred the Laws
againſt us have not been more ſevere than they are,
nay that they almoſt ſuffered a people, of whom they
could have no more certainty in State-affairs, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
declared humble Servants to a Foreign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to live at all amongſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97636:17"/>
Now, Brother, I will not at all diſpute the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Religion to take the Oath of Allegiance, ſince
I know you have taken it, and are not yet ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
bigotted to the Obedience of the ſpiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of your Ghoſtly Tyrant, but that you be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
on requiring to do it again; ſo that a diſcourſe of
that nature would be needleſs to you. But for all
that, I will a little glance on that Propoſition ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
accepted of, the Popes having power to abſolve
at pleaſure any perſon from an Oath he hath taken.</p>
            <p>Now that he has undertook to do this, is beyond
contradiction, and that ſeveral changes and revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Affairs of the World, both private and publick,
have thereupon happened, is as plain. But by what
Authority he at firſt aſſumed that Power, I believe is
not, and may be worth a rational Catholicks inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after, that he may the better know how with a
good Conſcience (that will hold teſt before the Popes
Superiour at the laſt Tryal) to demean himſelf in a
Country, whoſe Magiſtrates are of another Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Now as a ſtep towards this matter, I will beg leave
of his Holineſs to believe there were men in the
World, and Governments too, before there were
Popes; and that there were too amongſt them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Moral Rules, by which they began, continued,
and increaſed in the World. Now no doubt amongſt
many others there were ſolemn Compacts confirmed
by overt Acts, which they accounted Sacred; and
whoſoever, after having entred into ſuch Holy obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
did violently break them, were by the reſt
of mankind either extirpated, if dangerous, or deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97636:18"/>
and never more truſted, if weakly ſo perjur'd.</p>
            <p>Now it will as certainly follow, that new Accidents
and Revolutions in Common-wealths or Families,
might make it morally neceſſary, that the obligations
lying upon one or many perſons therein, by ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
tyes, ought to be broke for the ſafety it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the whole. An obſervation of which Mankind
ſoon found out Methods to diſtinguiſh perſons ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
acting againſt thoſe ſacred tyes which we call
Oaths, from ſuch as wilfully deſpiſed them; That the
firſt ſort, though breaking their Vows literally, might
be kept from the ſcandal and puniſhment of Covenant-breakers,
whilſt the laſt ſhould remain ſtill under the
laſh of the Law, or contempt of their fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Humane Nature falling neceſſarily under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
it was requiſite to appoint or agree upon
ſome Judgment, which ſhould be abſolute in the point
of determining when men were perjur'd by breaking
their Vows, and when not, to which perſons naturally
would have recourſe before they attempted the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it.</p>
            <p>Now theſe Compacts, Oaths, or Vows were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
either in Temples, with the aſſiſtance of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Miniſters made, or at leaſt ſworn by the Deity
or Deities, to which ſuch people were devoted; and
therefore Conſultations concerning the neceſſity of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
thoſe Reſolutions, were uſually had with the
chiefeſt of thoſe Heavenly Officers: and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
amongſt ſome, other Princes of large Kingdoms
did in ancient time keep the chief Celeſtial Character
united to the Regal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:97636:18"/>
For Experience ſhewed, that men naturally ſeeking
liberty, began to pervert that obligation which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
taught, of omitting the performance of Vows, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
prejudicial to ſociety, into a belief, that there
reſided a power in theſe Spiritual Judges of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
abſolutely to abſolve at their diſcretion any
perſon they pleaſed: So quickly the one through am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of having ſuch an Authority, and the other
finding a convenience to ſatisfie their looſe appetites,
if they bribed the Poſſeſſors of this Divine good
pleaſure, did almoſt acquieſce in this unreaſonable
belief, that there was a Power delegated from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to certain men, which made them Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
And that ſuch perſons had a power to make that
at their good pleaſure no ſin, which in it ſelf, if
there be any good thing or bad, muſt naturally be
ſo.</p>
            <p>This indeed was the general practice of the ancient
World before Chriſtianity; inſomuch that <hi>Moſes</hi> the
moſt Divine Law-giver amongſt them, did take it to
himſelf, though he is far from being commended for
it by our Saviour, when he ſpeaks of the Jewiſh Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
or general Diſpenſation from one natural Oath,
which is Marriage, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was pleaſed, by virtue
of this Authority he aſſumed to himſelf, to leave to
that whole Nation.</p>
            <p>For our Saviour plainly ſays, this Power did not
come from God, but was aſſumed by <hi>Moſes</hi> for the
hardneſs of their hearts, and that all that Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
notwithſtanding to put away a Wife, except for the
caſe of Adultery (which ſeems a natural diſſolution of
the compact) was a ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:97636:19"/>
So that I conclude: Our Saviour who had almoſt as
much Authority as the Pope, never did pretend to
any like that of making things in their own natures
ſinful, to become none; but taught, that it was not in
the power of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor any man elſe to do it.</p>
            <p>Then let us deſcend to times ſucceeding that fulneſs
of it which produced the Redemption of Mankind.
S. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches ſufficiently the neceſſity of keeping
Vows; and I do not find his Holineſſes Predeceſſor
S <hi>Peter</hi> very frequent with his Diſpenſations. But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, and haſtening to thoſe Ages, in which
through the Piety of Chriſtian Emperours, the Popes
had arrived to a competency of temporal, as well as
plentitude of Spiritual Authority in the World; We
do not find for ſome Ages after, that though ſeveral
Emperours turned Arrian, any Pope pretended to an
Authority of diſpenſing their Subjects from the Oaths
of Fidelity they had taken to them.</p>
            <p>But it is poſſible ſome may, and not impertinently,
anſwer, There was then ſcarce ſuch a thing in the
World as an Oath of Allegiance; therefore Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from what were not in being, could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>To this I aſſent, and do well know Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in its Primitive Innocency taught obedience from
the Laws of Nature, which ſome called Conſcience,
and did not ſuppoſe any perſons truly toucht with its
divine Doctrines, could need any other obligation to
perform their duties either to God or their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
than what their ſacred Initiating Vow of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm
laid upon them. And ſo far I believe the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
not without a true hint, that they needed one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97636:19"/>
amongſt another no other affirmations but Yea and
Nay, and that they guided their Converſations by the
true Rule Nature had taught them, which the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
call the Light within them.</p>
            <p>But when Religion became National, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wicked people took the name of Chriſtianity more
for worldly than heavenly advantage, then were they
forced to have recourſe to new ſort of ſolemn Oaths,
taken either in Publick Churches, where Kings did
likewiſe condeſcend to take new invented Coronation
Oaths, and the People Oaths of Subjection in return.
In the management of which Ceremony, the Biſhops
were the chief Officers, which by degrees hankt a
great reſpect to them, and they not a little ambitious
of more, taught the dependency of Subjects and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
one upon the other, not to be from the Laws of
Nature, but from theſe Compacts, which their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and nothing elſe could make Sacred.</p>
            <p>Theſe dangerous Tenets Princes not only at firſt
connived at, but made uſe of. For the greateſt part of
the World being then ſhifting Subjection from the
Roman Empire to native or more neighbouring Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
was ſhatter'd into petty Regencies; ſo that
the Biſhops, who preſerved a kind of Unity of their
diſtinct Authorities in that of the Roman Sees, had a
greater power over the common peoples minds, than
thoſe Kings of Counties had. So that indeed Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was often transferred from lawful Princes that
durſt ſtomach theſe ſpiritual Uſurpations, to Uſurpers
that would truckle to the Clergy for their good word
to prefer them.</p>
            <p>Thus all things becoming again as in the firſt corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97636:20"/>
of humane Nature, where every body were
forced to ſecure themſelves from violence and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
by obligations, they believed moſt ſacred Oaths
invented or formed by Popes and other Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Method; which when there was a neceſſity
of breaking, then they were conſulted with as perſons
beſt able to judge of that neceſſity, and above all of
them the Pope, as the moſt eminent, and then thought
moſt diſintereſted Biſhop, he being well provided for
in Temporalties, and very much eaſed from ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
ſubjection to the Civil Magiſtrate, as other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
in particular ſtill remained under; ſo from an
unprejudiced aſſiſtant to Conſcience, he by frequency
of Addreſſes became at length an Umpire, then in a
manner ſole Judge of what Oaths or Compacts remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſacred, and what by contingencies ceaſed to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory.
So by degrees, as naturally all men aſpire after
Power, he took upon him to give, and the World ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
from him of courſe Diſpenſations from any
Vows were troubleſom either to their affairs or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites;
and it may be, if he could have ſtopt here,
the World and moſt Princes in it would have been
contented ſtill to have made uſe of this impoſſible
Power he had aſſumed; but at laſt they flew to ſuch
Practices, as diſturbed, nay deſtroyed their own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
the Emperours that oppoſed their inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and attempted no leſs againſt moſt Chriſtian
Kingdoms: nay to ſuch a height were they arrived,
that few Kingdoms but muſt owne they did at one
time or other receive a new Race of Kings from their
appointment. And though ſeveral of them, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
this Kingdom, have by Gods Providence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97636:20"/>
again their natural Princes, yet was it long
firſt, and perhaps not truly in this Nation, till King
<hi>James</hi>'s aſſuming the Crown. But this exceſs, as well
in their extention, as execution of their uſurp't Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
alarm'd the World, and put that upon new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations
for its ſafety againſt a Power which pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the depoſing of Princes, and alteration of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
without ſo fair a warning as the beat of
Drum. This produced our Statute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any perſon that ſhould bring a Bull from <hi>Rome,</hi>
and that as early as <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's days, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is likewiſe provided, That if any Nuntio, Legate,
&amp;c. ſhould preſume to ſet foot in this Nation on a
Meſſage from the Pope, without having firſt procured
the Kings Licence, he ſhould be proceeded againſt as
an Enemy to the State.</p>
            <p>This and many other Laws of the like kind made
both in this Nation and other Kingdoms about thoſe
times, ſufficiently ſhew how weary and afraid the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
World were grown of the Popes Pride and
Uſurpations.</p>
            <p>But to return to the matter: If we will be ſo fooliſh
to allow all things may lawfully be done, that have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully
been ſo, then the Popes have not only a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to abſolve all perſons from their Oaths and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts,
but likewiſe to alter the Government of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and diſpenſe to Subjects their natural obediences
to their lawful Soveraigns, which are Tenets few Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks in the World do hold to the full,
and ſuch as do, it is pity ſhould be ſuffered to breathe
any Air in ſafety but that of S. <hi>John's de Lateran,</hi> or
the <hi>Vatican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:97636:21"/>
But not to leave the matter fully as I found it upon
doubtful Suppoſitions, whether they have any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or no to diſpenſe with any ſort of Vows whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I will proceed to divide all ſorts of Oaths in
the World under theſe three ſeveral kinds.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Oaths to declare ones aſſent, or to ſtrengthen
ones duty in performance of ſuch things as the Law
imprinted in every rational Soul does require, ſhould
however be done.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Oaths of Compact between Prince and
Prince, State and State, or private perſon and private
perſon, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Voluntary Vows or Oaths to perform
ſome Religious exerciſe or function, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Under theſe three Heads I conceive all Oaths that
have ever ſeemed to need or require Diſpenſation, do
fall. As from Oaths in Evidence, thoſe come not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our conſideration.</p>
            <p>Now in the firſt kind, neither the Pope, nor any
Power that is, or ever was viſible on Earth, could or
can diſpenſe; for that implies an Authority to give
leave to commit things <hi>malas in ſe,</hi> and under this
Head does clearly fall obedience of Subjects to their
Princes, Children to their Parents, &amp;c. things that, if
there never had been Religion, would have no ſooner
loſt their reſpect, but humane Nature would have loſt
its being by running into perfect confuſion, which
would quickly have produced its perfect extirpation.
So that Oaths of this kind were not invented to create,
but to keep in memory our duty: And where, upon
great confuſions in, and alterations of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
they have ſeemed to be otherways, in ſuch
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97636:21"/>
caſes they will fall under the next Head.</p>
            <p>Which are Compacts ratified by Oath for mutual
convenience. Theſe no power on Earth, neither ever
could or had Authority to diſpenſe with, except by
conſent of all Parties to the Bargain or Agreement; for
to affirm the contrary, would imply ſome one perſon
ſtill remaining in Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> State of Nature, preſiding
over all his Leviathans, who ſhould not only have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
right to every thing in the World, but to break and
diſſolve all the Government of it at his pleaſure, and
indeed to annihilate humane Nature it ſelf. But
though no ſingle perſon ſimply can have this Power of
diſpenſing the performance of Compacts, yet have the
Compactors themſelves the undoubted Right of relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
one the other without conſultation of any perſon
unconcerned in the World.</p>
            <p>Yet have Popes not only in the firſt, but likewiſe in
the laſt, often put in their fingers, as particularly in
the <hi>Hungarians</hi> fatal breach of ſolemn Faith, to the
which puniſhment viſibly ſhowr'd from Heaven on the
perjur'd Army, owned by many Catholick Divines
almoſt as miraculous, has ſufficiently evidenced to the
World what little confirmation above is of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and deſtructive Diſpenſations. But when the
Compactors themſelves diſpenſe one the other, no body
bogles or ſtarts at the breach of the Oath, as we ſee
lately in <hi>Holland,</hi> where the States General diſpenſed
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> themſelves and the Country of
an Oath taken againſt State-Holders, which I have
not yet heard of any man ſo ſay was not lawful for
them by mutual conſent to do. Though I know, had
it been a Popiſh Country, there would have been ſome
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97636:22"/>
Fees expected at the Apoſtolick Chamber for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſes
unneceſſary Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, that Oaths in themſelves diſpenſable,
are eaſily by the proper perſons diſpenſed, without the
Authority of a heavenly Delegate, who can never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to a greater Dominion rightfully in the matter,
than as a perſon whoſe diſcretion is proper to adviſe
with, and can only be that too to ſuch as are pleaſed
freely to think him ſo.</p>
            <p>But as for the laſt branch of Religious Vows, the
Author or Preſcriber of the form and faſhion of the
thing to which they ſwear, may have power to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
at diſcretion from the performance of it; and I
will not ſay but in our Church this may be the Popes
Province, which if he pleaſes to keep within, he may;
but if he will be ſtill medling, without being called,
with other mens concerns, let him for me; but I fear
it will be but to very little purpoſe; Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
being now wiſer than to be over aw'd too much
by his Pragmatical cenſures.</p>
            <p>Dear Brother, think not I have treated thus long
upon Vows and Diſpenſations to inform you or any
man elſe in this Age, who are wiſe enough without
my help to know that all this boaſted Power of the
Popes to diſpenſe men from Oaths or their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
has no foundation in Reaſon or Religion, and is
only bolſter'd up with Examples of the ſucceſs of ſome
former Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in their inſolencies; which way
of arguing is juſt of the ſame Authority, as if I ſhould,
to prove the piety of High-way robbing, tell you the
ſtory of the late famous <hi>Hind,</hi> who living many years
on that profeſſion, yet had the honour to dye for his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97636:22"/>
Loyalty to his Prince, and not as a Thief.</p>
            <p>But paſſing all theſe things over, I do conclude, it is
not only lawful to take the Oath of Allegiance, but to
keep it when we have done, nay that we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to do the laſt under pain of eternal damnation,
let the Pope ſay or diſpenſe the contrary how he pleaſe.
And further I do affirm, no rational man can prove the
contrary ſufficiently of the other Oath, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its Bugbear name of Supremacy.</p>
            <p>Nay now he's quite gone beyond recovery I am
afraid you your ſelf will ſay notwithſtanding all bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
affection, and then you'll go on in crying there
was ſome hopes of recovering me to the Catholick
Religion, whilſt I only pleaded for going to Church
and the Oath of Allegiance, but to ſay it is lawful to
take that horrible terrible Oath of Supremacy, ſhews
me a confirmed Heretick, ready to take the Teſt on
the firſt opportunity for an Imployment.</p>
            <p>But, Brother, I deſire you to ſuſpend your cenſure
of damnation againſt me, leſt you prove as raſh in it,
as the Pope was that firſt Excommunicated this whole
Nation in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time. For no doubt he
and ſeveral of his Succeſſors ſince have in their minds
ſecretly repented ſo inconſiderate an act, though they
will not acknowledge it, by taking off that cenſure,
till ſome previous Action of the Nation requires it,
which I am not like to live to ſee. My reaſon for this
Suppoſition is one of the motives of my aſſerting the
lawfulneſs for us of taking the Oath of Supremacy.
For what reaſon can there be for our refuſing to do ſo,
ſince he refuſes all ſpiritual Superiority over us, and
the King accepts it, and in theſe two points conſiſts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97636:23"/>
the whole ſcope of this Oath? It requires me to ſwear
the Pope has no Authority over this Kingdom. And
if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will take his own honeſt word, he has not, nor will
not have. What can be better than his own moſt ſolemn
Excommunication to prove it?</p>
            <p>The next Point I am to ſwear, is, That the King is
Head of all Perſons and Affairs as well Eccleſiaſtical
as Civil in theſe his Dominions, which no perſon
that hath his right wits I think can deny, as the caſe
now ſtands. For if ever the Popes were Heads or
Supreme in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs within this Nation,
they have long ſince, by an Act of their own as well as
of the Nations, ceaſed to be ſo. Therefore if any be,
it muſt be the King, ſince the Law ſays ſo; though it
be worth inquiring as to this point, how the Law
means him Head of Eccleſiaſtical matters.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſuppoſe it means Head of that Church and
the Eccleſiaſtical Affairs therein that is eſtabliſhed by
Law. For it cannot mean any other, ſince we ſee a
power of Diſpenſation contrary to Law for the moſt
minute diſſenters, to meet in another Form of ſerving
God, has been controverted. Not to ſay more of
the point therefore: if there muſt be but one Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
eſtabliſhed, and no other tolerated, then the Law
only intends him Head of that, which the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
will not deny him to be. So I ſuppoſe I may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſwear him that, which no other perſon ever did
or can pretend to beſides. Now this matter having
been excellently well treated of and handled in former
times by ſome learned Caſuiſts, when the Intention of
the Law, in the point which commands the Oath, was
not ſo plain as the Law-makers by late paſſages ſeem
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97636:23"/>
to make it; I ſay, ſince many good Catholick Caſuiſt
Prieſts have writ in defence of the taking it in former
times, I will omit to preſs that further, which to me
appears plain; reſolving however, if you ſhall ſend me
your doubts, of this or any other point diſcuſſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that I will readily anſwer them to the beſt of my
ſkill, being ſatisfied in my Conſcience, that I have ſaid
nothing herein ſcandalous to Catholick Religion it
ſelf, nor to any one but ſuch that make that the ſheeps
raiment for wolviſh deſigns.</p>
            <p>So, Brother, once again I deſire you to take into
your ſerious conſideration, what it is to loſe a good
Eſtate, not for conſcience, but ignorance, to make
your ſelf uncapable of doing ſervice to your Prince,
when there may be occaſion; but above all, what
ſcandal you ſtamp on the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion you profeſs, if you
obſtinately and without reaſon ſhall perſiſt in diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to every thing the Law appoints the Subjects
of this Nation to do.</p>
            <p>As for your expectation of aſſiſtance from the King,
it is one of the moſt unreaſonable things, examine it
rightly, that can enter into the heads of men, whether
you take it quadrate to his perſonal or rational In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>For alas, to ſay the Catholicks of this Nation were
all loyal, or rather truly not diſloyal to his Father and
him, is but to make a Hiſtory of a very ſhort Age.
For all the World knows, that it is as poſſible for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
to be Rebels, if it conſiſts with their Intereſts,
as any other men; for he that ſhould deny this, might
as well affirm we had no ſuch thing as Rebellions in
<hi>England</hi> before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97636:24"/>
if he would conſider how King <hi>Johns</hi> Charter
of Priviledges was extorted from him, he would by
no means aſſert. But alas, let us ſay what we will on
this ſide the Water, our Brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> we know
too well, led the dance to all the late miſchieſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
now I reflect on it, they were out-poſted by the
Covenanters of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But indeed it is a folly to
expect that any Religion, being once become an Art,
will refuſe to have recourſe to the Sword againſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oppreſt, and I am afraid it is much for want of
numbers proportionable, the beſt of them are quiet in
ſuch circumſtances.</p>
            <p>But however ſuppoſing the beſt, that all Catholicks
were loyal, and that their Principles made them ſo,
is that an Argument ſufficient to make the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
all his other Subjects to be otherways by his
Indulgence to them, who are not as one man to a
hundred of the Nation? Which is moſt reaſonable,
that you, dear Brother, ſhould ſtrive as far as you can
by the Rules of your Religion to comply with the
Law for your own advantage, or that the King ſhould
be forced to ſtop the courſe of it to his own prejudice
to comply with your nice obſtinacy, meerly becauſe
he has your bare word, that you will be very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him? If another Rebellion ſhall on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ariſe, I am confident the caſe thus ſtated, as
certainly it does at preſent ſtand, all rational men,
nay the Pope himſelf, would conclude, that the King
in not medling, but letting the Law and you tug for
it, is much in the right. Nor could he himſelf, were
he a Subject of any Catholick Country, expect more
friendſhip or favour. So for whoſe ſake this happens
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97636:24"/>
to you is not material, ſo it is, and is like to be. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let me once again adviſe you, go to Maſs at ſeven,
to Church at nine, and if Mr. Politick ſcruples giving
you Abſolution for your ſins, except you confeſs that
for one, ſend to me, I'le find you one ſhall venture his
neck in the point to ſerve you for twenty pounds a
year, which you may eaſily ſave out of the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
that is <hi>demitia</hi> except you follow my counſel,
and deal with none but honeſt Catholick Prieſts, not
Roman Courtiers, Men that aſpire to be Provincials,
nay perhaps General of their Orders for their ſturdy
tricks in oppoſition to our Laws. Theſe things I have
ſaid are great truths, that you will thank me for one
day, if you follow the advice; if not, you will repent
your ſelf, when you ſhall be aſhamed not to perſiſt
contrary to reaſon in what you ſo unreaſonably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
            <p>I could, Brother, have ſaid much more to the
Point, which it may be I will add as I find you reliſh
this; till when I ſhall remain, ſaying <hi>Paters</hi> and <hi>Aves</hi>
for the opening of your underſtanding to your own
good: So farewel.</p>
