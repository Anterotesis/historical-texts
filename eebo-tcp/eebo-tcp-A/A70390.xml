            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>1 PETER iii. 16.</bibl>
               <q>Having a good Conſcience; that whereas they ſpeak evil of you, as of evil doers, they may be aſhamed that falſly accuſe your good Converſation in Chriſt.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE laſt Lord's Day I made the former Verſe of this Chapter the Subject of what I then ſaid in this Place; which I ſhall not repeat: only let me put you in mind, that I told you who were then preſent, That it was the Duty of every one who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelf to be a Chriſtian, to be ready to give to every Man that asketh him, a Reaſon of the Hope that is in him. Under which Term <hi>[Hope]</hi> by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of a part for the whole, is comprehended and underſtood our whole Faith and Religion, and all our religious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Performances; for all which, as we ought to be able to give a Reaſon or Ground why we ſo believe, hope, act, and why we ſo profeſs, to our own Hearts and Conſciences; ſo we ought alſo to be able and ready to give the like Reaſon or Ground of the ſame to others that ask it of us, (which yet ſuffers ſome Limitation that I ſhall not now repeat) to the end, that by the ſame, they may be convinced to embrace the ſame way with us, as God is pleaſed to make us inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, by the Operation of his Holy Spirit, to produce that effect, or at leaſt to put to ſilence their unjuſt Clamours againſt us.</p>
            <p>But the chief thing is, with good Reaſon, to be perſuaded in our own Conſciences, that what we ſo believe, hope, or act, is true and right, is approved in the ſight of God; and in that we ſhall have Peace.</p>
            <p>In the opening of the Words of this 16th Verſe, I purpoſe to anſwer theſe three Queſtions; I. What Conſcience is. II. What a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is, and how a good Conſcience is diſtinguiſhed from an evil Conſcience. III. What the Rule of a good Conſcience is, according to which it ought to be directed and guided.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, I anſwer; Conſcience is that Power or Faculty of our reaſonable Soul or Mind, that can and doth reflect on our Thoughts, Words, and Deeds, both preſent and paſt, ſo as to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine concerning them, whether they be really or apparently right or wrong, good or evil, juſtifiable or reproveable. Hence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95814:5"/>
the Conſcience of the Heathen, or Gentiles, is ſaid <hi>to bear witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while to accuſe or excuſe one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ſecond, I anſwer; There are ſeveral things altogether neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to denominate a Man's Conſcience to be good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It muſt be an enlightned Conſcience, with a good meaſure of true Knowledge, whereby to know what is right and good, or wrong and evil. An ignorant Conſcience cannot be good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Obedience of the Heart and Will of Man to what he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of his Duty either to be believ'd or practis'd, is neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate the Conſcience to be a good Conſcience: for though true Conviction and Knowledge are neceſſary, yet that alone, without Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is not ſufficient to denominate the Conſcience to be good; even though the Knowledge and Conviction come from the Spirit of God, there muſt be a Conſent and Harmony betwixt the Underſtanding and the Will to conſtitute and denominate the Conſcience to be good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Conſcience that is purged and juſtified by the Blood of Chriſt, even the Blood of his Croſs, that was outwardly ſhed, <hi>through Faith in that Blood,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. and where the Heart and Conſcience, and whole Soul and Body, is ſanctified by the Spirit of God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work of Regeneration is known by the Spirit of God, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience only of ſuch a Man is a good Conſcience; I ſay, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt be purged by the Blood of Chriſt, that it may be good. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. <hi>For if the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh; how much more ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without Spot to God, purge your Conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</hi> And the Faith which is in the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. is wrought in us, and generally in all who have it, by means of the <hi>written Word;</hi> that is to ſay, by the Doctrine of Chriſt crucified, and the ſpiritual Bleſſings we have by him, as it is preached to us; for, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Faith comes by Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Hearing by the Word, and that Word is the outward Word, as it is in the mouth of the Preachers;</hi> as it followeth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher, and how ſhall they preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be ſent?</hi> Hence the Word, even the doctrinal Word, is called <hi>the incorruptible Se<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, of which true Believers are regenerated and born again,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. And Chriſt, in the Parable, compar'd his Preaching to the People <hi>to the Husbandman that ſoweth his ſeed in the ſeveral ſorts of ground,</hi> Matth. 13. 3.</p>
            <p>There are a great <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Among the</hi> Quakers.</note> many, who think they have a good Conſcience, but they have no need of <hi>this Blood of Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95814:5"/>
nor of Faith in it; they will have <hi>the Object of their Faith only within them;</hi> they find no need of having the Conſcience ſprinkled by the Blood of Chriſt without them; nay, they argue againſt it, as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible Notion, not conſidering that this Sprinkling is ſpiritually by Faith, <hi>and not by any material Application.</hi> Alſo they have a wrong Notion of Faith; they think they have no need of the <hi>written Word,</hi> or any <hi>outward Means</hi> or Helps, to have this Faith wrought in them: <hi>The Spirit or Light within, alone, doth all; the Light within them is ſufficient to Salvation, without any thing elſe; the Light within them is whole Chriſt, God and Man, Fleſh, and Spirit, and Bone.</hi> They need no Chriſt without them, nor no written Word without them; they can Preach, Pray, Believe, without Book, without all outward Helps; <hi>they need no Crutches,</hi> as ſome argue againſt <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> and call them <hi>Crutches</hi> to lame Perſons, which whole and ſound Men need not. So others make no more of the <hi>written Word,</hi> the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel, as outwardly delivered us in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>but as Crutches which they have no need of at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They will not allow of any written Word at all, or any outward Word; they ask where we find a written Word in Scripture? I tell them, I find it in <hi>John</hi> 15. 25. where Chriſt calleth a ſhort Sentence that he quoted out of a Pſalm of <hi>David,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>that written Word.</hi> They ſay, they call the Scripture what it calleth it ſelf, to wit, a Treatiſe; for which they quote <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 1. <hi>the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatiſe;</hi> but had they underſtood or conſulted the <hi>Greek,</hi> they would have found it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>the former Word,</hi> whereby he underſtands the whole Book of the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Luke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to the diſtinction betwixt a good and evil Conſcience, of which alſo the Scripture ſpeaks. 1. An evil Conſcience is an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Conſcience. 2. Unfaithfulneſs, and Diſobedince to what a Man is convinced of, renders the Conſcience to be evil. 3. Unbelief, and want of Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, makes the Conſcience evil. 4. Not to follow the dictates of Conſcience, even when it errs, is an evidence of an evil Conſcience. Here that <hi>Axiom</hi> takes place, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia errans ligat ſed non obligat,</hi> an erring Conſcience ties but doth not oblige; it is a great pinch and ſtrait: He <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> follows not an erring Conſcience ſinneth, becauſe he acts not in Faith, and <hi>what is not of faith is ſin;</hi> and when he followeth his erring Conſcience he ſinneth. This is no new Doctrine, however poſſibly it may ſo ſeem to ſome here; it is that which every Caſuiſt doth commonly teach: I will illuſtrate it to you by a Similitude that ſome have given. If a Subject be deceived by a counterfeit Meſſenger from his Prince, who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95814:6"/>
brings a counterfeit Meſſage from the King, ſealed with a counterfeit Seal, and he thinks it to be real, this Subject ſufficiently ſhews his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect and diſloyalty to his Prince, if he refuſe to obey it; the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is eaſie. If any object, that as Contradictories cannot be both true or both falſe, but the one true and the other falſe; ſo, if to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an erring Conſcience be a ſin, not to follow it is no ſin, being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory: But I anſwer, they are not Contradictory, for they are both affirmative Propoſitions: <hi>He that followeth an erring Conſcience ſinneth,</hi> this is affirmative; <hi>He that followeth not an erring Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſinneth,</hi> this is alſo affirmative. But the way to get out of this pinch, is to get a well-informed Conſcience, and to get rid of thoſe Errours of Conſcience, which prejudice of Education by evil Teachers has led them into; read the Holy Scriptures, ſearch, meditate, pray God to give you a good Underſtanding, and let you ſee your Errours; confer with ſuch whom you have good cauſe to eſteem both more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more wiſe and underſtanding than your ſelves.</p>
            <p>To the third and laſt, what the Rule of Conſcience is, according to which it muſt be directed and guided, that ſo it may be denominated a good Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt an inadequate or incomplete Rule of Conſcience, and that which is adequate and complete. The Law writ in the Heart of every Man, is an incomplete Rule to a Man's Conſcience, obliging every Chriſtian to obey it, ſo that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tranſgreſſeth againſt it, is guilty of hainous ſin; and this Law extendeth in ſome degree to moſt of all, yea in ſome ſort to all the ten Precepts of the Moral Law; but our higheſt Obedience to that Law and Rule, cannot denominate the Conſcience good, or give true peace of Conſcience, or heal the wound of it that ſin hath given; <hi>for all have ſinned and faln ſhort of the Glory of God; and whatſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law, that every mouth may be ſtopped, and the whole world become guilty before God.</hi> The beſt of our Obedience cannot make atonement for our ſins; nay, not for one ſin, not the leaſt ſin; it is only the <hi>Lamb of God, as he was ſlain for us, that takes away our ſins, as we have faith in him, his Blood cleanſeth us <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> all ſin;</hi> and the Merit and Value of it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to us the Gift of the Holy Spirit, to ſanctifie us; and therefore we owe both our Juſtification and Sanctification to the Lamb of God, and to his moſt precious Blood; for by our Juſtification we are cleanſed from the guilt of ſin, and by our Sanctification from the filth of it.</p>
            <p>And though Faith and Repentance are neceſſary conditions and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications to our obtaining Remiſſion of ſin, Juſtification and eternal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95814:6"/>
Salvation, yet they are not in any wiſe the meritorious Cauſe thereof; but Chriſt alone, by what he hath done and ſuffered for us. Holineſs, and our Obedience to God's Laws and Precepts, both as writ without in the Holy Scriptures, and as writ within in our Hearts, is indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary to our eternal Salvation; but we muſt not reſt nor rely upon it, even when it is wrought in us by the help of the Holy Spirit; it muſt not be the foundation or ground of our Faith, and hope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, and eternal Salvation, either in whole or in part; but our reliance muſt be alone on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, both God and Man, as he died for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and on the Mercy of God through him, apprehended by Faith.</p>
            <p>Now the knowledge of this in God's ordinary way is given to us, and all who have it, by the inward Illumination and Operation of the Holy Spirit, in the uſe of the written Word, as it is preached and heard by us, or read and meditated upon, <hi>We feeling the working of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, to mortifie the works of the fleſh, and the earthly members, and to draw up our mind to high and heavenly things;</hi> as the 17th Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Church of <hi>England</hi> plainly expreſſeth.</p>
            <p>The complete and adequate Rule therefore of our Faith and Practice is the whole revealed Will of God, as it is declared unto us in the Holy Scriptures; the Laws and Precepts whereof are of a far greater extent than thoſe writ in every Man's heart, without all Scripture Revelation, or antecedent to it: as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy Commandment is exceeding broad;</hi> that is, the whole complex or body of the Divine Laws given us by God and Chriſt, as they are contained in the Holy Scriptures, for Doctrine, for Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for Inſtruction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore a great and dangerous Errour in them who hold (as many do in theſe Nations) that the Light within, and what it dictates in every Man, is the full and entire, complete and perfect Rule of all Faith and Practice; and nothing is abſolutely needful to our Salvation, but what that Light within teacheth us and all Mankind, or will teach us if we hearken to it, and obey it, without all Scripture, and all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of Inſtruction; and yet the utmoſt extent that this Light within goeth to teach Men without Scripture, and without the ſpecial Illumination and Operation of the Spirit accompanying the Scripture's Teſtimony, is no more than the Righteouſneſs of the Moral Law, and Terms of the firſt Covenant, <hi>Do and Live:</hi> which Covenant we have all tranſgreſſed, and therefore cannot be ſaved by the Terms of it. But God in his great Mercy has given us a better Covenant, the Covenant of Grace and Peace, in and through the Knowledge and Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, as he is the Word made Fleſh, or God incarnate, the Terms of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95814:7"/>
which are gentle and eaſie, and full of Conſolation, God thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he will pardon the Sins of all that ſincerely repent, and truly believe the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſincerely reſolve and endeavour to keep his Commands, and give to them eternal Life; the which Terms God has graciouſly promiſed to help every one of us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, by the Offer and Gift of his Holy Spirit, as it accompanies the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But theſe new Terms of the Covenant of Grace, the Light, as it is an univerſal Principle in all Men, by whatſoever Name they will call it, or whatſoever Worth they will aſcribe to it, both Scripture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience doth tell us, doth not teach them. <hi>He ſheweth his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judgments unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation; and as for his Judgments, they have not known them,</hi> Pſal. 147. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>The Jews had this Advantage over the Heathen World, that <hi>unto them were committed the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 2. the <hi>exceeding great and precious Promiſes,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. which the Heathen World, to whom the Goſpel was not preach'd, had not: and we have that Advantage now that the Jews then had. But the Gentiles being without the Goſpel, are ſaid to be <hi>without God and Chriſt in the World,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 12. <hi>i. e.</hi> without an Intereſt in God and Chriſt, and without Hope; Aliens and Strangers to the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The higheſt Acts of Obedience to <hi>any Light within</hi> us, without the Goſpel, and without Faith in Chriſt crucified and rais'd again, do not denominate us the Children of God, nor prove us to have any juſt Title or Claim to the eternal Inheritance; for whoſoever are the Children of God, they are ſo by <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the Scripture expreſly declareth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. And the Goſpel requireth, that to obtain Salvation, we muſt confeſs with our Mouths, and believe with our Hearts, that God hath raiſed Chriſt from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8, 9. even him who died for our Sins, who was delivered for our Offences, and roſe again for our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. But <hi>the Light within,</hi> as it is an univerſal Principle, teacheth not Men theſe things, theſe great Myſteries of our Salvation, theſe lively Oracles, theſe great and precious Promiſes, nor theſe great Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion, ſuch as the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, the Incarnation of the Word, the perfect Atonement and Satisfaction that Chriſt hath made to the divine Juſtice and Law for our Sins by his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Paſſion and Death, his Aſcenſion, and Exaltation, and Mediation for us at the right hand of God in the glorified Nature of Man, conſiſting of a glorified Soul and Body, and that he is to be the Judge of the Quick and the Dead. Alſo there are divers poſitive Laws and Precepts of the Goſpel, that <hi>the Light within,</hi> as it is an univerſal Principle,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95814:7"/>
teacheth us nothing of: The Knowledge and Faith of all theſe things are given us by the written Word preached and read outwardly, and by the ſpecial Illumination of the Holy Spirit inwardly working in us a firm Perſuaſion and Faith of them, giving us a ſavoury underſtanding and reliſh of them, and great Joy and Conſolation through hope by the Knowledge and Faith of them.</p>
            <p>It proceeds from great Ignorance and Errour in many, that they will not allow any real diſtinction betwixt the <hi>common Illumination</hi> given to all Mankind, and the <hi>ſpecial Illumination</hi> given to Believers in the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Jeſus: Some will allow a diſtinction in <hi>degree,</hi> but not in <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>ſpecie;</hi> but, I ſay, they differ in <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>ſpecie,</hi> (though both come from one and the ſame Fountain, the Father of Lights, from whom all good Gifts flow, both natural, and ſpiritual, and ſupernatural) becauſe they diſcover differing Objects, <hi>i. e.</hi> differing Truths, by way of Object, that differ from theſe few Truths diſcovered by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Illumination, ſpecifically or in kind; for whatever Truth or Truths the common Illumination diſcovers to Heathens of the Being, and Power, and Providence <hi>of God, as Creator,</hi> and the Duty of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to him as ſuch, the holy Scriptures without, and the ſpecial Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the holy Spirit within, diſcovers far other and greater Myſteries of Truth, in the ineſtimable Love of God by the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World through Jeſus Chriſt, and the Duty that we owe to God and Chriſt thereby, in the Belief of his Word and Promiſes, the Obedience to his Commands, and eſpecially all and every of them gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven under the New Teſtament, as that of Baptiſm and the Supper, Obedience and Subjection to Chriſt's Government and Diſcipline he has eſtabliſhed in his Church, and to all whom he has ſet up to have the Rule over us, in his Houſe and Church.</p>
            <p>But whereas they plead for the Sufficiency of the <hi>Light within,</hi> and <hi>its Dictates,</hi> without the means of Scripture, and all outward teaching, to qualifie Men to be Chriſtians and Saints, and Heirs of eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 33. where God promiſed to put his Law in the inward parts, making the Law writ or put in the heart, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 33. to be the ſame, and of the ſame extent, and the ſame manner of heart, and manner of writing, with that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. This is a miſerable Miſtake, and a very groſs and miſchievous Errour. That in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 33. reſpects the People and Church of God; but that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. reſpects the Heathen World.</p>
            <p>The Law writ in the hearts of the Heathen World, teaching the moral Duties of Temperance, Juſtice, and general Piety towards God as Creator, is, I grant, without the means or help of Scripture, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95814:8"/>
antecedent to it; but ſo is not the Law or Laws of God writ in the hearts of Believers; whether Jews or Gentiles, who believe in the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Jeſus, peculiar to the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, as Obedience to the Faith of the Goſpel, and to the poſitive Ordinances and Inſtitutions of Chriſt, of Baptiſm and the Supper, and others aforeſaid; theſe Laws are not writ in our hearts without Scripture, nor antecedent to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but poſterior to Scripture, and by means of Scripture. Theſe poſitive and peculiar Laws of the Goſpel, writ in the hearts of true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and deeply printed and engraven in them, are no other than the Copy or Tranſcript of the Laws outwardly writ or printed in the holy Scriptures, which come to be tranſcribed into our hearts by what we daily and frequently hear preached to us, and read out of the holy Scriptures; and what we read our ſelves out of them, the Spirit of God working with our Induſtry and Labour, in our hearing, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and well pondering and meditating what we hear or read, cauſing it to take deep and living Impreſſion on our hearts, and making our hearts that were ſtony before, now to be ſoft and tender to receive that Impreſſion, and yet ſo ſolid, firm, and tenacious as to retain it, being as a Nail fixt in a firm place by the Maſters of Aſſemblies, given by one Shepherd, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 11. But ſo is not the heart of Unbelievers or Heathen Gentiles, whoſe heart is a heart of ſtone; but the heart of every ſincere Believer is a heart of fleſh, according to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. and 36. 26, 27. compared with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. But, ſay ſome, cannot the Spirit teach us without Book, even without the Scripture? Thus ſome argue for the ſufficiency of <hi>the Light within,</hi> without any thing elſe. I anſwer; and ſo can an able Schoolmaſter teach his Scholars without Book, but they cannot well learn without Book. As the Maſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendeth to the weak capacity of his Scholars to teach them by Books, ſo doth the Spirit condeſcend to our weak capacity, to teach us by the written Word.</p>
            <p>Now as concerning the peculiar poſitive Laws of the Goſpel under the New Teſtament, and the Goſpel Precepts, ſome of them are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſome leſſer, but all highly valuable and profitable. The greater are ſuch, that Obedience to them is of abſolute and indiſpenſible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to our Salvation; as, to believe in Chriſt, and to love Chriſt, and to rejoyce in Chriſt, whom yet we have neither outwardly heard nor ſeen, according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. and <hi>John</hi> 20. 29. <hi>Bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi> The leſſer are ſuch that are not of that abſolute and indiſpenſible neceſſity to Salvation in ſome caſes, thought ſtill generally neceſſary to Salvation; as, Water-Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper. It would be too uncharitable in us,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95814:8"/>
to conclude that all who die without them, fall ſhort of Salvation. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> but he ſaid not, he that is not baptized ſhall be damned, but, he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſhall be damned. Our moſt mereiful and gracious Lord knew well, that by ſome unavoidable Providences ſome could neither receive Baptiſm nor the Supper, how much ſoever they deſired it, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Death, before they could have them adminiſtred to them: in which caſe all good Caſuiſts and Divines ſay <hi>Votum Baptiſmi,</hi> i. e. The Deſire of Baptiſm, and the Willingneſs of the Mind to ſubject to it as the Ordinance of Chriſt, is equivalent to Baptiſm it ſelf: And the like may be ſaid of the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay or think of many in our day and time, who may have it, and yet through woful Ignorance and Errour, being delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by falſe Teachers, and prejudice of Education, or otherwiſe dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and blinded in their Minds, refuſe and reject it; not only break theſe two precious Commands of Chriſt, but teach Men ſo to do: And many have lived and died in this oppoſition to theſe Precepts of Chriſt, without any ſign of Repentance, being taught by their falſe Teachers to believe that they are no Commands of Chriſt. I own, to my Grief and Shame, that I have been ſo deceived by them; and I thank my gracious God that has ſpared and prolonged my natural Life until he was pleaſed to farther enlighten me, and give me to ſee my great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and renounce it, as I have done, and now to practiſe that which I formerly rejected. But to anſwer directly to the Queſtion, what other or better Anſwer can I give than the words of our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandments, and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Some underſtand it ſo, that he ſhall have no place in the Kingdom of Heaven; which is true, if he live and die in wilful Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Diſobedience: but I will not be ſo uncharitable, as to think ſo, of many who have in ſome measure in Faithfulneſs held the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Chriſtianity, and have ſincerely endeavoured to obey ſuch of the greater Commands of Chriſt, that they are periſhed; but, on the contrary, I have the charity to them, and ſo I hope and deſire that ye may have the ſame, that God has in mercy received them, and has not excluded them from the Kingdom of Heaven, notwithſtanding they have lived and died not only in the diſuſe of ſome of Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſuch as Baptiſm and the Supper, but have even continued in the oppoſition of them to the laſt moment, not throught any wilful Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, but by being impoſed upon by the high Pretences of their falſe Teachers, whom they eſteemed to be Prophets: Yet I think, without
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95814:9"/>
breach of charity, I may ſay, that for their Ignorance, and ignorant oppoſition to theſe or any of the leaſt of Chriſt's Commands, they ſhall have a leſſer degree of Glory in the Kingdom of Heaven than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they ſhould have had.</p>
            <p>I have now done with what I had to ſay in anſwer to theſe weighty Queſtions: I ſhall only obſerve one Particular from the words of the Text, which is this.</p>
            <p>That it hath oft been, and is the Lot of good Men, having a good Conſcience, to be wrongfully judged, miſrepreſented, and falſly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, both Scripture and Hiſtory abounds with Examples to prove this: as in the caſe of <hi>Joſeph, Moſes, David,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and many of the Prophets; and in the caſe of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and our Saviour; <hi>John came neither eating nor drinking, and they ſaid he had a Devil; Chriſt came eating and drinking with Publicans and Sinners, and they called him gluttonous, and a Wine-bibber:</hi> to which my Caſe ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles. Theſe four Years paſt, my Adverſaries among the <hi>Quakers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me, that I was of no Communion, neither <hi>Quaker</hi> nor <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> nor <hi>Independent</hi> nor <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> nor of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I would declare my ſelf to be of ſome particular Communion, they would not diſpute with me, nor regard me, to anſwer me; though I told them I was a Chriſtian, and a Member of the Catholick Church of Chriſt, and have great charity for all the ſincere that hold the Head in all the ſeveral Communions of Proteſtants: but this would not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, but they would inſult, and ſought to trample me under their feet, but God ſupported me.</p>
            <p>But now again, when with a good Conſcience, being farther (I bleſs God) enlightned, and my Scruples I had being fairly removed, after diligent Examination and mature Deliberation I have declared my ſelf to be for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and have joyn'd in Communion with her, they do as much reproach and revile me, and falſly accuſe me, as formerly; and ſo would they have done if I had joyned with any of the <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> but, I bleſs God, I have a good Conſcience, and my care hath been, is, and I hope ever ſhall be, to have Peace with God, and my own Conſcience; and therefore I need not be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned what my Adverſaries, or any other ignorant perſons, ſhall ſay of me. I am comforted with the words of our Bleſſed Lord to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake.</hi> This (I thank God) is my caſe: I charge my Adverſaries to prove any thing againſt me of evil Converſation. I have with Zeal and Reſolution, which God hath been pleas'd to give me, and who has
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95814:9"/>
greatly ſupported and ſtrengthened me, oppoſed and teſtified againſt their vile Errours; and this is all the cauſe of their Hatred againſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that God has been pleaſed to bleſs and proſper <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> with ſome Succeſs; ſo that both in <hi>America</hi> many and here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> both in City and Country, divers have come from Quakeriſm and gone over to the Church of <hi>England</hi> with me; yea, divers have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me, and gone before me; and divers here, I hope, will go along with me. I alſo remember what Chriſt ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 16. 2. <hi>The time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth God Service.</hi> Perſecutors commonly follow an erring Conſcience; few Perſecutors, and be ſure they are of the worſt ſort that knowingly and wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Servants of God.</p>
            <p>Having thus far proceeded, according to the Doctrine I mentioned at the beginning of this Diſcourſe, on the foregoing Verſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. I think it my Duty, and a weighty Concern lyeth upon me, to give to this Auditory the Reaſon of the Hope that is in me, of my Faith and Perſuaſion in this very particular, Why I have joined in Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> although I retain Charity to all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt-hearted of other Communions, hoping that in God's due time, the more Sincere will follow my Example; and that God will make all the Sincere, to be not only of one Faith, (as many at preſent are) but of one Way and Practice, and Uniformity, Worſhip, and Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ſo as with one mouth, and one heart and mind, to glorifie God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16. This will be a Joyful Day, which I hope many here, and elſewhere, pray for. Why then will ye not help it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by your good Examples, laying aſide all weak and inſufficient Scruples, which upon due Examination, will be found without juſt ground? And why find ye fault with thoſe that begin to give you good Example? Though this Change of mine is not ſo great as ſome imagine, I was never ſo uncharitable as I find ſome are; though I grant, I have been too uncharitable, which I have retracted: I have been for a conſiderable time very charitable to all ſober and religious Proteſtants of all ſorts, and have oft in ſecret, bewail'd their Oppoſition one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, perceiving that in great part it came more from Prejudice of Judgment and Education than any juſt Cauſe. I date not my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Chriſtianity from this Change, nay, nor from my firſt turning to the Quakers. My gracious God began early to deal with me, and turn'd my Heart towards him. I was well inſtituted in the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Chriſtianity, by the good Education I had, (for which I praiſe God,) before I knew the Quakers; and though in too many things I was miſled by them, being deceived by their high pretences to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95814:10"/>
and divine Enjoyments, by which they have deceived many as well as me, yet I retained a ſound Faith of the Fundamentals of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and did conſtantly profeſs the ſame, which I can ſufficiently prove both by my printed Books from time to time, and divers Manuſcripts; and from my Childhood to this day, God has in mercy preſerved me from all ſcandalous Converſation and Practice; whereof ſome of good Credit are ready to give a Teſtimony, who have known me for Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix Years paſt, and my manner of Converſation.</p>
            <p>I am the more concerned to give the reaſon of my ſaid Change, chiefly for the ſake of ſome of my good Friends here preſent, who though by the Bleſſing of God have been by me, as an inſtrument, brought off from the Quakers Errours, that were oppoſite to the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, yet have ſome remaining Scruples that at preſent hinder them from ſo cordial a joining with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeem to be concerned with my joining with her, which I hope God in due time will remove; and ſo far as is poſſible for me, I will endeavour, as his inſtrument, to be aſſiſting to them; as alſo for the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of ſuch who are cordially ready to join with me: And in the next place, to ſilence the unjuſt Clamours, and falſe Accuſations of my profeſſed Adverſaries, and others ignorantly prejudiced againſt me, I am deſirous to let them know that I have good reaſon for what I have done, and have acted as a rational Chriſtian Man in my ſo doing.</p>
            <p>A chief Reaſon therefore which I offer is this: Suppoſe there were a parity or equality in all other reſpects betwixt the Diſſenters and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I mean the more ſound and orthodox among them, as in Doctrine and Worſhip, Sacraments and Church-Government, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Conſtitution of Members; yet this with me doth caſt the Balance, and I think ought to caſt the Balance with any rational conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon, that on that ſuppoſition, the minority or leſſer number ſhould yield to the majority or greater number, and the younger ſhould yield to the elder, and the Daughters to the Mother. For, certain it is, that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as ſhe was in King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s time, and in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, was the <hi>Mother Proteſtant</hi> Church. The Diſſenters Forefathers had their Chriſtianity, Baptiſm, and Chriſtian Education and Profeſſion in her Communion, and were nurſed as it were in her Arms, and ſuckled at her Breaſts; and the more ſober of all Diſſenters will ſay, ſhe was a true Church then, in all the main things of Religion. Now unleſs they can prove that ſhe is changed from what ſhe then was, either in Doctrine, or Sacraments, or Worſhip, or Diſcipline, or Church-Government, in any material thing, from better to worſe, which I think they cannot do, how can they juſtifie their Separation from her?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95814:10"/>
And I think I may ſafely add, that the wiſer Men and ableſt in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Learning and Piety, and in the ſound Knowledge of the Scriptures to inſtruct the Ignorant, and convince or put to ſilence Oppoſers, to refute Antichriſtian and Popiſh Errors as well as all other old and late Hereſies are much more numerous to be found in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And what ſolid Learning the ableſt of the Diſſenters have had, ſo far as may be acquired by outward means, has been originally by means of Church of <hi>England</hi> Men. She hath been all along, and ſtill is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bulwark againſt Popery (whereof ſhe hath given ſufficient Proof from time to time, witneſs the many elaborate and excellent Books and Tracts written by her Members) againſt Popery eſpecially, and other old and new Hereſies, as Deiſm, Atheiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, let the Libraries and Cloſets of the generality of the Diſſenters Miniſters be ſearched, who are the more knowing and judicious, and of beſt repute among them, either for Piety or Learning, and it will be found, that they have more Books of Church of <hi>England</hi> Divines, and other forraign Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines who own Communion with her, than of any others? And yet for all this ſhall I be ſo uncharitably judged, and my Friends who go along with me, as a ſort of Apoſtates, and as having bad Ends and Deſigns, and as ſome of them (I hear) ſuggeſt againſt me, that I do it for a Living, I pray God forgive their uncharitable Judgment, I neither was nor yet am ſo hard put to it for a worldly Living, as ſome imagine, and as others wiſh and deſire, I mean of my Adverſaries among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have Prophecied of my outward as well as inward Ruine, and longed to have their falſe Prophecies accompliſhed againſt me; but God hath hitherto diſappointed them, and preſerved me and mine from Ruine both inwardly and outwardly, for which I bleſs his Name, and I hope he will preſerve me to the End. Why ſhould the Expectation of a Living incline me more to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters? Had I joyned with them, I might have got a Living among them, perhaps more <hi>plentiful by the Peoples Gratuities,</hi> than by a <hi>Set main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Which laſt way of living I think is the more Honourable; and leſs obnoxious to many great Temptations; and every way as ſuitable to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I find that the Church of God in Scripture is compared to an Army, whoſe Captain is our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, called the Captain of our Salvation. Now ſuppoſe there were two Armies in the Field, the one very great and numerous, the other far leſs in Number, as ſuppoſe the one Thirty thouſand, the other Ten, pray tell me, whether it is not more ſafe for us all, who are concerned in one common Cauſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95814:11"/>
againſt the common Enemy, to keep within the Body of the Army, then in ſeveral Parties to ſtraggle and keep aſunder from it, or Entrench by themſelves: The like is our preſent Caſe, both the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all called <hi>Proteſtant Deſſenters,</hi> profeſs to be concerned in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe againſt <hi>Papists, Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews, Deists</hi> and <hi>Atheists,</hi> and others guilty of vile <hi>Hereſies</hi> in a Spiritual Warfare. Is it not therefore more prudent and ſafe, to unite together in one Body of Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and Communion againſt the common Enemy, that we may be the ſtronger; eſpecially ſeeing the differences betwixt the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the more judicious and moderate of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> are not in any Materials either of Doctrine or Worſhip, but the very ſame, as they have Confeſſed? Have not theſe Diviſions and Separations had bad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, weakned the Proteſtant Intereſt, ſtrengthned the Papiſts, yea, and Deiſts, and Atheiſts, and looſe and ſcandalous Perſons, who take occaſion to ſay, there is no true Religion on either ſide, by obſerving the great Heats and Annimoſities, and bitter Prejudices of the differing Parties?</p>
            <p>I will now come to anſwer what I think they will object mainly againſt my Reaſon above given: They will tell us, that if the <hi>parity</hi> or <hi>equality</hi> on both Sides were the ſame, my Reaſon would be good; but they will alledge there is a great diſparity and inequality, the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters having the Advantage, in ſeveral Particulars, as <hi>1ſt.</hi> in Doctrines, <hi>2dly.</hi> in manner of Worſhip, <hi>3dly.</hi> Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, <hi>4thly.</hi> Church Governments, which (ſay the Diſſenters) is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture among them, than in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> To every one of which I think to ſay ſomething, as briefly as I can. And Firſt, as to the Doctrine, as touching the Articles of Faith (the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers excepted) they profeſs to be one with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and have ſigned, or profeſs themſelves willing to ſign to her Articles. <hi>Secondly,</hi> as to the manner of Worſhip, which the Diſſenters contend for, ſhould be wholly by an <hi>extempore</hi> Gift of the Spirit, whereas the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though ſhe alloweth, that Miniſters before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sermon may Pray (without a Set Form, either read, or repeated from the bare Memory) by uſing their ſanctified Parts, and Gifts of Underſtanding, to Conceive Prayer by the Help of the Spirit, yet She is not only for the Lawfulneſs of Set Forms of Prayer, compoſed by Pious Men of Spiritual Abilities, both ancient and late, but for the great Conveniency and Profitableneſs of them, yea and Neceſſity of them in many reſpects, in the Publick Worſhip of God, leaving every one to their Chriſtian Freedom, whether to uſe or not uſe, Set Forms in their Cloſet and Private Devotions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:95814:11"/>
But to this I ſay, The moſt Pious as well as Judicious, whom the Diſſenters eſteem ſo, and repute as their Fathers; and others that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them not ſo, yet will allow that they were very holy and ſpiritual Men, have owned the Lawfulneſs of Set Forms of Prayer; yea not only the Lawfulneſs, but the great Conveniency and Neceſſity of them in the Publick Worſhip of God. <hi>Calvin,</hi> one of the moſt famous of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Reformers was for them, as I proved to you ſome time ago, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quod ad formulam precum, &amp;c.</hi> As to the Form of Prayers, and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Rites,</hi> [Note] that I greatly approve that it be certain; from which it may not be lawful for Paſtors to depart in their Function, both to guard againſt the Simplicity and Unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſome, and alſo, that the Conſent of all the Churches among themſelves may be more certainly known. And laſtly, to Put a Check to the inſolent Liberty of ſome who affect certain Innovations.
<p>—So then it behoveth there be a Set [or fixed] Catechiſm, a Set Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Sacraments; alſo a Set Form of Prayers.</p>
               </note> out of his expreſs words, in his Letter to the Protector of <hi>England, Epiſt.</hi> 87. The Proteſtant Churches abroad in <hi>Germany, Holland, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> from the beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to this very day, have uſed Set Forms of Prayer and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving in their Publick Worſhip. And yet I think the Diſſenters here will not conclude, that their Worſhip was wholly carnal dead, and without Life or Spirit, as many of them do now argue againſt the publick Prayers of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The Life and Spirituality of Prayer doth not conſiſt in the Mode or Form of the words, whether Set or <hi>Extempore,</hi> ſay all ſound and judicious Chriſtians, but in the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Fervour of the Affections.</p>
            <p>And therefore an <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer may be very Formal, dead and dry, and a Prayer in a Set Form may be very lively, powerful, and effectual, as the experience of Thouſands daily confirm. And ſuppoſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters would be ſo uncharitable to judge, that <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Prayers at <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> in Set Forms, and <hi>Luther</hi>'s in <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> and all the other Proteſtants Prayers in Set Forms, were barely Formal, Carnal, Dead and Dry, and the bleſſed Proteſtants Prayers, who died Martyrs in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign that uſed Set Forms, yea many of theſe now in uſe (which would be great uncharitableneſs.) Will they dare to judge ſo of the publick Prayers of the Church of Chriſt, that were in Set Forms in the pureſt Times of Primitive Chriſtianity, from the days of the Apoſtles, in the Three Firſt Centuries, as is evident from Church Hiſtory, before Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery was heard of in the World? Or will they be ſo uncharitable to Cenſure the publick Prayers of the Jewiſh Church, in her beſt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Times, who had Set Forms of Worſhip, both for Prayer and Thankſgiving: And that it was the conſtant manner of the Jewiſh
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95814:12"/>
Church, to have a Part of the Publick Worſhip with the Prieſts, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them in Vocal Prayer with their Mouths and Lips. Both in Prayer and Thankſgiving is clear from many places of Scripture in the Old Teſtament, where no doubt their Aſſemblies, both in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Synagogues, conſiſted of a great mixture of good and bad, Sincere and Hypocritical; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15, 16. This was ſpoken not to Prieſts only, but to the People; and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29. 13. where the Lord blam'd not the People ſimply, for <hi>drawing near to God with their Mouth,</hi> and <hi>honouring him with their Lips;</hi> but that while they did give him that outward Part of Worſhip, they had removed their <hi>Heart far from him,</hi> and gave him not the internal as well as the external Part of Worſhip; the internal being as the Soul, and the external as the Body of it. This clearly ſhews, what the manner of their Publick Worſhip then was, and that the People that aſſembled did really Pray Vocally with the Prieſts; and that they did Offer unto God the Calves of their Lips, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 2. And in like manner, the Chriſtians in their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are commanded to Offer up unto God the Fruit of their Lips, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 15. and though the Sacrifice of Praiſe is there only mentioned, yet no doubt Prayer is alſo underſtood, and is as real a Duty for the People to practiſe, as that of Praiſe; and if People may Sing with the Spirit, and yet uſe Set Forms, as they do in Singing <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms in Publick Congregations all of them, [ſome Anabaptiſts excepted] why may they not Pray with the Spirit in Set Forms? If the Set Form quench not the Spirit in Singing, why ſhould it be ſuppoſed to do it in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>It is indeed one of the chiefeſt Reaſons that perſwade me, that in the Publick Worſhip of God Set Forms are neceſſary, becauſe the People ought to have a Part of the external Worſhip, as well as the internal, by Confeſſing, Praying, and giving thanks in Common with their Mouths and Lips, as in believing in one Common Faith, with their Hearts, being a holy Prieſthood unto God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay, the Miniſters Mouth when he Prays, is the Peoples Mouth unto God in Publick Prayer.</p>
            <p>As this is allowed that ſometimes ſo it is, but to ſay it is always, and muſt be always ſo, is without ground; yea, is hurtful and prejudicial, for ſo, as God is denied that external Service from the People that is due to him, of Adoration, the People is deprived of that which is their Priviledge and a great Benefit unto them, to ſpeak unto God by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (and not by a Proxy always) when they Pray. And if Prayer with the Mouth be a Duty in Private for all Chriſtian People, it is no leſs a Duty, or rather much more, in Publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95814:12"/>
We are Commanded to Confeſs with the Mouth, as well as Believe with our Heart, to hold faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith, the Greek word in both places ſignifies a joint Confeſſion, <hi>ſimul dicere,</hi> to ſay toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How ſhould we know one anothers Faith, that we hold it faſt, but by holding faſt the Profeſſion of it, in joining together in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Aſſemblies, Vocally and with word of Mouth, to Confeſs what we Believe, as we are Commanded, and as with one Mind, ſo with one Mouth to Glorifie God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 6. This one Mind, is the Conſent and Harmony of many Minds; and therefore the one Mouth, is not one ſimple Mouth of the Miniſter, no more than it is one ſingle Mind of the Miniſter; but the Conſent and Harmony of many Mouths, even of the whole Congregation.</p>
            <p>There is a greater Advantage and Benefit in Vocal Prayer by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Speech, when duly performed both in Private and Publick, than many do well underſtand, and eſpecially in Publick; both for their own good, and the good of others. Although our Prayers neither Vocal nor Mental, move God properly ſpeaking, yet they move our ſelves and others; and if the Spirit of God aſſiſt in our Vocal Prayers, as we have cauſe to believe he doth ſo aſſiſt all good Chriſtians, though not in that manner as he did the Prophets, that Motion kindles a Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Fire both in our ſelves, and others that hear us; and if one Mouth ſo divinely moved kindles a little, many Mouths ſo moved will kindle a great deal. St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, the <hi>Tongues of wicked Men are ſet on the Fire of Hell;</hi> and that <hi>one Tongue is like a little Spark of Fire that kindles a great matter, James</hi> 3. 5. And why may not we as well conclude that the Tongues of Godly Men are enkindled with Fire from Heaven. Yea it ſtands with good reaſon, that Holy Angels who are preſent in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Faithful, are moved with the Vocal Prayers and Praiſes of the Faithful in the Church, whereby they know our inward States and Thoughts, as Men know our Thoughts by our Words, when we ſincerely expreſs them; for Angels know not our Thoughts immediately, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately either by audible words, or by ſome ſoft and gentle motion of our bodily Organs of Speech: Alſo it ſtands with good reaſon from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Authority, that our bleſſed Mediatour Jeſus Chriſt, not as he is God, but as he is Man in our Nature, now in Heaven glorified, is really moved and affected with the Prayers, both Mental and Vocal, of the Faithful, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. We find in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that after the four Living Creatures, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Body of the Church, had ſung together their Antheme, the Twenty Four Elders, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Governours, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with their Antiphone; and the Angels anſwered both with theirs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10. compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. from <hi>ver.</hi> 8. to 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95814:13"/>
Now if the People in the Publick Worſhip ſhould have a Part, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Vocal Prayer and Thankſgiving with the Miniſter, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, ſometimes by ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> ſometimes by other fit and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words, this muſt needs be in Set Forms that both are agreed in, and know beforehand, otherwiſe either the People muſt be tied to his Form, which however <hi>Extempore</hi> to him, and free, yet to them is a Limitation and Reſtriction, as much and much leſs ſafe, than to be tied to a Form they had formerly known, and been acquainted with, or elſe we muſt ſuppoſe a Miracle to be wrought every time they Pray Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally together, If every of them, or any two of them Pray <hi>extempore</hi> in the ſame Form of words, without receiving it the one from the other.</p>
            <p>To plead for uſing a new Form, or Method of words in Prayer every time that Men Pray, is as improper and impertinent as to plead, that every time we Eat we muſt have a new Diſh or Platter, to Eat out of; and every time we drink, we muſt have a new Cup to drink out of, and if every day, yea as oft every day as we Pray, we muſt uſe a new <hi>extempore</hi> Form, we may as well plead every day, we muſt ſeveral times each day, put on New Shoes, and New Apparel; which as it would be great waſte, ſo would it be very uneaſie. The method of words in Prayer, whether <hi>extempore,</hi> or in a Set Form, is as remote an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the ſubſtance of Prayer, either for Matter or Life, as a Diſh or a Platter is to the Meat put into it, or a Cup to the Drink that is in it; the ſame Meat may be as good as when put into another Diſh, and the Drink as good as in another Cup; and as ſeveral Habits of Garments may ſuit the ſame Perſon, ſo ſeveral Forms of Prayer, with reſpect to the external Form, may ſuit the ſame Prayer, both as to Matter and Life. As Grace doth ſometimes cauſe a variety in our words of Prayer, when the Matter is the ſame, ſo meer humane Art can, and doth moſt frequently cauſe a variety; for by meer humane Art, ſix words can be varied ſome hundreds of times, and yet the matter remain the ſame: It is therefore a great miſtake in many who think, they who pray in greateſt variety of words and modes of expreſſion, they Pray moſt by the Spirit, or with Grace; for as it can be done by meer Art without Grace, ſo it frequently is ſo done; and thereby many are greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, eſpecially when it is Varniſhed with great ſeeming ſhews of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by geſtures and tones, that move and ſtir the natural and animal Paſſions and Affections.</p>
            <p>But I remember I have heard two or three things objected by ſome againſt the matter of Common Prayer. 1. Where the People ſay, <hi>There is no Health in us.</hi> But that is no more offenſive, then what the Scripture
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95814:13"/>
ſaith, <hi>That it is not in Man<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to direct his Steps,</hi> i. e. It is not in Man as of himſelf, but of the Lord, ſo there is no <hi>health in us,</hi> nor in any Man, but what is of God and Chriſt: It is not in us originally, but by derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and participation from God and Chriſt, in whom all fullneſs dwells, and of whoſe fullneſs we all receive, and Grace for Grace. 2. That they ſtill are praying from Seven to Seventy, <hi>Lord be merciful to us miſerable Offenders;</hi> but this I think is only made by the Quakers, all others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they are Sinners, and conſequently, as in themſelves, miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and continually needing God's mercy; for as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaid, <hi>in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things we offend all;</hi> and as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>if we ſay we have no Sin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves; but if we confeſs our Sins, &amp;c.</hi> The Church of God in all Ages have confeſſed their Sins; and the holieſt Men have done ſo, as <hi>Daniel, Eſdras,</hi> &amp;c. The great remiſſion of Sins in the moſt ſolemn and publick manner, is reſerved to the day of Judgment, that great day of Aſſiſe; what remiſſion the beſt now have, is but like the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Pardon from the King, that he has by himſelf in ſecret; that is not ſo Authentick till it be proclaimed in open Court at the Aſſiſe. 3. Some object againſt that expreſſion in the <hi>Common Prayer, We are tied and bound with the chain of our Sins.</hi> But I think none of the Diſſenters (the Quakers excepted) can well ſo object; many of whom commonly in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſay, <hi>They muſt carry about with them a Body of Sin and Death to the Grave;</hi> which I think is more then what is here objected againſt. I think it were more ſafe and warrantable according to Scripture to ſay, that ſome remainders of Sin remain in the Faithful, eſpecially with reſpect to the Original Defilement by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, as alſo with reſpect to ſome remaining part of thoſe Habits of Sin we had contracted by our actual Tranſgreſſions, than that the Body of Sin remains in them, if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, of the whole Body or Complex of vitious Habits contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by actual Sins, which the Saints are ſaid to have put off by Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as, when the Body or Bulk of a great Tree is cut down, with its Boughs, Branches, Twigs and Bearers, yet the Stump and Root, or ſome part of it remains in the Ground, which if due care be not taken continually to mortify, ſuppreſs, and ſubdue, would ſpring up again, to which that in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 15. ſeems plainly to refer, and with reſpect to ſuch a remaining Part, root or ſeed of Sin, in the Faithful, it is ſaid by St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> This remainder of Sin God hath ſeen meet to ſuffer to remain in the Faithful (though he pardoneth the Guilt of it, and hath promiſed to give them ſufficiency of his Grace, whereby ſtill they may be able to mortify and ſubdue it) for the tryal of their Faith, and the Exerciſe of both their Faith, and all other their Graces and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95814:14"/>
in the way of Spiritual Conflict and Warfare, againſt three grand Enemies, the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh; that ſo through the Victory that the Faithful obtain by the Victorious Power of God's Grace, their Reward may be the greater, (which yet is ſtill the Free Gift of God) according to 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>And if a Man alſo ſtrive for Maſteries, yet is he not crowned, except he ſtrive lawfully.</hi> Not that Sin either in leſs or more, is any proper Cauſe of the increaſe of our Virtues, yet as in natural Effects one natural Agent commonly works the more powerfully in the preſence of a contrary Agent, if that contrary Agent be not too powerful, its Agency ſerving but to excite the other the more effectually againſt it; as Heat is increaſed by Cold, and a little Water caſt into Fire increaſeth the Flame. Now that this remaining part, root, or ſeed of Sin, with what other is contracted by the daily indeliberate, and for the moſt part, involuntary infirmities that the Faithful are obnoxious to may be ſaid to be a Chain, whereby they are tied and bound, in part, though as to the main, they are looſed, and ſet free from the reign and prevalency of Sin, by the virtue and prevalency of God's Grace; as when a Man that has been bound Hands and Feet, and in his whole Body, by ſtrong Fetters of Iron, is looſed from the greateſt and heavieſt of them in his whole Body and Members, yet ſome leſs Chain or Chains remain, that though they neither do nor can hinder his acting and walking, yet do in part incommode and retard him. This is fitly repreſented by what is reported of that holy Man <hi>Anſelm</hi>'s obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Shepherd Boy that had tied a ſmall Stone with a ſmall Thred, to the Foot of a ſmall Bird, and then let it out of his hand looſe to fly. The ſmall Bird did fly but a little at a time, being incommoded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded with the weight of the Stone, though but little, flying a little, and reſting a little; now mounting upwards as if it would fly ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Heaven; but then ſoon after deſcending to the Earth; which that holy Man beholding, made the Embleme of the State of his Soul, and fell into Weeping, ſaying to this effect, <hi>What the little Stone is to this little Bird, that my Sin that hangs about me is to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Third,</hi> The Adminiſtration of the Sacraments; wherein do they ſuppoſe, that the Diſſenters have any advantage above the Church of <hi>England?</hi> they will ſay, that they add nothing to Chriſt's Inſtitution in Baptiſm, whereas the Church of <hi>England</hi> adds the Sign of the Croſs, and at the receiving the Lord's Supper they receive it kneeling; to this I anſwer, the Church of <hi>England</hi> makes not the Sign of the Croſs, any part of Baptiſm, for ſhe doth not order it to be uſed at private Baptiſm to any that is in danger of Death, nor does ſhe make it any Means of Grace, but a <hi>convenient Symbole</hi> to put us in mind, and alſo to ſignify, that we own Chriſt that was crucified on the Tree of the Croſs,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95814:14"/>
and are not aſhamed to confeſs him, the Captain of our Salvation, and manfully to fight under his Banner, againſt Sin, the World, and the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which has but the like Service that a Croſs drawn with Ink on Paper, has to ſignify the Croſs of Wood, that he was crucified up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is but a ſort of Hieroglyphick, neither commanded nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Scripture, but ſimply indifferent; and that our Superiors both Eccleſiaſtick and Civil, have Authority to command us in the uſe of indifferent Things, I am well ſatisfied, and I ſee not but ſo ought the Diſſenters to acknowledge, who grant that our Superiors both Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical and Civil may enjoin the keeping of a Faſt Day for publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, or a Feſtival Day of Thankſgiving for publick Mercies. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> makes no more hurt in uſing the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, than if we ſhould tie a piece of Thred to our Finger to keep us in mind of what we deſire to remember.</p>
            <p>That the Lord's Supper is received kneeling, has no more Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nor hurt in it, than that we pray kneeling, for both the Miniſter that gives, and the People that receives the Elements of Bread and Wine, do it with Prayer.</p>
            <p>For all the great Clamour againſt the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I ſcarcely find any more but one, that may be ſo called, to wit, that abovementioned, the ſign of the Croſs at Baptiſm, which is a very harmleſs, and a very ancient Practiſe in the Church of Chriſt, and had a warrantable Original, that becauſe the Heathens upbraided the Chriſtians with the Croſs, to ſhow, they were not aſhamed of it, after receiving Baptiſm, they received the ſign of the Croſs on their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, nor is that occaſion wanting in our Day, where ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands here in this Nation, on the pretence of high Divine Inſpirations, have caſt away the Profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, as he was outwardly Crucified, together with the Memorials of him, Baptiſm, and the Supper.</p>
            <p>And as concerning Infant Baptiſm time will not permit at preſent, that I ſhould inſiſt on it; but this I ſay, I am fully ſatisfied with the Baptiſm I had in Infancy, and I do believe that it as duly belongeth to the Infant Children of Believers under the New Teſtament, being a ſeal to them of God's Covenant of Grace for remiſſion of Sin, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did belong to ſuch under the Old Teſtament, for God is no leſs merciful to Believers and their Children now, than he was then.</p>
            <p>I cannot but think ſtrange, that there ſhould be ſuch a Clamour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ceremonies in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> having upon enquiry, found them ſo few. I lately met with a Book of one of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> wherein I found him having the ſame Thought with mine, that there is but one Ceremony in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> viz. the ſign

of the Croſs, and ſtrictly ſpeaking, I ſee no need why it ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Ceremony, this hard Word offends many ignorant People, why may not our Superiors Eccleſiaſtick and Civil enjoin ſome Things that are meerly Circumſtantial, and in themſelves indifferent, as to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Miniſter's Cloathing, and the Uſe of a Surplice in Divine Service, of the Decency and Conveniency of which they are more proper Judges than private Perſons, as well as they are generally allowed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine other Circumſtances of Time and Place, and various Actions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to both Religious and Civil Matters. To bury in Wollen, and to lay the dead in a Coffin, to lay a Cloth, or Cuſhen on the Pulpit, to ring a Bell before Sermon, to have a Clock or Hour-glaſs before the Miniſter's Face when he Preacheth, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> cry out againſt as much as others do againſt the Surplice, and ſign of the Croſs, to have a clean Linnen Cloth on the Communion Table, and Silver Platter and Cup, for the diſtributing the Elements of Bread and Wine at the Lord's Supper, all theſe and divers other Things the Diſſenters commonly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as well as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſome of them, by command of Superiors, others of them by Cuſtom, why do they not call them Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and fright the People with that hard Word?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, as to the Government of the Church, the Diſſenters are ſo far from having the Advantage of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that ſhe hath the Advantage over them, in that as well as in the other Things above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
            <p>That in all Societies both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, there ſhould be an Order and Superiority of Officers, Rulers and Governours, Nature it ſelf teacheth it. How can a City or Nation be ruled and kept in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if all the Rulers be equal? How can an Army be governed, or diſciplined, or led forth to Battel without divers Degrees, Superior and Inferior of Military Officers, if all the Captains of each ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, conſiſting ſuppoſe of one hundred Men each ſingle Company, and the whole Army conſiſting of many Thouſands; if theſe ſingle Captains had no ſuperior Officers over them, but every one left to his own Diſcretion, to lead on his Company to Battle againſt the common Enemy, who has all in good Order, and a due and regular Diſtinction of ſuperior and inferiour Officers, how can it be ſuppoſed, but that the Army that has this good Order and Diſtinction of various Officers, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior and inferior, ſhould prevail againſt the other that hath no ſuch Order and Diſtinction, we may ſee a wonderful order of Superiority and Inferiority in all Things in the whole viſible Creation, in the Heavens and Elements; and that there is the like Superiority in the inviſible Creation, of Angels and Spirits, the Scripture doth plainly inform us,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95814:15"/>
as Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities and Powers, Cherubim and Seraphim; <hi>Jethro Moſes</hi>'s Father-in-Law, adviſed him to ſet Captains over Tens, over Fifties, over Hundreds, and over Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the better and eaſier Government of them, both in War and Peace; and <hi>Moſes</hi> hearkned to his Advice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 24. And we find in Scripture, that the Church is compared to an Army, and the Members thereof to Soldiers; the chief General and Captain whereof is our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath appointed divers Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in his Church under the New Teſtament, diſtinct not only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but in kind, as Biſhops, Presbyters (otherwiſe called Prieſts) and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons anſwerable to the three Officers that were in the Church of the Jews under the Old Teſtament, to wit, the high Prieſt, Prieſts and Levites; and becauſe they were but one Nation, all living within a ſmall Compaſs of Ground, one High Prieſt did ſuffice, according to God's Appointment.</p>
            <p>This threefold diſtinction of Church Government by Biſhops, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons, upon a further ſearch into the New Teſtament, I find ſo very clear as doth fully ſatisfie me, notwithſtanding that by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Education I was formerly Principled againſt it; and alſo by ſearching into Church-Hiſtory, and the Writings of the Ancients, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the Apoſtles Times, and the ſucceeding Ages, in the pureſt and beſt State of the Churches, as well as when there was a great declining from that purity, yet as many other things both of ſound Doctrine, and good practice ſtill remained; ſo this diſtinction of Church Rulers did all along remain, generally in all Places, as well as in all Ages, where God had any Viſible Church, or where there was any Society of People, profeſſing the Chriſtian Religion, until the beginning of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where in divers Countries abroad, there was no Proteſtant Kings, the Proteſtants ſet up Churches without Biſhops (not rejecting the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nor condemning it as unlawful or Antichriſtian, as ſome in late Times have done) but excuſing the want of it by that general maxim, <hi>Neceſſity has no Law.</hi> I need not inſiſt to prove the diſtinction of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons out of the New Teſtament, it being (in ſome ſort) ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally acknowledged by the Diſſenters. But the Superiority of Biſhops over Presbyters, is that which is condemned by ſome as Antichriſtian, and by ſome others judged at beſt unneceſſary, and no part of Chriſtian Diſcipline, belonging to Chriſtianity either eſſential or integral. But if you will lay aſide all prejudice of Education, and uncharitableneſs, you will clearly and evidently ſee it in the Holy Scriptures. That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had a Superiority over not only the LXX, but all other Miniſters and Paſtors, or Teachers, is very clear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. compared with <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95814:16"/>
That Biſhops were to ſucceed the Apoſtles, and have the like Office both with them, as Churches came to be planted in divers parts of the World before their Deceaſe, and alſo after their Deceaſe; not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the extraordinary gifts of Prophecy and Miracles, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Government of the Church by a regular Succeſſion, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. compared with the above-cited <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. otherwiſe all ſtanding or ſetled Miniſtry, as an Ordinance of Chriſt, may be rejected, as Enthuſiaſts generally do, yea what can theſe Governments be, mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. but as really the Superiority of Biſhops over Presbyters, as of Presbyters over the Deacons, and the People, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe why Governments in the Plural Number? Alſo what are theſe Dignities mentioned <hi>Jud.</hi> 8. that ſome deſpiſed in the Apoſtles days? and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10, 11. And how ſhould any doubt of the Office of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, being an Ordinance of Chriſt in the Church, when the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requiſite to ſuch an Officer are ſo expreſly ſet down, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. from <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>to v.</hi> 8. But whereas it is objected, that ſeeing there is only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in that Chapter a twofold Order, 1. Of Biſhops, 2. Of Deacons, it would ſeem, that Presbyters are there underſtood by Biſhops, otherwiſe Presbyters ſhould be wholly excluded from Church Government.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that will not follow, 1. Becauſe Presbyters, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, yet may be underſtood, and implied, under either the one or the other expreſly mentioned; the name Deacon being ſometimes a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Name in Scripture, ſignifying the moſt ſuperiour, as well as inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Officers in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. St. <hi>Paul</hi> called himſelf and <hi>Apollo</hi> by the Name of Deacons, as it is in the Greek; and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. he calls all Miniſters and Teachers at large by that Name. But 2. in the order of things there were but theſe two Officers at firſt (excepting the Apoſtles) <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> The Churches in many places at firſt being ſmall, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> could both ſufficiently teach, and rule his Flock, and ſo did, without Presbyters, only by the aſſiſtance of Deacons; but the number of the Flock increaſing, he did chuſe, and raiſe up thoſe that had well uſed the Office of a Deacon, to the higher degree of Presbyters, which is called by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. a good degree, which they purchaſed to themſelves, even as thoſe that well uſed the Office of a Presbyter were afterwards raiſed up to the Office of a Biſhop, as was accordingly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Church, ſo that in priority of Nature, and alſo of Time, the Deacon is before the Presbyter, though in priority of Dignity, the Presbyter is before the Deacon. Hence according to the Order eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Church, none is to be ordained a Presbyter, until he firſt be ordained a Deacon; nor can he at one and the ſame time, be Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be both.</p>

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95814:16"/>
The Diſtinction and Superiority of Biſhops over Presbyters or Elders, is very clear to me, as well as to many, out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. I. St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to Command, or give in Charge to ſome that were Teachers at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to teach no other Doctrine, than the pure Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſuch as he had heard of him. And had not <hi>Timothy</hi> had a Superiority of Office above other Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which were then at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> why did he direct both his Epiſtles to him only, laying down excellent rules, and method of Government for him to follow, in the exerciſe of his Epiſcopal Function, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. with reſpect to ſeveral States of Perſons both Male and Female?</p>
            <p n="2">II. Why did St. <hi>Paul</hi> give the Charge to <hi>Timothy</hi> to count the Elders that ruled well, (which were no doubt under him) worthy of double Honour, eſpecially them who laboured in Word and Doctrine, but that he was able to confer that double Honour upon them; a part of which was an Honourable Maintenance, according to what follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the Ox that treadeth out the Corn; and the Labourer is worthy of his reward.</hi> By this it is plain, that it belonged to <hi>Timothy,</hi> being the Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> (as he is expreſly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Firſt Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> at the end of the ſecond Epiſtle to him) to whom the Church Treaſure, (made up of the Gifts of the People) was entruſted, to provide for the Presbyters under him, a neceſſary Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which manner of practice continued in the Church, the Biſhops having the diſpoſe of the Churches Treaſure, within their ſeveral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, during all that time the Church had no Chriſtian Magiſtrate to Countenance her, and long after.</p>
            <p n="3">III. He writes to him as an Eccleſiaſtick Ruler and Judge, that had power to hear and examine Accuſations brought againſt Presbyters, and accordingly to judge, after due Evidence of two or three Witneſſes; which plainly ſhews his Power of Juriſdiction over Presbyters, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. He gives him a moſt ſolemn Charge before God, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Elect Angels, that in the exerciſe of the Power of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, he act impartially, without Favour, or biaſs of Affection, not preferring one before another, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p n="5">V. He writes to him, as one having Power of Ordination, to Ordain Elders by laying on of Hands; and cautions him, to lay hands ſuddenly on no Man, <hi>ver.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. He writes to him in his ſecond Epiſtle, to ſtir up the gift of God that was in him by the putting on of his Hands, together with the Hands of the Presbytery or Elderſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome other Apoſtles that might jointly with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> lay Hands on him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. for that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95814:17"/>
here mentioned was a Colledge only of Presbyters, is a bare alledgment, <hi>viz.</hi> when he ordained him the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as appears from the end of the ſecond Epiſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. He willeth him, that he commit to faithful Men who ſhall be able to teach others alſo, thoſe Things that he had heard of him, among many Witneſſes, which behoved to be ſome peculiar Things relating in great part to Rules of Diſcipline and Church Government, which were not fit either for Heathens to hear, or Novices in the Faith, who yet might hear the common Doctrines of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> preached in the <hi>Chriſtian Aſſemblies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Writing to <hi>Titus,</hi> he preſuppoſeth him Biſhop of the <hi>Cretians,</hi> as appears from the end of the Epiſtle to him, and tells him why he left him in <hi>Crete, That he ſhould ſet in order the things that are wanting, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Elders in every City as he had appointed him.</hi> I know no reaſon why theſe ſhould be thought <hi>Lay-Elders, i. e.</hi> ſuch as were not to Preach, I find none ſuch, either here or any where elſe in the New Teſtament. How could <hi>Titus</hi> exerciſe this Authority in ſuch a ſpacious Iſland, where many Cities were, and Chriſtian Congregations ſet up, if he had been only a ſingle Presbyter? And if the other Presbyters had equal Power with him, why did not he write to him and them jointly? Whether in the Ordination of Presbyters, others jointly did not lay on Hands with the Biſhop, is not the preſent queſtion; but whether it is to be found in Scripture or Church Hiſtory, that any Number or Colledge of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Ordained any without a Biſhop preſiding over them?</p>
            <p n="9">IX. He telleth him, that the Mouths of ſuch Teachers as were unruly and vain Talkers; and Deceivers, and who taught things which they ought not, for filthy lucre ſake, muſt be ſtopped; which plainly ſhews his Authority to depoſe and ſilence falſe Teachers, as well as to Ordain Sound and Worthy.</p>
            <p n="10">X. He telleth him of his Authority to judge, who is a Heretick, and how after the firſt and ſecond Admonition, (if he amend not) he ought to reject him.</p>
            <p>By theſe Inſtances plainly collected out of the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> it may I think appear, to all impartial perſons that well and duly conſider them, that both <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Biſhops, and had a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of Power and Juriſdiction over the Presbyters in the Churches of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> as well as of Ordination.</p>
            <p>I know <hi>W. Prynne</hi> hath printed a Book, which he called the <hi>Unbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Timothy and Titus,</hi> which I have read; but I find not that he hath either ſufficiently anſwered the Arguments brought from Scripture, to prove that they were Biſhops, or given any ſufficient Arguments to the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95814:17"/>
contrary. I have alſo ſeen another great Book of his, giving a Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Relation of the evil Practiſes of many Biſhops, all which if true, ſaith nothing againſt the Office. But I could write a great Book, [three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold greater] giving a Hiſtorical Relation of many good Things, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have done in the World. Many Biſhops both in the early and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages, have been eminently exemplary in Holineſs of Life, and all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Virtues; and for divers Ages ſucceeding the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Days, were bleſſed and happy Inſtruments, to preſerve the Truth and Purity of the Chriſtian Doctrine, in the World, and the Unity and Peace of the many Churches in it, hindring Schiſms, and curing them that did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ariſe. Cutting down with the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, [even the Doctrinal Word, outwardly delivered in the Holy Scriptures, as they were mightily aſſiſted by the Holy Spirit ſo to do] the monſtrous and vile Hereſies that ſprung up from time to time, oppugning the Chriſtian Faith, wherein Almighty God bleſſed them with great Succeſs, and this they did partly by their particular Writings, Treatiſes and Epiſtles, as well as Sermons, and partly by their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in great Numbers, in Synods and Councils, to condemn them, and that many times to the danger of their Lives, under perſecuting Kings and Emperours; ſome whereof were Heathen, and ſome <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Eutychian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such who are but ordinarily well acquainted with Antiquity and Church Hiſtory, cannot be ignorant that the Government of the Church from the very days of the Apoſtles in all the famous places of the World, where Chriſtianity came to be planted, was by Succeſſion, the which did lineally deſcend for four hundred years from the Apoſtles days and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and in divers places, to this Age.</p>
            <p>There are two places of Scripture in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Fathers underſtood of Epiſcopal Government, as it was to be ſet up in the Church under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 16. being a Prophecy concerning Chriſt's Church, and his Government in the ſame by Church Officers. <hi>Inſtead of thy Fathers</hi> [i. e. the Apoſtles, who were the Founders of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> Church, and were her Fathers] <hi>ſhall be thy Children,</hi> [i. e. their Succeſſors in the Government of the Church after their Deceaſe] <hi>whom thou maieſt make Princes in all the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Place is in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 60. 17. <hi>I will appoint them Biſhops in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Deacons or Miniſters in Faith,</hi> as <hi>Clemens</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> quotes it in his famous Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> hath it, is thus, <hi>And I will give thy Princes in Peace, and thy Biſhops in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
