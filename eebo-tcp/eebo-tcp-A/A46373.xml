            <title>Jus divinum ministerii evangelici. Or The divine right of the Gospel-ministry: divided into two parts. The first part containing a justification of the Gospel-ministry in general. The necessity of ordination thereunto by imposition of hands. The unlawfulnesse of private mens assuming to themselves either the office or work of the ministry without a lawfull call and ordination. The second part containing a justification of the present ministers of England, both such as were ordained during the prevalency of episcopacy from the foul aspersion of anti-christianism: and those who have been ordained since its abolition, from the unjust imputation of novelty: proving that a bishop and presbyter are all one in Scripture; and that ordination by presbyters is most agreeable to the Scripture-patern. Together with an appendix, wherein the judgement and practice of antiquity about the whole matter of episcopacy, and especially about the ordination of ministers, is briefly discussed.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And therefore fore-seeing that this ensuing Treatise will meet with many Adversaries of different Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and with much opposition, We thought fit to give the Reader notice of our intentions here, lest We should be thought to be enemies to Peace, and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that long desired and often praied for Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween dissenting Brethren.</p>
            <p>There are six sorts and ranks of men whom We have occasion to deal with in this Book.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as are against the very Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and that affirm, That there is no such Office in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by Christ to be perpetual in his Church. We look upon this Assertion as destructive unto Christian Religion, and to the souls of Christians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as say, That it is lawfull for any men that suppose themselves gifted (though neither Ordained, nor approved by able men) to assume unto themselves a power to preach the Word, and Administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. This Opinion We judge to be the high-way
<pb facs="tcp:30575:3"/>
to all Disorder and Confusion, an inlet to Errours and Heresies, and a Door opened for Priests and Jesuites to broach their Popish and Antichristian Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such as hold, That the Ministry of <hi>England</hi> is Antichristian, That our Churches are no true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but Synagogues of Satan, and that there is no Communion to be held with us. This Opinion We conceive to be not only false and uncharitable, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to Peace and Unity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such as say, That Episcopacy is an higher Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Ministry above Presbytery by Divine Right, That Christ hath given the sole Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction unto Bishops; And that Ordination of Ministers is so appropriated to them by the Gospel, that all Ordinations by single Presbyters are null and void, and that Sacraments by them administred are no Sacraments.

            <p n="6">6. The last sort are the Moderate, Godly Episcopal men, that hold Ordination by Presbyters to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and valid; That a Bishop and a Presbyter are one and the same Order of Ministry, that are Orthodox in Doctrinal Truths, and yet hold, That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church by a perpetual Moderatour is most agreeable to Scripture-patern.</p>
            <p>Though herein We differ from them, yet We are farre from thinking that this difference should hinder a happy Union between them and Us. Nay, We crave leave to profess to the world, That it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (as We humbly conceive) be well with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

till there be an Union endeavoured and effected between all those that are Orthodox in Doctrine, though differing among themselves in some Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances about Church-government.</p>
            <p>And the Lord hath strangely made way for this long-desired Union, by the bitter, wofull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable fruits of Our Divisions, which have almost destroyed not only the Ministry, but even the very heart and life of Religion and Godlinesse.</p>
            <p>Memorable is the Story of Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Hooper,</hi> two famous Martyrs, who when they were out of Prison, disagreed about certain Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Garments, but when they were put into Prison they quickly and easily agreed together. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity united them whom Prosperity divided.</hi> The time is now come wherein the ruine of all the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Orthodox and Ordained Ministry, is by some men designed and endeavoured: And therefore though hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto We have continued sinfully divided, yet now the Consideration of our Common Danger, and the Preservation of the Ministry, and therein the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Glorious Ordinances, Churches and precious Truths of Jesus Christ, should marvellously constrain Us to study to finde out, and being found out cordially to imbrace all lawfull waies to Unity and Agreement.</p>
            <p>Thus much We thought fit to signifie, that so Our Endeavours in the ensuing Discourse may not be mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are two other things also which We are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to communicate unto the Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>First, That this Book should have come out two
<pb facs="tcp:30575:5"/>
Years ago, but was hindred by multitude of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and indispensable Businesses intervening. And that since our first undertaking of it, there have been many Treatises written of most of these Subjects (of which We speak) to very good purpose, which had prevailed with Us to have spared Our Pains, had We not been encouraged by a saying of <hi>Austines,</hi>
               <q>That it is good and profitable to the Church of Christ, that the same things be written of by divers Men in divers Books, because those Books which come to the view of some, will not come to the sight of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and by this means the Truths of Christ will be the sooner and easier spread and propagated.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We confesse that We have been necessitated in the Point of Episcopacy, to borrow some things out of <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> and Our Reverend Presbyterian Divines, in their Conference at the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and in Our Discourse about Election out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hudson,</hi> and some others: Which We have done, because being to handle the same Subjects, We thought it needless to adde any thing to what they have said; and also, That by this means We might revive the Memory of those Books which We believe are quite forgotten by most, and are assured were never sufficiently answered by any.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The other thing which We would make known is, That in this Our large Treatise We have purposedly declined all affectation of Language, We have not laboured <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to feast the ear with curious phrases. Our endeavour is to speak <hi>non diserta sed fortia.</hi> We have alwaies disliked those Books which have in them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Sea of words, and but a drop of sound Reason. Our Care hath been more after Matter then Words. And
<pb facs="tcp:30575:5"/>
We hope the unbiassed and judicious Reader will finde that though the <hi>Garment</hi> with which We clothe Our Matter, be <hi>rough and hairy</hi> like <hi>Esau,</hi> yet the <hi>Voice</hi> is alwaies the <hi>Voice of Iacob.</hi> For We have studiously avoided all Bitternesse of Speech, even against those that make it a great part oftheirReligion to rail and reproach Us, and who account Us the filth of the world, and the off-scouring of all things. We have learned of Our blessed Saviour, <hi>To blesse those that curse Us,</hi>

               <hi>to do good to them that hate Us, and to pray for them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully use Us and persecute Us.</hi> And of the blessed Apostle, <hi>To instruct them in meeknesse that oppose Us,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is a great Comfort to Us, that the Government of the Church is upon Christs shoulders, and he that could bear the wrath of God, no doubt will uphold his own Government, maugre all opposition. And it is no lesse Joy unto Us, that the Ministers of Christ are <hi>Stars in his right hand,</hi> and therefore safe and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the hurt of unreasonable men. We reade in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of a <hi>Woman cloathed with the Sunne and the Moon under her feet, and a Crown of twelve Stars upon her head.</hi> This Woman represents the true Church; Every true Christian is cloathed with Christs Righteousnesse as with the Sunne, and hath the world as the Moon under his feet, and wears the Ministers and their Gospel-Doctrine as a Crown upon his head. <hi>He that treads this Crown under his feet hath little of true Christianity in him.</hi> But howsoever, though We be trodden under feet, and reproachfully used for what We have written, yet it is no little Satisfaction to Us that We have discharged Our Consciences both to
<pb facs="tcp:30575:6"/>
God and men. And if some people will not <hi>wear Us as Crowns</hi> upon their heads, We <hi>shall wear their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> as <hi>Our Crown</hi>; and shall pray unto the Lord (who only teacheth to profit) that he would give a good Successe to this Undertaking of Ours for the Glory of his Name, the Benefit of his Church; and more especially for the Establishing of our respective Congregations, That he would direct, protect, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videfor, support, sanctifie and comfort the Godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry against all the sad Discouragements they meet with, That he would keep out Popery, root out Error, Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they could sooner want the Sun then <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry. And <hi>Chrysostom</hi> tels us, That <hi>Herod</hi> might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well have saved <hi>John</hi> Baptist notwithstanding his Oath, for his Oath was to give the daughter of <hi>Herodias what she should ask, though it were to half his Kingdom,</hi> but <hi>John</hi> Baptist's head was more worth then all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, That the Devil in all Ages hath laboured by his wicked Instruments to discountenance, disparage and overthrow the Ministry, as knowing that it is a spiritual Engine in the hand of the Lord of Hoasts to batter down his Strong holds, and designed for this very purpose to bring people from the power of Satan unto the Kingdom of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>In the Old Testament, though the Ministry that then was, was acknowledged to be of Divine Institution, yet even then it was by a carnal part of the World opposed, as a superfluous humane Invention, and the Persons to whom that Ministry was committed were in their several Generations vilified and traduced as a Society of men which rather sought some world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, carnal, personal interest, then the sacred things of Gods Kingdom. Thus <hi>Enoch</hi> who had this Testimony that he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndured hard speeches which ungodly sinners spoke against him. <hi>Noah</hi> a Preacher of Righteousnesse was not believed in his Generation, they did not, they would not know any thing till the Floud came and swept them all away. <hi>Moses</hi> a Prophet mighty in word and deed had <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> to resist him in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Corah</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to withstand him in the Wilderness. <hi>Elijah</hi> that man of God, whom one calleth an <hi>Earthly Angel, and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Mortal,</hi> who whilst he lived on Earth below, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Heavens and Clouds that are above, yet was he persecuted by <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and accounted by <hi>Ahab</hi> both an
<pb facs="tcp:30575:7"/>
Enemy to him and to the State, and accused to his face as the <hi>Troubler of Israel.</hi> Thus <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> sanctified from the Womb, was smitten and imprisoned, <hi>Michaiah</hi> imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Urijah</hi> slain with the Sword, <hi>Zechariah</hi> stoned to death.</p>
            <p>In the New Testament <hi>John</hi> Baptist who was filled with the holy Ghost from his Mothers womb, was beheaded. And Christ Iesus himself, who was not ashamed to be sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Minister of the Circumcision, The Bishop of our souls, The Apostle and High-Priest of our profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> was crucified between two thieves. The holy Apostles of whom the world was not worthy, were not worthy to live in the world, but were despised and rejected of men, and accounted the scum and off-scouring of the world.</p>

            <p>The Scripture tels us, that for the space of <hi>1260</hi> daies (that is, all the time of Antichrists reign) the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses should prophestein sackcloth, and this sackcloth is not yet put off, nor as yet likely to be.</p>
            <p>For there are a Generation of men risen up amongst us, that say, That it is the greatest cheat that ever was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christians, to make them believe that there is a distinct Office of the Ministry p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>culiar to some men and not to others. This they call a Monopolizing of the Ministery, and the
<pb facs="tcp:30575:8"/>
worst of all Monopolies. And they say, just as <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, <hi>You take too much upon you, yee sons of Levi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Are not all the people of God holy?</hi> And may not any man that is gifted preach, though he be not Ordained? But in the mean time they forget, that this Speech of <hi>Corahs</hi> was accounted Rebellion, and that the earth was not able to bear it, <hi>but opened her mouth and swallowed him up, and the rest of his companions.</hi> It was heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a great fault for a Minister to be a Iustice of Peace, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought incompatible with his Calling, and impossible for one man to wait upon both. But there are many in our daies, that continuing in their Civil Callings, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves able to discharge the Ministerial. And although the Apostle out of the sense of the weightiness of it, cried out, <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> Yet there are very many that think every man almost sufficient. And as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> made Priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> and it was reckoned as his great sinne. So it is with us, The lowest of the people and such as are not called to the Ministry, nor trained up in the Schools of the Prophets, are become Preachers, and cried up as the None-such of our times.</p>
            <p>There are divers waies by which some men endeavour to destroy the Ministry.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> By railing upon and reviling their persons, and raising all manner of reproaches against them, as if they were the onely Incendiaries of Church and State, pestilent fellows, the causers of all the disturbance in the Commonwealth.</p>

Sometimes for the Office of a Deacon: But in this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is taken for an Ecclesiasticall Function appointed by Christ in his Church for the Preaching of the Word and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacraments.

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> For this you must know, That there is a great deal of difference between the Office and the work of the Ministry; Indeed in Scripture they are sometimes held forth by one Name because they are near akin, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4. <hi>We will give our selves to the Ministry of the Word</hi>; And <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.13. <hi>I magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my Office</hi>; Both in the Originall called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, yet are they really distinct in nature as Relation and Action, and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either by Divine Providence in case of sicknesse, or by humane pravity in case of Imprisonment, Banishment, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the People, or Supine negligence, sloath, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or covetousnesse in the Officer.</p>
                     <p>Impossible it is to dispute about the Office without mention of the work, they being Relatives, and therefore cannot be understood the one without the other: But yet because there are a double sort of dissenters, some that deny the very Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Ministry; Others that grant the Office, but yet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30575:13"/>
think it no sin for a man gifted (though uncalled) to assume the publike work of the Ministry: Our purpose is to speak distinctly to both. But in this Proposition only to the first.</p>
                     <p>The Office of the Ministry is a spirituall Relation to the whole employment of the Ministry in a person qualified, founded upon a speciall and regular call.</p>
                     <p>For its generall nature, It is a Relation as is evident by removing all other kindes, In particular it cannot be Action, For this is transient, but an Office is permanent.</p>
                     <p>For its property, It is a spirituall Relation to distinguish it from naturall and civil Relations.</p>
                     <p>Its Subject is a person qualified, Namely, 1. Able. 2. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. 3. Pious in the judgement of Charity.</p>
                     <p>Its Object or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erm is the Ministeriall employment, ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by its extent in order to the work: A gifted Brother may upon just occasion materially exercise some parts of the Ministry, as Prayer, opening and applying of the Scripture, but not all parts, as Administration of the Sacraments, nor the former in publique, unlesse lawfully called thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Its Foundation is Vocation, or a Call limited; 1. By its Specialty: A generall Call enables to Prayer and Teaching as a Christian, but only a speciall and particular Call enables to these duties <hi>ex officio &amp; authoritativè</hi>; A private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may bring news of a Treaty to be had, but only an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour or Herauld comes enabled by Authority to treat.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is limited by its Regularity to distinguish it from the bare Call of the People: The Peoples Call may determine a Persons Ministry in an especiall manner to themselves, but cannot invest a person into the Office of the Ministry, who was not a Minister before; Nor can their deserting of him put him out of Office, though haply it may out of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Action is transient, but Relation is permanent; Therefore the Office is better defined by relation to the work then by relation to a particular people, who may easily out him of his work but not of his Office: This Regular Call then consists not in bare instinct, whereby men run before
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30575:14"/>
they be sent, nor barely in the suffrages of the people, which make a Person their Minister not a Minister: But in mission either immediate by God and Christ, witnesse the Prophets and Apostles; or mediate by some delegated and authorised by God for that purpose, <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet:</hi> Nor can he who is not either a Minister or the Lord of Ministers regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly make a Minister:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14. 2 Tim. 1.6. Act. 14.22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tit. 1.5. 1 Tim. 5.22.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> was called by Christ, <hi>Timothy</hi> by <hi>Paul</hi> and the Presbytery; Nor do we reade of any called or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to the Ministry without Ministers: And here by the way take notice, That the very nature of the Office of the Ministry argues strongly, that none can take upon them that sacred Office without a lawfull Call and Ordination, since the very Foundation of this Relation is a lawfull Call, and without a Foundation no Relation can either exist or persist; But more of this hereafter.</p>
                     <p>For the present, That which we have now to prove is, That the Office of the Ministry, that is, That a spiritual Relation to the whole employment of the Ministry in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son qualified, founded in a speciall and regular Call, is of Divine Institution: Or more plainly, That the Eccles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Ministry is an Order, Function, or Office, that hath its Originall from Heaven; Not from an Ordinance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of the Lord Jesus Christ, which we shall prove by these Arguments.</p>
                     <p>From the peculiar designation of some Persons to the work of the Ministry;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 1.</note> Whence thus we argue,</p>
                     <p>If God hath peculiarly designed some Persons to this work of the Ministry, then the Office of the Ministry is by Divine Institution: But God hath peculiarly designed some Persons to the Work of the Ministry: The Consequence is clear. If God appointed some Persons to the Work of judging <hi>Israel,</hi> then the Office of Judges was by Divine Institution; If God appointed some Persons to carry the Utensils of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle or Temple, and to keep the doors, then the Office of the Porters and Door-Keepers was of Divine Institution: So here if God designed some Persons to the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30575:14"/>
then there is such an Office. And it will be further strengthened by this consideration; That where there was no distinct Office God did not design peculiar Persons for the Work, but left it in common to all, and where he left it in common to all there was no distinct Office. Thus the daty of Almes-giving in generall, because it is a duty common to all, and no peculiar Persons are designed to it, but it is equally required of all according to their ability, therefore there is no such Office of Almes-giving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But now to distribute the Alms of the Church in a work peculiarly determined to some particular Persons which are called Deacons (and is not common to all) and therefore the Office of the Deacon is by divine Institution. Adde further that to design particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to any work, to which all have a like Call, Power, and Authority, is needlesse and ridiculous. So much for the proof of the consequence: The Antecedent will easily be made out.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That this was so under the Law, is evident beyond all dispute, to all who reade and beleeve the Old Testament: Though all <hi>Israel</hi> was <hi>Holinesse to the Lord, a Kingdom of Priests, and a Holy Nation,</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. This Promise (we grant) was made first and immediatly to the Apostles; but the Query is, Whether solely and only unto them as they were Apostles; It cannot be denied but many precepts and promises given to them were of a different nature, 1. Some to the Apostles as Apostles, and 2. Some to Apostles as Ministers, and 3. Some to Apostles as Beleevers. If any demand, how shall we know when Christ spake to them as Apostles? when to them as Ministers? and when to them as Christians? We answer, That the best way to discern this, is to consider the nature of these precepts and promises: if they be of an extraordinary nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> to all ordinary Ministry; Then these commands or promises are peculiar to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30575:24"/>
Apostles as Apostles, as extraordinary Officers; For instance, When Christ had called the twelve, <hi>He gave them power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sicknesses, and all manner of diseases:</hi> And these being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary promises, it appears they were made to the Apostles as Apostles, and not to them either as Beleevers or as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
                     <p>If they be of a common nature wherein all Saints and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Jesus Christ are equally concerned, then though they were given to the Apostles, yet not only to them as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, but to them as Beleevers,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.1. Matth. 24.42. compared with v. 2, 3.</note> who also partake of <hi>like precious faith with them,</hi> through the righteousnesse of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; When Christ commanded them to watch, for ye know not what hour the Lord will come; this duty was laid upon them immediatly and apart from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as appears; <hi>His Disciples came to him privately, saying, When shall these things be?</hi> Yet this duty is of such a nature as is common to all beleevers;<note place="margin">Mar. 13.37. Mat. 6.9. to 14</note> and so elsewhere Christ expounds it, <hi>What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch</hi>: When Christ taught his Disciples to pray, in them he taught the same duty to all beleevers: And all these commands, to <hi>deny our selves, take up the Crosse, and follow him,</hi> are so given to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles as they also oblige all beleevers:<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.20.</note> So when Christ praied for the Apostles, that God would sanctifie them with all truth; he prayed <hi>not for them alone, but for all that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him of the Father, which should also beleeve in him through their Word:</hi> So all those great and precious promises which pertain to life and godlinesse, whereby all beleevers <hi>partake of the divine nature, having escaped the pollutions which are in the world through lust,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.3, 4.</note> were given not only to the Apostles but to all Beleevers. The ignorance or non-observance of this distinction hath led the Papists into many absurdities, as when Christ gave the Cup to the Apostles, because they all were Ministers, therefore they do not conceive themselves obliged by that example to give the Cup to the Laity; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Christ gave the Cup to the Apostles not as Apostles but only as Beleevers, and so ordained it for all Beleevers, who

did not onely <hi>Eat the Bread,</hi> but <hi>Drink the Cup of the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>The Precepts and Promises which are of a middle nature betwixt the two former, not so general as to concern all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, nor yet so strait and peculiar as to be limited to the Apostles, as <hi>Go, Teach and Baptize,</hi> &amp;c. These Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Promises thereunto annexed, were given to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, not as Apostles, nor to them as believers, but given to them as <hi>Ministers and Stewards of the mysteries of God</hi>; For the Apostles did not administer the Sacraments as Apostles,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.17.</note> for to baptize was no peculiar work of the Apostles, as such.

                     <p>Secondly, As the need is perpetual and as great in these times as in former, so God is careful to provide for the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of his Saints, as well in the later times as in the former dayes. This needs no proof, because many rather now think that God neglected all former Saints in comparison to us, and so magnifie the Saints of this present age, that they either condemn or lightly esteem the generation of righteous men that lived before us. But however, sure it is that God is tender of his youngest children, and that the Primogeniture shall not carry all away: If our elder Brethren had a double portion,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.40. Heb. 8.6. Heb. 13.8.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As our need and Gods care are perpetual, so the great and sole ordinary means which our Lord in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regard to the souls of his hath appointed to heal our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so corrupt, to clear his mysteries which are so high, to detect the frauds of Satan which are so prevalent, and to counter-work seducers which are so many and so active, is the Ministry of the Word.

                     <p n="1">1.

This negation in this promise must be only comparative and not universall and absolute, because then it would not only destroy the Ministry as unnecessary in publike, but also evacuate and disannull all brotherly admonitions in private, and then all godly conference and fraternall reproofs should be prohibited as sins, which none can deny to be commanded as duties, and such duties as are perpetuall in Gospel-times; for all Saints at all times are commanded to <hi>consider one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to provoke unto holinesse and good works</hi>; And they should be <hi>teaching and admonishing one another to warn them that are unruly, to comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak,</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. The Internall teaching of the Spirit doth not take away the need of an externall teaching by the Ministry, because by the same Argument there should be no need of Scripture, because the Scripture it self also is externall: And this is not a malicious supposition, but <hi>de facto</hi> there are many men in our times that do so far rely upon this inward teaching as to lay aside the Scriptures: And if so, there is no rule left to try the spirits, which is ever needfull, because many false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are gone out into the world.

                        </gap> is the great Charter of the Gospel-Ministry, we shall crave leave a little to exspatiate: we have,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The fruits or effects of Christs Ascension, <hi>He gave some Apostles and some Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ends for which these gifts were given, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>That we be not children tossed to and fro,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3, The duration or continuance of these gifts, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly asserted to be <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>Till we all come in the unity of the faith,</hi> &amp;c. Now from this place we argue;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Either Apostles, or Prophets, or Evangelists, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Teachers, are to continue till we all come into the unity of the faith. But Apostles, Evangelists and Prophets were not to continue, which we prove thus, That which is here given to continue, and promised that it shall continue, that certainly did and doth continue, otherwise Christ should break his promise. But <hi>de facto</hi> Prophets, Apostles and Evangelists did not continue, as is confessed. Therefore Pastors and Teachers are to continue.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Ordinary Officers in the Church are as truly the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christ, and the fruits of his Ascension, as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and therefore where God gives ordinary Officers, they are to be received as sent by God, as well as extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, both are said to weave one web, to carry on one <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, one work of the Ministry.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:30575:32"/>3. Whatever God gives to the Church, man neither can nor must take it away, except God reverse it. But Christ gave this gift to the Church, and gave it as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with intention never to recall it. And therefore woe be to that man that offers to take away this gift, let him take heed lest God take away his part out of the book of life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Though <hi>Paul</hi> was an extraordinary Minister, yet he doth both here and elswher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> maintain the honour, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the necessity of ordinary Pastors, quite contrary to the men of our times who pretend to extraordinary inspirations, and thence take occasion to pour contempt upon the ordinary Ministry.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It was the intention of Jesus Christ when he gave this Ministry, that it should continue till we all come into the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the faith. And if the Ministry should not continue, it must be either because he is not carefull to make good his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or not able, or not willing to do it. But all these are absurd. Indeed if this were a conditional promise, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon some thing in us, the <hi>non</hi>-performance of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on our parts might excuse the not accomplishment of the promise on Gods part, but it is most evident that the promise here is absolute and independent upon us, and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it hath not been, shall not be broken.</p>
                     <p>If it be said, If this Argument hold, it will prove, that the Apostles shall continue till we all come to the Unity of the Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they also are mentioned in this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>We Answer. The words are to be understood not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctim</hi> but <hi>divisim,</hi> not conjoynedly that all those should continue, but severally, that some one of these (at least) should continue till that time, otherwise this great absurdity would follow, that Christ should fail in the fullfilling of his Word.</p>
                     <p n="6">6, When Christ promiseth a Ministry until we come to the Unity, he is thereby obliged not only to keep his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry from a finall abolition, but also from a totall interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As when God saith to Christ, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:30575:32"/>
untill I make thine enemies thy footstool,</hi> Mat. 22.44. it is therein implied, that Christ shall not cease sitting at the right hand of the Father till all his enemies be subdued. So here when Christ saith, the Ministers shall continue <hi>till we all come,</hi> &amp;c. it follows undeniably that they must not cease till that date be expired. And least of all should the Word of Christ stand, if God had only set Ministers in his Church for a hundred or two or three hundred years, and suffered his Church to lose the Ministry in the Apostacy of Antichrist, and to be without it for so many hundred years together, as the Seekers are not ashamed to affirm.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the Saints are converted, Gods end in the Word and Sacraments is to confirm them in a state of grace,<note place="margin">Act. 14.22. Phil. 3.12.</note> to edifie them and to nourish them up in the words of faith, for the best of Saints are not here perfect, but must go from strength to strength, pressing forward towards perfection; therefore during this life they shall ever need the Ministry, ordained of Christ for <hi>the perfecting of the Saints</hi>; and they are bound <hi>as new born babes to desire the sincere milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> And it is the character of true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, that <hi>they love the gates of Sion,</hi>

of those times, that the holy City should be trampled under foot; but also that they were holy pious Ministers distinct from the Saints in Office, and in the act of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical function, which is intimated to us,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the power bestowed upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord gives to them not only to pray and to mourn, but <hi>to Prophesie,</hi> Rev. 11.3.

                     <p n="2">2. From their effectual exercise of that power and that in their publick detecting those Antichristian abominations, and denouncing the wrath of God against them.

                     <p n="3">3.

maketh these two distinct, the Prophets and the Saints: <hi>Babylon</hi> is therefore ruined, <hi>because in her is found the blood of the Prophets and of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 17.24. Now if we descend from the words of this Prophecy, and come to observe the answerable event in History, we shall finde that in every age there were Ministers opposing the tenents of Antichrist. Their particular names, times, places, and their manner of resisting the man of sin, it will be too large to insist upon, yet a brief Catalogue of Ministers is here inserted.</p>

And in the succeeding Centuries, when the Man of Sinne began to prevail, there were in their several Ages, Godly and Learned Ministers who opposed the Popish Errours, defending the sufficiency of Scripture, Communion in both kindes, Justification by free Grace; disclaiming the defilements of worship in adoring Images, Invocation of Saints, praying for the Dead, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping Reliques; and openly testifying against the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and swelling power of the Pope, declaiming against his Supremacy and title of Universal Bishop as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>

Why should you strengthen the hands of sinners? that whereas formerly they could not sin against light, but they had many checks of conscience, now they despise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and hate to be reformed, and when they sin most fully and fouly, yet they sin without reluctancy, and glory in their own shame; so that if these men perish in their gain-sayings, yet may not their bloud be required at your hands, who have not only misled them into errour, but have killed them with prejudice against the remedy which should reclaim them?</p>
                     <p>Q. 5. Is not this opinion the sad abuse of the great liberty now enjoyed? In times of former trouble, How did Professors live sincerely, love fervently, pray, and fast, and mourn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? But by these Tenents the Staff of Bands and Beauty is broken, and dashed in pieces one upon another, which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30575:44"/>
may justly provoke the Lord to cut short the day of liberty, that men may learn by the want of liberty how to prise and sadly bewail their wofull abuse of it.</p>
                     <p>Q. 6. If your principles about an universall liberty be true, why are you so untrue to your own principles? you can well endure men that deny the Immortality of the soul, the verity of Scriptures, the Deity of Christ, the God-head of the holy Ghost, and those that defend any thing, whatsoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to sound doctrine; These you can tolerate, defend, hug in your bosome; and if any one speak against any the broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of those errours: You cry out, <hi>Persecution, Persecution,</hi> yet at the self same time you persecute (to your uttermost) all Ministers, who take themselves bound in conscience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Ministry, You do and can tolerate the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and hereticall, but these Ministers Consciences you cannot tolerate: Are you not partiall in your selves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Judges of evil thoughts, whilst you justifie that in your selves as a duty which you condemn in others as an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iniquity? Why are your professed principles so uneven, and you so contradictory to your own principles? Be not like the Jews who please not God and are contrary to all men.</p>
                     <p>Q. 7. Have you not cause to fear, that the Lord may leave you as he did your Predecessors in <hi>Germany,</hi> who held the same Tenents with you, gloried (as much as you) in their own confidences, and condemned (as you do) all others; Railed first against the Ministry, then raged aginst the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy, brought both Church and State into confusion, put the Countrey into burning Flames, wherein at length them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were consumed to ashes; Do not therefore persist in kindling these false fires; Walk no longer in the light of the sparks that you have kindled, lest you have this at the hand of the Lord, to lie down in sorrow.</p>

                     <p>IT is manifest by the Word of God, That no man ought to take upon him the Office or work of a Minister,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Propos.</hi> 3.</note> till he be lawfully called and ordained thereunto.</p>
                     <p>As the Church and State are distinct <hi>Polities,</hi> so have they <hi>Subjects Laws and Officers, distinct alwaies in the formal conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, though materially</hi> in divers things they may agree, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.21. <hi>Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars, and unto God the things that are Gods</hi>; The things of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> are distinct. Thus <hi>Luke</hi> 2.11. <hi>Man, who made me a Iudge or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over you?</hi> a Preacher and a Judge are two distinct cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
                     <p>These Officers for their <hi>Institution, Vocation, Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> depend not <hi>solely,</hi> nor <hi>principally</hi> upon man, but are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and confirmed to theChurch by Christ the King of Saints, and great Shepherd of Souls, for ends and purposes most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and necessary in all ages of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.29, 28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
                     <p>Supposing therefore at present what hath been already proved, that there is such an Office in the Church to last by Divine Institution to the end of the world: The present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course enquires about the <hi>Subjectum recipiens</hi> of this high and weighty Office, and the work of it, whether it lie in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or be appropriated by Divine Ordinance to some pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and speciall persons, who are not only favoured to be <hi>Christs Sheep,</hi> but honoured also to be <hi>Shepherds</hi> under him? This Question is not <hi>de lanâ caprinâ,</hi> nor needlesse; For</p>

                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:30575:45"/>1. It is manifest, that there be some who <hi>constantly supply</hi> the room of Preachers, and arrogate to themselves the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and maintenance due to none but Ministers, and yet they themselves were never ordained to this Office. By this means many Congregations are deprived of <hi>Government,</hi> and of the Sacraments, and such as would willingly take care of their souls in a regular and ordinary way are excluded by such intruders, as will neither be solemnly set apart for the, Ministry by imposition of hands, with fasting and prayer, nor give way to them that would.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Others there be that plead <hi>for a liberty of preaching,</hi> or (as they phrase it) for the exercise of gifts in publick, even in these Congregations where there are ordained Ministers, and this to be by those who pretend not to be Preachers and Ministers, <hi>strictly and properly so called,</hi> when, and as often as such persons please, and that this liberty ought to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every Christian who desires it, and may probably be presumed to be fitted for it.</p>
                     <p>We therefore that we may as much as in us lies take away the <hi>stumbling block</hi> which by these practices is laid before <hi>blinde Papists,</hi> and remove the <hi>scandal</hi> given to <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and hinder the progresse of this sinne in our own, shall

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30575:46"/>
lesse he be solemnly set apart thereunto,</hi> appears by these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>First, We argue from that known Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>And how shall they preach except they be sent?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 1.</note> This is set down by way of Interrogation, <hi>Vt oratio sit penetrantior,</hi> saith <hi>Pareu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> The Prohibition is made more <hi>emphatical</hi> by the interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the form of expression makes it <hi>morally</hi> impossible to preach without mission. The Apostle useth a four-fold gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>How shall they call upon him in whom they have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? How shall they hear without a preacher? How shall they preach except they be sent?</hi> The last link of the chain is of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual truth with the former. As no man can call rightly on him in whom he believes not, and no man can believe in him of whom he never heard, and no man can hear without a Preacher; so also no man can preach except he be sent; and therefore he that breaks this last link breaks this golden chain of the Apostle, and sins against God. Besides this last link is an eternal truth. As no man to the end of the world can call upon him in whom he believes not, or believe in him of whom he hears not, or hear without a Preacher; so it is, and will be true to the end of the world, that no man can preach ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be sent. The Apostle scrueth up the necessity of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as high as the necessity of preaching, and if one be perpetual, the other must be so also. Now from all this we gather,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That mission is essential to the constitution of a Minister.</hi> The Apostle doth not say, How shall they preach except they be <hi>gifted</hi> (though this be true) but how shall they preach <hi>except they be sent?</hi> Implying, that gifting without sending doth not constitute a Minister.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That this mission is not only of extraordinary, but of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary teachers,</hi> because faith is as much annexed to their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as teaching to their mission, and faith is not the fruit of humane invention (such is preaching without mission) but of Divine Ordinance And therefore since we have no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30575:46"/>
Preachers, we must either conclude <hi>there is no faith in the world,</hi> or that <hi>there is an ordinary way of sending Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> by whom as Gods instruments faith is wrought, and if so, their persons must enter that way, and not runne before they be sent.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>That there is a necessity of a constant and perpetual, as well as of an ordinary mission.</hi> If faith depends upon hearing, hearing upon preaching, preaching upon mission, then if faith be necessary in all ages of the world, mission is also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, yea ordinary mission, because extraordinary is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. A person may be <hi>praedo,</hi> but he cannot be <hi>praco</hi> without mission, and whatsoever may be done in some few extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cases where regular mission cannot be had, yet to run without sending, and to leap over the wall where God hath opened a door, is as high presumption in Divinity, as it is in the civil state, to break open an house without humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. To all this it is replied,</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>1. Some say,</hi> That this sending is meant of sending by the election of the people, but not by the Ordination of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This cannot be, for the people are the parties to whom the Preachers are sent: Ministers are <hi>sent to the people, not by the people.</hi> The same party cannot be the person send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the persons sent unto. An Embassadour is not sent by the State to whom he brings his Embassie, but by the States which gave him his Commission.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>2. Others say,</hi> That this sending is to be understood of a providential, not of an ecclesiastical and ministerial sending.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This is confuted by the next words in the Text, <hi>How shall they preach except they be sent? as it is written, How beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things.</hi> These words are taken out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. and must needs be understood of a ministerial sending. The Ministers he speaks of are called <hi>Watchmen,</hi> Isa. 52.8. and the Prophet himself is mentioned as one of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. They are a Prophecy of the acceptation that the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30575:47"/>
Ministers sent by God, should have amongst the people of God in the times of the Gospel; And that this Text is to be understood of more then a bare providential sending, appears further. Because</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If providential sending were sufficient, then women-Preachers are as much sent of God, and may promise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as good successe as the best Minister. Yea a tyrant, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or murtherer, may justifie himself in his wickednesse, as being sent by God providentially; Then <hi>Zimri</hi> had as just a warrant to destroy the house of <hi>Baasha,</hi> as <hi>Iehu</hi> had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the house of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren did well in selling him, since they did it by special providence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. &amp; 50.7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Apostle speaks of such a sending as must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all to be of God, an <hi>authoritative mission,</hi> such as Embassadours have, who are sent with publick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Credence, to negotiate the Affairs of those that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are called <hi>Preachers or Heralds,</hi> the participle in the original, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. noting the Office, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. &amp; 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. so in the parallel place, <hi>Isa.</hi> 52.8. they are called <hi>Watchmen,</hi> both which terms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note Authority.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. People are blamed for not hearing them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16, 21. but the not hearing of such as are not sent,<note place="margin">Otherwise then providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.</note> is no fault but a vertue, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.5, 8. Indeed divine truth is ever obligatory who ever brings it, but a double tie lies upon people when truth is conveighed by a divine messenger: Otherwise any private person had as much power of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and losing as a Minister. There is a wide difference between an arrest or pardon reported by a private person, and the same applied under the Broad-Seal by a person de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated from the Supream Magistrate.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Socinians</hi> reply to the Text, and say, <hi>That a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Call was necessary in the Apostles daies, because the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by them delivered was new and unheard of, but this mission is not necessary in our daies, because we preach no new
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30575:47"/>
Doctrine, but onely that which the Apostles have formerly taught and written.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> But the Answer is easie. For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. We have already proved, That there is a necessity in the Church of Christ of a constant, perpetual and ordinary mission.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is false that the Apostles and Prophets taught any new Doctrine, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14. &amp; 26.22. &amp; 28.23. they believed and taught nothing but old truths, formerly delivered by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. New indeed they might be in <hi>respect of the manner of proposing,</hi> Joh. 13.34. or the <hi>singular ratification thereof by miracles,</hi> Mark 1.27. or <hi>the apprehension of the Auditors,</hi> Acts 17.19. but not as to the <hi>substance</hi> of the Doctrine. Compare <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.34. with 2 <hi>Epist.</hi> of <hi>Iohn vers.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As to the first and third Consideration, the Gospel is alwayes new to <hi>children, ignorant persons</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore if <hi>Socinians</hi> will be true to their own principles, they cannot plead against a called Ministry.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the dayes of the <hi>Apostles</hi> the truths of the <hi>Gospel</hi> were owned by <hi>all the Churches,</hi> and so not new as to their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, yet then came none to the Ministry without a Call. Witnesse the Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> Thus at last we have vindicated this Text from all those mists that are cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to darken it, and made it to appear, That none ought to take upon them the Office of a Minister, unlesse they be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Called and Ordained thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Our second Argument is taken from <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God,</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30575:48"/>
here makes a general Proposition, No man ought to take the ministerial honour upon him unlesse called by God. This Proposition is not <hi>limited</hi> but <hi>illustrated,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, By <hi>Aaron,</hi> who undertook not this Office till called thereunto, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.1. no more did any other of the Priests in the Old Testament, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11. &amp; 16.16. It cost <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> and his Company dear for doing otherwise. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets also make mention of their Commissions in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Prophecies. The word of the Lord came to <hi>Isaiah, Ieremiah, Hosea,</hi> &amp;c. And when <hi>Amaziah</hi> objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Amos, Amos</hi> did not plead any <hi>general liberty</hi> the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> had of prophesying, but tels <hi>Amaziah, I was no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, I was an Herdsman, and a gatherer of Sycamore fruit, and the Lord took me as I followed the flock,</hi> &amp;c. If then the Priests and Prophets of the Old Testament could not take this honour upon them, till call'd and appointed, who can shew any just reason, why any under the New Testament should do otherwise, especially if we consider, <hi>That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Ministry is more weighty and glorious then the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal was.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, By Christ, who though he be <hi>God blessed for ever, the true God, coequal and coeternal with the Father,</hi> yet he glorified not himself; to be made an high-Priest, but was sealed and inaugurated by his Father into this great Office. And therefore he saith expresly <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.54. <hi>If I honour my self, my honour is nothing, it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom you say that he is your God.</hi> Now we desire all Christians in the fear of God to consider, That if the Lord Jesus would not honour himself to become our Mediator till he was anointed by his Father, and designed to this Office, it cannot but be great presumption for any man to glorifie himself, and make himself a Minister before he be lawfully ordained thereunto, we may truly say to such, as Christ doth, <hi>You that thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour your selves, your honour is nothing.</hi>

Adde further, that Ministers are called <hi>Gods Mouth,</hi> and how shall a man take upon him to be Gods mouth who is not sent from God? They are called the <hi>Good souldiers of Iesus Christ,</hi> souldiers in an eminent degree, to fight against iniquity and heresie, and therefore must be listed by Christ into that number, and must have his warrant for the discharge of their duty. They are <hi>Gods Servants and Ministers,</hi> and therefore must be sent by him, or else they are their own masters, not Gods servants. And that all these things concern our Ministry as well as theirs in the Primitive times, is evident, because these Titles are applied not onely to extraordinary, but to ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ministers.

man, though he be never so richly qualified for these Offices, unlesse he be lawfully appointed thereunto; So is it in Church-affairs, it is not gifts but calling that constitutes a Minister; therefore that distinction of a <hi>Minister by gifts and a Minister by calling</hi> hath no footing in the Word of Truth: If gifts were sufficient to make a Minister, then women might preach as well as men, for they may have as eminent gifts. Indeed gifts are a necessary qualification of the person to be called, but make him not a lawfull Minister till called and ordained: And if he take the Office upon him unsent, he is an Usurper, and may fear to perish in the gain-saying of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> notwithstanding his gifts.</p>

                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 5.</note>Fifthly, We argue from the <hi>Rules laid down in Scripture for the calling of men to the Office of the Ministry:</hi> The Word of God doth exactly tell us the <hi>qualifications of the person,</hi> that is to be called 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Scripture also directs <hi>for the manner of his calling</hi> to the work, <hi>who are to Ordain, How he is to be Ordained,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now either these directions are superfluous and unnecessary, or else it is a truth that no man ought to take this Office upon him without such a call; Nor were these directions given for that age only, but for all the ages of the Church to the end of the world, as appears evidently from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18. compared with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.7.21. In the first place he is charged to keep those commands without spot <hi>to the appearance of Iesus Christ</hi>; And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place there is as solemn a charge particularly applied to quicken his diligence and faithfulnesse about matters of the Church, and especially <hi>the ordination, honour and maintenance of the Ministry,</hi> in ordinary, as appeareth by the context be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and after from <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to <hi>ver.</hi> 23. The same charge is laid down also by way of direction, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and particularly committed to <hi>Timethy</hi>'s care, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. And one main ground why <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to be so carefull about these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars especially at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> was, That thereby false doctrine might be prevented, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3, 4. for which there is scarce a more effectuall means in the world, then a publike and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30575:49"/>
care of calling persons duely qualified to the Ministry: And we cannot but look with sad hearts upon the spreading of errours in these daies of generall Apostasie, as the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgement of God upon the supine negligence of men in this particular among others; The same charge upon the same ground is laid upon <hi>Titus,</hi> Cha. 1.5, 9, 10. where also the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle gives singular directions for the qualification of the person to be ordained, both in point of gifts and grace, which are all vain and unusefull, if any may enter upon the Ministry without Ordination.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, We argue from that confusion which would come into the Church,<note place="margin">

                     <p>NO man may perform the work of the Ministry but he that is solemnly set apart and ordained to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</p>
                     <p>Having in the precedent Chapter asserted the necessity of Ordination to the work of the Ministry against the presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous usurpation of such as run and are not sent; We shall by the grace of God in this Chapter vindicate the work of the Ministry unto those whom God hath set as Officers in his Church.</p>
                     <p>That there is a work belonging to the Ministry is out of question, and what that work is, is confessed by all; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them to dispense the mysteries of God, the keys of the Kingdom of God are in their hands; It is their work to watch for souls <hi>as they that must give an account of them at that great day</hi>; To preach the Word, and by sound doctrine to convince gain-sayers, to administer the Sacraments of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and the Lords Supper, to pray for and blesse the people in the Name of God, to rule and govern the Church, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a care of discipline, and all these as in the place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Of how great necessity these works are unto the Church, is evident unto understanding Christians, and hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated already: It now remains to be enquired, whether all or any of these works may be performed by men uncalled, though gifted, or whether they be peculiar unto Ministers.</p>
                     <p>Those with whom we have to do, yeelding all the rest to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30575:50"/>
the Ministry, challenge in their writings a liberty to preach the Word, and in their practises (some of them) a power of praying for and blessing the people, how justly we shall shew when we have first stated the Question, which we shall do briefly and plainly, that we may not seem to disallow what we ought to countenance, commend, nay to command in the Name of the Lord, and that we may prevent and anticipate the cavils of some gain-sayers.</p>
                     <p>For the right stating of the Question, we shall declare what we mean by preaching of the Word, and from thence premise some few distinctions, which well considered of, might put an end to this whole controversie.</p>
                     <p>By the Preaching of the Word we understand an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative explication and application of Scripture, for exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, edification, and comfort, to a Congregation met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the solemn worship of God, in the stead and place of Christ; and we desire that every branch of this description may be well weighed in the balance of the Sanctuary.</p>
                     <p>The Subject of Preaching is the Word of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Let him that hath my word speak my word faithfully,</hi> Jer. 23.28. This is that sound doctrine, and form of sound words which the Apostle enjoyns <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to hold fast. And them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and Christ himself taught no other things then were written in <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This work is the explication and application of this word: As <hi>Ezra</hi> read in the Book of the Law, and gave the sense, and <hi>caused all Israel to understand,</hi> Neh. 8.8. And it is to this which <hi>Paul</hi> presseth <hi>Timothy</hi> when he exhorts him to shew himself a <hi>workman that need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.15.</p>
                     <p>The end of this work is the exhortation, edification, and comfort of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.2. which is the profitable use of all Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                     <p>The object of this work is a Congregation met together for the Solemn worship of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. <hi>when you are come together into one place</hi>; It is true, that the word ought to be preach'd to Infidels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. <hi>Go into all the

                        </gap>, with all command. Secondly, In the stead and place of Christ; Thus the Apostle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>We beseech you,</hi> as if God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, <hi>we pray you in Christs stead, be reconciled to God</hi>; and hence it is that Christ saith to his Disciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you heareth me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>From hence,</p>
                     <p>First, We distinguish between a private brotherly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, admonition, exhortation of one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative publique teaching; The first grounded on charity is the common duty of all Christians, by the royall Law of love, and prescribed to all, even to women, by the Law of God under pain of sin, and this especially in evil times. This pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise we are far from disallowing or discouraging; we call God to witnesse it would be the joy of our hearts to see our people full of knowledge, and full of goodnesse, able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to admonish one another with prudence, love, zeal, and a spirit of meeknesse; and this we exhort and charge in the name of Christ that they neglect not: It is authoritative teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only which we deny.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We distinguish between the teaching of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Masters in their Families (to which also the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of School-masters may be reduced) and Ministeriall preaching: We call upon Parents, Masters, School-masters, not only to bring their Families, and Scholars to publike Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, but to make their Houses the Churches of Christ; To reade the Scriptures in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to catechize them, to train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, to teach

them in their youth, in the trade of their way, as they will answer it at that great day: And unto this duty we exhort even mothers; but we deny unto them Ministeriall Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We distinguish between the exhortation of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in the head of an Army, and of a Judge in his charge upon the Bench, and preaching the Word of God: Though we deny not the lawfulness of the one or the other of the two former, because we have the approved examples of <hi>Ioab,</hi> 2 Sam. 10. Of <hi>Abijah,</hi> 2 Chro. 13. Of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> 2 Chro. 19.20. <hi>Ioshua</hi> Cha. 23.24. yet we say, First, That properly thus to do was the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters work; for thus the Lord prescribes <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.2. <hi>And it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battell, that the Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, We distinguish between Divinity-exercises in the Schools, and University, and the Preaching of the Word. For though these Lectures are performed either only by such as have received Ordination, and ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their Scholars, and Scholars rendring account to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, then ministerial preaching.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, We distinguish between the act of members in any sacred or civil Assembly, debating, counselling, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing one another out of the Word of God, and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word; Because this action of theirs towards one another is not authoritative, but meerly brotherly, is rather <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a Christian conference, then preaching, and no other then private Christians met together by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent may perform; neither is their meeting such a one as is the Object of preaching of which we speak.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Before we proceed to argument, we desire it may be observed that we dispute not what may be done in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary cases, either in regard of times or places where Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination may not possibly be had; whether in such a case pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gifted men may not preach, we do not dispute: <hi>Davids</hi> necessity made it lawfull for him and his men to eat the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, which it was not lawfull for any but only the Priests to eat; but our Question is, What may be done in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, in Churches where Ordained Ministers either are or may be had; Though we will not prescribe against necessity, yet we would not have necessity pretended where none is: For we reade that the Indians were converted to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith by the means of <hi>Aedesius</hi> and <hi>Frumentius</hi> two pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, but we reade not that either of them took upon them the Office or work of the Ministry; <hi>Frumentius</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Bishop of the <hi>Indians</hi> by <hi>Athanasius. Theod. Eccl. hist.</hi> l. 1. c. 22. And it is observable how great a journey he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took rather then to run or officiate without a Call. The <hi>Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> were converted (as the same Authour relates) by the means of a Captive Maid, but they sent to <hi>Constantine</hi> for ordained Ministers by whom they might be further instructed and guided in the waies of God, which probably our gifted men would never have done.</p>
                     <p>These things thus premised, we come now to prove our Proposition, That <hi>None may undertake the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry but he that is solemnly set apart thereunto,</hi> not respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30575:52"/>
so much the number as weight of Arguments.</p>
                     <p>First, We argue thus,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 1.</note> That work for the doing of which God hath designed speciall Officers of his own, neither ought, nor may be performed by any that are not designed unto that Office.</p>
                     <p>But God hath designed speciall Officers of his own for the preaching of the Word; Therefore,</p>
                     <p>None ought or may preach the Word, but such as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed unto this Office.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>major</hi> of this Argument is confirmed by these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                     <p>First, Because God hath severely punished such as have done the work appointed by him to speciall Officers, though they had no intent to invade the Office unto which that work was by God designed: This appears manifestly; first in the case of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 13.8, 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He lost his kingdom for offering sacrifice, though but once, and that in a great straight. The Philistims were ready to assault him, he had not made his peace with God, <hi>Samuel</hi> delaied his coming, the people began to scatter from him, whereupon he constrained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and offered a Sacrifice, yet for this one presumptuous (though as it might seem) necessitated act, he hears from <hi>Samuel</hi> that he had done foolishly, <hi>i.</hi> wickedly, and from God, that his Kingdom was irrevocably rent from him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In the case of <hi>Vzzah,</hi> 1 Chro. 13.9, 10. who put his hand to the Ark, and that out of a good intention to keep it from falling, when the Oxen shook it, and yet the anger of the Lord was kindled against him, and he smote him that he died: Better it had been for <hi>Vzzah</hi> to have kept his hands farther off, then to have touched the Ark without warrant, and better for the people of God that he had so done, for for his rashnesse God made a breach upon them, and smote him, and this act of his did not help but hinder the bringing of the Ark up into the place prepared for it. Thirdly, In the case of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> 2 Chro. 16.16, 17, 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who when he was strong, had his heart lifted up to his destruction, for he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30575:53"/>
against the Lord his God, and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the Altar of Incense, but the Priests of God withstood him, and said, <hi>It appertaineth not to thee</hi> Uzziah <hi>to burn Incense to the Lord, but to the Priests the Sons of</hi> Aaron <hi>that are consecrated to burn Incense; Go out of the Sanctuary, for thou hast transgressed, neither shall it be for thine honour from the Lord God,</hi> and though he was a King, yet the Lord smote him immediatly with the plague of Leprosie, of which he was not healed till his death. This famous Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry holds forth these great Truths. 1. That it is a transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against God in any to enter upon the work designed by God to another calling. 2. That the Original of this transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is pride of heart. 3. That it is the Ministers duty to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and bear witnesse against such transgressions. 4. That it is dishonourable in the sight of God (whatever foolish people may imagine) thus to transgresse. 5. That God will not be alwaies silent to suffer such transgression unpunished in the greatest, when his Ministers warnings are rejected; <hi>Vzziah</hi> would enter into the Sanctuary, and is separated from the Congregation: Now though God be not so immediate in the severe punishing of such presumption in our daies, yet these things are written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come, that we should not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, as some of them were, lest we also perish as these did.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Because this practice doth make void, or at least unnecessary or insufficient those Officers which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. This is in it self a truth of clearest evidence: What needs a peculiar Officer to be set apart to a common work? As in the naturall body there is no peculiar member set apart as the Organ of feeling, because this sense is common to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member; so in the body of Christ there need not any spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Officer be designed for such a work as is common to, and may be performed by every Christian.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Because this practice doth confound and disturb that order which God hath set in his Church; therefore it must needs be sinfull. <hi>God is the God of order, and not of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:30575:53"/>
1 Cor. 14. and hath commanded <hi>that every one should do his own work,</hi> 1 Thess. 4. Rom. 12. <hi>And abide in his own cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. He hath <hi>condemned those that walk disorderly,</hi> 2 Thess. 3. and <hi>are busie bodies</hi>; he hath placed in his Church different orders, some <hi>Shepherds,</hi> some <hi>Sheep,</hi> some <hi>Teachers of the Word,</hi> some to be <hi>taught,</hi> as their places, so their works are distinct, as the different members of the body have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent offices; but now as in the body there would be confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if any member should do the work of another member; so is it in the Church, if any member shall invade the duty of another. This takes away distinction between Shepherds and Flock, Pastor and People, Rulers and Ruled, and with the new Astronomers casts down Stars towards the Centre, and advances and wheels the dull earth to, and in an heavenly orb. No marvel such <hi>Phaetons</hi> burn up the spiritual world by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming to govern the chariot of the Sun.</p>

And indeed who can in reason deny that those that are set by God in his Church, as Stewards, Heraulds, Watchmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are set by God as Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in his Church; The Apostle himself reckon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>a proper Office,</hi> Rom. 12. Secondly, That the preaching of the Word (amongst divers others) is one work assigned to these Officers; which is manifest both in the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Priests work was not only to bring Sacrifices and burn Incense, but also to teach <hi>Iacob,</hi> Deut 33.

Indeed the Preaching of the Word is not only a work assigned to the Ministry, which they may not omit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incurring the wo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>because a dispensation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them</hi>; but the greatest, weightiest work they are entrusted with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>I was not sent (i.</hi> so much sent) to baptize but to preach the Gospel; A work it is, which the people can least want, because it is the power of God to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and requireth the greatest learning, prudence, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, faithfulnesse in the dispensers of it, that they may shew themselves workmen that need not be ashamed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>and fullfill their Ministry.</hi> It is not for nothing that the Apostle tels us, that ordinary Teachers were set in the Church, that we might not be children in knowledge, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.14. Seeing therefore that God hath provided Officers of his own, to whose trust he hath committed the Preaching of the Word, and no man can without blasphemy averre, that this provision of God is either unnecessary or insufficient, it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the practice of men howsoever gifted, that preach
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30575:54"/>
without a solemn setting apart to the Office of the Ministry, is both unnecessary and unlawfull. And thus much of our first Argument against the preaching of un-ordained men.</p>
                     <p>Our second Argument shall be this; No religious service may be performed unto God by any other sort of persons then such as are appointed or otherwise warranted thereunto.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The preaching of the Word is a religious service unto which persons gifted, not ordained, are neither appointed nor warranted: Therefore,</p>
                     <p>The Preaching of the Word may not be performed by gifted persons un-ordained.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>major</hi> Proposition is clear from this principle: Every positive act of Religion must have an affirmative warrant, and the service which we tender must be obedience, or righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, obedience it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>annot be unless it be commended, nor righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness unless it be at the least indulged. If it be either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or indulged, we have warrant sufficient, but if the thing we do be neither required nor allowed, we sin presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously, though what we do be to a good intent, and very plausible to humane wisedom.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>minor</hi> or Assumption,</p>
                     <p>First, It will not be denied that the Preaching of the Word is a Religious Service.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That all gifted persons are not appointed to preach, nor otherwise warranted thereunto, It appears in the parts.</p>
                     <p>First, They are not appointed, For then,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Every gifted man that preaches not is guilty of the sin of Omission.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Preaching must be looked upon as a common duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned unto all Beleevers as such, and every one should study Divinity in order to Preaching, and wo to him that preaches not, though he could preach but one Sermon only, and do not; The judgement of the unprofitable Servant shall be upon him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They are not otherwise warranted, for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30575:55"/>
of the Word is only <hi>cultus institutus,</hi> founded in Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and therefore must be regulated according to it; For the Preaching of publique Officers we finde the Institution to be clear, but of another Institution for the publique exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of gifts by those who are no Ministers, we finde nothing; That which is pretended concerning prophesying, or the like, we shall answer when we come professedly to deal with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>

                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 3.</note>Thirdly, We argue thus, If no man may do the work of a Magistrate in the civil, or of a Deacon in the Ecclesiasticall State, but he that is called to the Office of a Magistrate, or of a Deacon, then much lesse may any man preach the Word (which is the work of a Minister) but he that is called to the Office of the Ministry.</p>
                     <p>But no man may do the work of a Magistrate in the civil, or of a Deacon in the Ecclesiasticall estate, but he that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Office of a Magistrate or of a Deacon: Therefore,</p>
                     <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is evident,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That no man may do the work of a Magistrate unlesse he be a Magistrate, from <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.14. where our Saviour Christ refuseth to meddle with dividing Inheritances, because he was no Judge; <hi>Man, who made me a Iudge?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That no man may do the work of a Deacon in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical state, unlesse called to the Office, is evident from <hi>Act.</hi> 6. where men full of the holy Ghost, and faith, chosen by the people to that work, yet might not minister till they were appointed by the Apostles; and that generall rule laid down, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. Let him be first proved, so let him mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</p>
                     <p>Now the reason of the connexion is evident, for by how much the work of the Ministry is of greater consequence, difficulty and danger, then either of these; by so much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care and circumspection is to be taken, that it be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed promiscuously to <hi>Quicunque vult,</hi> but performed by such men as are triedly sound in the faith, and able to teach others also:

Physick, for (saith he) if a Stone-cutter miscarry he loseth but a stone, If a Shoe-maker he spoils but a piece of Lether, but if a Physician miscarry, he destroys a man;</q> what may we say of those that intrude upon the work of the Ministry, if they miscarry they destroy souls, and this is indeed to destroy the man; <hi>Si navem poscat sibi peronatus arator, non meritò excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met frontem melicerta perisse de rebus?</hi>
In brief, shall an exact scrutiny passe upon such as are to feed the bodies of poor men, and not upon such as feed the souls? <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. The work of the Ministry, the preaching of the Word is a work of the highest consequence and importance that ever God committed to the sons of men; <hi>The reconciling of men to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. Even an heavenly Embassy of infinite and eternall consequence: Now if God allow not these works which are of an inferiour nature to be done by men untried and unappointed to the Office, how shall he approve of such as adventure upon this work of preaching the Word, which is <hi>negotium negotiorum</hi> the work of works, without any trial or commission.</p>
                     <p>If none may administer the Sacrament but he that is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called and ordained thereunto,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 4.</note> then neither may any preach but he that is lawfully called and ordained. But none may administer the Sacraments but he that is lawfully called and ordained thereunto. Therefore,</p>
                     <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is easily granted and proved from the nature of the Sacraments: They are <hi>Seals of the righteousnesse by faith.</hi> If it be an intolerable usurpation amongst men for a private man to take the broad seal of the Kingdom, and put it to what instruments he pleaseth, much more intolerable is it for a private man to usurp the dispensation of the broad Seal of the Kingdom of heaven: As in all States there are Keepers of the Seals appointed, whose office it is to dispose them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law: Even so it is in the Church of God, Jesus Christ hath appointed Keepers of his Seals, those whom he cals <hi>Stewards of the mysteries of God,</hi> to whom he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the word of Reconciliation, and to whom he hath
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30575:56"/>
given power to baptize, and to administer the Lords Supper.</p>
                     <p>The connexion is clear, because that these two works are joyntly in the same Commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. and of the two the preaching of the Word is the greater work. This the Apostle intimates, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the Gospel:</hi> The negative particle is here (as in many other places) taken for the comparative, he was sent rather to preach then to baptize, and by this manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression it appears, that to preach was his more proper and especiall work: This account all the rest of the Apostles had of it, therefore they did put off ministring to Tables, that they might give themselves to the Word and Praier. In the consideration of the greatnesse of this work, the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiah</hi> being sent about it cries out, <hi>Wo is me, I am undone;</hi> the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah, Ah Lord God, behold, I cannot speak, for I am a childe,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> also, <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> Of this account it hath been alwaies had in the Church of God ancient and modern till these unhappy times of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. And therefore we humbly entreat all those that do conscienciously (and as we beleeve justly) scruple to have their Children baptized by, or receive the Lords Supper from the hands of any un-ordained person, that they would seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider upon what warrant they hear un-ordained men preach: Seeing there is the same Commission for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for baptizing; and that preaching is the great, if not the greatest work of a Minister.</p>

                     <p>The first Proposition is clear by its own light, the other is easily proved, by asserting Preaching to be an act of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is evident both in that the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.12. gives this charge, <hi>Know them that are over you in the Lord, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish you,</hi> where to admonish is to be over, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controversie the lesser is blessed of the greater, and this

                        </gap>. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of teaching is to usurp authority over the man. Besides them the publike work of the Ministry of the Word is an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative administration, like unto that of Criers, Heralds, and Embassadors, to be performed in the name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and therefore may not be performed by any but such as are authorized, and immediatly or mediatly deputed by him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. appears, because in preaching, the key of the Kingdom of Heaven is used, to take men in or shut men out, and this key is in the hand of ordinary Teachers as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, yea, the power of binding and loosing is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, For though to preach be no act of jurisdiction strictly so called, yet it is an act not only of order but of power, not such as is common to every member of the Church, but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to such as are in publike Office. Now to perform any authoritative act without authority, what is it other then to usurp authority? Gifts conferre the faculty of administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but not the power: The Question which the Pharisees put to our Saviour being propounded to these men, <hi>By what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority dost thou these things, and who gave thee this authority?</hi> Could they answer as Christ? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.28. <hi>I am not come of my self.</hi>

It is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that <hi>Shemaiah</hi> the <hi>Nehelamite,</hi> a false Prophet and a dreamer, writes to <hi>Zephaniah</hi> the sonne of <hi>Maasiah</hi> the Priest, and to all the Priests, and accuseth <hi>Ieremiah</hi> for a mad man in making himself a Prophet, and tells them, that upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they ought to put him in prison, and in the stocks. It seems by this that it was no little sin, and deserves no little punishment (even in the judgement of false Prophets) to preach without a lawfull call.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30575:57"/>
baptize, is justified by his Mission. When the chief Priests and the Scribes with the Elders asked Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.2. <hi>Tell us by what authority doest thou these things, or who gave thee this authority?</hi> Christ makes answer by demanding another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>The Baptisme of Iohn, was it from heaven or of men?</hi> Which teacheth us these two truths: First, That none ought to preach without being authorized and sent. Secondly, That this Call and Sending is not only from men, but from heaven. True it is, such as is the Ministry, such ought the Call to be; if the Ministry extraordinary, the Call extraordinary; if the Ministry ordinary, the Call must be ordinary; but we reade of no Ministry allowed in Scripture without a Divine Call: There is a threefold Call to the Ministry mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. The first is of or from man only, when any is designed to this work <hi>errante clave,</hi> that hath no inward qualification or Call from God. This though it authorizeth to outward admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations in the Church, yet will not satisfie the conscience of him that so administers. The second is by man, as the instrument, when any is designed to the Ministry by those whom God hath intrusted with the work of Ordination ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of the Word; these God cals by man, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. This is the Call of ordinary Pastors. The third by Jesus Christ immediatly, and by this it is that <hi>Paul</hi> proves himself an Apostle, an extraordinary Minister.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, we argue thus:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 8.</note> That work may not be performed by any, which cannot by him be performed in faith; But preaching by a Brother Gifted, but not Called nor Ordained, cannot be done in faith: Therefore A Gifted unordained brother may not Preach.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the <hi>major</hi> we shall say little; the Apostles ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Canon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Whatsoever is not of faith is sin,</hi> doth evidently demonstrate it. The truth of the <hi>minor</hi> appears in that there is no warrant in Scripture (which is the ground of faith) for such a practice.</p>
                     <p>For first there is no</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Precept that such should preach; if there were a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30575:58"/>
it was then a necessary duty that every gifted person ought to perform, it was a sin if any gifted person should not preach, though he could preach but one Sermon only in all his life. Where is the necessity laid upon them (as the Apostle speaks of himself) that they preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is no Precept that any should hear them, or obey them in the Lord, or maintain them; these duties of the people areappropriated to those that are Preachers by Office, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. <hi>The Priests lips</hi> should <hi>preserve knowledge, and the people</hi> should <hi>enquire the Law at their lips. Luk.</hi> 10.16. The hearing of them is the hearing of Christ, and the refusing of them is the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Christ: It is not so said of any that preach without mission; but contrarily there is a strict charge not to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to such, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.14. and a complaint of them that heap to themselves teachers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Thus the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7, 17. <hi>Remember them, obey them, submit your selves to them that have the rule over you, and have spoken to you the Word of God.</hi> So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy of double honour,</hi> &amp;c. Nothing of this is spoken of gifted Brethren, yet if they may lawfully preach, all this may they challenge, and all that hear and plead for them are bound in conscience to yield, because all this is due for the works sake, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is no promise in Scripture made unto any that Preach and are not thereunto lawfully Ordained: We say no promise, either of</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Assistance: A Minister must depend upon God for his inabling unto the great work which he undertakes, for all our <hi>sufficiency is of God,</hi> and we have no sufficiency of our selves so much as to think any thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. and God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised this assistance only to those whom himself sends. Thus <hi>Exo.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Go,</hi> saith the Lord to <hi>Moses, and I will be with thy mouth. Isa.</hi> 6.7, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God touches the mouth of <hi>Isaiah</hi> and sends him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.21, 22. Christ sends and gives the holy Ghost to the Apostles, and to them is the promise. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. <hi>The Spirit of truth shall lead you into all truth.</hi> Doth God do thus
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30575:58"/>
to those that run and are not sent? O let the great errours broached of old by <hi>Origen,</hi> and others that presumed the the undertaking of this work without a Call; and in our daies by Anabaptists, Socinians, and others that despise a regular lawfull Call, bear witness. Surely we may say that if any amongst us Preach without a Call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet Preach the truth, they have not their assistance by vertue of any promise from the hand of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Protection: Thus God hath promised to those whom he sends on his message. Thus the Lord encourageth <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> ch. 1.18, 19. <hi>I have made thee this day a defenced City, and an iron pillar, and a brazen wall against this whole Land; and they shall fight against thee, but shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.</hi> Thus also <hi>Act.</hi> 18.9. the Lord incourageth <hi>Paul, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee.</hi> So also <hi>Act.</hi> 23.11. <hi>Be of good chear Paul, &amp;c.</hi> And as we finde that God hath promised protection to those he sends, so also the Ministers of God have incouraged themselves to a faithfull discharge of their duty against all opposition, especially upon this ground that they had their commission from God, and his immutable promise for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 51.16. <hi>Ier.</hi> 26.14, 15. But no where hath God made any such promise to those that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude themselves into this work, but threatens to be against them as hath been declared; The Angels of God have a charge to keep us in our waies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. but they that go out of them may fear the portion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Success, in respect of the weighty ends of the Ministry, the principall the glory of God, the secondary the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and salvation of souls; How is it possible that he who intrudes himself into the work of the Ministry should glorifie God in the work, since God is honoured only in his own waies and means, and therefore cannot be glorified when his waies are not observed. To obey is better then sacrifice, saith
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30575:59"/>
the Prophet, <hi>and to hearken then the fat of Rams.</hi> Christ glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified not himself to be made an High-priest; such therefore as assume the Ministry, glorifie themselves and not God. Neither is there any promise made, neither is it to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that he who assumes this work of the Ministry without a Call, should ever become the instrument of the conversion and edification of souls, <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> and hearing by the preaching of such as are sent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 17. but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Preachers have the curse of God upon their labours, that they shall not profit the people at all, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.32. <hi>Luther</hi> hath a good saying to this purpose, <hi>Deus non fortunat labores corum qui non sunt vocati, &amp; quamvis salutaria quaedam affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant tamen non aedificant:</hi> that is, <hi>God doth not prosper their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who are not called, and though they preach some profitable truths, yet do they not profit the people.</hi> Hence it comes to pass that they that hear uncalled Preachers, fall i nto so many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as a just punishment of God upon them; according to that the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>For the time will come that they will not indure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves Teachers, having itching ears, and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto fables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>Thirdly, There is no one approved example recorded in Scripture of any one not being Sent and Called, either immediatly or mediatly by God, especially in a constituted Church, that undertook this work of preaching, or any other work appropriated by God to the Ministry.</p>
                     <q>And thus we have also finished this second Chapter, and sufficiently and clearly proved, as we suppose, That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for any man not lawfully called and set apart to the Office of a Minister to undertake and intrude upon the work of Preaching appropriated by God to that Office.</q>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. Answering the Arguments brought for the Preaching of men out of Office.</head>
                     <p>IN this Chapter we shall give Answers to the chief and main Arguments produced by such as maintain this unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table practice of Preaching by men out of Office; for though a Christian ought not to depart from the plain rule of the Word of God, though he be not able to satisfie all the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical cavils of gain-saying adversaries, yet that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all stumbling blocks, and occasions to fall out of the way, that if it be possible some may be reclaimed from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rrour, others may be more firmly established in the truth, when they see discovered the vanity and invalidity of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Arguments for the preaching of gifted men out of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, we shall likewise undertake this task.</p>
                     <p>The first and principal Argument is drawn from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.31. <hi>Ye may all prophesie one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted:</hi> Whence is thus inferred; That the Apostle giving liberty to the gifted Brethren of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> out of Office to Prophesie (you may <hi>All</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) warrants this practice of Preaching in all men that have gifts, though they be not set apart to this Office.</p>
                     <p>In Answer to this Argument we first lay down this Rule, which is also of excellent use for the understanding of many other places of Scripture, <hi>viz. That this universal All is to be restrained and limited according to the subject or matter treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</hi> As when the Apostle saith, <hi>All things are lawfull for me,</hi> he means not <hi>simply All things,</hi> but <hi>restrainedly All in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things</hi> of which he was there treating, 1. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 6.12.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30575:60"/>
and 10.23. In like manner when the same Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. saith, <hi>All things are made new.</hi> This Proposition is to be restrained from the subject and matter of which he was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unto Beleevers. The like may be observed in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These things thus premised, We say</p>
                     <p>First, In this place of the Apostle, <hi>Ye may all prophesie,</hi> the word All is to be restrained according to the subject of which the Apostle speaks: He saith not of the Body or People of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that they might All Prophesie, but of the Prophets in that Church, that they might All Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. This is evident both from the antecedent and subsequent words. In the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse the Apostle saith, <hi>Let the Prophets speak two or three,</hi> &amp;c. then he subjoyns, <hi>For ye may All pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie:</hi> and then it follows immediatly, <hi>And the spirit of the Prophets shall be subject to the Prophets.</hi> By this discourse of the Apostle it evidently appears that the liberty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying was not given to every member of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> but only to the Prophets that were in that Church: Now it is clear they were not all Prophets (<hi>c.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Are all Prophets?</hi> i. All are not Prophets:) and therefore all had not granted them this liberty of prophecying: And thus far we have the consent not only of <hi>Beza</hi> and others upon the place, but even of the most sober of our adversaries, who will not assert a promiscuous liberty of prophecying to every member of the Church, but only to such as are gifted and qualified for the work, and desired by the Church to exercise that Gift.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Prophets both in this place, and where ever else in the Scriptures mentioned, were an order of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, not only gifted Brethren, but constituted Officers in the Church. Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>God hath set in his Church, first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. As the Apostles and Teachers were Officers set by God in his Church, so also were the Prophets. Reade also <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. When Christ gave <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> gifts, Officers for the good of the Church, he gave amongst these Officers Prophets. And
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30575:60"/>
we do not beleeve, that there can an instance be given of any Text either in the Old or New Testament, in which the word <hi>Prophet</hi> doth not signifie one in Office peculiarly called and sent. Now if this be an irrefragable truth (as indeed it is) then the Apostles permitting all Prophets (<hi>i.</hi> men in Office) to prophesie, is no warrant for gifted brethren (if out of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) to do that work.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Though what hath been already said be sufficient to infringe the Argument drawn from this place to warrant the preaching of men out of Office, yet we adde for the more full Vindication of this Scripture, that the Prophets here mentioned, yea, and throughout the New Testament, seem not to be only Officers in the Church, but extraordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers immediatly inspired and sent by the holy Ghost, which appears in that</p>
                     <p>First, They are not only mentioned and preferred before Pastors and Teachers, the ordinary Officers of the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. but also before the Evangelists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. who are acknowledged by all to have been Officers extraordinarily sent.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The gift of prophecy is reckoned amongst the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, and put in the midst of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10, 11. and contra-distinguished from ordinary gifts, <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8. the word of wisedom, the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; The word of wisedom denotes the Pastors work, the word of knowledge the Teachers work; but prophesying is different from both these, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Thirdly, It is evident by the <hi>series</hi> of this Chapter, that the Prophets herein spoken of, and their prophesying was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,

Women are not mentioned in opposition to the men in <hi>Corinth</hi> simply, But in opposition to such as had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts, whether of Tongues, or of Prophecy, or any such like: And the scope of the Apostle is not to give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to all, but to lay down rules to those that were Prophets and men in Office, how they should regulate their prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the edification, exhortation, and consolation of the people, and then he wholly excludes the women from this work.</p>

We may further answer, that by women here are not meant women simply, but <hi>Women-Prophetesses,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to <hi>men-Prophets</hi> formerly spoken of. This seems to be intimated in the words of the Text, <hi>Let your</hi> Women <hi>keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the Church,</hi> i. your prophesying women: That there were women that did prophesie appears from <hi>Act.</hi> 21.9. Now the Apostle doth inhibit all women-Prophetesses from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying in the Church. It is not permitted to them (of what rank soever) to speak, but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the Law. Thus also 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>But I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man:</hi> These Prophetesses might teach in private, but nature it self forbids them to usurp authority over the man, by teaching him in publique.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Women are said to pray and prophesie, not by doing so actually in their own persons, but by joyning with men in praying and prophesying: And the meaning of the Text is, Every woman that joyneth in praying or prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> is said to offer 120000. sheep, not in his own person, but by joyning with the Priests that did it. Thus <hi>Pilate</hi> is said to scourge Jesus, which he did not do in his own person, but by his Officers.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. But we assert, That these spirituall gifts are to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by every one in his own sphere, by private persons pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, by those that are in Office publikely, and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: It is very observable, that <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> private persons, yet of eminent gifts (insomuch as they knew the way of Christ more perfectly then <hi>Apollos</hi> himself, who was an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures) kept their own place, and whereas <hi>Apollos</hi> being a Minister in Office (as appears 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.) preached publiquely in the Synagogues, they as gifted Christians did not undertake to preach publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but took him to them, and privately expounded to him the way of God more perfectly, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. This is a notable patern for private Christians even of the highest form to walk by; In this way they may finde emploiment for all their gifts, in this way they may honour God, and be promoters of the Gospel, as were those women whom the Apostle honours with the Title of <hi>Labourers with him in the Gospel,</hi> Phil. 4.3. They laboured not by publike preaching, for this the Apostle permits not to women, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. but by private advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and admonitions, as opportunities were administred.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Therefore it follows not, that because all gifts are to be improved, therefore a gifted brother may preach; for first, there are other waies of making use of our most excellent gifts then by preaching only: and secondly, It is required in him that will preach warrantably, not only that he be fitted for the work, but that he be appointed to the Office of the Ministry, as hath been before fully demonsttated; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we do not the same work twice, we here su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persede.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Because he might not know that they were set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This was an excellent and imitable desire in <hi>Moses,</hi> for though he knew that God had decreed not to diffuse this gift of prophecy unto all, yet he here discovers his humility in wishing that all the Lords people had the gift of prophesie.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> To which we answer shortly; To the first, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the dispossessed did no more then he had a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from Christ to do, and therefore is no president for such as preach without a calling; if he did more he sinned.</p>
                     <p>To the second, The woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did not preach but only charitatively, and as private persons may, declare what she had seen and heard; and if any thing can be concluded from hence for Preaching without Ordination, the lawfulness of womens preaching must be concluded.</p>
                     <p>To the third, The man was cast into hell for hiding and not imploying his talent, that is in his own calling, as hath been often suggested; It is the duty of every Christian to stir up the gift ofGod that is in him, and for Christians to speak often one to another in evil times, to teach, admonish, exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to pray together and one for another; but all this comes short o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This instance which is much insisted upon by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is not of strength to conclude the lawfulnesse of preaching by gifted, un-ordained persons; For,</p>
                     <p>First, Some allowing these scattered Christians to have been private persons, yet do rationally distinguish between a Church constituted, and a Church scattered and dissolved, between what may be done in a Church gathered, and in an ordinary way, and in the gathering of a Church, and in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ase of necessity: It is not recorded that these did preach while they were at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in a setled Church, but when they were scattered, then they went every where preaching; what warrant soever this instance may give to persons uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to preach amongst Indians, and in places where no Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches nor Ministers are, yet can it not warrant them in their preaching in our Churches, in which Ministers are or may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be had.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It may justly be denied, that the Christians here spoken of were private Christians, it may be asserted that they were men in Office, and had commission to do what they did. This appears,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the first verse, where it is said, <hi>At that time there was a great persecution against the Church which was at Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and they were all scattered abroad throughout the Regions of Iudea</hi> and <hi>Samaria, except the Apostles</hi>; These <hi>All</hi> that were scattered must be either All the Teachers and Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or all the Beleevers; not all the beleevers, for it is said in the 3. verse, That <hi>Saul made havock of the Church,</hi> entring into every house, and haling men and women, committed them to prison. And <hi>Act.</hi> 11.22. there is expresse mention made of the Church at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> notwithstanding the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. Had all the Beleevers been scattered what should the Apostles have done at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> their tarrying would have been dangerous to themselves and useless to the Church.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:30575:67"/>
And therefore we judge that by <hi>all</hi> is meant all the Church-Officers (of whom there were many at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) were scattered except the Apostles, and when they were scattered they went every where preaching the Word.</p>
                     <p>To make the Interpretation clearer observe,</p>
                     <p>First, That the word <hi>All</hi> is used here with an exceptive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, which necessitates it to be meant not of beleevers but of men in office; for if all relate to beleevers, then it will follow that there was not one Beleever left in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Apostles. The particle <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Secondly, That it is said, That <hi>they that were scattered went every where preaching the Word</hi>; It is not said <hi>teaching</hi> which may be <hi>actus charitatis,</hi> but Preaching which is <hi>actus officij; How can they preach except they be sent,</hi> Rom. 10.

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.5. there is but one of this scattered number named, and he was a person in office, to wit <hi>Philip,</hi> not the Apostle, but who is numbered among the Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and called an Evangelist, <hi>Act.</hi> 21 8. By the singling out of this one who was in Office, we may judge that the rest were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in office as well as he.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, 'Tis probable, that these that were scattered did baptize as well as preach, which we gather from <hi>Act.</hi> 11.26. It is said there, <hi>There was a Church setled at Antioch,</hi> which

                     </p>
                     <p>If it be said, that there is no where mention made of the Ordination of, or any commission given to these scattered brethren: It is answered, that it doth not follow that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had none, because none is mentioned. It is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us that there are Scripture-Reasons to perswade us that they had a Commission; They did a work peculiar to Officers of the Church, as hath been proved, which godly men out of Office durst not have done; they had successe, and the blessing of God upon their labours, which he promiseth not to those that go in an evil way, as hath been demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But let thus much suffice for this instance.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, All are made Priests unto God, but are all made Prophets? Are not all made Kings? And may therefore all exercise regall jurisdiction amongst men? May all be Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates? Away with such fanatick Monasterian conceits; If

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Because he hath a calling to do the one, and no calling to do the other; You may as well ask, Why may not the Lord-Maior of <hi>London</hi> exercise his jurisdiction at <hi>York</hi> as well as at <hi>London?</hi> Or why may not a Justice of Peace send Warrants out of his own County? Or why might not <hi>Vzzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> as well offer Incense in the Temple as pray in his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a great difference between a private mans preaching that never intends the Ministry, and a Probationers preaching that intends the Ministry, and preacheth by way of triall, that so the people that are to choose him may have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his gifts. A probationer, and a Minister differ but in degree, but a private man and a Minister differ <hi>toto genere.</hi> In the Old Testament there were Prophets, and sons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that were trained up in the Schools of the Prophets: These Sons of the Prophets did prophesie by way of trial and exercise, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.20. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.3. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.35, 36.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That these Sons of the Prophets, or as they are commonly called, these Expectants, are not allowed in the Presbyteriall government to preach without approbation and license. The Directory stablished by both Nations, is, That such as intend the Ministry may occasionally both reade the Scriptures, and exercise gifts in preaching in the Congregation, being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto by the Presbytery. And therefore even Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners under the Presbyterian Government are not to preach

though but occasionally, and for a little while, without a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense and Authority so to do, from them to whom Christ hath given this power to authorize men for such an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p>The immediate call is when a man is chosen by God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intervention of man; Thus were the Prophets and Apostles called: <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, <hi>That he was an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle not of men nor by men, but by Christ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 1.1.</note> &amp;c. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tels us of three sorts of Ministers:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>We purpose not to speak much of this immediate Call; Only because there are some who are ordinarily called Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists or Enthusiasts, or as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> cals them <hi>fanaticos ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> fanatick men, that boast much of Heavenly Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and of divine impulses, and pretend to an immediate Call, we will for our peoples sake briefly answer these three Questions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. <hi>How may we distinguish between an immediate Call from God; and the imposture of fanatick men that say they are so called, and are not?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:30575:70"/>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. <hi>Whether are we to expect any immediate Call in these daies?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. <hi>Whether the Call of the first Reformers of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from the Errours of Popery, was an immediate Call or no?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. <hi>How may we distinguish between an immediate Call from God, and the imposture of men that say they are so called when they are not?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They that are immediatly called to the Ministry are endued by God either with the gift of miracles, or with some other testimony of the Spirit, by which they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to give proof of their immediate Call. When Christ called his twelve Apostles, he gave them power against un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean spirits <hi>to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sicknesse, and all manner of disease.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 10.1.</note> And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> cals this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of working miracles a sign of his Apostleship, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Truly the signs of an Apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs and wonders, and mighty deeds.</hi> When Christ called his 70 Disciples he adorned them also with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Miracles, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.9. Thus when God called <hi>Moses</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, he inabled him to work miracles, that so the Israelites might beleeve that he was not an Impostor, but that the Lord God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> had appeared unto him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. After this manner was the calling of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> confirmed. And yet from hence we dare not (as some do) gather a generall Rule, That an immediate Call is alwaies joyned with the gift of miracles, for it is said expresly of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> That he did no miracle, and yet he was immediatly called:<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.41.</note> Neither do we reade of many of the Prophets of the Old Testament, that they wrought any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; But we say, That an immediate Call is alwaies joyned either with the gift of Miracles, or the gift of Tongues, or some other extraordinary thing, by which men are enabled undoubtedly to demonstrate to others their immediate Call. Thus the Prophets were all of them endued with the gift of fore-telling things to come, and <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was enabled to make proof of his immediate Call by shewing the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:30575:70"/>
both of <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Malachy</hi> that were concerning him; which prophecies were applied to him by the Angel, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. before he was born; appropriated by himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.23. and confirmed by Christs testimony of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.9, 10, 11. And therefore let all those that boast of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, and say they are called by God to preach as the Apostles were, <hi>shew the signs and tokens of their Apostleship,</hi> as the Apostles did; let them shew the gift of miracles, or of Tongues, or of foretelling things to come, or some super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall prediction, that such as they should be sent into the world, or at least some rare and extraordinary work of God, that so the world may beleeve, that they are in truth sent by God, and are not Impostors and Seducers, as the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.14.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They that are immediatly called by God will preach no other doctrine but what is agreeable to the Word of God. This is the distinguishing character brought by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> Jer. 23.16. <hi>Hearken not unto the words of the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For they prophesie a lye unto you, for I have not sent them, saith the Lord, yet they prophesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>For God (as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> observes) hath by his Apostles delivered and prescribed to his Church a certain form by which he would have men enter into the Ministry, and that is a mediate Call, neither is there now any need of an immediate; For it is Gods will, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry even to the end of the world should be tied to that doctrine which is delivered to the Church by the Apostles.</q>

                     <p n="1">1. We will examine the Texts. The first is taken from the choice of <hi>Matthias</hi> into the office of an Apostle,<note place="margin">Act. 1.23.</note> which was done (say they) by the 120. Disciples there present; And if the people have power to choose an Apostle, much more to choose an Ordinary Minister. But we answer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That those words, <hi>And they appoined two, Ioseph called Barsabas, and Matthias,</hi> do in all probability relate to the Apostles, and not to the Disciples: They appointed two, that is, the Apostles appointed two; Thus our Annotators; They appointed two, that is, the fore-mentioned Apostles put two in Election. And if the history be well observed, it will appear that the 120. Disciples are named only in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis, and that <hi>Peter</hi> in his whole Discourse relates espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if not <hi>only</hi> to his Fellow-Apostles. It is said <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>He was numbred with us,</hi> that is, with the <hi>Apostles</hi> not with the <hi>Disciples.</hi> And so <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>which have companied with us,</hi> that is, with the <hi>Apostles.</hi> ver. 22. <hi>must one be ordained to be a witnesse with us,</hi> &amp;c. that is, with us <hi>Apostles.</hi> And then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>And they appointed,</hi> that is, the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and not the 120. Disciples.</p>
                     <p>But suppose that they had been appointed by the 120. Disciples, yet we answer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the whole and sole power of choosing was not in the people, for they were guided and directed in their choice by the eleven Apostles: It was <hi>Electio populi praeeuntibus &amp; dirigentibus Apostolis, By the guidance and direction of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>; and so it comes not up to the proof of the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Apostle tels them in expresse terms, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. <hi>of

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the people cannot (in any good construction) be said to have chosen <hi>Matthias</hi> any more then <hi>Barsabas:</hi> For they appointed two: And when the people had made their choice, <hi>Barsabas</hi> was as capable of being an Apostle, as <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias.</hi> The truth is, <hi>Matthias was chosen by God himself,</hi> and by God only, and therefore it is said, <hi>vers.</hi> 24. <hi>Thou Lord which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen.</hi> It was the divine lot, not the 120. that chose the Apostle.</p>

                        </gap>nd properly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth to choose by stones or counters, with which they were wont to give voices in commission or judgement. But here it must necessarily be taken in a more general sense, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall consent and approbation of the whole company: For it is certain, That <hi>Matthias</hi> was chosen by lot and not by stones, by God and not by the people; And therefore when it is said <hi>He was numbred,</hi> the meaning is, he was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be one of the 12. Apostles, They all rested con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the lot, as being confident that God disposed and approved the event thereof, and as our Annotations say, <hi>By a common declaration of their generall consent he was numbred among the eleven Apostles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second Text is, Concerning the choise of <hi>Deacons,</hi> where the whole and sole power of choosing is put into the hands of the people:<note place="margin">Act. 6.3.</note> And therefore (say they) the choise of a Minister belongs by divine right wholly and solely unto the people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The people had not the whole and the sole choise of the Deacons, but were herein guided, directed, and limited by the holy Apostles; They were limited to the number of seven, and to the company out of which those seven were to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:30575:76"/>
be chosen, and to certain qualifications which must be in these seven: <hi>Look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the holy Ghost, and wisedom, whom we may appoint over this businesse:</hi> And we are confident that if the brethren had failed in any of these particulars, the Apostles would have refused to have laid their hands upon them. And therefore this Text comes not up to the proof of the Objection.</p>
                     <p>But suppose, That the people had had the whole and sole choice of the <hi>Deacons,</hi> yet it will not follow that therefore they should have the whole and sole choise of their Ministers: For it is a certain Rule, <hi>Argumentum a minori ad majus non valet affirmativè.</hi> It is no good way of arguing to say, That because a man is able to do the lesser, therefore he is able to do the greater. Now the Office of a Deacon is inferior to the office of a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> And besides, it will no way follow, That because people are able without advice and direction from others to choose men to gather and distribute money to the poor, that therefore they are able wholly and solely to choose men that shall divide the Word of God amongst them, as skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workmen that need not be ashamed.</p>
                     <p>The third Text is <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>And when they had ordained them Elders in every Church, and had praied with fasting,</hi> &amp;c. The Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which signifieth a choosing by lifting up or stretching out the hand; And <hi>Beza</hi> translates the words, <hi>Cumque ipsis per suffragia creassent per singulas Ecclesias Presbyteros, And when they had created for them by suffrages Elders in every City.</hi> This Text seems to make much for the whole and sole power of the people in the Election of a Minister.</p>
                     <p>But we answer.</p>
                     <p>That though the word <gap reason="foreign">

For our parts we crave leave to dissent from these worthy men, and that upon these grounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Because our brethren do not bring any one Text of Scripture to prove this their assertion (as we can finde) nor do we think that any can be brought.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Because that those very Texts fore-mentioned, which are the chief (if not the only) Texts that are brought for popular Election, do seem to us to hold forth the quite contrary to this assertion. When <hi>Matthias</hi> was made an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, it was not the Election of the people that did constitute him an Apostle. The people chose two, (if they chose at all) but that which did constitute him an Apostle was the determination by lot; As in a Corporation, when the community chooseth two, and the Aldermen one of these two; in propriety of speech, it is the Aldermen that choose the Mayor, not the community: All that the 120. did (if they did that) was to set two before the Lord, but it was God that did constitute and appoint <hi>Matthias</hi> to be the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle: In the choise of <hi>Deacons</hi> the people nominated seven Persons to be <hi>Deacons,</hi> but it was the Apostles Ordination not the peoples Election, that did constitute and make them Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons;<note place="margin">Act. 6.3. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>As for <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. we have already shewed that they that did <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> were the Apostles and not the Churches; And
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:30575:80"/>
that if they did <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> by suffrages, it was <hi>per suffragia propria non aliena</hi> by their own suffrage not the Peoples, though we think (as we have formerly said) that the word is to be taken for a bare decerning and appointing, without the ceremony of lifting up of hands, as it is taken <hi>Act.</hi> 10.41. There is nothing at all in this Text that proves, That the whole essence of the Ministeriall Call is in the peoples Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but it rather proves the quite contrary, That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall Ordination was that which did constitute Elders in every Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. All those Texts that we shall hereafter bring for the asserting of the divine right of Ordination, do prove that the essence of the Ministeriall Call doth consist in Ordination and not in Election: There are more and more clear Texts for Ordination then for Election, and Texts that make it not to be an adjunct but an essentiall constituent of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Call, as we shall hereafter (God willing) prove at large.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. We argue from the nature of popular Election; Election by the people properly is nothing else but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation of a person that is to be made their Minister, or that is already a Minister, to his particular charge: It is not simply a making of a Minister, but the making of him a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of such a place; As it is one thing (saith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>) to make a gold Ring, another thing to appropriate it to such or such a finger; Election is nothing else but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation of a Minister for the exercise of his Ministry in such a place: It doth not give him the Office, but the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of exercising his officiall authority over those that choose him. This appears in the Election of Deacons; all that the people did by Election was only to design the persons and to <hi>set them</hi> before the Apostles, but it was the Apostles praying and laying on of their hands that made them Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.<note place="margin">Act. 6.6.</note> This likewise appears from <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.13. which place though it speaks of the choice of civil Officers, yet it doth very clearly describe unto us the nature of Election; <hi>Take ye wise men and understanding, and known among your tribes,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:30575:81"/>
and I will make them Rulers over you:</hi> The peoples taking of men did not give them the essentials of their office; They nominated the persons, but it was <hi>Moses</hi> that made them Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Our brethren of <hi>New-England</hi> in their Platform of Church-discipline, tell us, That <hi>all Office-power is proper to the Eldership, and that the brotherhood have only a power of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Now then we demand, If the people have no Office-power belonging to them, how can they by Election make an Officer? Indeed they may and do design persons unto office by choosing of them, but that they that have not the power of Office neither formally nor virtually committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and that cannot act or exercise an Office-power, that they by a bare Election should communicate Office-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and give the essentials of a Ministeriall Call, is to us a riddle we understand not; <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet nec for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter nec eminenter</hi>; The lesser is blessed of the greater, not the greater of the lesser. Adde further, If Election be (as our Brethren say) the constituting of a Minister, and the giving him the essentials of his Office, why then did the Apostles take so much pains to return to <hi>Lystra,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 14.21, 23.</note> 
                        <hi>Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> to ordain them Elders in every Church? and why did <hi>Paul</hi> leave <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete</hi> to ordain Elders in every City?<note place="margin">Tit. 1.5.</note> Why did they not spare their journey, and send to the people to make their own Ministers by Election? Can we imagine that they took such pains only to adde an adjunct to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall Call, an <hi>adjunct,</hi> which doth not give essence, but follows the essence, supposing the Subject compleat in its essence before?

                     </p>
                     <p>But a person Elected cannot administer the Sacraments without Ordination; he cannot do it lawfully, it being cross to Scripture-Presidents, nor can he do it in the opinion of those Reverend men with whom we now dispute: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

If the whole essence of the Ministeriall Call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in Election, then it will follow, That a Minister is only a Minister to that particular charge to which he is called, and that he cannot act as a Minister in any other place.

Pos. 8. <hi>If you mean by Ministerial act, such an act of authority and power in dispensing of Gods Ordinances as a Minister doth perform to the Church whereunto he is called to be a Minister, then we deny that he can perform any Ministeriall act to any other Church but his own, because his Office extends no further then his Call:</hi> This is also confessed in the <hi>New-England Platform of Church-Discipline.</hi> And therefore we need not say more for the proof of the consequence.</p>
                     <p>But as for the minor, That a Minister can perform no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall act out of his own Congregation, is an assertion</p>

                        <note place="margin">Separation examined, pag. 62.</note> while M. <hi>Wilson</hi> Pastor of the Church of <hi>Boston</hi> was here in <hi>England,</hi> went to <hi>Boston</hi> and administred the Lords Supper to that Church; This surely was a Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall act, and M. <hi>Phillips</hi> acted herein as a Pastor to those that were out of his own Congregation. And if we may argue from our Brethrens practice we may safely conclude, That a Minister may act as a Minister out of his own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Contrary to Scripture; For the Scripture tels us,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is a Church generall visible as well as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church visible, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Ministers are primarily seated in the Church gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall visible, and but secondarily in this or that particular Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. Teachers are set by God in the same Church with the Apostles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. Pastors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are given by Christ for <hi>the perfecting of the Saints, and for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:30575:82"/>
the building of the body of Christ</hi> in general.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That every Minister hath a double relation, one to his particular Church, another to the Church general visible. And though he be actually to exercise his Ministry, especially over that charge where he is fixed, yet he hath a <hi>virtual</hi> and <hi>habitual</hi> power to preach as a Minister in any place where he shall be lawfully called. Therefore Ministers are spoken of in Scripture under a general notion, to shew the indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their Office. They are called <hi>Ministers of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.4. <hi>Ministers of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1. <hi>Ministers of the New Testament,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> 1 Thess. 3.2. and <hi>Ministers in the Lord,</hi> Ephes. 6.21. <hi>Embassadours for Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20. But never Ministers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Indeed they are for the people, but not of the people.</p>
                     <p>That a Minister is a Minister of the Church Catholick visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, appears thus: He that can ministerially admit or eject a Member into, or out of the Church-Catholick visible, is a Minister and Officer of the Church-Catholick visible: But every Minister, by Baptism or Excommunication admitteth or ejecteth Members into, or out of the Church-Catholick vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Argument is urged by <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <hi>A Minister chosen and set over one Society, is to look unto that people committed to his charge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But he is a Minister in the Church u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal. For as the Church is one, so is the Ministry one, of which every Minister (sound &amp; orthodox) doth hold his part. And though he is a Minister over that flock which he is to attend, yet he is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in the Church universal. The function or power of exercising that function in the abstract, must be distinguished from the power of exercising it concretely, according to the divers circumstances of places. The first belongeth to a Minister every where in the Church, the later is proper to the place and people where he doth minister.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30575:83"/>
The lawful use of the power is limited to that Congregation ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily; the power it self is not so bounded. In Ordination Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters are not restrained to one or other certain place, as if they were to be deemed Ministers there onely, though they be set over a certain people. And as the faithfull in respect of their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between them, must and ought to perform the offices of love one to another, though of different Societies; so the Ministers in respect of their communion, must and ought upon occasion to perform mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Offices toward the faithfull of distinct societies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And one more passage out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Rutherford</hi> in his peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able plea, <hi>pag.</hi> 263. <hi>Ordination</hi> (saith he) <hi>maketh a man a Pastor under Christ formally and essentially, the peoples consent and choice do not make him a Minister, but their Minister, the Minister of such a Church; he is indefinitely made a Pastor for the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, This Assertion, That a Minister can perform no Pastoral act out of his own Congregation, as it is contrary to the universal Church, to the practice of our Brethren themselves, to the holy Scriptures; so also it is contrary to sound reason. For hence it will follow,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That when a Minister preacheth in his own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Members of another Congregation, he doth not preach to them, nor they hear him preach as a Minister, but as a gifted Brother. And that at the same time he preacheth as a Minister by vertue of his Office to those of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and to others of another Congregation then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, onely as a gifted Brother <hi>ex officio charitatis generali,</hi> out of the general office of charity, which to us is very irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence it will follow, That when a Minister preacheth out of his own Congregation, he preacheth only as a private Christian, and not as an Ambassadour of Christ, and when he acts in a <hi>Synod,</hi> his actings are the actings of a private Christian, and when he preacheth a Lecture out of his own Congregation (though it be in a constant way) yet he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth only as a gifted Brother. Now what a wide door this will open to private men to preach publickly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30575:83"/>
in our Congregations, we leave it to any indifferent man to judge.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence it will follow, That when a Minister baptizeth a childe, he baptizeth him only into his own Congregation. For if he be not an Officer of the Catholick-Church, he cannot baptize into the Catholick-Church, which is directly contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Hence it will follow, That a Christian who by reason of the unfixednesse of his civil habitation, is not admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a particular Congregation, hath no way left him to have his children baptized, but they must all be left without the Church in Satans visible Kingdom, because they are no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Members, and (according to our Brethrens opinion) there is no extension of the Ministerial office beyond the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We adde, That according to this Assertion, there is no way left us by Christ for the baptizing of Heathens, when it shall please God to convert them to the Christian faith. We will suppose an hundred Heathens converted. We demand, by whom shall these be baptized? Not by a private Christian. This our Brethren abhorre as well as we. To baptize is an act o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Office, and can be done only by Officers. Not by a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: For a Minister (say they) cannot perform any Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral act (such as this is) out of his own Congregation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can these hundred converts choose a Minister, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by give him power to baptize them; for they must first be a Church before they have power to choose Officers, and a Church they cannot be till baptized. Neither can they joyn as Members to any other Church, and thereby be made capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Baptism by that Minister into whose Church they are admitted. For in the way of Christ a man must first be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized before he be capable of being outwardly and solemnly admitted as a Member of a particular Church. The three thousand were not first added to the Church, and then bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, but first baptized, and thereby added to the Church.<note place="margin">Act. 2.41.</note> We cannot conceive how such Heathen converts should regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly be baptized, unlesse it be granted, that every Minister
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:30575:84"/>
is a Minister of the Church-Catholick, and that every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hath an habitual, indefinite power to act as a Minister in any place of the world where he shall be lawfully called: That the desire of these hundred converts to be baptized is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient call to draw forth this habitual power into act, and that he may (being thus desired) according to the rules of the Gospel regularly and warrantably baptize them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Hence it will follow, That a Minister preaching out of his own Congregation, cannot lawfully and warrantably pronounce the blessing after his Sermon (which yet is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by our Brethren.) For to blesse the people from God is an act of Office, and to be done only by an Officer, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23, 24, 25, 26. compared with <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.5. where the same blessings and persons from whom they come are expresly mentioned) And so also <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.21. where under the name of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> to be continued under the Gospel, are meant <hi>Evangelical Pastors,</hi> who therefore are by Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to blesse the people, and they onely, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Hence it will also follow, That when a Minister of a particular Congregation is sick, or necessitated to be a long while absent upon just occasion, that all this while (though it should be for many years) the Congregation must be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, without having their children baptized, and without any Preacher that shall preach amongst them, as a Minister of Christ, but only in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a private Christian.</p>
                     <p>Neither can it be answered by our Brethren (as some of them do) that a Neighbour Minister (in such cases) may come in at the desire of the Congregation, and administer the Sacraments amongst them by vertue of Communion of Churches, unlesse they will also hold Communion of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which they do not. For these acts being acts of Office, cannot be done, unlesse there be an habitual, indefinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Ministerial Office, which by the desire of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is drawn out into act.</p>
                     <p>There are divers other absurdities that flow from this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Though we believe that every Minister is a Minister of the Universal Church, yet we are far from thinking, that he is actually an Universal Minister. The Apostles had the actual care of the Church Universal committed unto them, and wheresoever they came had actual power to perform all Ministerial Offices without the consent or call of particular
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:30575:85"/>
Churches. And besides they were not fixed to any particular charge, but were Ministers alike of all the Churches of Christ. But it is far otherwise with ordinary Ministers: They are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their particular Congregations, where they are bound by divine right to reside, and to be diligent in preaching to them <hi>in season and out of season.</hi> All that we say concerning their being Ministers of the Church universall, is, That they have power by their Ordination <hi>in actu primo</hi> (as M. <hi>Hudson</hi> saith) to administer the Ordinances of Christ in all the Churches of the Saints, yet not <hi>in actu secundo,</hi> without a speciall Call, which is farre differing from the Apostolicall power.</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> If a Minister may act as a Minister out of his own Congregation, why do you your selves ordain none but such as have a title to some particular charge?</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, We say in our Government, <hi>That it is agreeable to the Word of God, and very convenient, That they that are to be ordained be designed to some particular Church or Ministerial employment,</hi> not hereby limiting their Office, but the ordinary exercise of their Office. We distinguish between a Minister of Christ and a Minister of Christ in such a place, between the Office it self and the ordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>xercise of it to such or such a people; And yet notwithstanding we ordain none without a Title, thereby to prevent,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A vagrant and ambulatory Ministry; For we conceive it far more edifying for the people of God to live under a fixt Ministry.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A lazy and idle Ministry; For when men shall have an office, and no place actually to exercise it, this might in a little space fill the Church with unpreaching Ministers.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A begging and so a contemptible Ministry; For when Ministers want places they are oftentimes wholly destitute of means, and thereby come to great poverty, even to the very contempt of the office it self.</p>
                     <p>So much for the sixth Argument.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. If the whole essence of the Ministeriall Call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in Election without Ordination, then it will necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:30575:85"/>
follow, that when a Minister leaves, or is put from that particular charge to which he is called, that then he ceaseth to be a Minister, and becomes a private person, and that when he is elected to another place, he needs a new Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and so <hi>toties quoties,</hi> as often as he is elected so often he is to be ordained, which to us seems a very great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity.</p>
                     <p>That this consequence doth necessarily follow, is confessed by the Reverend Ministers of <hi>New-England</hi> in their <hi>Platform of Church-Discipline,</hi> where they say, <hi>He that is clearly loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from his Office-relation unto that Church whereof he was a Minister, cannot be looked upon as an Officer, nor perform any act of Office in any other Church, unlesse he be again orderly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto Office, which when it shall be, we know nothing to hinder, but Imposicion of hands also in his Ordination ought to be used towards him again; For so</hi> Paul <hi>the Apostle received Imposition of hands twice at least, from</hi> Ananias <hi>Act.</hi> 9.17. and <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3, 4.</p>
                     <p>But this seems to us to be a very great absurdity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to sound doctrine, which we prove,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because every Minister hath a double relation, one to the Church-Catholique indefinitely, another to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation over which he is set. And when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves from his particular Congregation, he ceaseth indeed to be a Minister of that place, but not from being a Minister of the Gospel; And when called to another he needs no new Ordination, no more (as M. <hi>Hudson</hi> well saith) <hi>then a Physician or Lawyer need a new License or Call to the Barre,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>though they remove to other places, and have other Patients and Clients.</hi> For Ordination is to the essence of the Ministeriall Office, and not only in reference to a particular place or charge. <hi>The Reverend Assembly of Divines in their Advice to the Parliament concerning Church-government,</hi> say, <hi>That there is one generall Church visible held forth in the New Testament, and that the Ministry was given by Iesus Christ to the génerall Church-visible, for the gathering and perfecting of it in this life, until his second coming</hi>; which they prove from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:30575:86"/>
12.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4, 5. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16. of the same Chapter. Now if Ministers be seated by Christ in the Church-Catholique as well as in their particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, then it followeth, That they have a relation as Ministers to the Church-Catholique, and though their relation to their particular Church ceaseth, yet their Ministeriall relation cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not, because they were Officers of the Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, and there doth still remain in them a power <hi>in actu primo</hi> to dispense all the Ordinances of Christ, though their Call <hi>ad actum secundum, sive exercitum pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> (as M. <hi>Hudson</hi> phraseth it) ceaseth. Even as every private Christian hath also a double relation, one to the Church generall, another to the particular place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is a member: And when he removes from his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, he doth not cease to be a member of the visible Church (for then his Baptism should cease, for every bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized person is a member of the Church) but only of that particular Church. And when he joyns with any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation he needs not to be baptized again, but is received by vertue of his former Baptism; So it is with a Minister of the Gospel: When he leaves his particular Congregation, he continueth still to be <hi>a</hi> Minister, though not <hi>their</hi> Minister, and needs no more to be ordained anew, then a private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to be baptized anew; because neither Ordination nor Baptism do stand in relation to the particular Congregation, but to the Church-Catholique.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If a Minister when he removes or is removed from his particular Congregation ceaseth to be a Minister, then it will follow,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That if the Church that called him prove hereticall, and wickedly separate from him, that then the sin of the people should nullifie the Office of the Minister; Or.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the Church refuse to give him competent mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and starve him out from them, or if the <hi>major</hi> part unjustly combine together to vote him out (for such pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er our brethren give to particular Churches) that then the covetousnesse and injustice of the people should make void

                     <p>Thirdly, Because there is no Scripture to warrant the ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Ordination in case of removall.

But there is no mention made of any command for reiterated Ordination, neither indeed can it be; For Ordination being a setting a man apart to the Office of the Ministry (as we shall hereafter prove) and not only to the exercise of it in such a place, though the local exercise should cease yet his Office still remains, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs not be reiterated;<note place="margin">Austin <hi>contra</hi> Parmenianum lib. 2. c. 13. <hi>De bono conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gali.

                     <p>

                        </gap> the Imposition of hands by <hi>Ananias</hi> upon <hi>Paul</hi> was for the consecration of him to the Office of an Apostle, and not rather for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of his sight, and for that only: The Text seems to hold out the last; Sure we are that <hi>Paul</hi> was baptized after this Imposition of hands; and it is not probable that he was outwardly and visibly ordained to his Apostolical Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Baptism.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Act.</hi> 13. M. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Survey <hi>par.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 83. saith expresly, That here is no Ordination to Office at all, for the Apostles had their Office before, and if so, then it makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for our <hi>New-England</hi> Brethren to prove an iterated Ordination unto the same Office. Of the like minde with M. <hi>Hooker</hi> is Learned <hi>Chamier,</hi> who saith, <hi>That before this Ordination</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>had preached and exercised the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:30575:87"/>
Offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e of their Apostleship; And therefore we doe not think</hi> (saith he) <hi>that this Imposition of hands was an Ordination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly unto any New Ecclesiasticall Function, but onely a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their sending to the Gentiles, to whom they were not yet professedly sent: For in that excursion of theirs unto</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och <hi>there is no mention made of the Gentiles, and that was a kinde of Prologue to that great work which now they were to put in full execution.</hi> The Text it self seems to give countenance to this Interpretation, because it saith, <hi>Separate me</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>for the work,</hi> &amp;c. not for the <hi>office</hi> but for the <hi>work</hi> whereunto I have called them; Called they were before, and designed by God to be Preachers to the Gentiles, and now they were publiquely inaugurated to that great and eminent service. <hi>Chrysostome, Theophylact,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> (as they are cited by <hi>Chamier</hi>) say, That this Imposition of hands was unto the Office of an Apostle: Thus <hi>Deodate, They laid their hands on them,</hi> that is, for a sign of Consecration unto the Office of an Apostle. But how can this be, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul</hi> himself tels us, that he was an Apostle, not <hi>of men,</hi> neither <hi>by men,</hi> but <hi>by Iesus Christ</hi> immediatly? and also when he was an Apostle (as <hi>Calvin</hi> saith) long before this time? And therefore we rather think, that this separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not unto the Apostolicall Office, but unto that great and (as <hi>Calvin</hi> cals it) now unusual work of preaching unto the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>But howsoever, whether this Imposition of hands were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Apostolicall Office, or only unto a peculiar work, it makes nothing for the proof of that for which it is brought, to wit, That an Officer loosed from his Office-relation, may be ordained again unto the same Office: For <hi>Paul</hi> was never loosed from his Office after he was once called unto it; If the Imposition of hands by <hi>Ananias</hi> were unto the Office of an Apostle, as we beleeve it was not, yet if it were, we then demand, Either this Ordination was afterward null and void, or remained firm and valid? If it alwaies remained firm, what need a new Ordination? If null and void, we desire a proof of it, which we are sure they cannot produce, and till that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:30575:87"/>
be done, this instance makes nothing for the proof of their assertion.</p>
                     <p>Besides all this, we adde, That this separation and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands was by the immediate appointment of the holy Ghost; The holy Ghost said, <hi>Separate me,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>They were sent forth by the holy Ghost</hi>; This was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing, and therefore not sufficient to ground an ordinary practice upon.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and lastly, If the whole essence of the Ministerial Call consisteth in popular Election, then will two other great absurdities follow.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That Ordination can in no case precede such Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>First, that Ordination can in no wise precede Election. Now though ordinarily no man is ordained in the Presbyterian way without a title to some ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rge, yet we conceive many cases may be put, in which Ordination may lawfully go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Election: We shall only give two Instances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When an ordained Minister removes upon warrantable grounds from one charge to another, the people to whom he removes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. When there is a necessity of sending men (as there is now in <hi>New-England</hi> for the conversion of Heathen people) we th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>k it very agreeable unto Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>-rules, that these men sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ld be first ordained before they be elected by the Heathen to whom they are sent. And the reason is because that the conversion of souls is the proper work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry: When Christ went up into heaven he left not only <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Evang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christs Name or in <hi>Christs stead to beseech people to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God,</hi> not only to build them up in grace when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, but to be instrumental to reconcile them, <hi>to open their eyes and to turn them from darknesse to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> &amp;c. We finde no place in Scripture to warrant a Church to send out gifted brethren without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination for the work of conversion; What may be done in extraordinary cases where Ordination cannot be had we dispute not; but where it may be had, there we conceive it most agreeable to the Word, that men should be first Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained before sent: Hereby they shall have a divine stamp upon them, they shall go with more authority, and shall have power to baptize those whom they do convert, which otherwise they cannot lawfully do: It is an unscriptural opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and of pernicious consequence that some amongst us have taken up, That a Minister should preach only for the building up of Saints, and not for the conversion of sinners, That when a Minister converts any out of his own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, he doth it not as a Minister but as a gifted brother; That the great work of conversion which is the chief work of a Minister, doth properly belong to gifted Brethren. All this ariseth from that groundlesse conceit, That a Minister is no Minister out of his own Congregation, which we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly disproved.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It will also follow, That there must be Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es before there be Ministers, which is against Scripture and sound reason: We do not deny but that there must be a Church before <hi>their</hi> Minister, but not before <hi>a</hi> Minister: The Church-Entitative is before the Church Ministerial, but yet a Minister must needs be before a Church: For every Church must consist of persons baptized (Unbaptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons cannot make a Church:) And therefore there must be a Minister to baptize them before they can be made capable to enter into Church-fellowship. Our Saviour Christ chose his Apostles for the gathering of Churches; There were first <hi>Apostles</hi> before Churches, and afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Apostles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Elders in these gathered Churches. And one great
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:30575:88"/>
work of these Elders was to convert the neighbouring Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and when converted to baptize them, and gather them into Churches; And therefore Elders as well as Apostles were before Churches: And whosoever with us holds (as our Brethren do) that none but a Minister in Office can ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, must needs hold that there must be ordinary Ministers before Churches, and that therefore the whole essence of the Ministeriall Call, doth not consist in the Election of the Church. So much for the proof of the second Proposition.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> We shall answer to this Argument according to the grounds formerly laid; <hi>That every Minister hath a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, one to the particular Church of which he is a Minister, the other to the Church universall:</hi> As to his relation to his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, it is very true, That Pastor and People are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and <hi>simul naturâ</hi>; He cannot be their Pastor but by their submission to his Ministry, and when he leaves them he ceaseth to be their Minister. But now besides this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular relation he hath a relation also to the Church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, and by his Ordination is invested (as we have said) with habituall power to act as a Minister beyond his particular Church when he is lawfully called thereunto; and as long as this correlative (the Church universall) lasteth, so long his ministeriall office lasteth, though his particular relation should cease. In a word, The people give being to a Minister as to be <hi>their</hi> Minister but not as to be <hi>a Minister.</hi>

<q>
                           <p>Arg. <hi>2.</hi> It is lawfull for a people to reject a Pastor upon just cause (if he prove pertinaciously scandalous in his life, or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall in his doctrine) and put him out of his Office, <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is in their power also to call him outwardly, and put him into his Office.</p>
                           <p>The consequence is proved from the staple rule, <hi>Ejusdem est instituere, &amp; destituere,</hi> He that hath power to invest hath power to devest.</p>
                           <p>The Antecedent is as certain by warrant from the Word, <hi>Mat. 7.15. Mat. 7.15.</hi> Beware of Wolves, <hi>Phil. 3.2.</hi> Beware of false Prophets.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> If by <hi>putting him out of his office</hi> be meant only a putting him from being <hi>their Officer,</hi> then the argument must be thus framed; They that have power to put out <hi>a</hi> Minister from being <hi>their</hi> Minister, have power to choose him to be <hi>their</hi> Minister; and this we deny not.</p>
                     <p>But if by putting him out of office be meant a putting him absolutely from being an Officer, we deny, that the people in this sense have power <hi>destituere,</hi> to put him out of office, or <hi>instituere,</hi> to put him into office: And we retort the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                     <p>They that have not power <hi>instituere</hi> have not power <hi>desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere</hi>; They that have not power to put a Minister into of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, have not power to put him out of office: But people (not being Officers) have not power to make an Officer, as hath been shewed; <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                     <p>That Symbolical Theology is not argumentative, <hi>Similia ad pompam non ad pugnam,</hi> Similitudes do beautifie not forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. There is nothing almost more dangerous in Divinity, then to overstretch similitudes, of which fault we believe our Brethren are much guilty. As for the Similitude it self, we conceive it will not hold. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If Minister and people be as man and wife, then it will follow that they may not separate till death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be in case of adultery. The Wife is as much bound to the Husband as the Husband to his Wife. But there are few people (if any) that think themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to abide with their Ministers till death. (It is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary even with men professing godlinesse to forsake their Minister, and that oftentimes upon worldly interest.) And there are few Ministers (if any) that think that they may in no case leave their people. There are three cases in which we conceive all agree, that a Minister may remove from his people; if he cannot have his health where he is, if he be denied competent mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and if the glory of God may be in an eminent manner advanced. But we hope that it will not be said that a Husband may separate from his Wife in these cases.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Similitude sounds ill. For it makes every Minister to be as a Husband to his Church, and so by consequence the Head of his Church, which complies too much with the Antichrist of <hi>Rome,</hi> who cals himself the Husband and Head of the Church. The Church hath no Husband but Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Similitude makes Christ to have as many Wives as there are particular Churches. Our Brethren hold, That
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:30575:90"/>
every particular Congregation is the Body of Christ, and the Spouse of Christ, which if it were true Christ should have as many Bodies and Spouses as there are particular Churches, which (we conceive) cannot be right. For it is as absurd to say, That one Head hath many Bodies, and one Husband many Wives, as to say, That one Body hath many Heads, and one Wife many Husbands.</p>
                     <p>But now we say, That the whole Church of Christ through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world is but one. That Christ properly hath but one Body, and one Wife. And that particular Churches are but members of this one Body, and limbs and members of this one Spouse, even as every particular Saint also is. And that every Minister hath a relation to this Church-Catholick as a member thereof, and seated therein, and as one that by his Ordination hath power to act as a Minister wheresoever he is (if called) for the good of the whole. And that he is placed in a particular Church for the actual and constant exercise of his Ministry, as in a part of Christs Body, or a limb or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Spouse. And that they by their choice make him <hi>their</hi> Minister, <hi>their</hi> Pastor, <hi>their</hi> Shepherd; but not <hi>a</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <hi>a</hi> Pastor, <hi>a</hi> Shepherd.</p>
                     <p>So much in answer to the Arguments against the second Proposition, and also concerning Election of Ministers.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. X. Concerning Ordination of Ministers, wherein the first Assertion about Ordination is proved: Namely, That Ordination of Ministers, is an Ordinance of Christ.</head>
                     <p>THat the method which we propounded in the beginning may not be forgotten, we crave leave to put the Reader in minde of what we have already said, That the Call of men to the Ministry, is either immediate or mediate. That the mediate Call is by Election and Ordination. And having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished what we thought fit to say about Election, we are now to proceed to speak about Ordination, concerning which we shall offer this general Proposition.</p>
                     <p>That the work of Ordination, that is to say, <hi>An outward solemn constituting and setting apart of persons to the Office of the Ministry, by prayer, fasting and imposition of hands of the Presbytery, is an Ordinance of Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the more methodical proving of this general Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, we shall undertake to make good these four Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                        <item>1. <hi>That Ordination of Ministers is an Ordinance of Christ.</hi>

                        <item>2. <hi>That the Essence of the Ministerial Call consisteth in Ordination.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>That Ordination ought to be with prayer, fasting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands.</hi>

                        <hi>That Ordination of Ministers is an Ordinance of Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                           <hi>Assert.</hi> 1.</note>For the understanding of this Assertion we must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:30575:91"/>
between the Substance, Essence, and Formal Act of Ordination, and the Rite used in Ordination. The Essential Act of Ordination, is the constituting or appointing of a man to be a Minister, or the sending of him with Power and Authority to preach the Gospel. The Rite is Imposition of hands. In this Assertion we are not at all to speak of Imposition of hands, but onely of Ordination, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the setting of a man apart to the Office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</p>
                     <p>Now that this is an Ordinance of Christ, we shall not need to spend much time in proving it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because we have already made this out in our third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, where we asserted,<note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> That no man ought to take upon him the Office of a Minister, but he that is lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ordained thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because the proving of the other three will prove this also.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because we have not so many enemies to contest withall in this, as in the other three Propositions. For though there be many that hold Ordination to be onely an adjunct of the Ministerial Call, and not an Essential ingredient, which is against the second Proposition. And many that deny Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands against the third. And many that say, that a Church without Officers may ordain against the fourth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. And though there be very many that hold, That an unordained man may preach as a gifted Brother, yet there are but few (in comparison) who say, That a man may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Office of the Ministry, and preach authoritatively as a Pastor, without Ordination.</p>
                     <p>Our Brethren in <hi>New-England,</hi> in their Plat-form of Church-Government say,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> That <hi>Church-officers are not only to be chosen by the Church, but also to be ordained by Imposition of hands and prayer,</hi> &amp;c. And in their Answer to the thirty two Questions, they say expresly, <hi>That Ordination is necessary by Divine Institution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The very <hi>Socinians</hi> themselves,<note place="margin">Socin. <hi>Tract. de Eccles.</hi>
                        </note> though great enemies to the Ministerial Calling (and no wonder, when such great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:30575:92"/>
to Christ himself) though they deny the necessity of Ordination,<note place="margin">Nicolaides <hi>de Ecclesia &amp; mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione Ministerii.</hi>
                        </note> yet they acknowledge that for order and decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it is fit to retain it in the Church. For our parts we think the Scripture to be so clear for the proof of this Assertion, that we wonder there should be any found to stand up in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position against it. For</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Levit. 8. Num. 8.</note>First, In the Old Testament not onely the high-Priest, but all the other Priests and Levites were by divine appointment inaugurated to their Ministerial Offices, and when any men unconsecrated intruded themselves into the Priestly or Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office they were remarkably punished by God himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Witnesse <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, of whom we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made mention.</p>
                     <p>Now surely this was <hi>written for our instruction upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> to teach us, that it is the will of Christ that no man should enter into the Ministerial Office un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained or unconsecrate. To hint this, the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> tels us, That in the times of the New Testament the Lord would take from among Christians <hi>some to be Priests,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esa. 66.21.</note> 
                        <hi>and some to be Levites,</hi> where the New Testament Ministers are cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Old Testament titles, and are called Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, not in reference to any real unbloudy and propitiatory Sacrifice by them to be offered, as the Papists falsly imagine, but as we conceive to signifie unto us, 1. That there should be an Office of the Ministry distinct from all other Offices unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the New Testament as well as under the Old (and therefore it is said, that God would take <hi>of them</hi> for Priests not take all them for Priests.) And, 2. That these Ministers were to be consecrated to their respective offices, as the Priests and Levites were.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In the New Testament we read,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That in the very choice of Deacons, which was but an inferiour Office and serving only for the distribution of the temporal estates of people, the Apostle requires, that they should not onely be elected by the people, but also ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this office. Much more ought this to be done in the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:30575:92"/>
choise of persons who are called to the work of preaching, and dispensing Sacramental mysteries, a service of all others of greatest weight and worth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That even the very Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> though chosen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by Christ unto the great Office of preaching unto the Gentiles, and that in a miraculous way,<note place="margin">Act. 13.1.2, 3, 4.</note> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it was the pleasure of the holy Ghost, that he must be separated and set apart by men for this great work. And if this was thought necessary for an extraordinary Officer: If <hi>Paul</hi> that was separated from his mothers womb to preach Christ to the Heathen,<note place="margin">Gal. 1, 15, 16. Act. 9.15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gal. 1.1.</note> and was separated by an <hi>immediate voice from Heaven to bear Christ's Name before the Gentiles,</hi> must also have an outward solemn separation by the Prophets at <hi>Antioch</hi> unto this work, how much more is this necessary in ordinary Officers?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> who were themselves separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the work of the Ministry, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1. <hi>went about,</hi> Act. 14.23. <hi>ordaining Elders in every Church.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifieth (as we have shewed) not a choosing by the suffrages of the people, but a special designing and appointing of Ministers by the Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That <hi>Titus</hi> was left at <hi>Crete</hi> to ordain Elders in every Church, which surely had been very vain and superfluous if Ordination be not an Institution of Christ, and necessary in his Church.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordained not only by the <hi>laying on of Pauls hands,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.6. 1 Tim. 4.14.</note> but also <hi>by the laying on of the hands of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</hi> By laying on of hands, as by a Synecdoche is meant the whole work of Ordination, and hence we see that it is the will of the holy Ghost that not only <hi>Paul</hi> an Apostle, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evangelist must be set apart unto his Office by Ordination.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded <hi>to lay hands suddenly on no man, neither to be partakers of other mens sin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>but to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pure.</hi> This negative command implies an affirmative, that it was his Office to lay on hands, that is, to ordain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:30575:93"/>
but his care must be not to do it rashly and unadvisedly upon men insufficient, lest he should thereby be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of other mens sins. This Text doth necessarily imply a precept for Ordination.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.2.</note>7. That <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded to <hi>commit those things which he had heard from Paul among many witnesses, to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also.</hi> Where we have, 1. A Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of some men to be teachers in Christs Church. 2. The Qualification of these teachers, they must be faithfull men, and such as are able to teach others. 3. We have an injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction laid upon <hi>Timothy</hi> that he should commit what he had heard of <hi>Paul</hi> unto these faithfull men. Now this <hi>committing</hi> was not only to be by way of instruction, but also by way of Ordination. <hi>Pauls</hi> charge committed to <hi>Timothy</hi> was not so much to make men fit to teach others, as by Ordination to set men apart for the teaching of others, that there might be a perpetual Succession of teachers. For the further making out of this truth, let the Reader consider what is said by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Gillespy</hi> in his <hi>Miscellany</hi> Questions, and what we have before said, <hi>pag.</hi> 84.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Heb. 6.1, 2.</note>8. That laying on of hands is reckoned not only as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Christ, but as one of the principles of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Christ: but of this Text we shall speak more in the third Assertion.</p>
                     <p>By all these places it is evident, That it is the will of Christ that those that enter into the Ministerial Calling should be consecrated, set apart and ordained thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Most of the Objections brought against this Assertion, have been answered at large in the handling of the third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
                     <p>If any shall further object and say,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. That these are but examples, and examples do not amount up to a Rule.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That Apostolical examples in things necessary for the good of the Church, and which have a perpetual reason and equity in them, have the force of a Rule. Of this nature is Ordination.</p>

                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:30575:93"/>2. If we should not follow the examples of the Apostles in those things in which they acted as ordinary Elders, we should be left at uncertainties, and every man might do what seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in his own eyes, which would tend to confusion, and the dissolution of the Church.</p>

                     <p>And thus (as the Authour fore-mentioned saith) <hi>The Apostles admitted men in their own practice into the Ministry, and thus they appointed for succeeding times, and can any think that Ordination ended with that age? Is there not the same cause,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:30575:94"/>
necessity, use and reason for it in after ages as in the first times of the Church, when there were as yet extraordinary gifts stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the Church which are now ceased, and therefore the more need of a standing Ministry?</hi> Sure we are of two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there are more, and more clear Texts for Ordination then for popular Election; Our Brethren in <hi>New-England</hi> and many in <hi>Old England</hi> are very much for Election by the people; And so are we if it be rightly ordered and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; But we desire them to shew us as clear Scriptures for Election, as we have done for Ordination.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That there is as much (if not more) in Scripture for the Justification of Ordination as for any other part of Church-Government, as for the divine right of Synods, of Excommunication, of Ruling Elders, or any other part of Discipline, in which we agree together. How then it should come to passe that many in our daies should cry up the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right of Election by the people, of Excommunication, and other parts of Church-government, and cry down the divine right of Ordination, we know not: Indeed we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, That the Papists do too much extoll it, calling it a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and not only a Sacrament in a generall sense, as <hi>Calvin</hi> seemeth to do, but a Sacrament in a proper sense, as Baptism and the Lords Supper are called Sacraments; And also in appropriating it to Bishops, as distinct from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Hence it may be it is, That some in our age running into the other extream (as the nature of man alwaies is apt to do) do too much vilifie and undervalue it, and because they like it not, brand it with the black mark (as they do other of the Ordinances of Christ) of Antichristian Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But we hope better things of our people, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech them to take heed of those that call <hi>good evil and evil good,</hi> and that call the Institutions of Christ the doctrines of Antichrist.</p>
                     <p>So much for the first Assertion.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That the essence of the Ministeriall Call doth properly consist in Ordination.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The contrary to this Assertion is maintained by many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Divines, who set up Election in the room of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make Ordination <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o be but an adjunct unto, and a consequent of this Ministeriall Call, and a confirmation of a man into that office which he hath bestowed upon him by his election. <hi>The essence and substance of the outward calling of an ordinary Officer in the Church</hi> (say the Ministers of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in their <hi>Platform of Church-Government) doth not consist in his Ordination, but in his voluntary and free Election by the Church, and in his accepting of that Election.</hi> In opposition to this we have already endeavoured at large to prove, <hi>That the essence of the Ministeriall Call doth not consist in popular Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And therefore we intend to be very brief in proving the contrary; That it doth consist in Ordination: This we make out by these ensuing arguments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If Election doth not give the essentials of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Office, then Ordination doth: For the outward Call of a Minister (as it is agreed on all sides) doth consist only in his Election or Ordination.</p>
                     <p>But Election doth not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we have formerly shewed by divers arguments. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Ordination doth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If Ordination makes a man a Minister that was not one before, then it gives the essence of the Ministeriall Office.</p>
                     <p>But Ordination makes a man a Minister that was not one before, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:30575:95"/>That this is so appears,</p>

Hence it is, That some Divines do very well define Ordination to be <hi>missio potestativa,</hi> A sending of a man forth with power and authority to preach and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the Sacraments. It is not an installing of a man into an office to which he hath right before, but it is a giving of him his Commission and authority; And of this kinde of sending is this Text to be understood. That it cannot be understood of providential sending we have formerly proved, nor of a sending by the Election of the people: For the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be sent to themselves, but Ministers are said to be sent to them. And we now further adde, That it cannot be understood only of an extraordinary mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by God, such as the Apostles had, which was to cease with the Apostles, but it must be understood of such an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative sending which was to continue to the end of the world: For the Apostle in that <hi>Climax</hi> of his makes it as necessary and perpetuall as calling upon the Name of the Lord, as Beleeving and Hearing the Word: For this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle affirmeth, That as calling upon the Name of the Lord is perpetually necessary to salvation, so is faith to the calling upon the Name of the Lord, and so is Hearing of the Word necessary to Beleeving, so is Preaching of the Word to Hearing, and so is Ordination and Mission necessary to the orderly Preaching of the Word. And therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That by <hi>sending</hi> is meant a sending by Ordination, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:30575:96"/>
that this sending is a deputation of a man to an Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Function with power and authority to perform the same, and that it is to last as long as Preaching, Beleeving, and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is to the end of the world.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But here we must of necessity adde one caution left we be mis-understood.</p>
                     <p>When we say that Ordination gives the Ministerial office, we mean onely as to the essence of the outward Call, For we know, That it is the Prerogative Royall of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus to appoint Officers and Offices in his Church. It is Christ onely that institutes the office, and that furnisheth and fitteth men with graces and abilities for the discharge of so great an employment, with willing and ready mindes to give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to so holy services: It is Christ onely that sets the Laws and Rules according to which they must act. All that man doth in Ordination is in a subordinate way as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument under Christ to give the being of an outward Call, and to constitute him an Officer according to the method prescribed by Christ in his Word. All that we say (that we may be rightly understood) may be reduced to these three heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is the will of Christ who is King of his Church, that men should be outwardly called to the Ministry as well as inwardly fitted. And that without this Call none can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably do any act that belongs to an Officer, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the specificall form of an Officer, and (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Hooker</hi> saith) <hi>Whatsoever is done without this,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Part. 2. Pag. 45.</note> 
                        <hi>is void and of none effect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That this outward Call consisteth in Election and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Ordination is that which gives the Being of this outward Call, that makes a man a Minister, That (in this sense) gives him his Ministeriall Office. Election doth only design the person, but it is Ordination that bestoweth the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. We might argue in the fifth place from the persons appointed by Christ to ordain, and from the great solemnity used in Ordination, and from the blame that is laid upon those that ordain unworthy persons unto the Ministerial Office.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:30575:97"/>1. The persons that are said in Scripture to ordain, are (as we shall prove hereafter) either Apostles, Prophets, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists or Presbyters. And this is a sufficient Argument to us to prove that it is Ordination that constitutes the Minister, and not Election. For it is not likely, that Christ would appoint his Apostles, and his Apostles appoint extraordinary and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Elders to convey onely an adjunct of the Ministerial Call, and leave the great work of conveying the Office-power unto the common people.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The solemnity used in Ordination, is Prayer, Fasting, and Imposition of hands. We do not reade the like solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty expressed in Scripture in Election, and therefore it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason to think, That Election should constitute the Minister, and give him all his Essentials, and Ordination only give him a ceremonial complement.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The blame laid upon <hi>Timothy if he should lay hands sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly upon any Minister,</hi> is very great. For hereby he makes himself impure, and becomes accessory to the sins of those whom he makes Ministers. Now we may thus reason, <hi>Where the greatest blame lies for unworthy men coming into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, surely there must lie the greatest power of admitting men into the Ministry, else the blame is not just. But the greatest blame is laid upon the Ministers. Ergo.</hi> If the constituting cause of the Ministerial Call did lie in Election.

Prayer and fasting, though they be not necessary to the very being and essence of Ordination, yet they are very necessary to the better being of it, as divine conduits to convey the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God upon it.</p>
                     <p>First, For Prayer. It is observable in the old Testament, that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons did not enter upon their Ministry, till they had been sanctified by the holy oyl, and sprinkling of bloud, and had been seven whole dayes before the Lord, abiding at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.33.</p>
                     <p>In the New Testament our blessed Saviour, when he chose his Apostles is said to have spent all the night before in prayer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.12, 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. And to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance we do not reade that our Saviour spent a whole night in prayer, but upon this occasion, which sheweth, of how great consequence it is, that those who preach the Gospel should be sent out with solemn and earnest prayer. And this is the more observable if we compare the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> 36, 37, 38. with <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12, 13, 14. When Christ saw the misery of the people in the want of faithful Ministers, that they were <hi>as Sheep not having a Shepherd,</hi> he directs them <hi>to pray to the Lord
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:30575:98"/>
of the harvest to send forth labourers into his harvest,</hi> and then as seemeth by <hi>Luke</hi>'s relation, he put that in practice which he commended to do for themselves, <hi>he spent the whole night in prayer,</hi> and then <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.1, 2. he <hi>chose and sent out his twelve Apostles to preach the Gospel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, For joyning of Fasting with prayer, we may consider, That it was not ordinary and common prayer, or some few and occasional Petitions that were put up, but as in c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ses of greatest concernment, when some great evil was to be averted, or some singular mercy to be obtained, fasting was joyned with prayer.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Acts,</hi> where you have the records of the Primitive Churches practice, as the best president for succeeding ages, it is recorded, that persons designed to the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, were set apart and commended to God for his assistance, support and successe by fasting and prayer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. It is said of the Prophets and Teachers of <hi>Antioch, As they ministred to the Lord, and fasted, the holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I have called them.</hi> And then when by a new fast, as it may seem purposely called upon that occasion, they had sought God on that behalf, <hi>they fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, and sent them away to preach.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as it was thus done to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> so when they had travelled farre in preaching the Gospel, and had found that happy successe on their Ministry, that many among the Gentiles were converted, because themselves could not make their constant abode in anyone place (the greater service of the Church calling them forth to other places) that there might be a foundation of a fixed Ministry, for the building up of those that were already converted, and for the bringing in of others yet uncalled. <hi>They ordained them Elders in every Church,</hi> which should stay with them, <hi>and watch over them in the Lord,</hi> Act. 14.23. And these they sent out with the like solemnity in seeking God by fasting and prayer, and then commended them to the Lord in whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:30575:99"/>The Reasons why Ministers should be set a part with prayer and fasting, are weighty, and still the same.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The inidoneousnesse and insufficiency of any meer man (though of the greatest abilities and indowments, whether for nature, art, or grace) for such a work wherein we have to do withthe highest mysteries of God and heaven, and with the most precious things on earth, the truths of God, and souls of men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The discouragements which every where attend this work (when most faithfully performed) from Satan and wicked men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The successe of every ones Ministry depends wholly on Gods blessing.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.7.</note> 
                        <hi>For neither is he that planteth any thing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.</hi> Nor doth the faith of believers depend at all on the wisdome or or power of the Minister, but on the power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5. And therefore it is necessary in the most solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that is, by prayer and fasting to implore aid from God whensoever we ordain Ministers. But this will be granted by all sides, and therefore we will adde no more about it.</p>
                     <p>The second thing we are to make out, is</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Ordination of Ministers ought to be with imposition of hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That we may more orderly handle this Assertion, which is so much controverted in our unhappy dayes, and be rightly understood, we shall crave leave to premise three things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Imposition of hands is not a proper Gospel-duty, never used but in the New Testament, but it is a Rite and Ceremony borrowed from the Old Testament, and by Christ made a Gospel-institution.<note place="margin">Annotat. upon Acts 11.3. <hi>Totum regimen Ecclesiarum Christi consor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum fuit ad Synagogarum exemplar.</hi>
                        </note> That which <hi>Grotius</hi> saith in his Annotations, <hi>That the whole Government of the Churches of Christ, was conformed to the patern of the Synagogues,</hi> is true in many things, and especially in this of Imposition of hands. We finde it was used in four cases under the Old Testament, 1. In benediction and blessing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.14, 20. 2. In offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:30575:99"/>
of Sacrifices unto God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.4.3. In bearing witness, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.14.4. In ordaining or appointing unto an Office. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> when he ordained <hi>Ioshua</hi> to succeed him, he was commanded by God to lay his hands upon him, and to give him a charge in the sight of the people, <hi>Num.</hi> 27.18, 23. Under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is used, 1. In benediction, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.16.2. In curing of bodily diseases, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.13. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17. 3. In conveying the miraculous gifts of the holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.17, 18. <hi>Act.</hi> 19.6. 4. In Ordination of Church-officers, and of this last way of Imposition of hands are we now to speak.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it is not our purpose accurately to enquire whether Imposition of hands be an Essential part of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which it is null and void, or an integral part, without which it is deficient and imperfect, or onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable adjunct. It is enough for us to assert, That it is lawfull and warrantable, and not onely so, but that it is the duty of all that are to ordain Ministers to lay hands upon them, and that it is a sin in any that is to be ordained, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That though we assert the Divine Right of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, yet we plead for it onely in a Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense, but not in a Popish-sense. The Papists make it to be an outward sign of an inward and spiritual grace. They make Ordination a Sacrament, and Imposition of hands an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive instrument of conveying not only grace in general, but even justifying grace. Hence it is that some few of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines speak a little too slightly of it (at which those that are enemies to it take much advantage) but yet there are no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches (that we know of) but do retain it and plead for it, some as a Rite and Circumstance, and moral sign; others as an integral part, and others as an essential part of Ordination.</p>
                     <p>These things premised, we come now to prove, That it is the will of Christ, that all that are ordained Ministers should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lave Imposition of hands. This appears</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the examples of this Ceremony used by the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:30575:100"/>
Apostles in Ordination, 1. We finde that the Deacons though inferiour Officers must have hands laid on them. 2. We finde that the Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> though extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers had hands layed on them. 3. We reade that <hi>Paul</hi> layed hands upon <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

Hence it is that <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, <hi>Though there be no certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept extant concerning Imposition of hands, yet because we see it was in perpetual use by the Apostles, that, their so accurate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation ought to be in stead of a precept to us.</hi> And it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to us that they that are so exact in urging every other circumstance in Church-Government, and have suffered much prejudice in their outward estate rather then they would forbear sitting at the Sacrament (which yet is but an outward gesture) should take such strange liberty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in dispensing with a duty that hath so many examples for the enforcing of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From that command of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Lay hands suddenly on no man.</hi> This is a divine precept for imposition of hands. For when <hi>Timothy</hi> is forbidden to lay hands suddenly, it is implied, that it was his duty to lay on hands.

                        </note> speaking of Imposition of hands) <hi>to be required in almost all confessions. And truly since that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles have alwayes used it, yea the Apostle gives a precept to Timothy, to lay hands suddenly on no man; we judge it ought not to be omitted, because in that negative commandment, an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative is included, that he should lay on hands upon men that are worthy, where because it is taken by a Synecdoche for the whole calling of a Pastor, certainly it is to be esteemed either
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:30575:100"/>
for a rite, or an essential part, otherwise it could not be taken for the whole, or at least for a proper adjunct, and common to this with all other callings.</hi> So far <hi>Walaeus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Because the whole work of Ordination is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under this Ceremony of Imposition of hands, 1 <hi>Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 4.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.12. Ordination is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Imposition of hands, and the gift or office of the Ministry is said to be given by this as by the sign, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. Now then, if Imposition of hands, as a part, be put for the whole work of Ordination, it seems very strange to us that there should be any amongst us that expresse a willingnesse to be ordained, and yet an unwillingness to have Imposition of hands. We rather judge, That they that refuse Imposition of hands, which is put for the whole, will in a little time make no conscience of refusing the whole it self. We reade in Scripture, That prayer and keeping the Sabbath are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put for the whole worship of God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Isa.</hi> 56.4. And as it is a good Argument, keeping of the Sabbath and prayer are put for the whole worship of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are parts of it, if not chief parts. So it is a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Imposition of hands is put for the whole work of Ordination, and therefore it is a part of it, if not a chief part. And we desire our people further to consider, that there is but one Text for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or lifting up of hands in the election of a Minister (and this also but a shadow without a substance, as we have proved) and yet how zealous are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongst us for popular Election? And why should not they be much more zealous for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or Imposition of hands, which hath so many substantial Texts for the justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and which is so often put for the whole work of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Because it is placed by the Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. amongst the principles of the doctrine of Christ, <hi>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God, of the doctrine of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:30575:101"/>
dead, and of eternall judgement.</hi> The great Question is, What is here meant by laying on of hands. The Papists understand it of the Sacrament of Confirmation: But it never hath nor ever will be sufficiently proved, that either there is such a Sacrament appointed by Christ, or that it was a custome in the Apostles daies to lay on hands, or (as was formerly phrased) to Bishop baptized Christians who were grown up to years of discretion; others by laying on of hands understand the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghost, which in these daies were given by laying on of hands. But this cannot be the meaning.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because it cannot be proved, that the gift of the holy Ghost was given with every laying on of hands in those times. For the laying on of hands, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. was not for giving the holy Ghost, but for Ordination.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because the giving of the holy Ghost by laying on of hands was proper to the Primitive age, and doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern after ages; But the Catechetical heads enumerated by the Apostle concern all ages.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because it would be hard to think, that the knowledge or profession of the doctrine concerning the giving of the holy Ghost by such laying on of hands, was such a principle as that none ignorant thereof, though instructed in all the other Articles of Christian faith, could be received as a Church-member, and as one grounded in Catechisticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                     <p>And therefore by laying on of hands, as by a Synecdoche, we suppose is meant the whole Ministry. Thus D. <hi>Ames</hi> in his Confutation of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bellarminus enervatus,</hi> tom. 2. pag. 76.</note> By laying on of hands (saith he) is here meant <hi>Totum Ministerium,</hi> the whole Ministry. <hi>Bullinger</hi> on the place, By laying on of hands, understandeth also the Ministry and their Vocation, Mission, and Authority given them. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Survey of Church-Discipline, <hi>par.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 1. <hi>By laying on of hands as by a Metonymy of the adjunct,</hi> understandeth <hi>Ordination, and Ordination as one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is put</hi> (saith he) <hi>for the whole of Church-Discipline.</hi> And from this very Text he undertakes to prove Church-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:30575:101"/>
to be a fundamentall point of Religion: But we may more safely and more rationally assert the same of the Church-Ministry: For whosoever denieth a Ministry over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth all Gospel-Ordinances and Gospel-Churches. And here we will make bold to put our people in minde of a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Confutation of the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> who was a man sufficiently opposite to the Bishops and their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yet he is pleased to use these words upon this Text. <hi>By Imposition of hands the Apostle meaneth no Sacrament, much lesse Confirmation after Baptism, but by a Trope and borrowed Speech the Ministry of the Church upon the which hands were laid, which appeareth in that whosoever beleeveth, that there ought not to be a Ministry by order to teach and govern the Church, overthroweth Christianity; whereas if Confirmation of Children were a Sacrament as it is not, yet a man holding the rest, and denying the use of it, might notwithstanding be saved.</hi> So <hi>Cartwright.</hi> Now then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If Imposition of hands be taken in Scripture not only for the whole work of Ordination, but also for the whole Ministry; We may (we hope) safely and convincingly conclude, That it is the will of Jesus Christ, that they that enter into the Ministry should have hands laid upon them: And that they that oppose Imposition of hands may as well oppose the whole Gospel-Ministry, and therein over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Christianity it self.</p>
                     <p>We will not trouble the Reader with answering all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that are brought against this <hi>Thesis,</hi> but only such as seem to carry most weight in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 1. We do not reade that the Apostles were made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters with Imposition of hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. No more do we reade that they were made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters by the Election of the people; This objection fights as much against Election as against Imposition of hands.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A negative argument from Scripture doth not hold in matters of this nature; It doth not follow, because it is not recorded, therefore it was not done. Many things were done by Christ which are not written; It is said, That Christ or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained twelve, but after what manner is not set down.</p>

                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:30575:102"/>3. The Apostles were extraordinary Officers, and had an extraordinary Call. Our <hi>Thesis</hi> is of ordinary Officers; They that oppose this Assertion must prove, that ordinary Officers were made without Imposition of hands, or else they prove nothing to the purpose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. When the Apostle left <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain Elders in <hi>Crete,</hi> he saies not a word of Imposition of hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Nor a word of Election by the people.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Apostle left him to ordain Elders as he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him. Now it is irrationall to think that he would appoint <hi>Titus</hi> to do otherwise then according to what he himself practised. He ordained Deacons, Elders, and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> by laying on of hands: And therefore it is without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to us, That he appointed <hi>Titus</hi> to do so also.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If we compare <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. with <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3, 5. it will appear, That by appointing or ordaining Elders in <hi>Crete,</hi> is meant, ordaining by Imposition of hands: For there is the same word in both, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Imposition of hands was used by the Apostles only for the present occasion, as other things were observed, as bloud was forbidden, as <hi>Paul</hi> used circumcision and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Jews sake who had their publique Officers thus set apart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. No circumstance of any one Text where Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands is mentioned to be used, gives ground for sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this to be the reason of its practise.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This was not only practised at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> but at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and not only among and by the Jews, but elsewhere, and by others. It is said of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> that they ordained Elders in every Church.</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Imposition of hands was used by the Apostles in a miraculous way, and it did conferre the holy Ghost and gift of Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore as the miracle is ceased, so ought the ceremony to cease.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The giving of the holy Ghost and conferring of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:30575:102"/>
extraordinary gifts was one, but not the only use which the Apostles made of Imposition of hands. And as praier is still to be continued in the Church, though it did sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh extraordinary blessings, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15, 16, 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.40. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.14, 15. because it had other ordinary ends and uses; So is Imposition of hands to be continued upon the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. We never read of the holy Ghost given by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands in Ordination: That gift which <hi>Timothy</hi> received by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, is no other then the gift of Office. Neglect not the gift, <hi>i. e.</hi> Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect not the office. If <hi>Timothy</hi> had had power by laying on of hands to have conferred due qualifications for the Ministry; why doth <hi>Paul</hi> require him <hi>to lay hands suddenly on no man?</hi> and why must he be so carefull to see them first fit, in case his laying on of hands would fit them? There needed not such triall of their gifts, in case a touch of his hands could have gifted them. This proves clearly, That there was no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gift conferred in Ordination.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is a double Imposition of hands, <hi>The one mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and extraordinary,</hi> which consisted in healing the sick, and conveighing the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. And this was temporary and is now ceased as extream Unction is; <hi>The other is ordinary,</hi> Such is the Imposition of hands in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and therefore to be perpetually continued in the Church. We reade not only that <hi>Paul</hi> who was an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Officer, but that Presbyters who were ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers imposed hands upon <hi>Timothy.</hi> And the example of the Primitive Churches were intentionally left upon record for this end, that they might be binding patterns in like cases in after ages. And this seems to be one singular ground and reason of the Writing of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, <hi>That the Apostles acts in the Primitive Churches might be our Rules in succeeding ages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. To what purpose then is Imposition of hands used, if the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghost be not conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:30575:103"/>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We use it, because the Apostles did use it in an ordinary way without giving the holy Ghost, as well as in an extraordinary way, because there is the same standing reason, and because the Apostle bids us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Sufficit pro uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versis rationibus, Deus vult.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We use it not as an operative Ceremony, but as a Moral sign, so declare publickly who the party is that is solemnly set apart to the work of the Ministry.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We use it as it is a Rite and Ceremony by which the Office is conveyed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We use it as it is a consecrating, dedicating and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the party unto the Lord and his service, as in the Old Testament hands were laid on for this end.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We use it as it is an Authoritative and Ministerial Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the party ordained, as it was used by <hi>Iacob</hi> in his fatherly blessing of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasses,</hi> and by Christ in his blessing and praying over the little children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.16.</p>
                     <p>And thus we have made out the Divine Right of Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, and our Exhortation to our people is, That they would not stumble at that way of Ordination which hath so much of God in it, nor be easily led aside into by-pathes by the seducers of this Age. And that they would not rest contented with Ministerial Examination (though that ought to be, and that in all exactnesse) nor with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial approbation, nor yet with Authoritative Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without this Apostolicall Ordinance of Imposition of hands.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Supposing that there is such an Officer in the Church (for the proof of which we referre the Reader to our Vindication) We answer, That the power of ordering of the whole work of Ordination belongs to the whole Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:30575:104"/>
that is, to the Teaching and Ruling Elders. But Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands is to be alwayes by Preaching Presbyters, and the rather, because it is accompanied with Prayer and Exhortation, both before, in, and after, which is the proper work of the Teaching Elder.</p>

                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. Whether may one Preaching Presbyter lay on hands without the assistance of other Ministers?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Imposition of hands ought to be performed not by one single Presbyter, but by a combination of preaching Presbyters. In the Ordination of Deacons, not one Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle alone, but a company of them laid on hands, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.6. When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were separated unto the work whereunto they were called by God, the Prophets and Teachers joyned together in laying on of hands. It is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that in all the Texts where mention is made of Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is joyned with <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the Plural, not with <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the Singular or Dual Number, and so there must of necessity be more then one Imposer of hands. <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordained by the Imposition not onely of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, but also of the Presbytery. And therefore when we reade that <hi>Timothy</hi> is enjoyned <hi>to lay hands suddenly on no man,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> left in <hi>Crete to ordain Elders,</hi> we must not imagine that they were indued thereby with the sole power of Ordination. For surely the Apostle would not require <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> to do that which he himself would not do. If <hi>Paul</hi> with the Presbytery laid hands upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> then no doubt <hi>Timothy</hi> was also, together with other Presbyters, to lay hands upon those whom he should ordain. The naming of one doth not exclude others, especially if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Titus</hi> was left to ordain Elders, as <hi>Paul</hi> had appointed him. Now it is without all peradventure, that <hi>Paul</hi> did appoint him to do according as he himself pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Answer to this Question, is that which we espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially aim at in this our fourth Assertion, and wherein we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:30575:105"/>
most of all to satisfie the expectation of the Reader. For this end we shall offer this Proposition in Answer to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Ordination of Ministers doth belong to Church-Officers, and not to a Church without Officers.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Prop.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>And that Ordination by people without Ministers is a perverting of the Ordinance, and of no more force then Baptism by a Midwife, or consecration of the Lords Supper by a person out of Office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the proof of this we might argue from what is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Jewish Writers, concerning the custom of creating men members of their great Council or <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi> When <hi>Moses</hi> by Gods appointment assumed the seventy Elders to assist him in Government, and part of his spirit was by God put upon them, this was done saith <hi>Maimonides Sanhedr. cap.</hi> 4. by <hi>Moses</hi> laying hands upon them. And at length before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of this life, when a successour was to be provided for him, <hi>God commands him to take Ioshua, and lay his hand upon him,</hi> &amp;c. and accordingly it was done, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.18. And so for those seventy Elders, it is certain from the Jewish Writers, that the succession of these was continued through all Ages, by their creating others in the place of those that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Ceremony of Imposition of hands. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose are the clear words of <hi>Maimonides, Moses our Master created the seventy Elders by Imposition of hands, and the divine Majesty rested on them, and those Elders imposed hands on others, and others on others. And they were found created untill the house of judgement of Ioshua, and unto the house of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Moses:</hi> that is, from time to time ascending to the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> in <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s and <hi>Moses</hi>'s time. <hi>Petrus Cunaeus de Rep. Hebrae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

So Moses laid his hand upon Ioshua, and the seventy Elders, which solemnity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed, presently a divine Spirit from above fell down upon them, and filled their brests. And these being thus initiated themselves, admitted others after the same way.</hi> The same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour tels us also out of <hi>Maimonides</hi> of a constitution made,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:30575:105"/>
                        <hi>That no man should after such a time use Imposition of hands, but by grant from Rabbi</hi> Hillel <hi>that divine old man, who was Prince of the great Council; and how afterwards it came to cease: And what care was taken by</hi> Juda <hi>the son of</hi> Baba <hi>to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and uphold it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But because these things are not recorded in Scripture, we shall wave all such way of arguing, and rather dispute,</p>
                     <p>First, From the constant practice of the Church of Christ, as it is set down in the Apostolical Writings. We challenge any man to shew any one Text in all the New Testament for the justification of popular Ordination. We reade of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. And by Prophets and Teachers, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. And by Evangelists, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. And by a Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. But for Ordination by the people we meet not at all with it. And without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, If Ordination be an Ordinance of Christ, it is to be managed according to the will of Christ, and that is by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and not by the community of believers. May we not say to such Churches that usurp upon this work, as it is said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.23. <hi>By what Authority do you these things? And who gave you this Authority?</hi> Shew us your warrant out of the Word? We reade indeed of <hi>Ordination in Churches,</hi> Act. 18.23. and in Cities, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. but no where of <hi>Ordination by Churches,</hi> or by Cities, taking them for believers without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. We adde</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That Ordination by the people is not onely not written in Scripture, but it is against the Scripture. For to what end and purpose should Jesus Christ appoint Officers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and ordinary for the doing of that work which the people themselves may do? To what purpose did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> go from place to place to ordain Elders? Why was <hi>Titus</hi> left in <hi>Crete</hi> to appoint Elders in every City? Might not the people say, What need <hi>Paul</hi> leave <hi>Titus</hi> to do that which we can do our selves? <hi>Frastra <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>it per plura,</hi> &amp;c. If this Doctrine were true, the Apostles needed only to have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and to have converted the people to the faith, and when they had done to have said, <hi>We have now done our work, you
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:30575:106"/>
may now elect and ordain your Officers your selves, the power to do these things belongs to you.</hi> But the Apostles did quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and therefore certainly Ordination is not the peoples, but the Ministers Office.</p>
                     <p>Adde thirdly, that which to us seems to be of weight, That all that is written in the Epistles concerning the Ordainers and the qualification of the ordained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is all written in the Epistles unto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> who were Church-Officers. In the other Epistles which were written unto the Churches, there is no mention made of these things, which doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly prove unto us, That the work of Ordination is a work belonging to Ministers, and not to the people.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, We might argue from the nature of Ordination. It is a <hi>potestative and authoritative mission.</hi> It is an eminent act of Jurisdiction, not onely confirming a Minister in that Office which he had before by Election, but conveying the very Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-power of preaching and administring the Sacraments. It is that (as we have said) which gives the essentials of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Call. And therefore by the rule of the Gospel it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Officers, and not to private persons. The Scripture doth accurately distinguish between Church-Rulers and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17, 24. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12. Private persons can with no more lawfulnesse convey power to another, to administer the Sacraments, then they can themselves lawfully administer the Sacraments. Church-power is first seated in Christ the head, and from him committed to the Apostles, and from them to Church-Officers. And they alone who have received it from the Apostles can derive and transmit it to other Ministers. And though we freely confesse, That all Church-power is in the people, <hi>finaliter &amp; objective,</hi> that is, for their use and benefit, according to that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>All things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, all are yours,</hi> i.e. <hi>for your service and salvation</hi>; yet we are farre from thinking that all things are theirs formally and originally, that is, of their making and authorizing. Or that they that are not Ministers themselves can derive the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Office to others. This we beleeve to be both against Scripture and reason.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:30575:106"/>The serious consideration of these things is of marvellous concernment for the people of our age upon this one account especially, because there are a generation of men risen up amongst us, that renounce and disclaim all Ordination from Ministers, as unwarrantable and Antichristian, and take it up from the people as the only way of the Gospel, herein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting amongst many other these three evils.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In renouncing the Ordinance of Christ, and calling that which is truly Christian, Antichristian.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In setting up a new way of Ordination, which hath not the least footing in the New Testament, or in all Antiquity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In plunging themselves into this inextricable difficulty; for he that renounceth Ordination by Ministers as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, must of necessity renounce not only our present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, but all the Ministers and Churches in the Christian world, he must turn Seeker, and forsake all Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as some in our unhappy dayes do. For all Ordination by the people is null and void, as being not only not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Scripture, but against Scripture. And to intrude into the Ministerial Office without Ordination, is as the sinne of <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, as we have formerly shewed. Our desire is that these particulars may be duly weighed by all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Christians.</p>
                     <p>It will not be amiss here to consider what is said against this <hi>Thesis</hi> by the Elders of <hi>New-England.</hi> In four things they agree with us,

                              <item>4.That where there are no Elders, if the Church so desire, Imposition of hands may be performed by the Elders of other Churches.</item>
                           </list>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they differ from what we have asserted, when they say,</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>In such Churches where there are no Elders, Imposition of hands may be performed by some of the Brethren chosen by the Church thereunto. For the proof of this they bring a Reason and a Scripture.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:30575:107"/>
                        <q>
                           <hi>The Reason is,</hi> If the people may elect Officers, which is the greater, and wherein the substance of the Office consists, they may much more (occasion, and need so requiring) impose hands in Ordination, which is the lesse, and but the accomplishment of the other.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If this Argument were valid, it would follow that people might ordain their own Ministers, not only when they want Elders, but when they have Elders. For if Election give the <hi>essence</hi> to a Minister, and Ordination only an <hi>adjunct,</hi> we see no reason why they that give the <hi>essence,</hi> should not also give the <hi>adjunct</hi>; And why an <hi>adjunct</hi> should belong to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in that Church, to whom the <hi>essence</hi> doth not belong. But</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We say, That Scripture-light being Judge, Election is not the greater, and Ordination the lesse. It is possible that it is upon this ground that some men have made so slight of Ordination, that so they might entitle the people thereunto. But we have abundantly shewed, 1. That <hi>Election</hi> doth not give the <hi>essence</hi> of the <hi>Ministerial Call.</hi> That <hi>Election</hi> is only the <hi>designation</hi> of the person that is to be made a <hi>Minister,</hi> not the making of him a <hi>Minister.</hi> 2. That <hi>Ordination</hi> is that which gives the <hi>essence.</hi> That it is an <hi>Authoritative appointing</hi> of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the Ministry, and an <hi>actual investing</hi> him into the office. That it is held forth in the Scripture as the greater, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not given to one and the same persons, but this later re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the more honourable persons, as appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3, 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.</p>
                     <p>The Text they quote in the Margine for the proof of this, is not out of the New Testament but the Old, out of <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites: And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord, for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This Text doth not prove that for which it is brought, but makes rather against our Brethren. For they say, That where there are Elders, Imposition of hands is to be by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not by the people, but in case of want of Elders. But here <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons were present. And if it proves
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:30575:107"/>
any thing, it proves that the people may ordain where there are Elders, which our Brethren will in no case consent unto.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were commanded by God immediately to lay on hands upon the Levites. But in the New Testament, we meet with no such command laid upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We reade that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the Presbytery are to lay on hands, but not a word of command for the people, but rather against it, as we have shewed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When it is said, That the children of <hi>Israel</hi> laid on hands, it is not imaginable that all the <hi>Israelites</hi> did put on hands, but it was done by some chief of them in the name of the rest. And as <hi>Ainsworth</hi> observes, <hi>It was done by the first-born: For the first-born was sanctified and consecrated unto the Lord,</hi> Exo. 13.1. <hi>Because the Lord when he destroyed the first-born in Egypt, spared the first-born of the Israelites, therefore he challengeth a right in all their first-born, and they were to be given to him. And now the Levites were taken by God in stead of the first-born, as appears</hi> Numb. 8.16, 17. <hi>And hence it was that the children of Israel, that is, the first-born of Israel, were to lay on hands upon them, for the Levites gave an atonement for them, and were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up unto the Lord in their stead, and as the Rabbins say, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very first-born laid on hands on the Levite that was for him.</hi> Which if it be so, will afford us two other answers to this text.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the children of <hi>Israel</hi> had not onely a special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but a special reason also for what they did. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this example cannot be made a patern for New Testament practice.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That this laying on of hands upon the Levites, was not for them to set them apart for the service of the Lord, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a setting them apart for a Sacrifice unto the Lord. It was the command of God that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> must put their hands upon the Sacrifices they did offer unto the Lord. The Levites were now to be waved or offered before the Lord for an offering of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to be offered in stead of the first-born. And therefore the first-born did put their hands upon them as their propitiation and atonement.</p>
                     <p>It is very observable, That notwithstanding this Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:30575:108"/>
of hands, the Levites were not thereupon invested into their office, and made able immediatly to execute it. But <hi>Aaron</hi> the Priest was to wave them before the Lord for a wave-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that they might execute the service of the Lord.</hi> It was <hi>Aarons</hi> waving of the Levites, and separating them from among the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that did constitute and make them Church-officers.</p>
                     <p>And thus at last we have put an end to our first part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Divine Right of the Gospel-Ministry,</hi> and have, as we hope, sufficiently cleared to the consciences of our people, <hi>That there is such an Office as the Office of the Ministry perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be continued in the Church of Christ. That no man ought to take upon him either the Office or the Work of the Ministry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he be lawfully ordained thereunto. That Ordination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters is an Ordinance of Christ, and ought to be by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>We cannot but expect to meet with many Adversaries that will oppose what we have here written. Some will deny the very <hi>Office</hi> of the Ministry. Others will grant that there was such an <hi>Office</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> dayes, but will say that it is <hi>now quite lost.</hi> Some will grant that the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Ministry</hi> is perpetually necessary, but will adde, That it is lawfull for all men gifted, to enter upon the publick work of the Ministry, though they be not called and ordained thereunto. Some are for an <hi>immediate and extraordinary Call</hi> to the Ministry. Some will deny all <hi>Ordination of Ministers.</hi> Others will grant <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> but deny <hi>Imposition of hands.</hi> Others will grant <hi>Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands,</hi> but say, That it ought to be done by <hi>private Church-members,</hi> and not by the <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this it appears that our Adversaries differ as much one from another, as they do from us. And therefore we need not be much afraid of their opposition, for in writing against us they will be necessitated also to write one against another.</p>
                     <p>It is, we confesse, <hi>a great lamentation, and shall be for a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi> that there should be such differences and divisions amongst <hi>Christians,</hi> and especially amongst those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the <hi>Protestant Reformed Religion,</hi> and have made a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

This is our <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi> this is the <hi>success</hi> we pray for.</p>
                     <p>We have been necessitated to make frequent mention of <hi>A Platform of Church-Discipline,</hi> agreed upon by the Elders and Messengers of the Churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> and have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed our dissent from some things therein contained. But we desire the Reader to take notice,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That in the Preface to this Platform they assure us of their hearty consent to the whole Confession of Faith (for substance of Doctrine) which the Reverend Assembly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Parliament; and tell us of an unanimous vote of a Synod at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> 1648. which passed in these words, <hi>This Synod having perused and considered (with much gladnesse of heart, and thankefulness to God) the Confession of Faith pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished of late by the Reverend Assembly in</hi> England, <hi>do judge i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> to be very holy, orthodox and judicious in all matters of Faith, and do therefore freely and fully consent thereunto, for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance thereof,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And do therefore think it meet, that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, should be commended to the Churches of Christ amongst us, and to the honoured Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as worthy of their due consideration and acceptance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That as we agree wholly in the same <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> so also we agree in many things of greatest concernment in the matter of <hi>Church-Discipline.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That those things wherein we differ are not of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, as to cause a schism between us, either in worship, or in love and affection. Our debates with them are (as it was said of the disputes of the ancient Fathers one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about lesser differences) not <hi>contentiones,</hi> but <hi>collationes.</hi>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:30575:109"/>
We can truly say (as our Brethren do in the fore-named Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face) <hi>That it is far from us so to attest the Discipline of Christ, as to detest the Disciples of Christ; so to contend for the seamless coat of Christ, as to crucifie the living members of Christ; So to divide our selves about Church-communion, as through breaches to open a wide gap for a deluge of Antichristian and prophane ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity to swallow up both Church and Civil State.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The main intendment and chief drift of this our underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, hath been, to oppose those that say, <hi>That there is no such Office as the Office of the Ministry</hi>; or, <hi>That this Office is quite lost</hi>; or, <hi>That every man that thinks himself gifted, may intrude into the Ministerial Office.</hi> These opinions we judge <hi>destructive to Christian Religion,</hi> and an <hi>in-let to Popery and all errour, to all disorder and confusion, and at last to all profaneness and Atheism.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:30575:113"/>
pluck us out of his right hand; That even <hi>Ieroboam's</hi> hand (though a King) shall wither, if he stretch it out against a true Prophet of the Lord; That we are a plant of Gods planting, and therefore shall not be rooted up: Therefore it is that we have undertaken this work.</p>
                  <p>The Thesis we shall lay down is this,
<q>That the Ministers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that now are, and have been since the reformation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are lawfully called to their Office, so as they need not renounce their Ordination; nor have their people any just ground of separation from them in that respect.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The present Ministers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are of two sorts, either such as have been made Ministers since the abolishing of Prelacy by the imposition of the hands of preaching Presbyters; or such as were ordained heretofore by the laying on of the hands of the Bishop, together with other Ministers. And there are two sorts of Dissenters amongst us. There are some that dislike our present way of Ordination, and say it is invalid, because performed by Ministers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Bishop. There are others dislike our former way of Ordination, and say it is null, and of no validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, because we were made by Antichristian Bishops. One side deny our Ministry to be of God, because we want Bshops to Ordain us: The other side deny our Ministry to be of God, because we had once Bishops to Ordain us. And thus is the present Ministry like Jesus Christ himself crucified between two opposite parties. But as Christ, though crucified, yet rose again and is ascended up into heaven: So we doubt
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:30575:113"/>
not but the Ministers of Christ, though they prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in sackcloth for the present, and may perhaps <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In opposition to these two sorts of Dissenters, we shall lay down these two Propositions:</p>

                  <p>That there are true Churches in <hi>England,</hi> and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence true Ministers, appears further.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where there are a company of visible Saints meeting constantly together in publike, to worship God according to his own way prescribed in his Word for the substance of it, there are (according to these mens opinion) a true Church, and a true Church-state, and a true Ministry.</p>
                  <p>But during the prevalency of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> there were in our Congregations companies of visible Saints meeting together, to worship God according to his own way, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Word for the substance of it;</p>

                  <p>We acknowledge no such Church Covenant as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Scripture distinct from the Covenant of grace.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Supposing, but not granting, that a Church-Covenant is necessary to the being of a Church, yet we desire that our Brethren in <hi>New-England</hi> may be heard pleading for us.</p>

An implicite Covevant is when in their practise they do that whereby they make themselves ingaged to walk in such a Society, according to such Rules of Government, which are exercised amongst them, and so submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereunto, but do not make any verbal profession thereof.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thus the people in the Parishes in England, when there is a Minister put upon them by the Patron or Bishop, they constantly hold them to the fellowship of the people in such a place, attend all the Ordinances there used, and the Dispensations of the Minister so imposed upon them, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thereunto &amp;c.

and therefore no true Churches of Christ, and so by consequence have no true Ministry.</p>
                  <p>There is much opposition in our dayes against distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing of Congregations by local bounds,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi>
                     </note> and much endeavour to break this bond asunder, and to leave people at liberty to joyn (notwithstanding their dwellings) with what Church they please, &amp; with no Churches if they please; and most People speak of Parochial Churches in a most contemptible way, as of so many cages of unclean Birds, and of Parochiall Ministers, as of so many Parish Priests: But we hope this ariseth not so much out of Malice, and from a spirit of opposition, as from a misunderstanding of our judgement concerning Parochial Congregations. We will therefore briefly declare what we do not hold, and what we do hold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We do not say That the bare dwelling in a Parish is sufficient to make a man a member of the Church of Christ within that Parish. A <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Idolater</hi> may be within the bounds of a Parish, and yet we do not hold him a member of the Church in that Parish.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We do not say, That all that dwell in a Parish, and that joyn constantly in hearing of the word of God therein Preached, should upon that account be admitted to the Lords Table. We heartily desire, and sincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep all Ignorant and Scandalous People from the Sacrament although they dwell within the same bounds with those that are admitted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We do not allow, but much dislike the unequal divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Parishes, and we heartily desire a redresse herein.</p>
                  <p>But we say.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is most expedient for edification, and most agreeable to the Evangelical pattern, that Congregations should be distinguished by the respective bounds of their dwellings. Thus all the Christians in <hi>Corinth</hi> did belong to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and all the Believers in <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sus,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> The Churches in the New Testament are distinguished one from another by the places
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30575:118"/>
where the believers dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. As the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> from the Church at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> And we do not read of any of one Town member of a Church in another Town distinct from it.</p>
                  <p>The Reverend Assembly gave 3. reasons for the proof of this Assertion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because they who dwell together, being bound to all kind of Moral duties one to another,<note place="margin">Deut. 15.7.11. Matth.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  <p n="2">2. The Communion of Saints must be so ordered, as may stand with the most convenient use of the Ordinances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 2.4.</note> and discharge of Morall duties without respect of persons, 1 Cor. 14.26. <hi>Let all things be done unto edifying. Heb.</hi> 10.24, 25. <hi>Iam</hi> 2.1.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Pastor and people must so nearly cohabit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that they may mutually perform their duties each to other with most conveniency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We say, That all that live within the same Parish being Baptized persons, and making profession of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity may claime admission into the society of Christians within those bounds, &amp; enjoy the priviledges and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there dispensed, if by their Scandalous lives they make not themselves unworthy.

                  <p n="3">3. We say, That it is agreeable to the will of Christ and much tending to the edification of his Church, That all those that live within the same bounds, should be under the care of the same Minister or Ministers, to be taught by them and Governed by them, and to have the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

give all orders, all blessings, and consecrations, but that for the avoiding of the peril of Schisme, it was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that one should be chosen, who should be named a Bishop, whom the rest should obey, and to whom it was reserved to give orders, and to do some other things which none but Bishops do.

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conclu.</hi>
                     </note>That the power of Ordination of Ministers exercised for these many hundred years by Bishops, did belong to them as Presbyters and not as Bishops, and that the act and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it was restrained to them <hi>potius ad honorem Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii &amp; in remedium schismatis quam ad Legis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For the Scripture warrants no such pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, as we shall shew hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now this floweth from the former conclusion. For if Episcopacy be the same Order of Ministers with Presbytery, and the Ecclesiastical power equal in both, and a Bishop be nothing else in the opinion of Antiquity, but a chief Presbyter, or the President of the Presbytery, and of the same rank with them, then all the acts he doth, he must do by vertue of his Presbyterial consecration. This is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable (even our adversaries being Judges) from this Argument.</p>
                  <p>Because a Bishop made <hi>per saltum,</hi> that never had the Ordination of a Presbyter, can neither consecrate and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, nor Ordain a Presbyter, himself being none, nor do any act peculiarly appertaining to Presbyters. Ordination therefore (saith Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>) is reserved to the Bishop, not in respect of superiority in degree of Ministry above his brethren,<note place="margin">Answer to Mr. Can. pag. 96.</note> for if he be no Presbyter he cannot make Presbyters, but for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sake, and to prevent Schisme and division, being for substance of the same Order and consecration with them.

Whereby it is most Evident (<hi>saith Dr. Field</hi>) That that wherein a Bishop excelleth a Presbyter, is not a distinct Power of Order,, but an Eminency and Dignitie onely, specially yeelded to one above all the rest of the same Rank, for Order sake, and to preserve the unity and peace of the Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What peace and Order was preserved hereby in the Church, we shall shew afterwards: For the present it is most clear, even from the testimony of <hi>Episcopal</hi> men themselves, That a Bishop is of the same Order and Rank with a Presbyter, and that his acts of Ordination were exercised by him as a Presbyter, not as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</p>

                     <q>Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> in his <hi>Heart-divisions</hi> hath this observable passage.<note place="margin">Pag. 184.</note> If a man doth a thing that he may do by vertue of 2 relations, or either of them, it may be he thinks he stands in one of these relations which indeed he doth not, yet he doth the action by vertue of it in his own thoughts, in this he sins; but there is another relation wherein he stands, that is enough to warrant the action that he doth to be lawful. Now though he doth not intend the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this relation, the action may be sin to him, but not at all sin to those that joyn with him in it. If he will go upon a false ground, when he may go upon a true, let him look to it. I will joyn with him in that action as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted for him to do by vertue of his second relation, which it may be he will not own himself. He gives this instance. Giving alms is a work that a man may do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by vertue of Church-office, as a Deacon, or as a Christian, whom God hath blessed in his estate, or betrusted

with the distribution of what others betrust him with, Now suppose a man is in the place of a Deacon, he thinks, himself to be in that office by a right call into it, and he gives out the alms of his Church by vertue of his call; but I am perswaded his call to that office is not right, he is not a true Deacon; yet if I be in want, I knowing that bothhe and those who have given him monies to dispose, may and ought to distribute to those that are in need, by vertue of another relation, as men, as Christians, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by God, surely then I may receive alms from him law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, though his principle by which he gives them me is sin to him.

                  <p>That some evil men may and alwaies have <hi>de facto</hi> been officers and Ministers in the Church. In the Church of the Jewes <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> in the dayes of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scribes and Pharises.</p>

Christs commission did as well authorize <hi>Iudas</hi> as any other to Preach and baptize, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And surely if the Principall acts belongingto the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial function, as Preaching, Baptizing, adminstring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, be not nulled or made void by the personal wickedness of Ministers, then, consequently not their ordination. So that if <hi>Iudas</hi> had been an Apostle when Christ sent his Apostles to ordain Elders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Ordination should have been as valid as his Preaching, and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing formerly had been.

                  <p>For satisfaction to this objection, we shall first propose what the ancient learned &amp; godly <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> have left in print about it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ans.</hi>
                     </note> and then we will lay down our own answer. The old <hi>Non-conformists</hi> by joynt consent have written, That they did not see how our Bishops could be called Antichrists, or Antichristian.
<q>1. Because the word m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rks out Antichrist by his false Doctrine: nor do we find in holy Scripture any such accounted Antichrist or Antichristian, which holding the truth of Doctrine,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30575:126"/>
swerveth, either in judgement or practise, from Christs rule for Discipline. Now it is evident that our Bishops do hold and teach all fundamental doctrines and truths, and some of them have soundly maintained them against Hereticks, converted many to the truth and have suffered persecution for the Gospel.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <q>2. Their Hierarchy and other corruptions, charged upon the calling of our Bishops, were rather to be esteemed the staires and way to Antichristianity, then Antichristianity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  <p n="3">
                     <q>3. The Antichristian Bishops hold their preeminence as from Gods law, which is unchangeable; whereas our Bishops since his Majesties reign to this day (for the most part) hold superiority by no other right then the positive law, which is variable; yea it appeares by the institution of the Court of Delegates, and the continuance thereof to this day, that they do and ought by law to hold their Jurisdiction, not as from God, but is from the Prince.</q>
Thus they.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Ministers Ordeyned by Bishops, they say.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Bishops are able to judge of such gifts as are required for the sufficiencie of Ministers, that many of them have been such Ministers themselves, as to whose labours th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Lord hath set to his Seal. We are perswaded, that though it were not necessary, yet it cannot be unlawful for him that entreth into the ministery to be approved, and authorized even by them. Andif our Ordination be in this behalf faultie, how will our Brethren justifie the calling of their own Ministers that have received Ordination ever from the people, who neither by commandement nor example can be found to have any such authority, nor are in any degree so capable of it as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much is said by the old Non-conformist.</p>
                  <p>For our own particulars we shall return an answer to this objection by distinguishing of the word <hi>Bishop</hi> and the word <hi>Antichristian.</hi>

                  <p>For as a maimed man may beget a perfect child, because he begets him not as maimed but as a man. So an Antichristian Bishop may ordain a true Minister, because he ordaines him; not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Antichristian, but as a Presbyter, that by divine warrant hath authority so to do. As <hi>Austin</hi> against the Donatists proves the validity of Baptisme by Hereticks, if they Baptized with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, though in other points they were Heretical. So certainly a Minister or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to Preach the Word and administer the Sacraments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of Christ is a lawful Minister, though or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by a Bishop in other points Antichristian, considering that in that one act he is not Antichristian, but doth that which he hath warrant from the Scripture to do though he were not a Bishop. The word Sacraments, and Ministery are the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Jesus Christ. And these are not made null and void though the power to dispence them <hi>in foro externo</hi> be conveighed to us by corrupt Instruments, no more then the Scriptures were polluted because offered by <hi>Hophni and Phinehas,</hi> or the Chair of <hi>Moses</hi> defiled, because the Scribes and Pharisees sat in it. We must carefully distinguish (as a learned Minister well saith) the acts of office (which have their form and being from a root or fountain without us) from the qualities of the man that performes the office. The man may be naught, yet his office good; and acts done by vertue of his Office, Just and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, although the man and his religion be naught. As for

A Popish Judge doth passe a sentence in Court, which stands good in Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his sentence is not Popish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he that pronounced it be a Papist; the reason is, because the legall sentence is not of him, nor from him, as a Papist, but as a Judge, who doth but deliver that which he hath received from an higher root, the Law. So in this case, Ordination is an act of Office received from Christ and is not Antichristian, though executed by one that is in other things Antichristian. We do not rebaptize them that were baptized by a popish Priest, because the power ofGods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance depends not on theperson that does execute the same, but upon an higher foundation, the institution of Christ.

                  <p>Our <hi>Antiministerial</hi> adversaries, if they would argue aright, their objection must be thus framed.</p>

                     </note> That our ministry is derived to us from Jesus Christ. We are his Ministers and his Ambassadors. It is he that gave Pastors and Teachers to his Church as well as Apostles and Evangelists.. We say, That Ordination of Ministers by Ministers, is no <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> institution but instituted by the Lord Jesus himself long before Antichrist was. That our Ministry is descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us from Christ <hi>through</hi> the Apostate Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but not <hi>from</hi> the Apostate Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that this great objection (which some say is unanswerable) must of necessity be summed up into this argument.</p>
                  <p>Those Ministers which stand by an institution of Christ descending to them from the Apostles through the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>

                        </p>
                     </note> notwithstanding the great and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Apostacy that hath been in it. And our learned Protestants in divers Books have given us a Catalogue of the faithful Ministers of God, and other godly men whom the Lord raised up in all ages of the Church to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against the growing and spreading abominations of Antichristianisme in the Christian World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third thing we offer to consideration is. To beseech our people, accurately to distinguish between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Antichristianisme of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as between a man and the Plague-sore that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; and between a Field that is full of tares, and yet hath some Wheat in it. It is certain that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a true Church in the Apostles dayes when the faith of it was spread throughout the World, and it is as certain that afterwards by little and litle it apostatized, till at last Antichrist set up his throne in that Church. And yet still we must distinguish between the Church, and the Apostasie of it; between the Corn and the Tares that are in it. Thus the Apostle seems to do, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.4. where he puts a difference between the Temple of God, in which the man of sin shall sit as God, and between the man of sin sitting in this Temple. The man of sin is no part of this Temple of God, but as a Plague of Leprosie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, defiling, and polluting it. But yet the Temple of God (which is his visible Church, as appears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.12, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.1, 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19.)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30575:132"/>
doth remain where the man of sin sits, even as the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> did, where the seat of Satan was.<note place="margin">Revel. 2.13.</note> And though we renounce the Antichristianisme which pollutes the Temple of God, yet we do not renounce the Temple in self.</p>
                  <p>This is that which some of our Divines say: That we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no more from <hi>Rome</hi> then <hi>Rome</hi> differs from it self, and from what it was in the Apostles dayes, neither do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse any Doctrine that they hold, simply because they hold it, unlesse it can appear to us, that that doctrine is part of the Antichristianisme of that Church. The Religion of the Church of Rome, is like a peece of bread mingled with a great deal of poison. They hold many truthes, but then they poison them by their Heretial additions. They hold most that we hold, and their Apostasie consisteth rather in adding to the truth, then in detracting from it. They hold the Scriptures we hold, but they add Apocryphal to the Canonical Scriptures. They hold Christ the Head of the Church, but the Pope also. They hold Justification by Faith as we do, but they add Justification by works also; They hold praying to God, but add praying to Saints; They hold two Sacraments, but add five more &amp;c. Thus their Religion is bread and poison mingled together, and whosoever living amongst them can separate the bread from the poison, shall find bread enough to nourish him unto eternal life.</p>
                  <p>And the reason why we separated from them, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not suffer us to eat the bread unlesse we would eate the poison also. Even as a man that is drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cup of Wine, and another comes and puts a Toade in it, and will not suffer him to drink the Wine unlesse he will drink the Toade also. This was our condition Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we would swallow down all their Antichristian addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Gods Word, they would not suffer us to live amongst them, and hereupon we separated, and may justly be said to be <hi>non fugitivi, sed fugati.</hi> Not withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but driven away. And which is very observable;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30575:133"/>
When the Protestant Churches did separate, they did not erect a New Church but reformed a corrupt Church. And therefore ours is called The Protestant <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion. Not, A <hi>New</hi> Religion. We take away their hereticall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructions, but still keep the Truths which they hold; We put away the poyson, but keep the bread; We take out the toad, but yet do not fling away the Wine; We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the rubbish of Antichristianisme, but yet we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any thing of God, or of the Scriptures that is yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining sincere in that Church. All this we the rather observe, that thereby we might heed our people of that great cheat that is now put upon the Saints of God in this Nation, in crying down all the truths of Jesus Christ, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian, and scaring people from the doctrine of Christ by perswading them to avoid Antichrist. There is hardly any Truth of Christ but it is charged by some or other in our unhappie dayes to be Antichristian. Thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Doctrine of the souls Immortality was, <hi>excogitata ab Antichristo ad stabiliendam suam culinam per fictum Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium,</hi>

<q>That the most grand and blasphemous heresies that are in the World, the mystery of iniquity, and Kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ doth depend upon this doctrine of the Souls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Doctrine of the Trinity is said to be a doctrine that hath Antichrist for the author of it. <hi>Zanchius in respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione ad Arianos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Christ is God coaequal and coaeternal with the Father, this also is called antichristian doctrine. <hi>Sic cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat Antichristus.</hi> So cryeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Antichrist, say the <hi>Arrians; Zanch. in responsione ad Arianos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The doctrine of the Magistrates power in punishing Anti istian heresies and blasphemies (which the Scripture saith will be the way by which God will at last destroy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30575:133"/>
Antichrist) is said to be Antichristian. Thus <hi>Blackwood</hi> in his storming of Antichrist.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Doctrine of Infant-Baptisme is also called Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Doctrine of humiliation, Repentance, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of good works, done out of obedience to Gods command, is antichristian, as say the Antinomians.</p>
                  <p>And who knoweth not, That the very places where we meet to worship God, and the worship which we perform in those places, and that our Government of the Church by lesser and greater Synod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, is called Antichristian? And therefore it is no wonder if our Ministry be also so called. For we are now come to that height, That there are some that renounce all Churches as Antichristian, even those Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es themselves that renounce us as Antichristian. And thus by the great subtlety of Satan under the notion of avoiding Antichristianisme there are many people tumbling down apace to direct Athiesme; and are brought to renounce Christ himself, lest therein they should comply with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. And therefore we earnestly beseech and intreat our respective Congregations not to be affrighted at the bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear word <hi>Antichristian or Popish.</hi> But to examin, Whether the Charge be true, and to renounce whatsoever is truly Antichristian: But to take heed that they be not frighted from Christ and from his Ordinances, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; Worship, &amp; Ministery under the notion of renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Antichristianisme. So much for the third consideration; these three first considerations are more general. We shall now apply our selves more punctually to the answer of the great Objection, and desire it may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Consid. 4. In the fourth place. That it hath pleased God out of his infinite Wisdom and providence to continue the two great Ordinances of Baptisme and Ordination found for the substantials of them in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> even in their greatest apostacy. We deny not but they have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly bemudded and corrupted, <hi>Baptism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

many superstitious ceremonies as of Oyl, Spettle, Crossings &amp;c. <hi>Ordination</hi> with giving power to the party Ordained to make the body of Christ &amp;c. But yet the Substantials have been preserved. Children were Baptized with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghost. And the parties ordained had power given them to Preach the Word of God. Now the Protestant Religion doth not teach us to renounce Baptisme received in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither is a Papist, when converted Protestant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized. Nor doth it teach us simply and absolutely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Ordination; but it deals with it, as the Jewes were to do with a captive maid when they had a mind to marrie her. They must shave her head and pare her nailes, and put the raiment of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So that if the whole be well considered, it will puzzle our Antiministerial adversaries to prove that the Church of England was beholding to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for either the first plantation, after reformation, or continuation of the Gospel, Church and Ministry therein, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this day.

                  <p>For the first, there are two chiefe and principall arguments, the one from <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> the other from the 7. <hi>Asian</hi> Angels.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> It is said, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Bishops of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Cree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To this we Answer.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not Bishops in a Prelatical sense. We deny not but that they did exercise Episcopal power both in Ordination and Jurisdiction, and that this power is necessary to be continued in the Church. But we say, that they did this, not as Bishops in a formall sense, but as extraordinary Officers or Evangelists, which were Officers in the Church distinct from Pastors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
                  <p>To make this out, we will briefly do two things.</p>
                  <list>

                  <p>Some call them <hi>Archbishops, Metropolitans, Patriarches,</hi> and yet will not be easie to perswade a person disengaged from <hi>Prelacy</hi> that there were <hi>Archbishops</hi> and <hi>Metropolitans</hi> in the Apostles dayes. The truth is, That which <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi> saith of the ancient Greek Historians, may as truly be said of <hi>Eusebius,</hi>

                     <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and others, &amp;c. That those things which they received from their Fore-fathers they delivered to their posterity without strict examination, and thereby in many things more deceived themselves, and were the cause of deceiving others, as we shall have occasion to shew afterwards.</p>
                  <p>For our parts we answer clearly; That the Fathers and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30575:145"/>
Councels speak of the Officers of former times according to the stile of their own times. That <hi>Timothy</hi> had an Office above a Bishop, (as <hi>Wale Messalinus</hi> saith) though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the custome of the Church and some acts that Bishops did like his (but not solely) he was allusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not abusively, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> called a Bishop. And as another faith; <hi>Timothy and Titus are called Bishops by the ancients, because they did those acts that by humane custome were afterwards appropriated to Bishops in regard of Presidency, but they did them not as Bishops (which they are not called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) hut as Evangelists which they were, and so one of them is called,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second argument to prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were no Bishops, relates especially to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and it is this.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Timothy</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> it must be when the first Epistle was written. For it is in that Epistle in which he is said to receive his pretended charge of exercising his Episcopal power in Ordination and Jurisdiction. But now this first Epistle was written when <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the learned, both new and old, Papists and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, agree. And it was after this when <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Miletum</hi> accompanied with <hi>Timothy,</hi> and sends for the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> unto him, and commends the government of the Church unto these Elders whom he calls Bishops. Now surely if <hi>Timothy</hi> had been constituted their Bishop (in the sence of our Adversaries) the Apostle would not have called the Elders Bishops before their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops face, and in stead of giving a charge to the Elders to feed the flock of Christ, he would have given that charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and not to them, And no doubt he would have given some directions to the Elders how to carry themselves toward their Bishop. And because none of these things were done; it is a clear demonstration to us, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not at that time Bishop of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To avoid the force of this argument, there are some that say, That <hi>Timothy</hi> was not made Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> till after <hi>Pauls</hi> first being a prisoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> which was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30575:146"/>
after his being at <hi>Miletum.</hi> But these men while they seek to avoid the <hi>Scylla</hi> of one inconvenience, fall into the <hi>Carybdis</hi> of another as great; For if <hi>Timothy</hi> was not made Bishop till <hi>Pauls</hi> first being at <hi>Rome,</hi> then he was not Bishop when the first Epistle was written to him (which all agree to be written before that time) And then it will also follow, That all that charge that was laid upon him, both of Ordination and jurisdiction, and that intreating of him to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> was given to him not as to the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> (which he was not,) but as to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officer sent thither upon special occasion, with a purpose of returning when his work imposed was finished. From both these considerations we may safely conclude.</p>
                  <p>That if <hi>Timothy</hi> were neither constituted Bishop of <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> before <hi>Pauls</hi> first being prisoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor after; Then he was not constituted Bishop at all: But he was neither constituted Bishop before nor after &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> not at all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not Bishops in a Prelatical sence, we argue from the matter contained in these Epistles. In the first Epistle (wherein all that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for Episcopacy is contained, for in the 2 Epistle there is nothing at all said about it) Chap. 1. Vers. 3.

like words of instalment of a man into a Bishoprick, but of an intendment to call him away again. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider his actual revocation of them both (of which we shall afterwards speake) and the intimation in these texts of his intention, that they should not stay there for continuance; and the reason of his beseeching the one to stay, and of his leaving the other behind him, which was some present defects and distempers in those Churches, they will put fair to prove, That the Apostle intended not to establish them Bishops of those places, and therfore did not. Add to this, That when <hi>Paul</hi> undertook in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. to set out the Office of a Bishop, he mentioneth nothing in that Office which is not competent to a Presbyter, and therefore omits the Office of a Presbyter (as we have formerly said) including it in the Office of a Bishop, which certainly he would never have done, if he had at the same time made <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> an HierachicalBishop, with a power to do that formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which was unlawful for a Presbyter to do.</p>
                  <p>And in his Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> he directly confounds the names and offices of Presbyters, and Bishops, and makes them one and the same <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5.6. which he certainly would not have done, if he had made them at that time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct order<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:30575:148"/>From all this we gather 3. Conclusions.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not Bishops in our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns sense,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conclus.</hi> 1.</note> that is, were not fixed Stars in <hi>Ephesus</hi> or <hi>Creet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas it is answered, that the necessities of those times made even the most fixed Stars planetary, calling them frequently, from the places of their abode, to those services that were of most use for the successe of that great work, yet so that after their errands fully done, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their own charge, and that therefore they might be Bishops notwithstanding their severall journeys.</p>
                  <p>We challenge any of them to shew in all the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, any one that was appointed Overseer of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, whose motion was as Planetary, as we have shewed that of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to have been, or if that fail, to shew that after <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> went abroad up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the service of the Churches, they did constantly or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily return either to <hi>Ephesus</hi> or <hi>Creet,</hi> and not to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces either of the Apostles present abode, or appointment. But we are fully assured that they can shew neither the one nor the other, and therefore we may safely conclude, that they were not Bishops in our Brethrens sense.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Conclus.</hi> 2.</note>That <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Evangelists, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists in a proper sense, and Officers distinct from Pastors, and Teachers and Officers of an higher Rank and Order.</p>

And the truth is, If they were Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists at any time, we cannot conceive how they can come to be Bishops in our Brethrens sense. For we thus argue,</p>
                  <p>They that were made Evangelists in a proper sense by the Apostles, were never afterwards made Bishops in our Brethrens sense by the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>For this had been to degrade them from a superiour Office to an inferiour. And if (according to the Councell of Chalcedon) it be not onely incongruous, but sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30575:148"/>
to bring back a Bishop to the degree of a Presbyter; If it be an eternall reproach and shame to a Bishop to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> degraded from a Bishop to a Presbyter, much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and shame it must needs be, for an Evangelist to be brought down unto the Office of a Bishop.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were once made Evangelists by the Apostles, when they were chosen to travell up and downe with them as their companions, and before they were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (as our Brethren suppose) the one at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Creet.</hi> This is confessed by Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> Bishop <hi>Downham,</hi> and all Episcopall men, that we have read of this subject. And the great debate between them and us is, not whether they were once Evangelists, and Vice-Apostles or no, but how long they continued so, and whether ever they were made Bishops in our Brethrens sense.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we may undoubtedly conclude, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were once Evangelists, therefore they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Bishops, neither before they were sent to <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Before we leave our discourse concerning <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> we must of necessity answer one Objection.</p>
                  <p>It is said,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Object.</hi>
                     </note> that the work imposed upon <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> both of Ordination and Jurisdiction is as necessary to be continued in the Church as the work of preaching and adminstring the Sacrament, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their deaths, those that did succeed them did the same work, and were called Bishops by the ancient Fathers. And that therefore <hi>Timothy</hi> himselfe was a Bishop, because his Successors in the same place were called so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Evangelists,<note place="margin">

Indeed the power they did exercise in <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> was necessary for the Church of Christ, and there were some that succeeded them in that work, but none in the Office, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Evangelists had some that came after them and did the same work that they did in governing ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30575:149"/>
and preaching: but they had no Successors in Office, for then they had not been extraordinary. And as one wel saith; when the Apostles and Evangelists dyed, their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ceased, what parts of their Office were of perpetuall use, as praying, preaching, administring Sacraments, and the use of the Keyes, were left to those Ordinary Officers called Pastors and Teachers <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. The distinction made afterward between a Pastor-Bishop, and a Pastor-Presbyter, was but an humane invention for order, and to avoid accidental inconveniencies, of which we shall speake more hereafter. In a word the successors of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Presbyters, who by common consent govern the Church, and ordain Elders, and did the same work as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary standing Officers which <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and temporary Officers, &amp;c. So it was at first, till afterwards, for avoiding ofSchisme, (as <hi>Hierom</hi> saith) one was chosen from amongst the Presbyters and called a Bishop; But whether this invention were of God, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were hurtfull or profitable for the Church, we shall, God willing, shew at large when we come to speak of the practise of Antiquity in point of Episcopacy.

                  <p n="1">1. That there is not the least intimation in all St. <hi>Iohns</hi> writngs of the superiority of one Presbyter over another, save onely where he names and chides <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> as one ambitiously affecting such a Primacy.</p>
                  <p>Consider, thirdly, That the same Authors, that say that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> made <hi>Polycarp</hi> Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and that St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> made <hi>Ignatius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> do also say that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> himself sate many yeares Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and was the Metropolitan of all <hi>Asia,</hi> which is an evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration to us, that these Authors did not use the word Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in a Prelaticall sense. For it is certain that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles cannot properly be called Bishops: For, though they did eminently contain the Episcopall office, yet they were not formally Bishops. For, this were to degrade the Apostles, and to make their Office ordinary and perpetuall, this were to exalt the Bishop above his degree, and make
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30575:150"/>
him an Apostle, and to make the Apostle a Bishop.<note place="margin">

                     </note> It doth not much differ from madness, to say that <hi>Peter</hi> or any one of the Apostles were properly Bishops, as learned <hi>Whitaker</hi> saith, whom we shal have occasion to cite this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider fourthly, That the word Angel (which is the title given to those supposed Bishops) doth not import any peculiar jurisdiction or preheminence, but is a common name to all Ministers, and is so used in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For all Ministers are Gods Messengers, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours sent for the good of the Elect, and therfore the name being common to all Ministers, why should we think that there should be any thing spoken to one Minister, that doth not belong to all? The same may be said of the word <hi>Starre</hi> (which is also a title given to those supposed Metropolitans.) It is evident that all faithfull Ministers are called Stars in Scripture, whose duty is to shine as lights unto the Churches in all purity of doctrine, and holiness of conversation. There is nothing in these Titles, that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue these Ministers to be Bishops in our Brethrens sense, insomuch as had they not been called Bishops, by some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that succeeded them (who spake of former times according to the language of their own times) this way of arguing would have been counted ridiculous.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Add lastly, That these Titles of <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> are mysterious and metaphoricall. It is said <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20 <hi>The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the seven Stars,</hi> &amp;c. And certainly it cannot be safe or solid, to build the structure of Episcopacy by Divine right upon mysterious and metaphorical denominations; <hi>Theologia Symbolica non est argumentativa.</hi> Especially if we consider, that there are abundance of cleare Texts, that make Presbyters and Bishops to be one and the same: and it cannot be praise-worthy for any men (though never so learned in the esteem of the world,) to oppose certain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall, and mysterious titles, to so many express testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Against all this it will be said, That our Saviour Christ in

As for example.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that our Saviour Christ speakes to this Angel often in the plural number, Rev. 2.24. <hi>But unto you I say and the rest of Thyatira Rev.</hi> 2.10. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. It is certain that the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was a collective body, and that there were many Presbyters to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> at his final departure from them committed the charge
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30575:151"/>

                  <p n="3">3. It is usuall with the Holy Ghost, not onely in other books of the Scripture, but in this very book of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in Mysterious and prophetick writings and visional representations (such as this of the stars and golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick is) to expresse a number of things or persons in singulars. And this in visions is the usual way of representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, a thousand persons making up one Church, is represented by one Candlestick; many Ministers making up one Presbytery by one Angel. Thus Revel. 8.2. It is said, That <hi>Iohn</hi> say seven Angels which stood before God. By these seven Candlesticks Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> doth not understand seven Individual Angels, but all the Angels.

                     </gap> forementioned.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Add lastly, That though but one Angel be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>front; yet it is evident, that the Epistles themselves (though we are far from thinking in that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Denomination the Angels and Candlesticks are the the same) are dedicated to all the Angels and Ministers in every Church, and to the Churches themselves, as appears <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7.11.17. And therefore when it is said in the singular number, <hi>I know thy workes, This thou hast, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and do thy first workes</hi> &amp;c. All these and the like places are not to be understood as meant of one Individuall person, but of the whole company of Ministers, and also of the whole Church, because the punishment threatned is to the whole Church <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5.16.2. Now we have no warrant in the word to think that Christ would remove his Gospel from a Church for the sin of one Bishop, when all the other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Churches are far from those sins. These are some of those reasons that are brought to prove that this our interpretation is no wresting or offering of violence to the text, but such a one that floweth naturally from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:30575:152"/>We might for the confirmation of it cite Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> (who citeth <hi>Primasius, Haymo, Beda, Richardus, Thomas</hi> &amp;c. of the same judgment) Dr. <hi>Fulk,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede, Gregory,</hi> and St. <hi>Austin,</hi> all of them interpreting this text as we do. But we forbear, because they are quoted by <hi>Smectimnuus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it will be said that as some Autohors say, That <hi>Timothy</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> when our Saviour wrote this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to it;<note place="margin">

                  <p>They that say that <hi>Timothy</hi> was then Bishop, offer no little injury to him;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi>
                     </note> for they thereby charge him to be guilty of Apostacy, and of losing his first love, and so out of a blind zeal to Episcopacy, they make that Glorious Saint to stand charged as an Apostate. The like injurie is offered by Objections to <hi>Onesimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have already proved, That <hi>Timothy</hi> was an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist in a proper sense, and therefore cannot be called a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in their sense.</p>
                  <p>It will not follow because <hi>Onesimus</hi> was bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in</p>
                  <p n="3">3. St. Johns dayes, that therefore he was the onely person to whom Christ wrote his Epistle; for <hi>St Paul</hi> tells us that there were many Bishops at <hi>Ephesus</hi> (besides the supposed <hi>Onesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>) and Christ may very well write to him and to all the rest as well as him. The like may be said concerning <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpe</hi>: For our Saviour speakes to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> in the plural number <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. And therefore he may truly be said to write to all the other Angels that were at <hi>Smyrna</hi> as well as to one. So much for the first head of answers.</p>

<q>That these writings to the Angels are directed as Epistolary letters to Collective bodies usually are; That is, To one, but intended to the body, which your Majestie illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by your sending a Message to your two Houses, and directing it to the Speaker of the Hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Dr, <hi>Reynolds</hi> (who hath written a letter in Print against the <hi>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30575:153"/>
Angel was <hi>persona singularis.</hi> For he saith, That Presbyters when they met together for the carrying on of the affairs of the Church by common Councel and consent, chose one amongst them to be the President of their company, and Moderator of their actions. As in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> though it had sundry Elders and Pastors to guide it; yet amongst those sundry, was there one chief, whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our calleth The Angel of the Church, and writeth that to him, which by him the rest should know. From which saying we may safely conclude, That though we should grant (which yet we do not) that this Angel is a single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet it will not at all help the Episcopal Hierarchy. For this Angel is but a Moderator of the Presbytery, having no superiority of power either in Ordination, or Jurisdiction, above Presbyters; is himself also a Presbytery, and (for ought appears to the contrary, from the judgment of Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi>) a Moderator onely <hi>pro tempore</hi>: Which kind of government is purely Presbyterial, and not at all Episcopal, much lesse (as some would have it, even from this text) Archiepiscopal and Metropolitical.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That it is no good argument from the greatnesse of the Cities, to inferr the greatnesse of the Churches: For, though the Cities were great, yet the Churches were but small, and the number of believers very few in comparison of the rest of the people.</p>

                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:30575:153"/>2. We do not believe that ever it can be proved, That the Apostles did model the government of the Church according to the government of the <hi>Roman</hi> State. This was the after-policy of Christian Emperours and Bishops, but no part of Apostolical policy; And therefore it doth not follow, That because there were divers Cities under the jurisdiction of these seven Cities, That therefore there should be divers Churches subordinate to these seven <hi>Asian</hi> Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are fully assured, That it can never be made out, That any of these <hi>Asian</hi> Angels were Archbishops, or Bishops over other Bishops; or Bishops over divers settled Churches. The seven starrs are said in Scripture to be fixed in their seven Candlesticks or Churches, not one Star over divers Candlesticks, or Churches.</p>
                  <p>If this opinion were true, Then <hi>Tertullian</hi> did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> do well in saying, That St. <hi>Iohn</hi> made <hi>Polycarpe</hi> Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> but he should rather have said, That he made him Arch-Bishop. And our Saviour Christ had not given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these seven <hi>Angels</hi> their due Titles. For he must have written. To the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> together with all those Churches in the Cities subordinate to <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so likewise of the other Six: Surely this device was found out for the honour of <hi>Archiepiscopacy</hi> by some that did aspire unto that dignity; But we hope that our more moderate Brethren are far from stamping a <hi>divinum jus</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Archbishops and Prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tes and Patriarchs, for fear lest by the same proportion of reason they be forced to put a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine stamp at last upon the Pope himself. And therefore we forbear to say any more about it.</p>
                  <p>For the conclusion of this discourse about the <hi>Asian</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, we shall add;</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That it can never be proved, That these <hi>Asian</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were Bishops in a Prelatical sence, much lesse Arch-Bishops and Metropolitans. For it is agreed upon on al parts, That believers in great Cities were not divided into set and fixed Congregations or Parishes, till long after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30575:154"/>
dayes. And that Parishes were not united into Diocesses till 260. years after Christ. And therefore sure we are, That there could not be Diocesan Churches, and Diocesan Bishops formally so called in the Apostles dayes. These <hi>Angels</hi> were Congregational, not Diocesan. In the beginning of Christianity the number of believers, even in the greatest Cities, were so few, as that they might well meet, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in one and the same place. And these were called <hi>The Church of the Citie,</hi> and therefore, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Elders <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, are all one in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards we conceive, That believers became so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in these great Cities as that they could not convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meet in one place.<note place="margin">

But yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, there are three things diligently to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. That notwithstanding these different meeting places, yet the believers of one City made but one Church in the Apostles dayes, as is evident in the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which is called a Church, not Churches, Act. 8.1. &amp; 15.6. &amp; 22.16. And so likewise it is called the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> &amp;c. not Churches &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this Church in the City was governed in the Apostles dayes by the common Councel of Presbyters, or Bishops.<note place="margin">

                  <p>The general answer that is returned unto all our texts of Scripture is; That these texts do onely prove an Identity of names, but not of Offices, and that it is the great Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:30575:155"/>But we answer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is of no small consequence, that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Identity of denomination between a Bishop and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>ymnuus</hi> saith) to distinguish things according to the difference of their nature, and the supream wisdom of God being the imposer of these names, who could neither be ignorant of the nature of these offices, nor mistake the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of imposition of names, nor want variety to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse himself, the argument taken from the constant Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Denomination is not so contemptible as some would make it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But we answer further, That our argument is not drawn from the Identity of denomination onely, but also from the Identity of Office, &amp; it is this. They that have the same name, and the same office, and the same qualifications for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the same Ordination to their office, they are one and the same: but so hath the Presbyter, and Bishop, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi> This we proved from <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5.6.7. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and other places never yet answered.</p>

It is answered, That these Elders were not meer Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but Bishops properly so called. And though they were sent for from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> yet they are not said to be all of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> But they were all the Bishops of <hi>Asia</hi> called from divers parts, and gathered together at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and from thence sent for by Paul to <hi>Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To all this we reply.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. There is no sufficient ground to build that conjecture upon, That the <hi>Bishops</hi> of all <hi>Asia</hi> were gathered together at <hi>Ephesus</hi> when Paul sent from <hi>Miletum</hi> to <hi>Ephesvs.</hi> The text saith that Paul from <hi>Miletum</hi> sent to <hi>Ephesus</hi> and called the Elders of the Church.

If the Apostles by the Elders of the Church had meant the Bishops of all <hi>Asia,</hi> he would have said, not the Elders of the <hi>Church,</hi> but of the <hi>Churches.</hi> It is an observation brought by one of those that makes use of this answer we are now confuting, That when the Scripture speakes of Churches in Cities, it alwaies useth the singular number, as the Church of <hi>Hirusalem,</hi> the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> &amp;c. But when it speakes of provinces in which were many Cities, then it useth the Plural number. As the Churches of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> Rev. 1.11. According to this observation, If the Apostle had meant of the Bishops of All <hi>Asia,</hi> he would have said, <hi>The Elders of the Churches.</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:30575:156"/>
But because he saith the <hi>Elders of the Church,</hi> it is evident he meanes onely, The Elders of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and so by consequence it is as evident, That by Elders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle understands meer Presbyters, &amp; not Bishops in a distinct sense, unlesse our brethren will confesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That there were more Bishops then one in <hi>Ephesus</hi> which is wholly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake theircause, and to confesse that which we affirm, that the Bishops of <hi>Ephesus</hi> were true Presbyters, and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters true Bishops.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whereas it is said, That Paul sent not onely for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops or superintendents of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but of all <hi>Asia.</hi> We demand, who was the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> sent for? Surely it was not <hi>Timothy.</hi> For <hi>Timothy</hi> was then present with him, and needed not to have been sent for, and yet <hi>Timothy</hi> was (according to our Brethrens judgement) the first Bishop of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> And if <hi>Timothy</hi> was the first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, then surely there was none in <hi>Ephesus</hi> for Paul to send for, and if <hi>Ephesus</hi> at that time had no Bishop which was the Metroplis of all Asia; How came the Daughter Churches to have Bishops before their Mothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nding Officers constituted by Christ in his Church &amp;c. To this divers answers are given, and some of them quite contrary one to the other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First it is said by some, That though in the place cited there be but two Orders of the Ministry mentioned, yet it doth not follow, but that there may be mention in other Scriptures of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nother standing Officer.</p>
                  <p>We desire that these Scriptures may be produced: We say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That there is no mention in any place of any others, and we add, That there is no mention of any Rules for Ordaining any others, or of any way of Mission for any others, no Qualifications for any others. And therefore that there is no other standing Officer in Christ's Church of his appointing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is confessed by others, That the Bishops in <hi>Philippi</hi> were meer Presbyters, and that the Apostles in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30575:157"/>
which they planted, did not at first appoint any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but Presbyters onely, to whom they gave the power of Preaching, but reserved in their own hands the power of Governing, till towards the latter end of their lives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Reply.</note>This conceit, though it be frequently urged, and much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on by the learnedest of our Brethren, yet that it is but a meer conceit, appears.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because that when the Apostles placed Preaching Presbyters over the Churches, they did not only give unto them the power of Teaching, but also of governing. They are called Rulers and Governours, and their charge was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as we have proved at large. Our Saviour Christ committed both the Keyes (as they are called) The Key of Doctrine and Discipline, into the hands of Preaching Presbyters. And whom the Apostles did constitute Teachers, the same they made also Rulers and Governours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because that when <hi>Paul</hi> took his solemn leave of the Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and was never to see their faces more, he did not set a Bishop over them to Rule and govern them, But he left the power of government in the hands of the Elders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Charging them to feed the flock (over which the holy Ghost had made them Bishops) both by Doctrine, and Discipline.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This answer doth yeeld thus much; That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles at first did place Presbyters in the Churches by them planted, and that to these Presbyters, he gave the power of Teaching, and (as we have proved) the power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also.</p>
                  <p>Now it lyeth upon our Brethren to prove a Super-insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Bishop over Presbyters by the Apostles, in some after times, which we are sure they cannot do. It is evident they did the quite contrary at <hi>Ephesus</hi>: And therefore we may safely conclude, That there was no such Officer in the Apostles dayes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for the Apostles reserving in their own hands the power of governing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:30575:157"/>
                     <q>To this it is well answered by the reverend Divines in their humble answer &amp;c. That the Apostles could no more devest themselves of power of Governing, then (as Dr. <hi>Bilson</hi> saith) they could lose their Apostleship. Had they set up Bishops in all Churches, they had no more parted with their power of Governing, then they did in setting up Presbyters; for we have proved that Presbyters being called Rulers, Governours, Bishops had the power of Governing in Ordinary, committed to them as well as the office of teaching &amp;c. Nor do we see, how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle could reasonably commit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Government of the Church to the Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and yet reserve the power of Governing (viz. in ordinary) in his own hands, who took his last farewell of them as never to see them more. As the reserving of that part of the power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernme nt called <hi>Legislative,</hi> in the Apostles hands hindred not, but that in your Majesties judgment <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> were Bishops at <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> to whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle gives rules for ordering and governing the Church: So likewise there is no reason, why the Apostle reserving of that part of the power of Government called <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> in such cases and upon such occasions as they thought m eet should hinder the setting up of Bishops, if they had intended it; and therefore the reserving of power in their hands can be no greater reason why they did not set up Bishops at first, then that they never did.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a third answer given which is quite contrary to the second, and that is, that these Bishops of <hi>Philippi</hi> were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in a proper sence, and that at that time when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle wrote his Epistle there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were no single Presbyters at <hi>Philippi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. This answer is quite contrary to the sence that <hi>Hierom, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Theophylacts,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. This answer supposeth, that there were more Bishops then one planted in one City by the Apostles, which is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30575:158"/>
quite contrary to the judgment of Episcopall divines, and quite destructive of the Episcopal Hierarchy. <hi>Theodoret</hi> sayth that the Apostles by Bishops understands single Presbyters <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>Otherwise it had been impossible for many Bishops to go vern one, City.</hi> And so also <hi>Theophylact,</hi> The Apostle calls Presbyters, Bishops, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>For there were not many Bishops in one City.</hi> And the truth is, To affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That there were many Bishops in one City in the Apostles dayes is in plain English to grant the cause and to say, That the Apostolicall Bishops were mere Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another text brought by us to prove the Identity of a Bishop, and Presbyter was 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. where the Apostle reckoning up the qualifications of a Bishop passeth from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops unto Deacon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, leaving out the qualifications of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there by giving us to understand that Presbyters and Bishops are all one. To this it is answered, That because Paul wrote to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> who were Bishops, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no need to write any thing concerning the choice or qualification of any other sort of officers, then such as belonged to their Ordination and inspection, which were Presbyters and Deacons onely, and no Bishops.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Reply.</note>1. This answer would have some weight in it, if it could be proved, That <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Bishops in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">
                     <q>2. It is reasonable to think (as our Divines at the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> say) the Apostle when he passeth immediately from the Bishop to the Deacon (in the place forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) would have distinctly exprest, or at least hinted, what sort of Bishop he meant whether the Bishop over Presbyters, or the Presbyter Bishop, to have avoided the confusion of the name, and to have set, as it were, some
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30575:158"/>
mark of difference in the Eschocheon of the Presbyter-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, if there had been some other Bishop of a higher house.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. According to the judgement of Episcopal men (as our divines do well observe) Bishops might then have ordained Bishops like themselves; for there was then no Canon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> forbidding one single Bishop to Ordain another of his own rank: and there being many Cities in <hi>Creete Titus</hi> might have found it expedient, to have set up Bishops in some of those Cities. So that this answer fights against the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of those that hold <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to have been Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This answer is opposite to all those that hold <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to have been made by the Apostle Arch-Bishops of <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. That wheresover the word Bishop is used in the New Testament, it is to be taken in a Prelatical sense. For a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop is superiour to Presbyters in Ordination and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That wheresoever the word Presbyter is used in the New Testament, it is to be understood, not of a meer Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, but of a Bishop properly so called. And whereas we say, That the Scripture-Bishop is nothing else but a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30575:159"/>
Presbyter, and that there were no Bishops distinct from Presbyters in the Apostles dayes: This Author on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary saith, That the Scripture-Presbyter, is a true Bishop: And that there were no single and meer Presbyters in the Apostles dayes. For our parts, we do not think it necessary to take a particular survey of all that is said in Justification of these Paradoxes. Onely we desire it may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That these assertions are contrary unto Antiquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which yet notwithstanding our Brethren do so highly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, and boast of in this controversie, and for receding from which (as they s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y we do) they do most deeply charge us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they are contrary to all that have ever written in defence of Episcopacy. And therefore till our Brethren can agree amongst themselves, we need not spend time to answer the private opinion of one Doctor.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That whosoever will defend these Paradoxes, must of necessity be forced to grant;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there were more Bishops then one in a City in the Apostles dayes, which is to betray the cause of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and to bring down a Bishop to the ranke of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there were no Bishops over Presbyters in the Apostles dayes. For if there were no Presbyters, there could be no Bishops over Presbyters.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That <hi>Ordo Presbyteratus</hi> is not <hi>jure divino</hi>: For if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ, nor his Apostles Ordained the Office of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter. Then is the Order of Presbytery a meer humane invention: Which is an assertion, that even the worst of Papists will abominate. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself saith, That a Bishop that is not first a Presbyter is a meer figment, and an empty Title.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Author himself in Justification of this his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is forc'd to confesse.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Ephesius</hi> Presbyters whom <hi>Paul</hi> sent for to <hi>Mile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:30575:160"/>2. That the Bishops of <hi>Philippi</hi> whom Paul salutes Chap. 1. were not the Bishops of that City onely, but of the whole Province, whereas <hi>Theophylact</hi> saith, That <hi>Philippi</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> A little City subject to the <hi>Metropolis of Thessalonica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That <hi>Timothy</hi> was Arch-Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and that when Paul sets down the qualifications of Bishops, though he mentioneth no qualification, but such which are common to a Presbyter with a Bishop; yet he is to be understood to speak of Bishops in a prelatical sence, and not at all of Presbyters. And when he saith, The <hi>Elders that rule well are worthy of double honour</hi> &amp;c. That is saith this Author, the Bishops that rule well &amp;c. Thereby holding out this great error, that a Bishop that rules well is worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour though he never preacheth. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> (saith he) of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. And when the Apostle chargeth him not to rebuke an Elder &amp;c. and not receive an accusation against an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp;c. This is to be understood of Bishops (saith he) and not of meer Presbyters.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That <hi>Titus</hi> also was Arch-Bishop of <hi>Creet,</hi> and that he received no commission from St. Paul to ordain single Elders, but onely for ordaining of Bishops in every City. It seems this Author slights the postscript where <hi>Titus</hi> is called the first Bishop of <hi>Creet,</hi> and slights all those ancient Fathers that are cited by his own party to prove that he was Bishop of <hi>Creet.</hi> But he must be an Arch-bishop, and so must <hi>Tymothy</hi> be also, or else these assertions of his will fall to the ground. Now that they were neither Bishops nor Archbishops hath been sufficiently proved (as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) in the former discourse.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fiftly and lastly, those Paradoxes are contrary to the very letter of the Scripture, as we have made it evident in our arguments against the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Episcopacy, and would further manifest it, if we thought it necessary. For when the Apostle saith <hi>Iames</hi> 5.14. <hi>Is any sick among you?
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30575:160"/>
let him call for the Elders of the Church</hi> &amp;c. who is there that can be perswaded to believe That all these Elders were Bishops in the sense that Bishops are taken in our dayes) is this the proper work of Bishops to visit the sick? and, besides, If the Apostles by Elders had meant Bishops in that sense, he would have said, let him call the Elder s of the Churches, not of the Church, unlesse our Brethren will say that there were divers Bishops in every Church in the Apostles dayes, in which there were many sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p>Besides, when it is said <hi>Act.</hi> 21.18. <hi>Paul went in with us unto Iames, and all the Elders were present.</hi> It is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by our Episcopal men that this <hi>Iames</hi> was at this time Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> Now we demand, who were these Elders? were these also Bishops of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>? will this answer consist with our Brethrens judgment? So likewise when it is said <hi>Act.</hi> 15.4. And when they were come to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> they were received of the <hi>Church and of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if so, Then we ask further what is meant by the <hi>Elders</hi>? Must it not be answered, That by Elders are meant the Elders of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> And then let any man tell us how these Elders can be said to be Bishops in a Prelaticall sense, especially according to the sense of our Brethren who make <hi>Iames</hi> to be at this time the onely Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> Add further, It is said <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. when Paul and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had ordained them Elders in every Church <hi>Act.</hi> 11.30. They sent relief to the Elders &amp;c. Can any Imagin that this Relief was sent onely to Bishops, and that Paul and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordained no Presbyters in any Church but onely Bishops. Is not this to offer manifest violence to the Scriptures? and instead of upholding of Episcopacy is not this sufficient to render it odious and contemptible to all sober and Godly and Moderate Christians? But we forbear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:30575:161"/>So much for our Scripture-proof, and for our Justification out of the Word of God of Ordination by Presbyters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Prelats.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HAving now finished our <hi>Vindication of the present Ministers of the Church of England,</hi> both such as were made by Bishops, and such as are now made without Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, before we come to our Appendix; we shall crave leave to shew in few words unto our respective Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not onely the lawfulnesse of the present Ministry: But the absolute necessity of adhering to it, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive dangers, and ineffable mischiefs that will follow upon receiving of it. And this will appear upon a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold account.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because a true Ministery is essential to an Organical Church, that is, a Church administring Ordinances. A true Church saith <hi>Cyprian is Plebs Episcopo adunata.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ecclesia non est (saith</hi> Jerom) <hi>quae non habet sacerdotem.</hi> Sure we are; That there cannot be a true Church Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, without true Ministers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the Scripture way and the onely Ordinary way by which men are set apart to the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is by Ordination, as we have abundantly shewed. <hi>He that comes any other way is a Thief and a Robber,</hi> not a true Shepherd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because That this Ordination must be performed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Ministers, or by the people.</p>
                  <p>And if all Ordination by Ministers be to be accounted Antichristian (because these Ministers were made by other Ministers, and those by others, and those by such, as before the reformation, were belonging to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) Then it will follow, That there is no way of Ordination left, but by the people.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because there is neither precept nor president in all the Book of God for Ordination of Ministers by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without Ministers. We read of Ordination by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, but never by the laying on of the hands of the people. We find the Apostles Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30575:161"/>
and <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> Ordaining (as we have formerly said) and the Presbytery ordaining; But no where of the peoples Ordaining. We find the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-distinguished from Rulers and Governours, but no where called Rulers or Governours. And if there be a power by Scripture in the people to Ordain Ministers, why was <hi>Titus</hi> sent to <hi>Creete</hi> to Ordain Elders? why did the Apostles visit the Churches they had planted, to Ordain Elders in every Church? And why is <hi>Timothy</hi> commanded, To lay hands suddenly on no man, &amp;c. Some thing possibly may be said out of Scripture: For <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> there is <hi>ne <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> quidem in totâ Scripturâ.</hi> Surely, this way of Ordination by the people is a devise that hath neither ground for it in the Scripture, nor in all Antiquity. And for private Christians to assume, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a power to elect their own Ministers, that is, to nominate Persons to be made their Ministers (which we no wayes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or deny, so it be done in an orderly way by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Presbytery) but also to undertake, without Ordination, to become Publick Preachers themselves: and not onely so, but to send forth Ministers authoritatively to Preach the Gospel, and administer the Sacraments. This is a sin like unto the sin of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> and of <hi>Corah</hi> and his company. This is to make themselves Political Popes, and Antichristian Christians.</p>
                  <p>And therefore for the conclusion of all, we shall make bold to speak two things to all those that renounce their former Ordination by Ministers, and take up a new way of Ordination by the people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We would intreat them that before they find fault with our way of Ordination by Ministers, they would first of all justifie by the Canon of the Scripture, their new way of Ordination by the people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We would desire them, in the fear of God to consider; That whosoever renounceth Ordination by Ministers, must of nece ssity not onely renounce our Ministry, but
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30575:162"/>
all the Ministers and Churches Reformed in the Christian world, and as <hi>Constantine</hi> said to <hi>Acesius</hi> the <hi>Nova<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But we hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> better things of you, though we thus speak.

                  <p>For Bishops distinct from Presbyters have been (say they) in the Church of Christ for 1600. years and up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ward. And there never was any Ordination without them. And when <hi>Coluthus</hi> was Ordained by a Presbyter without a Bishop, his Ordination was pronounced null and void: And <hi>Aerius</hi> by <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Heretique, for holding (an <gap reason="foreign">

Nay <hi>Ierom</hi> himself saith, That a Bishop over Presbyters is an Apostolical Tradition, and that it began when some said, <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas,</hi> which was (say they) in the Apostles dayes.

                     <p>THat there were many corruptions which crept into the Church, in the very Infancy of it, and were generally received as Apostolical traditions, which yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

are not pleaded for by our Episcopal men, but many of them confessedly acknowledged to be errors and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes.

Rightly (saith <hi>Austin</hi>) do the Punick Christians call Baptisme by no other names but <hi>health</hi> and <hi>safety</hi>; nor the Sacraments of Christs body by no other then life: <hi>Vnde nisi ex antiquâ, (ut existimo) &amp; Apostolica tradi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And the same Author himself is of this opinion, saying; Before this advancing, these names, Bishops and Presbyters, were altogether of the same signification, and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration was common: because Churches were governed by the common advise of Presbyters.

<q>That there are great arguments drawn out of these Epistles themselves, betraying their insincerity, adulterate mixtures, and interpolations: So that <hi>Ignatius</hi> cannot be distinctly known in <hi>Ignatius.</hi> And if we take him in grosse, we make him the Patron (as <hi>Baronius,</hi> and the rest of the Popish writers do) of such rights and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, as the Church in his time cannot be thought to have owned. He doth indeed give testimony to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of a Bishop above a Presbyter; That which may justly render him suspected, is, that he gives too much Honour, saith he, the Bishop as Gods high Priest, and after him you must honour the King. He was indeed a holy Martyr, and his writings have suffered Martyrdom as well as he. Corruptions could not go currant, but under the credit of worthy names.</q>

                        <q>Because we read in the Apostles daies there were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Rom. 16.17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Schismes, 1 Cor. 3.3. &amp; 11.18. yet the Apostle was not directed by the Holy Ghost to Ordain Bishops for the taking away of those Schismes.

<q>Because the Holy Ghost, who could foresee what would ensue thereupon, would never ordain that for a remedy, which would not onely be ineffectual to the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of evil, but become a stirrup for Antichrist to get into the saddle. For if there be a necessity of setting up one Bishop over many Presbyters for preventing Schisms, there is as great a necessity of setting up one Archbishop over many Bishops; and one Patriarch over many Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, and one Pope over all, unlesse men will imagine that there is a danger of Schisme only among Presbyters, and not among Bishops and Archbishops, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to reason, truth, history and our own experience.</q>

the Apostles, yet all agree, that there was a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of some Persons; and so though the credit of the Catalogues be infirmed, yet the thing intended is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thereby: We grant, that a Succession of men to feed and govern these Churches, while they continued Churches, cannot be denyed; and that the Apostles and Evangelists, that planted and watered those Churches (though extraordinary and temporary Officers) were by Ecclesiastical Writers in compliance with the language and usage of thir own times, called Bishops; and so were eminent men, of chief note, presiding in Presbyteries of the Cities or Churches, called by such Writers as wrote after the division and distinction of the names of Presbyters and Bishops: But that those first and ancientest Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were Bishops in proper sence, according to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties description, invested with power over Presbyters and people, to whom (as distinct from Presbyters) did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the power of Ordination, giving Rules and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; we humbly conceive can never be proved by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick or competent Testimonies.

<q>As touching Priesthood in the Primitive Church, when vertue bore (as Ancient Doctors do deem,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:30575:177"/>
and Scripture in mine opinion recordeth the same) most room, there were no more Officers in the Church of God then Bishops and Deacons that is Ministers; as witnesseth, besides Scripture, <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Commentariesupon the Epistles of <hi>Paul.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But we shall give one instance instead of many that might be added. In the year 1537. there came out a Book called, <hi>The Institution of a Christian man,</hi> made by the whole Clergy in their Provincial Synod, set forth by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Kings Majestie, and approved by the whole Parliament, and commanded to be preached to the whole Kingdom, wherein speaking of the Sacrament of Orders, it is said expresly, That although the Fathers of the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church after the Apostles instituted certain inferiour degrees of Ministery; yet the truth is, that in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament there is no mention made of any other degree or distinction in Orders, but onely of <hi>Deacons</hi> or Ministers; and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or Bishops, and thoroughout the whole discourse makes Presbyters and Bishops one and the same. But of this Proposition we have had occasion to speak formerly, to which we refer the diligent Reader.</p>
                     <p>Now from hence it followeth inevitably, That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the judgments of our Episcopal Divines, Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy be the same Order of Ministry with Presbytery, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> it hath no more intrinsecal power of Ordination and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, then Presbytery hath. And that all that distinction that was put between them by Antiquity, was meerly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining the use and exercise of that power which was truly and really inherent in them. The <hi>actus primu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> was common to both, although for order sake the <hi>actus secundus</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the Presbytery. And this leads us to speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about the practise of Antiquity in the point of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Ministers: which is that in which we believe the Reader doth desire especially to be satisfied, and which is that for which we have undertaken this discourse about An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and in which our Adversaries do most triumph. For it is said by all Anti-Presbyterians, That the way of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:30575:177"/>
now in use is quite contrary to Antiquity, and that whatsoever is done in this kind without a Bishop over Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, is null and void. In answer to this we shall crave leave to hold forth these ensuing Propositions about Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, out of Antiquity (for as to what the Scripture saith, of that we have already spoken.)</p>

The same Authour proves this his Assertion thus; Because that a Bishop is intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally inabled to give Orders, not by his power of Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by his power of Order. And because a Presbyter hath as much of the Sacrament and character of Order (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Papists themselves) as a Bishop, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every Presbyter hath an intrinsecal power of giving Orders. Now that Episcopacy and Presbytery are one and the same Order of Ministry, and that that which is added in Episcopal consecration, whereby a Bishop is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from a Presbyter, is only a degree of dignity and eminency, and is neither the Sacrament of Order, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printeth

<q>Above Priesthood there is no superiour Order; no not the function of a Bishop or Archbishop.</q>
                           <hi>Armachanus</hi> saith,

                        <p>THat even during the prevalency of Episcopacy it was not held unlawful for a Presbyter to Ordain without a Bishop. A Presbyter had not onely an inherent power of Ordination, but in some cases he did actually Ordain. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> upon Eph. 4. saith, <hi>Apud Aegyptum Presbyteri consignant, si praesens non sit Episcopus.

them) of the consecration of the Eucharist. For this might be done by the Presbyter <hi>praesente Episcopo</hi>; But it must be understood either of confirmation, or (which is more likely) of Ordination, because <hi>Ambrose</hi> in that place is speaking of Ordination. But howsoever it is not much material. For Confirmation was restrained to the Bishop as well as Ordination; and if the Presbyter might confirm <hi>si desit Episcopus,</hi> then he might also Ordain.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hierome</hi> saith of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Bishops, <hi>Presbyteri unum ex se electum, in excelsiori gradu collocatum, Episcopum nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> &amp;c. That the Presbyters for many years did Ordain their Bishops. And certainly if it were not held unlawfull in Antiquity for Presbyters to ordain Bishops, much lesse could it be held unlawful for Presbyters to Ordain Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <hi>Forbes</hi> saith, That in all those Churches which are governed by the Common Councel of Presbyters without Bishops, <hi>Valida &amp; efficax est Ordinatio quae fit per impositionem manuum solius Presbyterii. Quin &amp; ubi est Episcopus, possunt Presbyteri Ordinare; consentiente, licet non simul manus impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nente, Episcopo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. <hi>Field</hi> of the Church, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. tells us;
<q>That Presbyters in some places, and at some times did impose hands, which when <hi>Gregory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> would whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have forbidden, there was so great exception taken at him for it, that he left it free again. And afterwards, Not onely <hi>Armachanus,</hi> a very learned and worthy Bishop, but, as it appeareth by <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales,</hi> many learned men in his time and before, were of opinion, that in some cases, and at some times Presbyters may give Orders, and that their Ordinations are of force, &amp;c.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that Ordination by Presbyters was held lawfull and warrantable by the ancient Church, appears further by these ensuing Arguments.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because the <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> who were but single Presbyters, had liberty by the Church to Ordain, if they had a licence, from the Bishop. That they had liberty appears from the

                           </gap>. From these two Canons we may collect these two observations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That before these Councels the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> did Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Presbyters without any licence at all from the Bishop of the City. Otherwise to what purpose are they inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That after these Councels they might Ordain by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a licence, which sheweth evidently that in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these Reverend Fathers, the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal power to Ordain derived to them from Christ. For a licence doth not confer a power to him that hath it not, but onely a faculty to exercise that power he hath.

                        <p>From these two arguments, and the quotations alledged, we may safely gather these conclusions:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there was a time when Presbyters did govern by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30575:183"/>
Common Councel, and did Ordain without Bishops. So saith <hi>Panormitan, Olim Presbyteri in communi regebant Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam, &amp; Ordinabant Sacerdotes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. That whole Nations have been converted to the faith and governed for hundreds of years without Bishops. This Conclusion is abundantly proved by D. <hi>Blondel, Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>de Ordinationibus,</hi> where he tells us, That <hi>Ioannes Major de ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis Scotorum lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. saith, <hi>Per Sacerdotes &amp; Monachos sine Episcopis Scoti in fide eruditi,</hi> That <hi>Ioannes Fordonius</hi> saith, <hi>Ante Palladi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The like he proves of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> For brevity sake we refer the Reader to the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when the Bishop was absent, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did consecrate.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That in <hi>Alexandria</hi> for almost 200. years the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters constituted and Ordained their Bishop.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That though by the Canons of the Church the power of Presbyters in Ordaining was restrained, yet it was the judgment of Antiquity, That every Presbyter hath <hi>actum primum,</hi> and an inward power to Ordain, and that though his power was impedited by the Canons, yet it was not utterly extinguished.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That when a Presbyter is made a Bishop, he hath no new power conferred upon him, but onely his former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints and impediments are removed, as saith <hi>Aureolus.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p n="8">8. That to this day it is the opinion of Schoolmen and Canonists, that the Pope may give liberty to a Presbyter to Ordain. From whence, saith Dr. <hi>Forbes,</hi> it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,

                        <p>That which by divine authority is to be done onely by Bishops, that neither Bishops nor Councels, nor Pope can commit to Presbyters that are not Bishops. <hi>Nam in jure Divino Papa non potest dispensare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But (according to the Judgment and practise of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity) The Pope may give the liberty and power of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Presb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the liberty and power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining is not by divine right belonging to Bishops onely, but may be lawfully done by others, the Papists themselves being Judges. And so much for our fourth Proposition.</p>

Not that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be finally concluded by the determination of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Traditions unwritten, or by the Fathers, or Canons of the Church, in this great Controversie, For, though we are amongst the number of those that do much <hi>reverence</hi> Antiquity; yet we do not <hi>Idolize</hi> it. For we know that the Ancient Church was much beguiled in receiving many things as Traditions <hi>Apostolical,</hi> which are confessed by all to have been <hi>Apocryphal. Irenaeus</hi>

                              <item>2.

                        <p>And now we hope, at last, we may safely conclude from all the Premisses, That the Way of Ordination which is now, for the present, in use in <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Scripture-Bishops,</hi> that is, <hi>Presbyters,</hi> is not onely lawful, but more desirable than the former way, because more agreeable to Scripture-patterne.
