         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a ſtraight charge, which that mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
giueth to his ſeruants in deliuering
to them his money, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Negotiamini donec veniam,</hi> The
conſideration whereof as it hath ſet all
Gods ſeruants formerly on worke, in
their times to turne &amp; put forth their
talents, that they might giue account with gain: ſo the great
vantage that they haue already gotten, cannot excuſe after
ſeruants, in after times from this ſpirituall traffique: what
though their receipts be leſſe? yet they carefully imploy what
they haue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that their maister alſo may receiue of them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
increaſe.</p>
            <p>And this is the cauſe, why we in like ſort, in conſcience of
this charge, at this time put our one talent into the banke,
which we haue heeretofore (for the moſt part) imployed in
our priuate Miniſtery; and would now with the fiſhers, when
fiſhes waxe ſcant at the ſhore, launch a little further into the
deepe; and with the Marchants, thriuing a little at home, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
further abroad, to try in other coaſts how wee can
make our markets. In this our preſent trauell, wee haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the manner of ſuch Traders, making proofe with
theſe new wares, what hope there will be of venting abroad
<pb facs="tcp:173371:5"/>
more of the ſame kind, which we are very ready to doe, and
that with ſpeed, if we may know them for the profit ſaleable;
but if otherwiſe, as we may ſaue further labor in this courſe,
ſo our loſſe ſhall not be much by ſo little: yea heereby we ſhall
gaine ſomewhat to our ſelues, euen a comfortable anſwere to
make at that day of account, that whatſoeuer our ſucceſſe is,
yet ſuch haue our endeuours beene, heereby to doe the beſt
good we can to the Church of God, and with the conſcience
of this wee haue hardened our foreheads againſt the many
cenſures of men, and ſet it as a brazen wall againſt them;
chooſing rather to be accounted of ſuch, fooliſh, vaineglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
affecting bookiſhnes, or any thing elſe, as pleaſeth them
in their ſalt humour to vtter, then that not doing the good
wee might, our owne conſciences ſhould condemne vs, yea,
God himſelfe, for euill and vnprofitable ſeruants.</p>
            <p>Now we haue entred vpon the book of the Pſalms, drawn
on hitherto by the great variety of documents and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſutable to all eſtates of men moſt plentifully contained
heerein, ſo that wee may boldly ſay, there is no condition of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in proſperity or aduerſity, peace or warres, health or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
inward or outward distreſſe, with many particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in all theſe kinds, but he ſhall finde ſome Pſalmes, which he
may thinke almoſt to haue beene compoſed vpon his owne oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
wherin he may praiſe God, pray vnto him, complaine
and open his particular griefes.</p>
            <p>And for direction heerein, wee referre thee to the diuers
Prefaces both of ancient and late writers, chiefly of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,
Baſil the great, Auguſtine</hi> and ſome others, who haue
commended this booke vnto vs, as a ſtorehouſe of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as an Apothecaries ſhop richly furniſhed with all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of ſpirituall medicines, by which we may haue remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all and euery our ſeuerall diſeaſes and infirmities. And
ſurely, as when <hi>Saul</hi> was troubled with an euill ſpirit, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
<pb facs="tcp:173371:5"/>
of his ſeruants, he ſought out one that might play on the
Harpe, and they found <hi>Dauid</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iſhai,</hi> who plaied
with his hand, and <hi>Saul</hi> was refreſhed, and had eaſe, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
ſpirit departing from him: ſo hath God giuen vnto his
Church the ſame <hi>Dauid</hi> ſtill, euen the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael,
to modulate, as on his harpe, theſe heauenly ditties, wherunto
if we reſort, to heare, read, ſing and meditate therein, our
restleſſe perturbations, inordinate affections and paſsions
whatſoeuer; which as ſo many euill ſpirits doe vexe vs many
times, ſhall thus depart from vs, and wee ſhall bee caſed and
refreſhed thereby.</p>
            <p>If any ſay now to vs, that very many haue moſt profitably
ſpent their trauell heerein, making expoſitions, annotations,
gloſſes, paraphraſes, enarrations, yea iust and compleat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
already, in which reſpect what vſe therefore is there of
further labours, heereby rather to ouerloaden the ſtudious,
than to profit them? We anſwer, that moſt true it is, not only
for this booke, but all parts almoſt of holy writ, God (his name
be bleſſed) hath ſtirred vp the harts of many his ſeruants, to
bestow their ſtrength, time, learning and meanes, not onely
to profit the preſent ages wherein they liued, but by their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

neither is it the current of a thouſand yeares
(ſhould the world ſo long endure) which ſhall preuent the
last man of all occaſions to bring ſomething to the perfecting
heereof. Or be it that all things are already found out of the
ancient, in ſuch compleat manner, that they can admit no

            <p>And this is that which we haue ſpecially endeuoured vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

more, as out of that ſmall treaſury that God hath put into our
earthen veſſels, to propoſe what we haue, whether old or new,
in that method and forme, which may be beſt &amp; moſt handy
to the readers vſe. For this purpoſe, to the Argument, the vſe
of the Pſalme, and the reſolution thereof prefixed in a table,
we haue ſubioyned a Paraphraſe with the text, and quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of other Scriptures ſeruing for the explanation thereof,
noted in the margines: wherein ſo neere as we could, we haue
endeuoured to expreſſe the meaning of the holy ghoſt, with
his owne more plaine phraſes and ſpeeches in other places; not
ſo much ſtudying to find out pleaſant words, as an vpright
writing,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 10.</note> euen the words of truth. Alſo to the explanation
of the words, are annexed the obſeruation of doctrines with
the ſeuerall vſes, that any one may ſee from what fountaine
they flow, and how thence deriued, And theſe are briefly ſet
<pb facs="tcp:173371:6"/>
downe without any further enlargement, more then the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of proofes, out of the holy Scriptures, and that to auoid

as <hi>Dauid</hi> elſwhere ſpeaketh of Gods word, that the entrance

may ſeeme to be taken out of the 145.
Pſalme, which is thus intituled, <hi>Tehillah
le Dauid.</hi> The Hebrewes call it the book
of Pſalmes, <hi>Sepher tehillim:</hi> and ſo is it
called by Chriſt himſelfe, Luk. 20. 42. It
is called <hi>Tehillim,</hi> that is, <hi>praiſes:</hi> for that
this booke containeth manifold praiſes and thankſgiuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. Yet not theſe things only, but alſo moſt ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and doctrines of faith, ſpirituall exerciſes of prayer
in al manner of aduerſitie, ſound reioycings in the Lord, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
conſolations to afflicted hearts, prophecies, and diuine
predictions of Chriſt and his Church; and all for the comfort
and edification of Gods people. It hath the title of <hi>Pſalmes,</hi>
for that theſe things herein contained were in the ſeruice of
the Law to be ſung with muſicall inſtruments: whereupon
the Greekes called the booke a <hi>Pſalter,</hi>

counted <hi>Dauids Pſalmes,</hi> becauſe the moſt of them are his,
though there bee beſides, many Pſalmes of other Prophets,
and holy men.</p>
            <p>By this title wee may learne,<note place="margin">What to learne from the title.</note> I. That the holy men of God
gaue themſelues to laud God, and to ſet foorth his praiſes.
II. That praiſes and thankſgiuing are a ſpeciall dutie, and
chiefly commended vnto vs, ſith they beare the title of the
booke, before all the reſt of the things therein contained.

III. That theſe Pſalmes are inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were deliuered vnto the Church by the Prophets
of God, <hi>Dauid</hi> and the reſt. This is approued by Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging
a ſaying out of one Pſalme, yet nameth the whole
book, confirming to vs the book of the Pſalmes, Luk. 20. 42.</p>
            <p>Which booke (as many thinke) was collected by <hi>Eſdras,</hi>
after the Iewes returne from the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and it
containeth holy ſongs, written by holy men of God vnto the
heauie and lamentable time of that wicked <hi>Antiochus.</hi>

diuide this whole booke into fiue parts thus. The I. from the

the 90. IV. from the 90. to the 107. V. from the 107. to the
end. Some other according to the penmen (which the holie
Ghoſt vſed, as they iudge) diuide them thus: I. To <hi>Dauid</hi>
124. <hi>viz.</hi> in order from the 1. Pſalme to the 41. then 51. and

breaketh foorth at length with this true concluſion, <hi>that the

                  <hi>our iudgements

               <p>That godlineſſe doth not ſtand of generalities,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> but of certaine
diſtinct parts, in which he that is godly doth exerciſe himſelfe: <hi>as

                  <hi>Therefore hereupon may be concluded:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> That where at leaſt

moued by that vn-erring ſpirit of God, as all holy men were,
2. Pet. 1. 20. 21. II. That the doctrine of the Goſpell of
Chriſt and his kingdome was no new doctrine, when he was
incarnate, which hee and his Apoſtles taught; but that pure
and moſt holy ancient truth deliuered before in the holie
Scriptures, as the word ſheweth, Luk. 24. 27. 44. Acts 26. 22.
