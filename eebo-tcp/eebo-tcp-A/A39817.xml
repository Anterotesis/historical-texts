            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of that Well-known and Often Experienced
MEDICINE
Fletcher's Powder.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Excellent Panacaea,</hi> is so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a Friend unto <hi>Decaying Nature,</hi> that whatever <hi>Vnnatural, Destructive,</hi> and <hi>Health-opposing Matter</hi> it shall meet within the Body of <hi>Man,</hi> be it from what Cause, Source, or Fountain it will, or in what parts soever (for it purifieth from Center to Circumference) it <note n="*" rend="inter">
                  <hi>Or the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assisted by it.</hi>
               </note> doth by its renovating quality (in time) radically extirpate and drive out, and in its place constitutes a Healthful Body (as hath been proved by Thousands in the City of <hi>London</hi>) having cured <hi>Head-aches, Vertigoes, Appoplexies, Lethargies, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilepsies, Convulsions,</hi> with all other Distempers that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually afflict the Head: as <hi>Difficulty of Hearing, Noise in the Head and Ears, Diseases of the Eyes, Teeth,</hi> &amp;c. Its also effectual in Opening all Obstructions of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Liver, Spleen,</hi> and all the Noble Bowels; expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Venoms offending the same: by which it cures <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,</hi> and <hi>Feavers</hi> of all sorts. It powerfully cures that loathsome Disease <hi>Ala mode d' Englettere,</hi> with all its Symptoms. It cures the <hi>Scurvey, Leprosie, Gout, Dropsie, Stone.</hi> It resists the <hi>Pestilence, Small-pox,</hi> and <hi>Measles.</hi> It expels Poyson, and hath done wonders upon those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which have been spoiled by <hi>Mercurial Medicines,</hi> too too often used (supposing therewith) to cure all foul and stubborn Diseases.</p>
            <p>For this New and Now Reigning <hi>Putrid Feaver,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

with Aguish Shiverings, Griping in the Guts, Vomitings, Giddiness, Violent Pains in the Head and Limbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (the which Disease may in all probability terminate in a Plague, unless repentance pacifie the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened Wrath.) This Medicine is excellent both for cure and prevention; and I dare and may boldly affirm, That no Man or Medicine hath cured so many of the aforesaid Disease as this Powder; as Thousands can witness.</p>
            <p>A safer or powerfuller <hi>Medicine</hi> cannot be given for <hi>Women,</hi> it being an <hi>Vniversal Remedy</hi> for those many Distempers that usually attend their Weak, Unhealthy, Cold, and Moist Bodies; all which I shall not name, but commend it as a Wonder-working Powder to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Miscariages in Women with-child; and when time of separation is near, to cause speedy and easie Delivery, and to ease the After-pains: And did all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men know what this Medicine hath performed in these Cases, there is none but would make use of it at such times, <hi>viz.</hi> both before the time of Travel, and after Delivery. In Virgins it speedily takes away the Cause of the <hi>Green Sickness,</hi> and those ill Habits of Body ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Obstructions, and causeth in them a Lively, Fresh, and Cheerful Countenance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To Children it is a most Potent Preservative, and cures them of <hi>Convulsions, Falling-Sickness, Worms, Small-pox, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sles, Rickets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It wonderfully dispos<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th Wounds (both Internal and External) to Healing, and in short time perfects the Cure; and for all Outward Wounds, taking this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, you need only wash the Sore Night and Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your Urine Warm, and bind it up to defend it from the Air. It cures all Swellings, Inflamations, and Pains of the Limbs. I have (without the use of any Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Application) cured Cancerated Breasts of long continuance; Gangrenous Tumours, Kings-Evil, and Fistula's to a wonder. In short, this Medicine is so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109054:2"/>
great a Friend to Nature, that no Disease (the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time for Dissolution being not yet come) is able to withstand its power; for against all Diseases there is a Remedy, but against Death none; but to this and all other (Good) Medicines, time must be given to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest their Effects: For many rash and inconsiderate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hearing of a Good Medicine, will without doubt be desirous to make a trial of it, and will also imagine, that as soon as they have taken it into their Bodies (or at farthest within two or three days) that their Infirmity or Disease, of what kind or degree soever, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity presently vanish and be gone, without any the least Sign or Relict of it remaining; which no inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious person must or will expect: but according to the Nature, Radication, Habit, and Continuance of the Distemper; with the Age, Strength, and Constitution of Body, Nature co-acting with the Medicine, expect the desired Effects in the Restauration of Health; which (by Gods Blessing and an orderly use of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine in due time) will be found. Now this Powder at some times, and in some Bodies, may work by Vomit, Stool, Sweat, and Urine, especially at the first taking of it; let not any therefore presently imagine this to be a common Medicine, and such Operations to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in all Bodies and at all times: No (rather) let them conclude (as justly and truly they may) such O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations to proceed from great quantity of Diseasie Matter Nature was filled and obstructed with, which would not easily be evacuated, without such Operations well to be tollerated or born with, in respect of the great benefit they will reap by it, <hi>viz.</hi>) the preventing some greater mischief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the truth of which I have had large experience; having known many on which it had such Operations at the first, but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and moderately repeated taking of it for (some time) by which their Bodies became emptied and freed rom that stubborn gross Matter, they afterwards felt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109054:3"/>
not the least trouble or manifest Operations, but if Nature makes a separation by Vomit, Stool, Sweat or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine (how forcible soever they seem to be at present) she is never weakned but strengthened, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which proves the Medicine to be friendly.</p>
            <p>But often doth this Excellent Medicine both prevent and cure a Disease without any of the before-mentioned Operations (as Experience testifieth) by keeping in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and pacifying (when enraged) the Vital Spirit in Man.</p>
            <p>Therefore the highest and noblest way of Cure, is by such Medicines as are exalted by Art to such a degree of Purity as makes them fit to (pacifie or) bring to quiet the Natural Spirit.</p>
            <p>For Preserving or Restoring of Health, consists not in taking of Poysonous Purges, Vomits, Fluxing with <hi>Mercury,</hi> or Torturing the Sick with Blisters, Cuppings, Issues, Bleedings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the end the Spirit being more enraged by such eminent dangers immediately threatning the Life, in hopes (by that means) it may throw out what was offending before; but in keeping it from fury, if not already provoked, or otherwise pacifying, if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, as aforesaid. And I appeal to all Ingenious Men, which of the two is the better Method; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is not friendly to the Life, either ingendred within, or assumed from without, brings sooner or later, the whole or part, into an inquietude.</p>
            <p>Consider, What is it that gives eminency to any one thing we esteem as Excellent, and we shall find that it is the Purity of it; if we consider then what we are speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, <hi>viz.</hi> A Medicine to help Nature, we must also conclude its efficacy and excellency to proceed from its purity or purified Nature; then consider what it is for. It is to help and restore Decaying Nature, or the Languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit in Man. Now this Spirit is the most subtile part of Man, therefore no way to be assisted, but by that which is of purity and likeness with it (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Medicine</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:109054:3"/>
of a Solar (or Gold-like) Nature, made by Art subtile, penetrable, and capable by its splendent Beam to dispel those Mists in the Air which clouds and darkens the Sun of the Little World Man; and he that hath such a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine as this (which every Physician ought to have) needs not so much mind the uncertain Indications, Diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks, and the like Verbal Impertinences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which serves only for ostentation.</p>
            <p>Now Courteous Reader, Consider whether this <hi>Solar Powder</hi> (which is so amicable to Nature, and cures Radicated Diseases by enlightning and enlivening the Natur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
