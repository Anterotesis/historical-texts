            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wife, by meanes of whiche money thei fell out,
and in fallyng out the saied Elleine in greate

            <p>2 The sonne of the foresaid Ellen Smithe,
<pb facs="tcp:19593:6"/>
of the age of thirteene yeres, or there aboutes,
came to the house of one Ihon Estwood of

a while after the said Estwood was taken with
very greate paine in his bodie, and the same
night followyng, as he satte by the fire with

thei thruste it into the fire, and so helde it in

well, and therefore I came to see how you did,
and so went her waie.</p>
            <p>3 Also it was auouched, and by this prisoner
confessed, that where as her daughter, and the

beyng doen, the Cradle rocked of it self, sixe or
seuen tymes, in presence of one of the Earle of
Surreis gentilmen, who seyng it stabbed his
dagger three or fower tymes into the Cradle
ere it staied: Merily iestyng and saiyng, that he

diuerse thynges, whiche she demaunded at
once, and also charged with the stealyng of a
Knife from thence, she wente her waie in
greate anger, and presently after her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the little childe of the saied Petie fell so

&amp;c. she asked the good wife how many
children she had, who aunswered one, whiche
childe beeyng then in perfite healthe, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
taken with suche a sweate and coldnesse
of bodie, and fell into suche shrickyng and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng,
wringyng and writhyng of the bodie to
and fro, that all that sawe it, were doubtfull of
the life of it.</p>
            <p>7 Item, she came on a tyme to the house of
Robart Cornell of Suersem, and craued a
Bottle of Milke of his wife, but beyng denied
it, she departed for a little while, leauyng her
owne Bottle behinde her, and tooke an other

<pb facs="tcp:19593:9"/>
after three daies she came againe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
her owne Bottle, and restored the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
crauyng Milke as before, the wife of the
house alwaies suspectyng her to bee a Witche
denied her requeste, and barred the doores a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her, wherevpon she satte doune vppon
her heeles before the doore, and made a Circle
vppon the grounde with a knife. After that she
digged it full of holes with in the compasse, in
the sight of the saied wife, her man, and her
maide, who demaundyng why she did so? She
made aunswere, that she made a shityng house
for her self after that sorte, and so departed, the
nexte daie the wife commyng out at the same
doore, was taken sicke, and began to swell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

as she feared she should burste: and to this daie
is not restored to healthe.</p>
            <p>8 Item, she came often to the house of one
Ihon Hopwood of Walden, and had contina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

Milke, yelded gore stinkyng blood, and one of
his Kine fell into suche miserable plight, that
for a certaine space, he could by no meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
her.</p>
            <p>Item, she came on a tyme to the Uicars
house at Wimbishe, and beyng denied her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rande
by his wife (he beeyng as then from
home) his little sonne in the Nurses lapp was
taken with suche veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sicknes, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
supposed no lesse, but it would straight
haue died, the saied Mother Staunton sittyng
by, and hauyng touched the child before it grew
sicke: but within one hower after the Uicar
came home the childe recouered perfectly, and
plaied as before.</p>
            <p>Item, also she came on a tyme to the house
of oue Rohart Lathburie, of the same Toune,

Hogges fell sicke and died, to the number of
twentie, and in the ende he burned one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
as he thinketh, he saued the reste: He also
had a Cowe straungely caste into a narrowe
<pb facs="tcp:19593:10"/>
gripe, and beyng holpen out in the presence of

the diligent care that was takn of her, she was
in fewe daies three tymes like to be loste in the
mite. And thus muche for Mother Staunton.</p>
