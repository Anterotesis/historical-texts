         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in the yeare of our Lord,
1611.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He foule brand which Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi>
hath laboured to set upon mee in
his preface, to wit, breach of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and charity, and defect of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
and common honesty, is
so scandalous to the person and
calling of a living Minister and
Pastor in Gods Church, that Mr.
<hi>Gataker</hi> in going about to set it on me, doth manifestly
appeare to have printed it deepely in his owne fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
The words of truth spoken of a dead man, in the
defence of a divine and saving truth, and in confuting
of a dangerous error can bee no such breach of piety or
charity, as the unjust scandall and slander laid on a man
living and labouring in the worke of the Lord: For
this tends to bring his Ministry and the word of God
by him preached into contempt; to disgrace his person
most uncharitably, and to adde affliction to him who
hath suffered persecution and bonds for the truths sake,
by wounding him deepely in his reputation, which is
contrary to humanity and common honesty.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> in his papers which he dispersed in this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64519:3"/>
Citie, and which he acknowledged to be his owne when
I brought them to his face before Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> and eight
other grave Ministers, doth deny the imputation of the
whole obedience of Christ, to the Law of God; both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and passive, both joyntly and severally. He affirmes
that there is no end or use whatsoever of the imputation
of Christ his righteousnesse for justification. He renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the law in whole and part, performed by our selves,
or any other in our stead for our justification. In stead of
mans owne workes of righteousnesse, performed to the
law in his owne person which was the condition of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and life in the first covenant, and instead of
Christs fulfillng of the law for us which is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of justification and life to beleevers in the covenant of
grace, he sets up faith, even the Act of beleeving for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
affirmes that it is said to be imputed in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
sense without a trope, and serves for all purposes in
our justification under the Gospell, as perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of workes performed to the whole law did for
mans justification in the first covenant. Hee denieth the
punishment of our sinnes in Christ, and the satisfaction
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. in him our head &amp; surety was made to Gods justice
for purchase of our pardon. For (saith he) I see no place
left for pardon, if we in Christ be said to have satisfied
Gods justice, &amp; to have suffered in him the punishments
due to sin; for pardon and punishment are contrary. Thus
he overthrowes our redemption by Christ, and that
Christ is our ransome, as <hi>Socinus</hi> did, (though hee hold
the words of Scripture with <hi>Socinus</hi> in an improper
sense; to wit, Redeemer, Ransome, Propitiation, and the
rest.) For no man can dreame of any other way by
which Christ is said in Scripture to redeeme us, and to
be a ransome for sinne, but onely by being made under
the Law, and a perfect fulfiller of it in our stead. If faith
serves for all purposes to justification, as a mans perfect
righteousnesse of workes performed to the full in his
owne person would have done in the first Covenant; then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64519:3"/>
it serves to this purpose to be our formall righteousnesse;
yea our owne inherent righteousnesse by which we are
justified. Which is most contrary to the truth of the
Gospell, and contradictory to his owne words in other
places. These and such like speeches I condemned for
<hi>Socinian</hi> Heresie and blasphemy, as <hi>Beza, Paraeus,</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi>
had done before me, and for this Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> did
deride me, when I gave in my charge against Mr. <hi>Wotton
27.</hi> yeares agoe, and now blames it in mee as falshood
and dishonesty. I desire no better defence of my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
but Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> owne confession in his Expositions
which Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> hath published for his defence. For in
his answer to the first proposition, he confesseth that the
denying of the imputation of Christs righteousnesse as
a meritorious cause of justification is both hereticall and
blasphemous. And this he himselfe doth in the words
which are cited out of his owne papers, to prove him
guilty of the first error, as you may see in the 12 page of
Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> defence, where they are thus laid downe and
translated out of Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> Latin Theses. <hi>No necessary use
or end can he assigned of the imputation of the obedience of
Christ to the justification of a sinner.</hi> And in an English
Manuscript of his, which I also shewed, and he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for his owne, he useth more peremptory words,
saying, <hi>I dare not admit of Christs righteousnesse imputed to any
end whatsoever. I find no testimony or proofe of it in any part
of Gods word, no signification in any Sacrament of the Gospell,
no necessary use or end thereof.</hi> Which words if we take them
as Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> hath related them, prove him to be an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike
and blasphemer by his owne confession. Unlesse
Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> can perswade us, that to be imputed as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
cause, is to be imputed for no end or use what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p>But before I proceede to my narration, I will first lay
downe the occasion, by which I have provoked Mr.
<hi>Gataker</hi> to proclame so bitterly against me, and to brand
me with breach of piety, charity, and defect of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64519:4"/>
and common honesty. In my discovery and confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Socinianisme I perceived that Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> disciples
did admire and extoll him as a deepe searcher out and
discoverer of divine truth, which none could ever find
out before him; To convince them of folly and ignorance
I rehearsed the names of severall persons who had publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and taught the same things before Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and
for them and other errors and Heresies which are therein
necessarily included, have beene condemned in former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
as <hi>Peter Abailard, Servetus, Socinus, Arminius,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> out of whose booke <hi>De Reconciliatione,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> stole his opinions. My words are these, <hi>The
fifth perverse publisher of this heresie, who first openly professed it
in England, and in manuscript Pamphlets, and printed bookes
dispersed it in London, and from thence into severall places of
the Countrie,</hi> about twenty eight yeares agoe, was <hi>Anthony
Wotton.</hi> I would gladly know what just offence can be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at any of these words. That Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
publisher of this heresie, and the first that openly
professed it in England, is a manifest truth; as my parallell
of him with <hi>Socinus</hi> published by Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> now in
print, proveth most fully.</p>
            <p>If he be offended, because I call this errour an heresie,
though he and his fellow Subscribers to Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
out of their great love to Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> person,
and upon his promise of reformation, did thinke it not
fit to call any thing in his exposition of his speeches, by
the name of heresie or blasphemie: I answer, first, that his
speeches which I cited in my parallell are manifestly
blasphemous and hereticall by his owne confession; and
of them and his opinion in them published, doe I speake
and call it heresie. Secondly, though I rather assent to
<hi>Beza, Paraeus, Lubertus,</hi> and other most learned and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Divines, who condemne some things in Mr.
<hi>Wottons</hi> expositions for heresie, &amp; blasphemie, rather then
to Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> and his fellowes, who were pleased to
thinke otherwise; I hope I give therein no offence, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64519:4"/>
seeing I have Gods Word for my warrant, and have
such cleare knowledge and full perswasion of the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie
of some of his speeches, That I did (as Master.
<hi>Downham,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> and others present at our meeting
did heare and see, and if their memories faile them not,
will confesse) challenge Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
if he would take his part to defend some passages in
those expositions, and promised that I would aske Mr.
<hi>Wotton</hi> forgivenesse on my knees, if I did not by convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
arguments in strict syllogismes prove them to be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall:
which they cowardly then refused with shew of
scornfull disdaine.</p>
            <p>But if Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> be so highly offended, because I
call Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> by the bare name of <hi>Anthony Wotton;</hi> I
must answer that therein I did him a favour. For under
that obscure title, his person might have beene hid, and
not made knowne to any, but those who were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with all the passages betweene him and me. But Mr.
<hi>Gataker</hi> by discovering him more plainly, and blazoning
his armes, hath exposed his person to much shame, and
stained the name and memorie of him long agoe dead
and buried in the dust with the brand of Heresie, &amp; hath
made all the world see, that he was the man who first
sowed these <hi>Socinian</hi> tares in the faire field of the Church
of England. As for my selfe, I am assured, that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my cause, which is the cause of God &amp; his truth,
will beare me out, &amp; justifie me against all his misreports.
And if any man be forestalled with prejudice and a sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
opinion of my proceedings against Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> let
him read this my relation, which I can justifie both by
living witnesses, and by my papers, which I have in my
custody untill this day.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> opinions were first made knowne
to me upon the occasion mentioned in my letter to Mr.
<hi>Wotton,</hi> which hereafter followeth; I by meanes of my
late reading of the controversies betweene <hi>Junius</hi> &amp; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,
Lubertus, Bertius, Gomarus,</hi> and others of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64519:5"/>
did easily discerne them to be of the same
stampe with the heresies of <hi>Servetus,</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> newly
revived and set on foote in <hi>Holland</hi> by <hi>Vorstius, Arminius,</hi>
and those of that faction. I shewed Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> papers to
Mr. <hi>Alexander Richardson</hi> a most learned and judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
to whom for his singular learning in Divinity, and
all other learned Arts, and excellent knowledge in the
originall tongues of holy Scripture, divers studious
young men did resort from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to his dwelling in
the parish of <hi>Barking</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> to be directed in their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Divinity, and other arts: among which these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
men of good note in our Church, Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Chauncey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Yates,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Barlow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perry,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Mr. <hi>Richardson</hi> approved my censure of them, and
so detested them that he could not read one passage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sighing. He also sent to Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> to meete him in a
conference before some judicious hearers, which Mr.
<hi>Wotton</hi> promised, but did not performe. I also sent and
desired that he would admit me, to come to him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
with him; but as he was afraid to meete Mr. <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardson,</hi>
so he disdained my youth and yeares, and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me to one <hi>Spencer</hi> a tradesman, a factious Disciple of
his, as I have objected to him in my letter: upon this I
preached two sermons in the Church of which I am now
Pastor, in the one I laid open breifly, the true received
doctrine of justification; in the other I discovered Mr.
<hi>Wottons</hi> opinions to be <hi>Socinian</hi> heresie, and shewed the
danger of them. The next day some of Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> friends
being startled came to me, and intreated me to goe with
them to him, and promised that he should purge himselfe
from those errors, and give me good satisfaction: I yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to their desire, and went along with two of them to
Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> house, who welcomed me coldly in words,
though his heart seemed by his countenance to be hot
with indignation and disdaine. At my first entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Studie he told me very abruptly, that I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly
affirmed that the whole streame of learned Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64519:5"/>
Divines did hold the same doctrine which I had
taught concerning justification by Christs righteousnesse
imputed to beleevers. And withall he shewed a place out
of <hi>Luther</hi> upon the Galatians, in which <hi>Luther</hi> denyed
justification by our owne workes and righteousnesse of
the law: but in the words which next followed upon the
top of of the next page, (which Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> covered with
his fingers as he held the booke in his hand) <hi>Luther</hi> in
plain words affirmed that Christs fulfilling of the law for
us is our righteousnes; &amp; in the same page also saith, that
faith is not sufficient for righteousnes without Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Christs righteousnesse. I snatched the booke
out of his fingers, read the words, which were directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himselfe, blamed him before the two witnesses for
his dealing <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lo malo,</hi> and going about purposely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
us, and with great compassion and teares in mine
eyes professed my griefe to see him, a man of great esteeme
(whom I had never seene before, but had much reverenced
for the reports which I had heard of his great learning)
to play the prancke of a deceiver and jugling Sophister.
After many words which passed betweene us, but in no
strict forme of disputation, which I desired and M. <hi>Wotton</hi>
refused; he confessed that my doctrine, which I taught
concerning imputation of Christs righteousnesse, was
sound and saving truth, able to save beleevers, though
they went no further: but he had dived more deepely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the poynts of justification, and did goe further, but
not a contrarie way; But I protested against his opinion
and told him it was as contrarie to my doctrine and
faith, as darknesse is to light. Mr. <hi>Standish</hi> one of the
witnesses who went along with me, desired me to rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
and to breake off; to which I yeelded, and tooke
my leave. And no sooner were we entred into the streete,
but the said Mr. <hi>Standish</hi> brake out into speeches of dislike
against Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> fraudulent dealing, protested that he
would never hearken to his opinion and doctrine in
these points any more, and that he was much comforted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64519:6"/>
and confirmed by that acknowledgment of the truth
which I at length did wring from Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> owne
mouth. The second day after this I went to Cambridge &amp;
returned not to London till three months after; in which
time what lyes were dispersed in London concerning my
apostasie to Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> errors, my letter to him sheweth.</p>
            <p>The next yeare after I came to be setled in my pastorall
charge, and because I found some in my parish much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> opinion out of respect to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
more then any knowledge, being not able to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reason for it at all, I spent many Sabbaths in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the doctrine of justification out of the fifth chapter of
the Epistle to the Romans; and in discovering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
all errors contrarie to the truth professed in the
reformed Churches, and amongst the rest the errors of
<hi>Socinus:</hi> What affronts were offered me in the Church &amp;
what clamours raised against me in the citie, my letter to
Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> will tell you in part. I could rehearse many
passages which would move laughter and discover the
absurditie and ridiculous folly of divers people who
were factiously addicted to admire all things in Mr. <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
good or bad; I will Instance in one example onely. It
was this. I was requested to preach at Black-friers on a
Wednesday in the absence of Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> some weekes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had finished my text concerning Justification. In that
assemblie, there were many ancient professors of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who knew me not by face, and who were so taken
with my Sermon, that they were verie inquisitive to
know my name, and hearing that I was Pastor of Saint
<hi>John Evangelists,</hi> and my name <hi>Walker,</hi> they were so pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with an evill opinion of me by the slaunders and
railings of Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> and his disciples, that they cryed,
Hang him, he will be hanged before he come to preach
such a godly Sermon as this is, we will never beleeve that
this is that <hi>Walker</hi> which hath preached against that
man of God, Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> and belyed him in the pulpit.
My Clerke being well acquainted with them, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64519:6"/>
did affirme to them that I was the man, and told
them that they themselves might easily come to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in hell, if they did not repent of their wicked railings
against me so unjustly: By this you see what wrong I suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and what hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t shamelesse slaunders of wicked hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
may doe to the good name of the most innocent,
even among them that are religious. These &amp; such injuries
and reproaches heaped on me together with a ridiculous
booke written against me by one <hi>Spencer</hi> a disciple of Mr.
<hi>Wotton,</hi> forced me to write a challenge in my letter to Mr.
<hi>Wotton,</hi> by which I at length brought him to the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
which is the subject of M. <hi>Gatakers</hi> invective against
me. This letter, because it containes a just complaint and
a rehearsall of the ill behaviour of M. <hi>Wotton</hi> and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
towards me, I have thought good here to insert,
that the world may see the intolerable provocations,
wherewith I was provoked to call M. <hi>Wotton</hi> to account,
before some brethren in the Ministery equally chosen by
both parties.</p>

                  <p>SIr, my hearty desire, and prayer to God for you is,
that you may repent and be saved. And as I doe, and
by the grace of God will continually pray to God for
you, so long as there is any hope: So now also I will not
spare to exhort you, and in the bowels of Jesus Christ
beseech you, (yea if neede require) by thunderings and
threatnings of Gods heavy judgements, proceed and goe
forward to puty ou in feare, that if it be possible you may
repent, and recant, and that the errors and thoughts of
your heart may be forgiven; for I perceive that you are
in the gall of bitternesse and in the bonds of iniquitie.
You will perhaps say, A sharpe and a fierce onset, who

I am perswaded in my soule, that yours is; and upon my
conscience, and before God I speake it, whom I know to
be the searcher of all hearts. Wherefore though an heart
settled in error, and over-runne with perverse affection
cannot brooke any sharpe reproofe, but will hate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proover,
according to that saying of the wise man, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove

I am not ignorant that by my former both writing and
preaching against your errors, and by my fervency and
vehemency of words I have troubled, and vexed you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would I have you thinke, that I have thus dealt with
you upon any distempered affection or such like infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
I professe ingenuously that I have done it upon good
deliberation and of set purpose, because I have judged, &amp;
doe yet still deeme that course to be the best for divers
reasons. First, because I knew that the errors and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                        </gap>us</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> those most damnable and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
heretickes, the greatest monsters that ever were borne
within the borders of Christs Church, as I can plainly
shew by your owne writings and theirs compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and would have already shewed, if you had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to joyne with me in a Christian conference before
eight learned and godly Ministers. Now being perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
yea knowing that your opinions are so dangerous,
&amp; pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nicious; do you not thinke that I am bound before
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64519:7"/>
God to lay them open, and to inveigh against them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of Gods Prophets, whose fashion hath
ever beene to brand lesse sinnes then these, and lesse dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
errors, with the name of abomination, blasphemy
sorcery, witch-craft, and such like?</p>
                  <p>The second reason of my fervency is godly jealousie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I see that you labour by all meanes to draw mens
hearts from the love of the truth of my God generally
professed unto your errours, and that many who are
grounded in knowledge of good things, are so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with a conceit of you, and affection to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that rather then they will forsake you, they will
forgoe the truth; this being (as you know) the ground
upon which all heresies have beene builded, and the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
meanes by which they have beene dispersed, and
have gotten head, and made factions in the world, in all
ages heretofore. Can you blame me, whom God hath
called to be a watchman over his flocke, if I be jealous
over you, and if for love to my God and his truth, and
the salvation of his people, I doe bring you, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of my power, into just disgrace with them, by
uncovering your shame, so farre as may stand with equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and conscience, and by painting out your errours
in most ugly manner, for the terrifying of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from medling with them?</p>
                  <p>The third reason, and indeed the greatest of all, is
your obstinacy, arrogancy, pride, perversenesse, fraud;
and dissimulation, the speciall markes of willfull here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes;
all which I have good reason to suspect in you,
yea, (if we may know a man by his fruites and workes)
I know and have tryed to be deeply rooted in you. And
that you may know I speake upon judgement, not in
affection, I will name some particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, when I first heard of your errors by one of your
near<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> disciples, I observed in him such forwardnesse to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> before me, being to him a stranger, such
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> in urging and maintaining them, with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64519:8"/>
no other arguments then your authority, whom he so
odiously compared with all learned and godly Divines,
chiefe pillars of our Church, as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Whitakers,
Perkins,</hi> and others; that he was not ashamed to call
them foolish boyes in comparison of you; not worthy
to carry your bookes; whereupon I conceived present
suspicion, that these grosse and stinking sins did proceed
from some secret sparkes of hellish fire, either by you sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
or by him foolishly conceived, and that such a
malicious and rayling spirit was not free from grosse
errour. And therefore for mine owne better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I desired to conferre with you, and to learne from
you the substance of your opinion, and according to
my small ability, to reason and dispute the question with
you, if so be you held as he affirmed; the message he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
tooke upon him, and promised to bring me to
you, to conferre in a kinde and friendly manner, (for
that was my desire, for the reverence I did beare to your
person, being then, by report of others onely, knowne
to me:) But I found your answer farre differing from
that which I expected, I looked for the spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
humility, love, gentlenesse, and had good hope
to be admitted into familiarity, and acquaintance with
you; And you in scorne sent me to one <hi>Spencer,</hi> a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of ill report among all honest men; who all with
one voyce, when I inquired after him, told me, he was
a vaine idle giddy-headed fellow, and so I now finde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and his owne hand-writing shall testifie unto the
world. If this be not an infallible token of your pride
and scornefulnesse, let the world judge, thus to send a
Minister of the Gospell in contempt to one of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
to learne of him, as if you thought your selfe
too high, and all others too base to be admitted to your
presence.</p>
                  <p>This your doing, when I complained to you of it,
face to face, you excused, as done out of ignorance of
mine intent and desire. Afterwards, you for shame ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64519:8"/>
denyed it, and sent about your disciples to disprove
my report of it. And now lastly, you have againe so
justifyed it, that you are not ashamed to say, you did
me no wrong, in affirming that <hi>Spencer</hi> understands the
Doctrine of Justification better then I; And that your
pride, obstinacy, and perversnesse, might shew it selfe
to the full; you still goe on from worse to worse, and
now you have set <hi>Spencer</hi> to confute me, and to make
a challenge; whose writing will (I hope) be the utter
ruine either of your errours, or of your selves. All ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
men to whom I shew it, are ready to stop their
noses at the first sight and smell of the stinking folly,
blindnesse, and ignorance, wherewith almost every line
is stuffed, so miserably doth he beate himselfe, and eate
the flesh of his owne arme, saying, and unsaying, lying
and mistaking every point: These courses, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
whether they argue and convince you of pride,
obstinacy, and perversenesse, I leave to the judgement of
others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when (after my first Preaching against your
errours for the satisfaction of some who were wavering
and doubting) one of your disciples brought me unto
you, did not I then shew all patience, love, and good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
towards you? Did not I beseech you with teares
to be silent in these points, till you had further sifted
them, and throughly disputed them with others? Did
not you use me scornefully, and goe about to wrest a
place in <hi>Luthers</hi> Commentary on the <hi>Galations,</hi> and out
of it to prove that <hi>Luther</hi> denyed the imputation of
Christs Righteousnesse to us; and this against your
owne conscience? For by a marke of your owne making
in the same page, I was directed to words in the same
page, in which he plainely disproved you, and this you
would have smothered by covering the place with your
fingers, till I plucked the booke from you. Did not I
patiently put up this, though it wounded my soule? and
did not this your dealing <hi>dolo malo,</hi> shew your fraud, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64519:9"/>
forgery, and that you are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
being damned of himselfe? If you deny this, God
is my witnesse and mine owne conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your booke
also, and the marke in the marg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>against
you; and besides, I have another witnesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
who was there present.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, after my departing for a time into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
your disciples thinking I had quite left the City,
did most falsely and abominably report abroad, that you
did so put me downe by arguments, that I with teares
acknowledged mine errour, and vowed to live and dye
in your opinion. How wicked and false this was, you,
and I, and they who were present, know; I am sure that
never did the Papists and Jesuites more falsly slander <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
and <hi>Beza,</hi> then they did me in this report. If these
be not the arts of the devill, the Father of lyers, let all
Christians judge.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, after my returne out of the Country, when
they saw their lyes discovered by my open profession, and
constancy in the truth which I had Preached; they and
you were so farre from shame and amendment, that you
made me amends with all rayling, and reviling speeches,
insomuch that in many mens mouthes, I heare your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous
exclamations, in which you call me in asse, a
sot, a boy, an impudent and brazen-faced fellow; yea,
your disciples have not beene afraid to make mowes at
me, Preaching in the Pulpit, as mine eyes, and the eyes
of divers others did often see and can testifie, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
have they cryed out in the Church, and derided me,
and scoffed at the word of God, by me delivered, and
that so loud, that all round about have heard, and been
offended. And yet all this I have endured, though the
Law was in my hand, to make them be apprehended,
brought before the Magistrate, and punished; and for
all this, there is no remorse nor amendment. Shall I,
nay, can I (thinke you) in this case judge any better of
them, then as of wilfull heretickes, and blasphemers, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64519:9"/>
of your Doctrine, which leades them into this excesse,
then as of devillish heresie? For the Doctrine which I
delivered and they derided, did not in one sentence differ
from the doctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and all learned Divines, as
by my papers and notes shall appeare.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for I will not repeate all particulars, (which
were an endlesse worke) you still goe on in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and send out pamphlet after pamphlet, full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
and falsifications, as I can shew you to your
face. You will neither conferre before any of our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Brethren, godly Ministers privately; nor publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before the Reverend Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> You dare not
commit yourselfe to him, because he is a wicked Judge,
and will respect persons in Judgement, my friends are
too potent with him: these are your excuses; and I
know them all to be false. For so cunningly did you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
with that good Bishop, and hide your errours,
that he rather blamed me, than you, (as I heare.) Can
you therefore in conscience blame me, if I, for these,
and such like reasons, thinke hardly of you, as of an
Heretique, and though my zeale doe burne against you
like a fire, though I cannot without griefe looke upon
you? May not a Christian Minister; nay, is he not bound
in conscience being thus perswaded, to cry out against
you, and to lift his voyce like a trumpet, and make men
know your abominations? yea, to threaten hell, destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and all curses against you, except you repent?
Surely my conscience doth not accuse me of any thing
which I have done in this cause; I have the examples
of the Prophets to warrant and encourage me, and to
justifie my doings. If you will stop my mouth, you
must either by words or deeds perswade me to thinke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
and I promise you I will; yea, I desire to be
otherwise perswaded, if you will but purge your selfe
from the crimes whereof you are openly convicted.
Wherefore I will once againe intreate you, and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
request you, yea, charge you in the name of Iesus
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64519:10"/>
Christ, that if you desire the peace of the Church, and
can abide to have the truth tryed, you will cast off those
carnall and corrupt, yea hellish affections of pride and
disdaine, or at least this show of them which appeareth
in you; and meete me as a Christian before eight godly
and learned Ministers, chosen equally by both, that they
be witnesse betweene you and me; and that it may be
seene whether I doe justly charge you with heresie and
blasphemy or no; and whether your writings doe not
shew you to be a <hi>Socinian.</hi> The foure Ministers which
I will chuse for my part, shall be Mr. <hi>Stocke,</hi> Mr. <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
Mr <hi>Westfield,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gouge.</hi> I professe, and take
God to witnesse, that I desire your conversion, not your
confusion. It is my love and zeale for truth, more then
hatred or indignation against you, which makes me so
hot and earnest against your errours.</p>
                  <p>The first offence that ever you gave me, was the injurie
which you have done to the obedience, righteousnesse
and blood of our Saviour Iesus Christ, whom you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
to be so made mine, that his obedience is imputed
to me for righteousnesse, and his blood for the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Gods justice. For this (if you obstinately persist
in it) I must hate you with a perfect hatred, as if you
were mine enemie, neither shall there ever be peace so
long as your errors are so great, and pernicious. God
himselfe I am assured, will trouble you, And quickely
confound you, except you repent. O consider therefore
from whence you are fallen, and suspect your selfe. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
that faith be sufficient for you, which hath saved so
many Saints of God, and for the which so many godly
and noble Martyrs have heretofore shed their blood,
even in this place, and in this Kingdome? Me thinks that
the name of <hi>Servetus,</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> should terrifie your
conscience, if it were so tender as you have heretofore
professed. Can you hope for any good or pure water,
from such foule and polluted Cisternes, full of all heresie
and blasphemie?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64519:10"/>
O that you would but lay these things to your heart,
and be moved! My heart, I assure you, is open to imbrace
you with all love, if you would truly repent; God forbid
that I should hate you any otherwise, then as you are
the enemy of Christ. And God forbid, that I should give
you one <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or God save you, if you persist in this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
which is so contrarie to the wholsome doctrine of
salvation. Wherefore, if now you will shew but one signe
of amendment by yeelding to my request, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a time and place where we may meete, I will much
relent from my Iealousie over you, and I hope that God
will give good successe. But if I finde you so incurable,
that you will not admit of the least meanes, which tends
to the cure of your soule, but will still upon no grounds
at all persist in your novelties, and publish them for the
seducing of others, to the overthrow of Gods ttuth, and
the disturbance of the Church: I doe thinke my selfe
bound in conscience to forbeare no longer, but to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
your errours to the world, that all may see those
many errours, blasphemies and contradictions, which
I have faithfully gathered out of your owne words and
writings. And because you doe goe about by your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple
<hi>Spencer</hi> to challenge me, and to debase my calling
and Ministery, by laying false imputations upon me,
as ignorance, slander, and the like: I have resolved to
draw articles against you, and to collect your errours,
and misdemeanours into one supplication, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it to the Lord Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his Grace,
and to the High Commission, that there and before them
it may be tryed and seene, whether you doe not jumpe
with <hi>Socinus</hi> in his heresie. I know and have traced you
in all your <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> trickes, and distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and if you trust to them you are deceived. If you
compell me to take this last, and most desperate course
with you, and if it turne to the subversion and ruine of
your whole estate, and of your selfe and your disciples:
blame your selfe, and not me. For you see I admonish
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64519:11"/>
you first, and it is in your owne hand to prevent it. I
am loath to be a meanes of your open shame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but if no better will be, <hi>Melius est ut pereat unus,
quam unitas.</hi> Our Saviour Christ (you know) gave this
commandement, that when you will not be privately
admonished, then we must tell the Church, Sure I am,
that if you be once brought in publicke, and persist in
your errours; you shall perish, and your blood shall be
on your owne head: But on them that put away shame
from <hi>Israel,</hi> and are instruments to roote out heresie from
the Church, and on their seed, and on their house shall
be peace for ever from the Lord. The God of power and
strength give you an heart to feare his judgements, and
to hearken to them that admonish you in his name; And
if it be his will I pray that you may be converted in his
good time, that the truth may flourish, and the peace of
our Church may be surely established unto the end of
the world. Thus you see I have opened my minde free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto you. If I be deceived in you, it is <hi>error amoris,
non amor erroris,</hi> I will so soone as I perceive it, change my
stile, and mine affection towards you. I pray you let
me have your answer as shortly as you can; if you send
not quickly, I will take it for granted that you scorne
to hearken to me, and despise my Christian admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as heretofore you seeme to have done; and I will
proceed in my resolution against you. God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
I desire your good, and the good of his Church.
If I were not carefull of your safety, I would not steale
this time from my nights rest and sleepe, this Sabbath
day at night, after my body is wearyed with reading,
Preaching, and administring the Lords Supper.</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64519:11"/>VPon the receipt and reading of this Letter, Mr. <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
sent me a Letter of defiance, and therein profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his scorne and disdaine of my threatnings: but the
next day he sent me another, wherein he promised to
yeild to my motion. And yet to prevent our meeting,
he used meanes by Mr. <hi>Mason,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Londons</hi>
Chaplaine, an Arminian, to make it knowne to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
in hope that he would forbid our meeting: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Bishop gave way, and we did meete up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a day appointed, before the eight Ministers named in
Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> defence. I brought for me, Mr. <hi>Stocke,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Downham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Westfield,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> now Doctors.
He brought for him, Mr. <hi>Balmeford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Randall,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Gataker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hickes,</hi> the last of which appeared to
be already of Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> minde in all points. And both
Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> and be, bare themselves towards me, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
an adversary, and as advocates for Mr. <hi>Wotton.</hi>
Dr. <hi>Westfield</hi> being the onely man with whom I then had
any great familiarity, did perceive a generall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them all, to favour Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> as much as they
could, being all his old familiar friends, and I a stranger of
two yeares residence in the City; after our first meeting,
refused to meete any more, fearing what followed, and
I chose Dr. <hi>Baylie</hi> in his place.</p>
            <p>I being the Plaintiffe and procurer of the meeting, did
first shew what I desired, namely, that I might have Mr.
<hi>Wottons</hi> writings, which were come to my hands, viewed;
and by Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> acknowledged; which he could not
deny, but did confesse them to be his owne handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke.
And that I having rehearsed Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> words
out of his bookes and writings, which I had in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
confuted, under the name of <hi>Socinian</hi> heresies, and
having paralleled them in writing, with the words of
<hi>Socinus,</hi> and made them appeare to be the same, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and comparing the bookes and writing; They
would give me their hands to my parallell, and subscribe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64519:12"/>
that I had not either charged Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> with any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
or words but his owne, or confuted under the
name of Socinianisme any words of his, but onely
those wherein he did concurre with <hi>Socinus.</hi> If I had
either mis-related his words, or confuted under the name
of Socinianisme, any point wherein he did not jumpe
with <hi>Socinus,</hi> I desired them to censure me. The Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llels
being read and examined, appeared to some of
them so cleare, and my charge so just, that the same day
at Mr. <hi>Randall Wetwoods</hi> table, where Dr. <hi>Baylie</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Downham</hi> dined with me, the Doctor did protest that I
had discovered Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> to be as damned an hereticke
as ever did tread on English ground: Mr. <hi>Downham,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Wetwood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hopkins</hi> were eare-witnesses
of this, and all yet living, as well as my selfe.
Mr. <hi>Wetwood</hi> asked why they did not justifie me and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him without more adoe, seeing that was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of our meeting, that they should judge of things
accordingly as they were proved. They pretended that
they desired to convert, not to confound Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> that
they perceived him to be afraid of shame like to fall on
him, and that if I would yeeld to let him expound
himselfe, he would by a wrested exposition gaine-say,
and contradict his former words and opinions and run
from them, which being gotten from him under his
hand, they would either hold him to it, or shame him
for ever, if he did fall backe againe. This course being
Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> device, I refused to yeeld unto, because I
had never opposed him, but onely in opinions former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
published, and not in future expositions, and because
I had fully proved my charge, I desired their verdict and
just judgement. But after much importunity I yeelded,
and so lost my cause, and was drawne into a new busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that was to contend with Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> not about
his former opinions, which I had formerly confuted;
but about new expositions, which he would make
in answer to my parallells. At another day appointed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64519:12"/>
he brought his expositions, which when they had read
in my hearing, I did except against divers passages in
them, and some contradictions, which I desired to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
against, with Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> face to face, in strict syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logismes;
but he refused to answer me, and our Judges
refused to heare me, or to suffer me to have a coppy of
his expositions, as he had of my parallels.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I protested against their unequall dealing,
and departed, threatning to bring him and them before
higher Judges. After that they had read the expositions
which Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> did plead for most hotly, Mr. <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
promised to make and publish a large declaration,
wherein he would free himselfe from all Socinian errors.
In the meane time he begg'd this favour, that they would
subscribe to his expositions, that they found no heresie
or blasphemy in them. Upon this promise and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they did subscribe as followeth.</p>

            <p>THE Expositions thus subscribed, were commtited
to Doctor <hi>Baylie,</hi> with charge that he should keepe
them close, and not suffer me or any other man to see,
or read them, untill Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> had made a larger Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and fully purged himselfe from Socinianisme.
By which it appeared, that they durst not openly justifie
their subscription, nor suffer it to come into my hands.
And that it was a thing with much importunity wrung
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64519:13"/>
from them which the better part of them would never
have yeelded unto, but upon promise of a better and
larger exposition, and in hope to draw Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from his errors; some of which he had allready con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted,
and acknowledged to be hereticall and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous,
to wit, his denying of Christs Righteousnesse
imputed for any use or end whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bayly</hi> the first of the Subscribers had (upon the
first reading of those speeches of Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> which I
shewed out of his owne writings, and did parallell them
with <hi>Socinus)</hi> condemned Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> for an heretike,
and his errors for blasphemie. Mr. <hi>Downham</hi> heard his
censure uttered at Mr. <hi>Wetwoods</hi> table, and by silence
assented to it. Mr. <hi>Randall</hi> did argue verie hotly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> opinions that same day that they
subscribed, and told him before as all, that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
against them often in private, and had disswaded
him from them; and that he for his part abhorred them.
Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> hath publikely confuted them, and in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
condemned them under the name of <hi>Socianisme.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Stocke</hi> did ever abhorre them, as he often told me in
private. And one time, I by a prettie Stratageme
brought him before other witnesse, to condemne them
for heresie and blasphemie. Mr. <hi>Wetwood</hi> mine host in
whose house I then lodged, having by much importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
obtained of Dr. <hi>Bayly</hi> the sight of Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
subscribed, as you heard before, and committed
to his custodie, did lend them to me for the space of two
houres, till I had copied out both them, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
word for word with the mens names, which
copie I have yet to shew.</p>
            <p>And one Sunday at night being invited to supper by
Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodyeare,</hi> my parishoner, I brought it with
me to shew it to Mr. <hi>Goodyeare,</hi> who was verie desirous to
see and read it. Mr. <hi>Stocke</hi> and his wife being at the same
time invited came in while we were reading it together
And seeing me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> in my hand, asked what
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64519:13"/>
it was. I answered that it was a paper of new and
strange opinions, which when he desired to heare, I did
read to him that passage in Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> Expositions,
where he saith; This I say, that in this proposition
(Faith is counted for Righteousnes,) the word <hi>(Faith)</hi>
is to be taken properly, not tropically; and I asked him
what he thought of it: He not knowing that it was Mr.
<hi>Wottons</hi> Exposition, out of which I read it, did answer
that it was Popery, or worse. I asked him whether he did
not thinke it to be the heresie and blasphemy of <hi>Socinus:</hi>
he answered, yes verily. I asked him then what hee
thought of certaine learned Divines, who had subscribed
to this, and other such speeches, that they were neither
heresie nor blasphemy: He said he thought none but mad
men would doe it, and asked who they were. I present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read the subscription and among the rest his owne
name, and withall shewed him the copy. Mr. <hi>Goodyeare</hi>
laughed heartily, and said to Mr. <hi>Stocke,</hi> O Master, our
Parson is too cunning for you, I never saw any man so
finely taken in a snare, as hee hath taken you in your
owne snare. I have ever told you, that in this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
you were too partiall for your old friend and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Mr. <hi>Wotton.</hi> Mr. <hi>Stocke</hi> could plead nothing but
this, That Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> had promised them to silence
himselfe and his disciples in these points, and to write
a large declaration; whereby he would purge himselfe
fully from Socinianisme. In hope whereof they did gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
him with this subscription, for the suppressing of
clamours, till he had further cleared himselfe. But Mr.
<hi>Wotton</hi> had broken his promise, and boasted of that which
made nothing for him in the maine cause, but onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the by; and had requited their favour towards him,
with disgrace to them, and danger to himselfe; and that
it had beene better he had never beene borne, then to
trouble the Church of God with his false opinions. By
this you see how dangerous a thing it is, even for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, to be judges in a cause of controversie betweene a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64519:14"/>
familiar friend (as Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> was to these men) and a
stranger, as I at that time was to the most of them.</p>
            <p>As for the other three, to wit, Mr. <hi>Balmeford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Hickes,</hi> they were Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> advocates,
rather then equall Judges: Mr. <hi>Balmeford</hi> was Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi>
silenced brother; Mr. <hi>Hickes</hi> was Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> disciple,
one who would <hi>jurare in verba Magistri;</hi> Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi>
did more angrily and peevishly speake against me, and
snarle at me then my adversary Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> himselfe, so
that I was forced to challenge him as well as Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi>
and to offer to dispute against them both.</p>
            <p>What Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> intent was in begging such a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
subscription, and Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> in procuring it
from the rest, the event hath shewed. For Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi>
and his disciples did presently report through <hi>London,</hi>
that I could prove nothing against him, nor bring any
thing out of his bookes, or writings to convince him
of Socinianisme, and that the eight learned Ministers
had justified him, and condemned me for a false accuser.
And upon this he grew more bold, and wrote certaine
Essaies concerning Justification, a copy whereof I have
to shew, wherein he denies the true, reall, and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
union of the faithfull with Christ, and Chrits me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
of justification, and salvation for them; he affirmes
that when they are said to be one with Christ, the speech
is Metaphoricall, and that there is no mention of
Christs merits in all the Scripture. By which his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
breaking out, and going on from evill to worse,
I was forced to write my <hi>Antithesis Wottonismi, &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianismi;</hi>
wherein I discovered more of his errors, and
his sactious and Schismaticall behaviour: This I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the then Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to Doctor <hi>Nidd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> his Chaplaine, who being
himselfe a favourer of Arminians, neglected to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of it to his Lord. And indeed I never called upon
him, because Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> having intelligence of it, silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
himselfe and all his disciples, being admonished by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64519:14"/>
his friends of the danger in which he was, unlesse hee
and they did forbeare to justifie and maintaine his errors,
and further to provoke me by their false reports and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies.</p>
            <p>Thus was the fire quenched, and no man opened his
mouth to defend Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> opinions; though I with
many others, did often (as occasion was offered by the
Scriptures which we expounded) confute and condemne
them: In the meane time Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> wrote his booke
<hi>De Reconciliatione</hi> in Latine, wherein he seemed to recant
and to contradict divers of his former writings; but
yet he vented so much poyson in it; that when it was
sent over to <hi>Leiden</hi> to be Printed, the Professors there
rejected it, as being full of Socinian errours; and (as
I have beene informed) did also send to <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to
stop the Printing of it, which was there attempted also;
So that Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> disciples were forced to Print it at
their owne charge by stealth, in some further place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas, and to disperse the copies here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Upon one of which Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> a lover of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties,
and strange doctrines unhappily stumbled; and
thence stole his opinions, which his foolish followers
receive, and admire, as new revelations from heaven,
never heard of before.</p>
            <p>Thus have I briefly related the chiefe passages betweene
Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> and my selfe. I have heard of others also,
who did privately oppose Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> especially Master
<hi>Woodcocke,</hi> a grave Preacher, Parson or Vicar of <hi>Chessam,</hi>
who did in writing confute Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> and admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to forsake his errours. One thing I cannot omit,
which was a strong motive to move divers godly people
in <hi>London,</hi> to abhorre Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> opinions; that was
the sharpe censure which that holy man of God, Master
<hi>Alexander Richardson</hi> gave against them on his death bed,
and which Mr. <hi>John Barlow</hi> an eare-witnesse thereof, did
report to divers from his mouth. Mr. <hi>Richardson</hi> being
ready to leave this world, Mr. <hi>Barlow</hi> who had often
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64519:15"/>
before resorted to him for direction in his study, and
resolution of doubts, in many points of Divinity, was
at that time present with him, and told him that hee
had heard me the Sabbath before, propounding the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Justification, to be laid open out of the fifth
Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
against Papists, Socinians, and other Heretiques,
some of which were of late revived in the City, and
withall desired to know his judgement concerning Mr.
<hi>Wottons</hi> opinion, who denyed Christs fulfilling of the
Law for justification of beleevers, and the imputation
of his Righteousnesse; and held faith to be imputed in
a proper sense without a trope: Mr. <hi>Richardson</hi> answered
and said, Take these words of me a dying man. I have
read and well weighed Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> papers, and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and I know them to be so pestilent and dangerous,
that whosoever liveth and dyeth in the beleefe of them,
shall never enter into the Kingdome of heaven. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
me to Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and desire him from me, (as
being my last request to him) to be couragious in the
cause of God, and for that saving truth which he hath
undertaken to maintaine against those dangerous and
deadly errours, lately set on foote by Mr. <hi>Wotton.</hi> This
message being delivered unto me before diverse witnesses,
some of which are alive to testifie it, did much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
me, and made me more bold to lay open the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> opinions publickely in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
without feare or regard of the slanders and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings
of his factious and furious disciples. This was
in the yeare 1613. And I praise God, I am constant in
the same minde, and doe pray and hope that God will
give me grace to persevere in this beleefe to the end. As
for Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> invective against me in Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
I doe as little regard it, as Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> rayling
Libell, which (some say) Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> counselled him
to write against me.</p>
            <p>If it were not vaine expence of precious time, I could
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64519:15"/>
produce Socinianisme out of Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> Printed
workes, and prove him a party. I could prove him to
be <hi>Thomas</hi> of all sides. Sometimes holding that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and faithfull are cloathed with the garment of
Christs Righteousnesse, and againe, disputing against
their communion and imputation of Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But I pray God to give him a more setled judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the truth, and a more charitable heart to his
laborious neighbours, who spend their time in better
studies then writing of Treatises for unlawfull gaming
and card-playing, and bedawbing Margents with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
quotations to small purpose, but onely for ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of much reading.</p>
            <p>Yet give me leave to aske Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> a few questions,
which if he cannot answer with any credit, let him for
shame hold his peace, and blush to thinke of his defence
of Master <hi>Wotton,</hi> to the accusing and defaming of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Question,</hi> Whether is it truth and honesty, to say
that all the eight Ministers, with unanimous consent,
generally resolved and pronounced, that there appeared
not to them either heresie or blasphemy, in ought that
Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> was by me convinced to have delivered or
maintained? When their subscription shewes, that they
medled onely with his Expositions, and not with his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall
and blasphemous speeches, in which I paralleled
him with <hi>Socinus</hi> the Hereticke.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> doth thinke that Mr.
<hi>Wotton</hi> renouncing the Law of God, and the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof performed by Christ in our stead for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
doth not in so doing deny Christ his ransome
paid, and satisfaction made to Gods just Law, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and for remission of our sins?</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether mans perfect fulfilling of the Law
in his owne person, under the covenant of workes, was
not formall inherent righteousnesse, and would have
made man worthy of life: And if so, how he can excuse
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64519:16"/>
Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> from making faith the formall inherent
righteousnesse of beleevers, in the covenant of the Gospel,
by which they are worthy of justification, and eternall
life, seeing he saith that faith under the Gospell serves
to all purposes, for obtaining eternall life, as mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
fullfilling of the Law did in the covenant of
workes?</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> professing his dissent
from <hi>Socinus</hi> in those things which are Orthodox and
true, to wit, That faith is obedience to Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
who commands us to beleeve and repent;
That repentance which commeth not but by faith, is
the meanes to obtaine forgivenesse of sins which Christ
hath brought, that is to get the sense and assurance of
forgivenesse; And that faith is a beleeving of that which
Christ taught, and an assurance of obtaining that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
upon our repentance and obedience: can therefore
be justified from the heresies of <hi>Socinus,</hi> in the point of
justification, when he holds other things which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in <hi>Socinus</hi> for heresie, as that faith used in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
sense, not tropically, is said to be imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
to justification, and not the righteousnesse of
Christ, apprehended and applied by faith; And that
Christ hath not redeemed us, and satisfied for our sinnes,
and procured our pardon and justification, by fulfilling
the Law in our stead; And that faith, though not for the
merit, worth and vertue of it, yet by the place and office
which the Lord of his mercy hath assigned, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
upon which God doth justifie and adopt us, and
is accepted of God and counted for righteousnesse?</p>
            <p>5 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> doth not deny the free
covenant of Grace, when he holds that God doth not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to justifie and give life, but upon a condition, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
on our part, equivalent for all purposes, to a
mans perfect fulfilling of the Law in his owne person
under the covenant of workes?</p>
            <p>6 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> affirming that if we be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64519:16"/>
freely pardoned, then our sinnes were not punished in
Christ our head and surety, doth not deny Christs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for sinne?</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> be not guilty of hereticall
tergiversation, and grosse contradiction in these passages.
First, when he saith, that there is no end or use of the
imputation of Christs Righteousnesse, pag. 12. of Mr.
<hi>Gatakers</hi> defence. And againe, pag. 21. That it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
and blasphemous, to say that Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is not imputed as the meritorious cause of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And againe, in his Essayes saith, that there is no
mention of the merit of Christ in all the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when he saith, That Faith doth not justifie
us, <hi>per se,</hi> by it selfe, and yet is said properly, and not
tropically, to be imputed to us for Righteousnesse, pag.
27. of the Defence; and is the onely condition which
God requires on our part for Justification, pag. 13. Also,
when he saith, That Faith doth not justifie us, but onely
as it apprehendeth and applyeth Christ and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
pag. 27. And yet denyeth that Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
is so apprehended and applyed by Faith, that
God counts it our Righteousnesse to Justification, pag.
12.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when he renounceth the Law of God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by our selves or any other in our stead, for the
justifying of us before God, pag. 12. And denyeth that
we are punished for our sinnes, in Christ our head and
surety, for the satisfying of Gods just wrath, pag. 29.
And yet pag. 34. saith, I acknowledge and professe that
Christ hath made satisfaction for us, by paying a true
price to God his Father. Is not this the same tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
which the Hereticke <hi>Socinus</hi> useth? Who in some
places confesseth in the Scripture phrases, that Christ is
our Redeemer, our Ransome, and the propitiation for
our sinnes: And in other places denyeth Christs satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and paying of a ransome to God for our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and justification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:64519:17"/>
Fourthly, when he saith, that we are not accounted
to be formally righteous, by fulfilling the Law, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
the Justice of God in Christ, and yet saith, that
we are accepted of God as Righteous for Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
no lesse then if wee had indeed performed those
things, pag. 32. and pag. 26. For ought I hold of Faith,
Christs Righteousnesse may be even the formall cause of
our Justification. But pag. 22. He confesseth that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
Christs Righteousnesse to be imputed as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
cause whereby we are made formally Righteous;
which is a flat contradiction of the Apostles words, <hi>Rom.
5. 19. By the obedience of one many shall be made righteous,</hi>
that is, constituted and made formally righteous, for so
the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth signifie.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> can with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
by Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> be justified and proclaimed free
from heresie, when he wil fully and perversely denyeth
the very forme, essence, and being of Justification, to
wit, the imputation of Christs Righteousnesse, which
he first simply rejecteth, as being of no use, and afterwards
as the formall cause of justification, seeing he (the said
Mr. <hi>Gataker)</hi> hath publickely extolled, and commended
for Orthodox, the like Treatise of Mr. <hi>William Bradshaw,</hi>
wherein he makes imputation of Christs Righteousnesse
the forme of Justification, and inveighed against some,
(meaning me, who had opposed some errours and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
which are in that Booke) in his funerall
Sermon, Preached at Mr. <hi>Bradshawes</hi> buryall?</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the faithfull being by one spirit
united to Christ, and made one spirituall body, and
partakers of his righteousnesse, and whole obedience to
the Law of God, and thereby constituted righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, can without hereticall perversenesse be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againe and againe to be formally, that is, truely and
really righteous, by that Righteousnesse, though not
inherent in every beleever, but onely spiritually commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
from the head to every member of the body?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:64519:17"/>
10. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> might not justly be
judged to be possessed with the spirit of Socinian blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and giddinesse, when he derides Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
For making every beleever justifyed by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christs satisfactory obedience, a Redeemer and
Saviour, and satisfyer for all the elect and faithfull (for
thus he argues. If Christs Righteousnesse and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be imputed to every beleever, then must every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
be counted a Redeemer, Justifyer, &amp; Satisfyer, for
all the Elect: But this is absurd, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Antecedent is
false. In one of his written pamphlets) though they
doe not hold that Gods imputing of Christs obedience
and satisfaction, is an accounting of it to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by them in their owne persons, or imputed as a
meritorious efficient cause; but onely his accounting it
theirs by communion from Christ the head to every
member so farre as to make him formally righteous.
And yet he himselfe contradicting his former absolute
denyall of imputation, pag. 12. doth hold imputation
of Christs Righteousnesse, as a meritorious, and efficient
cause of Justification, pag. 21. Which is a manifest falling
into that absurdity, which he would pin upon others.
For if it be counted ours, as a meritorious efficient cause,
then are we all counted justifyers, who doe justifie the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and merit their justification.</p>
            <p>I could propound divers other Questions, but when
Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> sees himselfe seriously to answer these, I hope
he shall perceive (if he hath ever an eye left to see) that
his defence of Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> is worse then standing at his
backe, till his head be broken, even a breaking of his
head, and a defaming of him by going about to defame
me unjustly in this pretended Defence, the issue whereof
is, That by publishing in Print, those damnable hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
speeches, which I in private objected against Mr.
<hi>Wotton,</hi> out of his owne writings (not one word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he could deny) he hath made Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> name to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64519:18"/>
stinke, like the issue of a running Cancer in a most foule
body, and like those Sepulchres dogges, which scratch
rotten carkasses out of their graves, hee hath raked up
Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> rotten body of errours out of his grave;
(as some godly Divines have said, upon the reading of
his defence.) For what true Christian, when he reades
those desperate speeches which I objected in my parallel,
now Printed by Mr. <hi>Gataker, (viz.</hi> That there is no end
or use whatsoever of the imputation of Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
active or passive, for the justification of sinners;
That Faith, taken in a proper sense, is by God coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Righteousnesse: And is for all purposes, as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to justification under the Gospell, as the fulfilling
of the Law by a man in his owne person, was in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of workes; that he renounceth the fulfilling of
the Law by Christ for our Justification: And that our
sinnes are not punished in Christ, nor Gods wrath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed
thereby) is not so offended with the ill savour
of those rotten heresies, that he is forced to stoppe his
nose at the reading of them, as passengers doe, when
they passe by the valley of <hi>Hamon Gog? Ezech.</hi> 29. 11.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> be so profuse and prodigall of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
as to subscribe to them, that there is no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
or blasphemy in them; when <hi>Beza, Paraeus, Lubertus</hi>
and others, our betters, have, before me, so proclaymed
them to be: Yet he hath with breach of piety and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and with greater virulency and defect of humanity,
and common honesty than he hath proved to be in me;
most falsely fathered on those dead Saints, Mr. <hi>Randall,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Stocke,</hi> and on those living pious men, Doctor
<hi>Gouge,</hi> and Master <hi>Downham,</hi> a subscription to those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours;
that they saw no heresie, or blasphemy in them.
Whereas, indeed and in truth, I have to shew in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that their subscription was not to all or any thing,
which I produced out of his writings against him; but
onely to his Expositions, wherein he denyed many of
his errours, and set a false glosse on the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64519:18"/>
Indeed some things in those Expositions, I did then
shew to be already condemned for heresie and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
by the learned before named; and thereupon I did
blame their subscription, and protested against it, and
desired to dispute with Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> and prove those
points heresie; but Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> interposed and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
so with the rest, that I could not be heard, neither
could I by any intreaty obtaine a copy of those Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions;
but they were committed to Doctor <hi>Baylie</hi> to
be kept; till Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> had more fully in writing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
himselfe, and the Doctor durst never suffer me once
to read them, fearing lest I should write a publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of them. Howbeit I wrote a confutation of so
much as I could remember, by hearing them once read,
at the time when they were subscribed, and on Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
being the second day after, did shew it to Doctor
<hi>Gouge,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Downham</hi> after the Sermon at Blackfry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
And a long time after, I with much adoe, by Mr.
<hi>Wetwoods</hi> meanes, obtained the sight of them, for two
houres, in which space I copyed them out, as is before
related; so farre was I from pressing Doctor <hi>Baylie</hi> to
conceale them, (as Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> would intimate, pag. 37)
that I never laboured for any thing more earnestly, then
to have them published for the freeing of my selfe from
the crimes which Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> then, and now Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi>
by false reports would lay and fasten on me, pag. 39. of
his Defence.</p>
            <p>As for that testification rehearsed, pag. 38. and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by <hi>John Downham,</hi> and <hi>William Gouge,</hi> it was got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> seven yeares after, when the businesse
was almost forgotten: And (as Mr. <hi>Downham</hi> told me)
it was upon this occasion. Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> having written his
Booke <hi>de Reconciliatione,</hi> came to him and told him, that
now he had fully purged himselfe from Socinianisme,
(as he promised) in a Booke which Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
Chaplaine would licence for the Presse, if two or
more of them who heard the Controversie, betweene
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64519:19"/>
him and me, would testifie that I did not convince him
of heresie before them; and that they all had so subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
And upon this suggestion, which was false, they
two onely gave that attestation, which Mr. <hi>Stocke,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Baylie,</hi> abhorred to doe, repenting of what favour
they had shewed him at the first.</p>
            <p>If this be not so, let Mr. <hi>Downham,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> speake
for themselves: As for the rest of Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> defence,
it is so frivolous, that a short answer will serve. His
maine charge against me is, that I make Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> to
hold the same things which have formerly been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for heresie in <hi>Abailard, Servetus,</hi> and <hi>Socinus;</hi> for this
he accuseth me of iniquity, but the iniquity returnes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his owne head.</p>
            <p>First, for <hi>Peter Abailard,</hi> he held that our sins are not
punished in Christ, and that it had beene injustice in God
to punish one for another, and to impute the obedience
of one to others: And against him Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> disputes
<hi>Epist.</hi> 190. in these words, <hi>It was man who was indebted,
and man satisfyed.</hi> If one dyed for all, then all dyed in
him, that the satisfaction of one may be imputed to all;
for he who offended and forfeited was not one, and he
who satisfyed, another; the head and the body are one
Christ. And a little after. I call my selfe righteous, but
by his Righteousnesse. Which is that? Christ, the end
of the Law for Righteousnesse to every beleever. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
Man is mercifully redeemed, or delivered, yet
so as that there Justice executed even in the deliverance.
If the heresie of <hi>Abailard,</hi> thus confuted by <hi>Bernard,</hi> be
not the same which I proved to be held by Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi>
let the Reader judge. If <hi>Abailard</hi> did deny in plaine
words the eternall Deity of Christ, and after him <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetus</hi>
and <hi>Socinus</hi> also: so also did Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> in effect,
though in words he professed the contrary. For he held
that Christs obedience did serve onely to justifie himselfe,
and to bring him into high favour with God, so that
God justifies us by him as by a favourite, onely upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64519:19"/>
of our trusting in him. Now where is the infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>
value of his Deity, if he needed justification and favour
for himselfe?</p>
            <p>Secondly, that <hi>Servetus</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> were in the same er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and that Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> in the points of justification
holds with them, I have proved out of his owne words.
It is a poore defence for Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> to excuse him by
naming other heresies of theirs which he professed not;
neither did I charge him with them; And to plead, that
because they were condemned for other heresies, more
then this; therefore this was no heresie. I know it to be
heresie and blasphemie, and with the learned before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
do proclame it to be so. Yea Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
told him that his opinions were condemned for
heresie and blasphemy, and for feare of shame, denyed
them at sometimes; and most frequently contradicted
himselfe, saying and unsaying, as <hi>Socinus</hi> his Master often
did.</p>
            <p>I am loath to spend more time, to answer to this last
part of Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> defence, which one short breath is
sufficient to blow away. If he be forward to breake out
into a further defence of these errors, and of Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi>
(who in his first paper speaking of the Doctrine of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
as it is held and maintained by all Orthodox
Divines of the reformed Church, did not blush to say, I
am enforced to dissent from them all; what spirit enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him, I cannot conceive unlesse it was the spirit of
<hi>Abailard,</hi> who is condemned by Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> for saying,
<hi>Omnes doctores nostri post Apostolos in hoc conveniunt, &amp;c</hi> All
our Doctors or teachers since the Apostles agree in
this point; but I am of another opinion: <hi>sic omnes, non sie
ego,</hi> all other thinke so, but I doe not think so) I shall by
Gods grace be as ready to resist him still. And I doubt not
but the hand of all Orthodox Divines wilbe against him
who takes part with one against all; yea against the holy
Scriptures, and the holy Pen-men of them. My faith, by
which I beleeve that I shall be saved, is a firme beleife that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64519:20"/>
Christ is my head and surety, who fulfilled the whole
Law for me, that he might thereby, redeeme, reconcile,
and justifie me, and that my sins were punnished in him,
and his righteousnesse, is my righteousnesse, in which I
stand righteous before God. I know whom I have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
I feare not what any man can say against me. If
God be with me, I care not who be against me. If he
justifie me, who can condemne? I will therefore rest on
that promise of the Lord, <hi>Esay 54. 17. No weapon that is
formed against thee shall prosper, and every tongue that riseth up
against thee in judgement thou shalt condemne. This is the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage
of the servants of the Lord; and their righteousnesse is of
me, saith the Lord.</hi>
