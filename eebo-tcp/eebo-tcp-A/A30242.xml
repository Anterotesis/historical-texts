            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wherein is no Edifying.

But Scepticiſm and inconſtancy, and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affectation of Opinions and Controverſies, is contrary to the ſound conſtitution of Chriſtianity, which inclineth to a ſolid mind in Matters of Faith, and to an holy mortified heart in reſpect of our converſation. Now to bring ſuch an holy and heavenly Eſtabliſhment upon the ſoul, the only way is, to make a conſtant and diligent Improvement of Gods <hi>Word,</hi> in all the happy and bleſſed Effects it cauſeth upon the ſoul.

                     <hi>That the ignorance and ſinfulneſs of a people, are a just cauſe, why faithfull and wiſe Miniſters of the Word, do not ſometimes preach of the more ſublime and excellent points in Chriſtianity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> deſired not only to lay a good foundation, but alſo to build an excellent ſuperſtruction, but the rudeneſs and ignorance of his hearers reſtrained him: Even as the Husbandman doth not ſow his beſt ſeed, wheat, and the like, becauſe his ground is ſo barren and lean, that it will not bear it. As the Schoolmaſter teacheth not his choiſeſt notions, becauſe the Scholar cannot receive them. See how ſadly <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12, 13. they were not ſuch who could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>ſtrong meat</hi>; therefore he preſſeth them not to reſt alwayes in the <hi>firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> and <hi>elements of Religion,</hi> but to be carried on to <hi>further perfection.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are compar'd by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Nurſes,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2.7. if they ſhould give bread and meat to young Infants, this were not to nouriſh them, but to choak them: Our Saviour to this very purpoſe, ſhewing, that beginners are not prepared for lofty and more ſpiritual truths, excellently inſtanceth, in <hi>old bottles receiving new wine,</hi> Luk. 5.36. which preſently break, not being able to bear the ſtrength of it.</p>
                  <p>To open the Doctrine, conſider, That in Chriſtianity, and ſo in our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is a two-fold kind of matter:
<list>
                        <item>1. That which is <hi>Fundamental, plain, neceſſary</hi> and <hi>eaſie,</hi> being the <hi>firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion,</hi> the total ignorance whereof damneth.</item>
                        <item>2. There are <hi>admirable Conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>quences</hi> and <hi>Concluſions</hi> to be deduced from, and improved out of theſe, unto which the godly are to grow, not reſting in the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but greedily deſiring the later. The fore-named place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. evidenceth this; where he tels us of <hi>firſt principles,</hi> ſuch as every one muſt learn, Repentance from dead works, Faith in God, the Reſurrection of the dead, and eternal Judgment; ſo theſe be principles and foundations, and it is as impoſſible to build up towards Heaven without theſe, as to build an houſe without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. The Apoſtle compareth theſe to <hi>milk,</hi> and the other to <hi>ſtrong meat.</hi> Now as it is a ſhame for a child alwayes to ſuck; ſo it is not only a ſhame, but a grievous ſinne, for a people to be capable of nothing but milk. <hi>To be children alwayes:</hi> And if <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo offended at it, What cauſe have the Miniſters of God in theſe dayes to burn with zeal, becauſe of the general ignorance upon moſt people? Alas, how many do not ſo much as underſtand the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? How many have not laid a foundation? We cannot preach to them, no not as babes, much leſſe as grown men, they are even bruitiſh <hi>Pagans</hi> almoſt for their ignorance in religious things. But of that more hereafter.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is to ſhew you, <hi>That Chriſts ſchool hath many forms,</hi> and it is a ſinne and a ſhame to be alwayes in the Alphabet. For further proſecuting the Doctrine,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101245:13"/>
Conſider firſt, How <hi>Ignorance</hi> doth reſtrain the Miniſters abilities. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How <hi>ſinfulneſs,</hi> for both theſe are in the Doctrine. And both theſe <hi>Paul</hi> intends in calling them carnal. Ignorance is an impediment to our preaching, in theſe particulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> is an impediment to the Miniſters preaching.</note> 
                     <hi>The more eminent and ſublime myſteries of the Goſpel about Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, we cannot ſo frequently preach upon, but theſe things which may be known of God by the natural light of conſcience, and by the works of Creation.</hi> There are things known of God, partly by natural light of conſcience, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if furthered with Education; and things by ſupernatural Revelation, and Authority of the Scripture meerly; ſuch is the whole Doctrine about Chriſt and his Offices. Now this later ſort of matter, which is the marrow and life of all preaching, many of our Congregations, as they now ſtand corrupted with blindneſs and ignorance are not prepared to receive it. For generally people know no more than what may be known of God, by the common principles of reaſon, and what their Parents have taught them by tradition; but for acquaintance with the truths of the Goſpel, which are revealed to us in the Scripture, they have but a glimering about them, if any apprehenſion at all. When <hi>Peter</hi> had made that Confeſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Thou art the Sonne of the living God</hi>; Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Fleſh and blood had not revealed this to him,</hi> Mat. 16.17. Now moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have no more knowledge, no more apprehenſion in matters of Religion, than what <hi>fleſh and blood revealeth to them.</hi> We that are Miniſters, and have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to enquire into the knowledge of people, have cauſe thus to complain. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.19. a notable place, <hi>Every one that is a babe, is unskilfull in the Word of righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, in the Myſtery of the Goſpel: ſo that to preach much of Chriſt, till people be prepared by knowledge, or fitted by principles for him, is to throw ſeed on the ground before it be plowed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As thoſe ſublime myſteries cannot be often preached on, (though ſometimes we muſt, becauſe we are debtors to the wiſe, as well as the fooliſh, and there are ſpiritual as well as carnal in our Congregations) ſo likewiſe, <hi>That growth in knowledge, and increaſe more and more in heavenly light and knowledge, cannot be preſſed where groſſe ignorance is.</hi> You ſhall ſee this much preſſed in Scripture, <hi>not to reſt in foundations,</hi> to <hi>grow</hi> in knowledge: Yea one main end of the Miniſtry, is to carry us unto a <hi>full ſtature in Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4 13. Now (alas) how can our Miniſtry be for growth to ſuch, who are not ſo much as babes, who are not yet begotten anew by the Word? Can we expect any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or fruit, when men are not ſo much as plants planted by God? Many Congregations being like <hi>Golgotha,</hi> places not of dead skuls, but of dead hearts, Oh how ſhort do our people come of the primitive Chriſtians! Theſe very <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> commends them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5, 7. <hi>Ye are inriched in all utterance and knowledge,</hi> and yet he finds faults with them. Alas, the Miniſters of God have farre higher and larger degrees of knowledge and grace to preſs you to, if once the foundation were laid.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>There are many choiſe and excellent duties, in the exerciſe whereof a Chriſtian would have much joy, and bring much glory to God; but the ignorance of a people makes the Mixiſter not ſo frequently urge thoſe, becauſe other things muſt be done firſt.</hi> The duties are theſe, <hi>Let the word of God dwell plentifully in you, teaching and admoniſhing one another,</hi> Col. 3 6. And again, <hi>Exhort and provoke one another,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14 Thus the <hi>Father,</hi> he is to make his family like the Church of God, he is to <hi>inſtruct thoſe that are under him in the knowledge of the Lord. Husbands</hi> they are to be ſuch as can inform their wives, if they doubt of any thing in Religion, <hi>Let them ask their husbands at home,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 Cor. 14.35. So families are to ſerve God, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> reſolved, which is by praying to him, and calling upon his Name: How can theſe things be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a Miniſter upon a people groſly ignorant? How few Parents or Maſters
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101245:14"/>
have you that know how to ſerve God in their family? How few Husbands that know how to inform their wives in matter of Religion? And how few Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are able to teach and admoniſh one another out of the Word, whereas <hi>the conſtant exerciſe of thoſe duties, would bring admirable glory to God, would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite comfort to faithfull Miniſters; but ignorance and dulneſſe hath covered the face of all people?</hi> How many Families are there who eat, and drink, and ſwear, and curſe, and go to bed, and riſe like ſo many bruit beaſts, and you can no more expect religious duties from them, than underſtanding and diſcourſe from the worm that crawleth on the ground? Oh that we could once preach to our auditors as ſpiritual in this particular!</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The ignorance of a people, reſtraineth the Miniſters of God, that they cannot ſo powerfully preſſe at firſt, the pure and ſincere worſhip of God, and the leaving of all ſuperſtitious and traditional wayes of worſhip, but they muſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, here a little, and there a little, as they are able to bear it.</hi> Thus our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhewed in that fore-mentioned place, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. <hi>No man putteth new wine in old bottles</hi>; The people were offended, that Chriſt and his Diſciples did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that external worſhip, which others did; and he tels them, it is with Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Diſciples, as with bottles, if old, they are not able to bear new and ſpirituous wine. Hence our Saviour told the Diſciples at another time, <hi>I have many ohings to tell you, but you cannot hear them now</hi>; therefore they were to ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> till they were indowed with the holy Ghoſt from above. If we ſhould at firſt preſs a people plunged into all ignorance and ſuperſtition to the higheſt and exact worſhip of God, they would judge it madneſſe. Hence our Saviour by degrees, inſtructs the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who worſhipped ſhe knew not what. And <hi>Calvin</hi> commends that known counſel of <hi>Auſtin</hi> to a Biſhop, who deſired his adviſe about Diſcipline, where the ſinne of drunkenneſſe had generally infected all, which was, That he ſhould proceed wiſely and mildly, <hi>Monendo magis quam minando,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>In remittendis delictis penò ipſe delinquo,</hi> yet this muſt not be uſed for ſlothfulneſſe and remiſneſs in Church reformation; For how greatly hath God bleſſed even the endeavours of a few againſt univerſal impiety. Thus much for <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What precious truths in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe</hi> of a people make them uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</note>Then the <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> of people make them uncapable of many precious truths in Religion. As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Miniſters labour is moſt ſpent in diſcovering the damnable nature of groſſe ſins, taking them off from their bruitiſh beaſtly wayes</hi>; and as for <hi>ſpiritual ſins, unbelief, diffidence</hi> in the promiſes, <hi>carnal confidence</hi> in themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe they cannot ſo much preſſe againſt, becauſe ſuch Auditors come farre ſhort of civility, and therefore much leſſe reach to <hi>piety.</hi> Hence, though they can go along with Sermons that urge the leaving of groſſe ſinnes, yet thoſe about <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> and a <hi>New creature,</hi> they cannot perceive. Thus our Saviour, <hi>If I have ſpoken to you earthly things, and ye underſtand xot, how can ye heavenly? John</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To a people living in groſſe ſins, we cannot ſo frequently and gloriouſly preach Jeſus Chriſt in the Offices of a Mediatour.</hi> We cannot make it our work to ſet forth the promiſe of the Goſpel in its glory. We cannot preach of joy and peace in believing. We cannot commend the reſting and relying upon Chriſt; for before this be done, men muſt be convinced of the guilt of their particular ſinnes. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> did to <hi>Felix,</hi> when deſired to preach of faith in Chriſt. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> indeavoured to prick the conſciences of thoſe, that murdered Chriſt the life of glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The performing of duties in a ſpiritual and gracious manner, ſo as to have communion with God, and to enjoy him.</hi> This alſo is too high for ſinfull wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, <hi>Wiſdome is too high for a fool,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>; and ſo the ſpiritual pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, enjoying of God in thoſe Ordinances, is a paradox and myſtery
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101245:14"/>
to them. What a glorious expreſſion is that, <hi>We beholding as in a glaſſe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, are transformed into his image?</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. but the <hi>world hath not received the Spirit of God to know theſe things,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> To arouſe and awaken people out of their ignorance and ſinfulneſſe. If <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought a young man no fit Auditor for his Morals, becauſe he was ſubject to unruly affections, how fit can people blind in mind, corrupt in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, be to receive the truths of God? How great is the labour and grief of a Miniſter to preach to thoſe that are not ſo much as babes in Chriſt? The very Ox and Horſe know the noiſe and command of the Driver, and turn as he would have them, onely man is more unruly and bruitiſh, refuſing to order his ſteps, as he is commanded. How much of the ſtudy, labour, parts, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of a Miniſter may be loſt through the indocibleneſſe of hearers? Though we preach not Latine, yet the matter we preach may be ſo ſpiritual, heavenly, that it may be as untelligible, as an unknown tongue. We would go on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, were not your ſlowneſſe, ſlothfulneſſe an obſtruction. Is not Chriſt, nor the glorious promiſe no more publiſhed? thank we our ſelves for this.

                  <p>The ſecond thing obſervable, is the <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> of the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, [<hi>Not as ſpiritual, but as carnal</hi>;] This is not to be underſtood of <hi>all,</hi> but of <hi>many</hi> amongſt them; for he doth acknowledg ſome wiſe and perfect to whom he was a debtor.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now you muſt know this word or attribute <hi>[carnal]</hi> hath ſeveral ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Scripture; ſometimes it ſignifieth no more, than to partake of the ſame ſtock with us. Thus the Apoſtle cals them <hi>carnal Maſters, or Maſters after the fleſh,</hi> Epheſ. 6.5. And the Apoſtle makes a diſtinction between <hi>being in the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>walking after the fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is ſaid to be <hi>carnal,</hi> that although he hath a great meaſure of grace, and with much ſpiritual fortitude doth conquer ſinne, yet it many times haled him away captive to thoſe reliques and remainders of corruption in him. And this (as I remember) is but in one place, where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>But I am carnal, and ſold under ſin,</hi> Rom. 7.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The moſt frequent application of this word, is to thoſe, who <hi>wholly</hi> give up themſelves to the luſts of the fleſh, and make proviſion for them. Even as cuſtomary ſins are called <hi>the works of the fleſh,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. This is the moſt general uſe of the word, as we uſe it alſo in Engliſh.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Carnal</hi> is uſed <hi>comparatively,</hi> for thoſe who are indeed godly, but very weak and infirm, retaining many corruptions, and ſavouring much of the fleſh, though they for the main are godly. And in this ſenſe it is uſed in the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As unto carnal</hi>] He uſeth the word <hi>[As]</hi> for mitigation ſake; and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his meaning, calling them <hi>babes in Chriſt.</hi> Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That even among thoſe who are truly, and indeed of the viſible Church of God, there is a vaſt difference, ſome are ſpiritual, ſome are carnal, ſome are men, ſome are babes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though God created <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in their full perfection, yet he doth not regenerate us into a full ſtature in Chriſt. Though it be the opinion of ſome Divines, That at the Reſurrection, all the godly ſhall riſe in their compleat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, children, in that ſtature, they might have grown up unto; yet it is not ſo here; we are ſpiritually begotten babes in Chriſt, and ſo have ſeveral degrees into which we are to grow; yea one Chriſtian may ſo far exceed another both in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101245:15"/>
parts and graces, that one would wonder, that the ſame Heaven ſhould ever receive them at laſt. Yea one Chriſtian in time may exceedingly differ from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: As the Apoſtles, how rude and evil at firſt, but how admirable and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, when they had received the Spirit from above in a fuller meaſure? Thus <hi>as one ſtarre differeth from another in glory</hi>; There is a vaſt difference between the Sunne and any of the leſſe ſtarres; ſo it is many times in the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>To open this Point, Conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is a great Diſpute, Who are truly members of the viſible Church?</hi> The Papiſts they make all publick and groſſe ſinners to be truly of the Church; even as a wicked or ungodly man may be truly and indeed a Citizen of ſuch a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and have the Liberties thereof. But the Reformed Divines, they ſay, Groſſe and prophane men are not truly and indeed of the viſible Church, which is a company of ſheep, and not goats. It is that through neglect of Diſcipline and want of godly order, prophane obſtinate men may abide in the Church, who yet are to be caſt out of it. And this is not a ground for any to ſeparate uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and ſinfully from the Church ſo polluted; yet ſuch wicked men continuing amongſt believers, are not internally, but externally, and in appearance only of the Church: Even as a wicked branch, or a dead hand is a part of the body equivocally, it receiveth no life or influence; ſo neither do theſe, though they pray, hear, come to Church, yet they receive no more ſpiritual benefit from Chriſt, then the glaſſe eye doth vital operation from the ſoul. And <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> himſelf doth at laſt acknowledge, That publick and open ſinners, though they be <hi>De corpore Eccleſiae,</hi> yet they are not <hi>De Anima.</hi> Happily therefore the Papiſts do not ſo much contradict the Doctrine of the Proteſtants, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For <hi>Ameſius</hi> doth reject that Propoſition, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on us; as if we held internal grace neceſſarily conſtituent of a member of a viſible Church; external profeſſion of faith, and of obedience to Chriſt, is enough to this, though Regeneration be wanting. <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Some were not of them, though they were amongst them,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.19.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Apoſtle in the Text, he ſpeaks of two degrees onely amongst the godly,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and the <hi>Carnal,</hi> the <hi>men</hi> and the <hi>babes,</hi> even as we ſpeak of the <hi>Incipients</hi> and <hi>Proficients.</hi> Now the <hi>ſpiritual man</hi> is he that hath attained to an higher degree both of <hi>knowledge</hi> in the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>ſanctification,</hi> in the heart; of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1 This later is neceſſary. For if a man have never ſuch ſpiritual abilities, if he abound in the knowledge of all myſteries, can preach, pray, and do all things to the raviſhment of the hearer, yet if he be not ſanctified in his heart, he is carnal, and not ſpiritual. Theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> are ſaid <hi>to abound in all utterance,</hi> and they came behind no Church in any gift; yet no Church ſo carnal, and ſo full of the works of the fleſh as this; here were <hi>groſſe hereſies,</hi> here were <hi>diviſions</hi> and <hi>ſchiſmes</hi> among them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>groſſe practices</hi>; ſo that a ſpiritual people, is not preſently a people of parts, and knowledge, and abilities onely, but of <hi>grace</hi> and raiſed <hi>ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> alſo.</p>

                        <hi>Carnal,</hi> or <hi>babes</hi> deſcribed and counſelled.</note>Then as for the <hi>Carnal</hi> or <hi>Babes,</hi> two things belong to them,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That they be not dejected, or quite out of hopes, becauſe they are babes.</hi> Fathers have naturally tender and dear affections to thoſe children that are moſt infirm and weak. Chriſt had care of the <hi>bruiſed reed; he rebuked thoſe that would have kept little children from him,</hi> how much rather theſe ſpiritual babes, and the promiſe of pardon, and glory, is made to the leaſt degree of grace? Do not then judge that which is little, nothing at all. The leaſt faith receiveth Chriſt as truly, though not ſo firmly, as the ſtrongeſt. The little pupill in a mans eye, can receive the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the great Mountains; And though thou haſt not ſuch graces and parts, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> yet thou haſt the ſame God and Chriſt, which they have. Look to it therefore, you that are babes in Chriſt, you are apt to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and dejected: remember the branch doth not bear the root, but the root it, and thou doſt not ſo much lay hold on Chriſt, as Chriſt layes hold on thee. The little child in danger catcheth hold of his father, and its ſafety is not ſo much, that the child holds the father, as the father it. Thy ſafety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not, becauſe thy grace joyns thee to Chriſt, but becauſe his Spirit knits thee to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed of reſting in low things.</hi> To be alwayes weak, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes carnal doth highly provoke God, and grieve a faithfull Miniſtry, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by <hi>Paul</hi>: to grow in grace, and bring forth much fruit, are made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our continuance in the ſtate of grace. And if <hi>Paul</hi> and ſuch Gyants thought themſelves dwarfs, and therefore <hi>they preſſed forward,</hi> Phil. 3.14. How much rather muſt dwarfs indeed make haſte? Oh ſay, What a proficient might I have been, if I had ſtill purſued forward and forward? If the rich man ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing his wealth, is deſirous to adde to his treaſure; how much rather ſhouldſt thou deſire the growth of grace? <hi>He that thinks he hath grace enough, never had any grace at all</hi>; And the rather we muſt grow, becauſe we hinder our ſelves of the chiefeſt truths, and the choiſeſt conſolations in the Scripture, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for thoſe that are ſpiritual. But of this enough here.</p>

There is required judgment, and a ſound mind to ſeparate Truth from falſehood</hi>: To know which is gold and precious ſtone, and which is hay and ſtubble: To winnow the chaff from the wheat. Hence a Miniſter is required, <hi>to be able to divide the Word of God aright,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.15. as they did the Sacrifice, giving that to God, which did belong to him; and that to man, which did belong to him: The conſequent of which Wiſdome, is <hi>not to be aſhamed,</hi> as if ſhame would ſometimes or other confound thoſe that had not this skill. It's impoſſible but you ſhould be fed with chaff inſtead of wheat, with dung inſtead of meat, if the Miniſter cannot ſeparate the <hi>precious from the vile.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks of ſome that were ignorant, that did <hi>wreſt the Scriptures</hi> (2 Pet. 3.16.) <hi>to their own damnation</hi>; but the ignorant Miniſter, he may wreſt it to the damnation of many others. How many in the world ſwallow down damnable Hereſies, feed on the draffe of corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, becauſe God hath ſent falſe Prophets and falſe Teachers amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>As wiſdome is required to chooſe out true, and ſound matter, ſo to proportion it to the Capacity of the Hearers.</hi> He is to be the <hi>wiſe Scribe, that brings out of his Treaſure new and old,</hi> Mat. 13 25. That is, ſuch which may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect every Hearer: It's an alluſion to <hi>Cantic.</hi> 7.13. They are indeed, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.27. to acquaint them with the <hi>whole counſell of God</hi>; yet in a methodical way, the moſt eaſie, and moſt plain.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To preach the Nature of <hi>God</hi> and his Attributes; of Original <hi>ſinne,</hi> of <hi>Converſion,</hi> of <hi>Juſtification</hi>; as alſo about <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Offices. Theſe are the New things, and the Old And as God made the moſt neceſſary things firſt, and the ornaments in the world afterwards, ſo are we. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> begins with the knowledge of God by the creatures, then Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſinne, afterwards Juſtification and Sanctification, and then proceeds to Election. It's an excellent Rule of <hi>Nazianzen, We are not to preach of every thing, to every man, at every time, in every place</hi>; but in prudence, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence as Auditours are able to bear it: So did our Saviour.</p>

For Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note>A ſecond part of this <hi>Doctrinal Key,</hi> is, <hi>To preach comfort, and diſpenſe the grace of God in the Goſpel.</hi> But here is much wiſdome required, that be doth it not to unbroken and impenitent ſinners. To preach a Saviour to thoſe that do not find themſelves loſt, to commend a Phyſician to thoſe that find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whole, to pour oyl, where there are no wounds, is to pervert all order. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh</hi> 7.37. And, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden,</hi> Mat. 11.28. <hi>The Spirit of God, convinces the world of ſin, and then of righteouſneſs.</hi> Oh but how much unwiſe and unfaithfull preaching is there in this reſpect? How many are there, that <hi>ſtrengthen wicked</hi> mens hearts, and make them not <hi>ſad,</hi> whom God would have made <hi>ſad?</hi> That <hi>daube with untemppered morter,</hi> that ſay to every prophane man, if he do but cry, Lord have mercy upon me, <hi>Be of good comfort, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> It's this daubing, and ſoothing up people in their wickedneſs, ſtriking out all fear of hell and damnation, that makes them wallow like ſwine in their filth. To ſuch to preach no comfort, but the Law and Threatnings; but to thoſe that are broken in heart, a tongue of the learned is required to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon. How carefull was <hi>Paul,</hi> that the inceſtuous perſon ſhould not be overwhelmed with grief, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2? And here is the more wiſdome, becauſe Satans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101245:17"/>
are ſubtile and inſinuating; <hi>We are not ignorant of his devices,</hi> of his ſchiſmes, what falſe circumventions and appearances he will have. Now, How many are there, that are not acquainted themſelves with the depths of Satan, that are no better Comforters then <hi>Jobs Friends</hi> were? Chriſt himſelf was affected with all our temptations, that he might know how the more feelingly to pity others. Thus a Miniſter that hath himſelf been in the deep mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, that hath himſelf been exerciſed with all kind of temptations, he can only tell how to ſpeak to the heart of another. So that you ſee, much wiſdome is required in the giving of comfort. Alas, every ſick man, every dying man, looks we ſhould give comfort, and they would have a word of comfort! Oh, but what hath thy life been! What truth of grace is there in thee? Have not ſome wicked men cryed out of their ſinnes, in fear of death, and publique judgments, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did? Therefore we muſt take heed what we do; we muſt not comfort, whom God would not have comforted. Here is great wiſdome required.</p>
                     <p>A third part of his <hi>Doctrinal Key,</hi> is, <hi>To rebuke and reprove for ſinne.</hi> Now,<note place="margin">3.

Thus <hi>John</hi> called ſome <hi>a generation of vipers,</hi> Mat. 3.7. and our Saviour, <hi>Wo to ye Scribes, Phariſees, Hypocrites</hi>; many times repeating that, upbraiding of them. Theſe were obſtinate impenitent Hypocrites, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13, 14, 15. and little blows will not move them. Others again are tender, tractable: meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will do more than auſterity So that there is ſcarce any thing requireth more wiſdome than publique and private reproofs. Men can ſo hardly bear them, <hi>Genus quoddam Maritirii eſt reprehenſionem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> patienter ferre,</hi> It is a kind of martyrdome to bear a reproof patiently. And Miniſters are either apt to be too awfull, and pleaſing of men, or elſe too boiſterous or paſſionate. So that the Shepherd of irrational Sheep, have a farre more eaſie task, then ſpiritual Shepherds of men eſpecially in ſuperſtitious Cuſtomes, in falſe waies of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Here an Angels wiſdome will ſcarce ſuffice. What a trouble was that to the Church in her infancy, about the retaining or leaving the Jewiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? The Queſtions and differences grew ſo hot, that it had almoſt torn the Church in pieces. The Council of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was called about this; many ſtill Judaizing thought, that if you took the obſervation of times, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ceremonies away, you took away all Religion. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. is very diligent to inform them about this, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make them ſpiritual, and to draw up their hearts from thoſe beggerly elements: <hi>Paul</hi> was circumſpect how to walk in this ſlippery Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, <hi>To the Jew, I became a Jew,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.20. Not that he was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler, or an Hypocrite, or humoured them in their ſuperſtitious weakneſs, but he took upon him all ſweet affections; he was as a Jew to a Jew, as weak to weak; he would conſider them, as if he were in their caſe: Yea, to walk in theſe Controverſies was ſo hard, that <hi>Peter</hi> gave great occaſion of offence; yea, <hi>Barnabas</hi> was alſo laid aſide, for he did not <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, which made <hi>Paul</hi> reſiſt him to the face, with this diſſimulation, <hi>Gal</hi> 1. <hi>Now if the Apoſtle, was ſo induſtrious to root out the practice of thoſe Rites and Ceremonies, which yet God himſelf had once commanded, how much rather ſhould we thoſe things which were brought into the Church, without any command of God, or warrant of Scripture, but meerly by the will of man?</hi>

Seeing then the managing of holy truths is not had by humane prudence, but by wiſdome from above, we muſt be <hi>Scribes inſtructed to the kingdome of heaven</hi>: we are not born but made Preachers of the Goſpel by God, no marvel if this be ſo great a work.</p>

Thou getteſt no more profit, thou canſt not underſtand, thou art not affected, Oh ſee, if this be not a juſt reward for thy want of prayers for thy guide! How often doth <hi>Paul</hi> deſire the prayers of the people he writes to? how happy is it when the Miniſtery is profitable to thee, and thou art profiting to it? As God muſt be with the Preacher, ſo he muſt be with the hearer: a coal of fire on his tongue to purify it, and a coal of fire on your eares to cleanſe them. Oh then how ungodly are they, who inſtead of praying, curſe, grudge, and nouriſh malice, for the Miniſters work ſake meerly, when that ſhould make him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable!

                        <hi>That it's very neceſſary to have a people inſtructed with the principles of Religion, before they make further progreſs in Religion.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>I have fed you with milk.</hi> Children, as they ſpeak like children, think like children, and do like children (as the Apoſtle in another caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.) ſo they have meat fit for children. And this point is of great conſequence. For how univerſal and damnable is the ignorance of moſt, who have not yet learned the Alphabet of Religion, ſcarce have heard whether there be an Holy Ghoſt or no? Who, though they have Chriſt often in their mouths, yet know not what Chriſt was, and thereupon may juſtly have that doom upon them, which our Saviour paſſeth upon the woman of <hi>Samaria, Ye worſhip ye know not what</hi>; Joh. 4.22. To open this Doctrine,</p>
                     <p>Conſider firſt, <hi>And bewail the miſerable atheiſme, ignorance, and blindneſs that every man naturally is born in, about Religion and divine truths.</hi>

                           </gap> the principles of Religion, and the knowledge and ignorance of them.</note> Hence <hi>Eph</hi> 5.8. they are called <hi>darkneſs</hi> it ſelf, in the abſtract, and <hi>the natural man cannot receive the ſpiritual things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. <hi>Zophar</hi> compareth every man by his birth to <hi>the wild Aſſes colt,</hi> Job 11.12. What is more brutiſh then that? Now there are thouſands of people, and thoſe living in the Church of God, who are not yet come out of this brutiſh ignorance, men that never felt this Sunne, or day-ſtarre of the Goſpel ariſing in their hearts. Thus as God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>knowledge ſhould cover the face of the earth, as waters do the ſeas,</hi> Iſa. 11.9. Darkneſs covers our Congregations, as it did the chaos at firſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As people are thus naturally ignorant of divine truths, ſo alſo their wilful ſlothfulneſs about them is much more damnable. He that doth not know his <hi>maſters will,</hi> ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes; but he that ſhuts his eyes that he may not know; he that bids <hi>the knowledge of the moſt High, depart from him,</hi> he ſhall be beaten with more ſtripes. Oh then! why is it that thou art ſuch a blind Bat, or Owle in the day of the Goſpel? thou canſt not ſay, it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to get knowledge; No, how great are the helps and meanes that God hath vouchſafed in theſe dayes? <hi>Theodoret</hi> tells us, <hi>That in his dayes, the common ſort of people, maides, old women, handycrafts men, labourers, theſe could all tell the ground of their faith</hi>; but there are few among us who can riſe up to that duty, to give an account of our hope, yet the Scripture requireth this of all, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. Why then doſt thou ſay, I muſt know how to work, how to plow, to ſow, to maintain my natural life, and not alſo be as diligent about thy ſupernatural?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe naturally we are thus like a wilderneſs full of bryars, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath ſtrictly commanded this duty of inſtructing, and informing thoſe that are rude and ignorant in the wayes of God.</hi> And this duty is not only upon the Miniſters, but the Scripture commands it indiſpenſably upon Parents and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours. Thus in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. they are commanded to <hi>wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t the law upon their family, and to write it upon the poſts, and to be ſpeaking of them daily:</hi> Thus <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> they made their <hi>family to ſerve the Lord,</hi> which cannot be without the knowledge of him. In the new Teſtament, <hi>Paul</hi> commands <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, To bring up their children in the knowledge of the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6.5. And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Proverbs</hi> are full of theſe exhortations. For certainly if the Scripture ſay, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9 23. <hi>Let not the rich man boaſt in his riches, nor the great man in his honours, but in that he knows God</hi>; then the endeavour of parents to provide wealth, riches, lands, or a great portion, is nothing ſo acceptable, as to teach them the fear of God. Oh therefore that at laſt our families might be made Chriſts Schools, wherin the principles and commands of Chriſt may be frequently urged! Oh who can make lamentations bitter enough for the neglect of this! In many
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101245:19"/>
Families, there is the Devils School; people may learn to curſe, to ſwear, to become bruit beaſts: But to have the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God <hi>taught,</hi> would be the greateſt burden in the world. Well, conſider that of <hi>Jeremy</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour down thy wrath upon the Families, that call not on thy Name</hi>: Which by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, at leaſt, reacheth private Families and Houſholds. And how can they <hi>call,</hi> if they do not <hi>believe</hi>? and how can they <hi>believe,</hi> if they do not <hi>know</hi>? As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth, <hi>That Families are the beginnings of Common wealths</hi>; and ſo they are good, or bad, as particular Families are. So it is with the Church, that conſiſts of particular Families. But if they be like a Cage of unclean birds, like the Wilderneſs, wherein dreadfull Birds are, what good can be expected from a Church conſiſting of ſuch? Men ſpeak of Houſes where the Devils walk, where ſpirits haunt, men dare not dwell there: I tell thee, That a Family where ignorance and prophaneneſs is nouriſhed, is an houſe, not only haunted, but even poſſeſſed by Devils. And how canſt thou eat, ſleep, and live in ſuch a place?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In the <hi>primitive times,</hi> there were a rank of people, that were called <hi>Catecumini,</hi> (as we ſaid before) <hi>Candidati,</hi> or <hi>Competentes</hi>; ſuch who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted from Paganiſm, were not yet fully inſtructed in the <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Religi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Thus you ſee, how carefull in Antiquity they were, that they might have no <hi>ignorant</hi> perſons among them. And certainly, as in all Arts, there are <hi>Principles</hi> which muſt be learned, before they can come to <hi>Concluſions</hi>; ſo it's here in Religion. And oh, that we could ſee this <hi>Knowledge</hi> brought in amongſt people! To be a Chriſtian, is to be <hi>anointed</hi>; and this <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Principles of Religion (largely ſo called) are of two ſorts; either <hi>Corrupt, Idolatrical,</hi> and <hi>Heretical</hi>; or true, <hi>Sound,</hi> and <hi>Conſonant</hi> to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now there are many in the world, are too forward to infuſe poyſonous and dangerous Principles; ſo great a matter is it, to conſider what men are ſeaſoned with at firſt, either privately or publiquely. Thus many are infected with Popiſh and ſuperſtitious Principles; many with erroneous and falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; and theſe foundations being laid, it's very difficult ever to remove them. As the veſſel is firſt ſeaſoned, or the tree at firſt planted, ſo it is likely to continue. The Apoſtle cals thoſe Jewiſh Ceremonies, the <hi>beggerly elements,</hi> Gal. 4.9. or <hi>Principles of the world.</hi> Why ſo? becauſe the ſuperſtitious Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made them the firſt Elements, the Principles, the foundation of all; and therefore they thought all Religion was taken away, if they were removed. And thus you have divers perſons, they have indeed ſome <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> but they are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> ſuch as <hi>put out</hi> the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Chriſt, and the Scriptures. And, <hi>It's a two-fold labour</hi> (as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid) <hi>to a perverted Diſciple of his, to teach them,</hi> for they muſt firſt be untaught their erroneous Principles, and then muſt be inſtructed in the truth. Oh then, look to this, that thy Principles about Religion be not falſe, ignorant, and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones!</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The <hi>true</hi> Principles of Religion, are reduced to ſeverall heads, and are both ſhort and eaſie, but neceſſary to be known. The Doctrine about <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and our <hi>ſelves,</hi> which is the <hi>Credendum.</hi> The Doctrine about <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is the <hi>Agendum.</hi> And about things <hi>to come,</hi> which is the <hi>Sperandum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About <hi>God,</hi> we are to believe, <hi>That he is,</hi> and <hi>a rewarder of thoſe that ſeek him.</hi> About <hi>Chriſt, This is eternal life, to know Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (Joh. 17.2.) <hi>and the holy Ghoſt</hi>; for, <hi>we are Baptized in his Name.</hi> About our <hi>ſelves,</hi> the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101245:19"/>
deſperate pollution of our <hi>natures,</hi> the hainouſneſs of <hi>ſinne,</hi> the aggravation of the curſes of the <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The things to <hi>be done,</hi> are <hi>Repentance,</hi> which driveth out of our ſins; and <hi>Faith,</hi> which driveth out of our own righteouſneſs. But becauſe theſe are Divine Works, therefore a man muſt be <hi>regenerated and born again.</hi> And this Principle Chriſt inſiſted on to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> Joh 3.</p>
                     <p>The things <hi>to come,</hi> are, The <hi>Reſurrection of the Body</hi>; The <hi>immortality of the Soul</hi>; The <hi>Day of Judgment</hi>; The <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> provided for the godly and the wicked. Theſe Principles are plain and eaſie; not to fleſh and blood, but in reſpect of the <hi>manifeſtation of them.</hi> They are laid down clearly in Scripture: None, without horrible impudency, can deny them. Indeed, there are many ſublime Diſputes about the Trinity, and about Chriſts Incarnation; but theſe are not neceſſary to be believed by every one. Oh then, how great is thy ingratitude! God hath made the neceſſary things eaſie, and plain, and yet thou art not acquainted with them. If God had commanded ſome greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thee; If he had required all thy time, all thy ſtudy, thou waſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to have done it. How much rather in things of ſo eaſie apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
                     <p>But now, when we ſay, <hi>Theſe divine Principles are eaſie</hi>; you muſt take heed of two miſtakes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>We do not mean, that the divine Faith and Belief of them, is eaſie to fleſh and blood; no: but they are eaſie, ſuppoſing the grace of God, in reſpect of other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in Religion</hi> For otherwiſe: To believe with a Divine Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>the Spirit of God inabling upon divine Authority,</hi> (which is only true Faith) is <hi>the immediate work of Gods Spirit.</hi> Therefore Faith, though it be but Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and not ſaving, is the gift of God. When we deſire a Knowledge, and Faith of theſe Principles, we mean not ſuch a Faith as moſt men have, a Faith of cuſtom and humane education; a Faith, becauſe they are brought up in ſuch a Religion: but upon <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Knowledge grounded upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> That which is uſually called the <hi>Colliars</hi> Faith, <hi>To believe as the Church believes</hi>; Is the Husbandmans, and the Tradeſmans, and the rich mans, and the poor mans Faith, too much in the world. So that as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>His yoke is eaſie,</hi> and yet alſo it is <hi>very hard: Eaſie</hi> to the <hi>heart ſanctified,</hi> but <hi>grieveous</hi> to the <hi>unregenerate.</hi> So it is here: The Principles of Religion are eaſie and plain to the mind inlightned, but they are either fooliſhneſs, or abſurdities to the greateſt Scholar that is, if h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>We do not mean, that the bare ſaying of the Principles of Religian by heart and rote, is the true believing and knowing of them.</hi> As the Child is not ſaid to be fed with milk, unleſs it ſwallow it down, and be nouriſhed by it. So neither can they be ſaid to <hi>believe</hi> the Principles of Religion, unleſs they do with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>apply</hi> them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>receive</hi> them into their hearts. But this is all that moſt attain unto, they can tell you, <hi>God made them</hi>; That <hi>Chriſt is their Saviour</hi>; That <hi>they muſt repent of ſinne:</hi> But theſe things are by meer rote. They learn them, as formerly in Popery they learned their Prayers in Lattin, they knew not what they prayed for; ſo neither theſe, what they do believe.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Groun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi> for <hi>Inſtruction</hi> in theſe Principles, are,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe God accounts of no zeal, nor devout affections,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How neceſſary the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is.</note> 
                        <hi>if they be not the fruit of Knowledge.</hi> Thus Chriſt told the woman, that was ſo zealous for her Fathers worſhip, <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what,</hi> Joh. 4 22. Though God once accepted bruit beaſts as a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rifice to him, <hi>Yet now</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>let's offer up our ſelves a reaſonable Sacrifice,</hi> Rom. 12.1. The Jew had a zeal, but not according to Knowledge. Therefore thoſe crafty Principles in Popery, to keep men in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> (to make <hi>it</hi> the Mother of Devotion) that thereby
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101245:20"/>
they may reign, and do what they liſt, is to lead men blind-fold into Hell.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Principles are Foundations, and are the Root.</hi> Now, he would be an unwiſe Artificer, that ſhould intend to rear up a Houſe, and lay no Foundation. So that, as long as we preach to a people <hi>ignorant</hi> of theſe, we have no bottom to ſtand upon. Principles are like Seed: Every poor man will make hard ſhift to get Seed to ſow with.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Without this good Foundation laid, no Preaching, or Duties, can have any ſpiritual effect.</hi> For, Why are not the bruit Beaſts? Why not fools and mad men, capable of any benefit by the Word preached? But, becauſe the one have not rational ſouls; and the other, though they have them, yet the actual uſe and exerciſe of Reaſon is bound up. It is thus with all people deſtitute of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Principles: All is done in an unknown tongue. They are <hi>Barbarians</hi> to us, and we to them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Converſion cannot be wrought without ſome Knowledge of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> We cannot <hi>believe</hi> in <hi>him</hi> we do not <hi>know.</hi> We cannot <hi>love him</hi> we do not <hi>know.</hi> The Heathens, they indeed, built an Altar <hi>To the unknown God</hi> But it is unſufferable for a Chriſtian, if a Chriſtian ſhould perform his duties to an <hi>unknown God,</hi> or <hi>unknown Chriſt.</hi> They muſt <hi>underſtand, and ſo be converted,</hi> Iſa. 6.10. God makes <hi>light ſhine out of darkneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>The Knowledge of theſe Principles is neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> You that are ignorant totally of them, cannot upon any juſt grounds hope for ſalvation. <hi>This is eternal life, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> Joh. 17.2. <hi>They are a people of no underſtanding, therefore he that made them will not ſave them,</hi> Iſa. 27.11. God would have all men to be ſaved, and <hi>come to the Knowledge of the Truth,</hi> 2 Tim 3.7. Oh then, how ſhould you, who ſit in this palpable darkneſs be afraid! People uſe to fear in the dark; and certainly thou ſhould bewail thy ſelf. I am an old man, an old woman; I have lived thus long where the word hath been preached, and yet how little do I know.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>None can pretend excuſes for their ignorance herein.</hi> To have much Knowledg in Religion, there is required much time and ſtudy; many abilities, better education. But for theſe Foundations, none can excuſe, themſelves becauſe God hath revealed them in a plain eaſie manner: He that runneth may read them. So that it is our ſlowthfulneſs if we do not know.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>Want of ſound Knowledge in theſe, makes many Errors and Hereſies.</hi> Many affect to ſpeak, and hold opinions in Religion, before ever they were well inſtructed. Thoſe that did not hold Chriſt the Head, they preſently fell to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Angels. The empty ſtraw, is <hi>carried about with every wind.</hi> He that hath no bottom, moveth up and down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Of ſharp Reproof, to ſuch who continue in this <hi>damnable Ignorance,</hi> and that though they live where the Word is preached. If the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were to be blamed becauſe they could not bear ſtrong food, what then belongs to them who are not capable of milk? The very Principles of Religion are too hard for them. They know not what you mean, when you ſpeak of theſe things. Thus they are as bruit beaſts, made to be deſtroyed. You may find as much knowledg of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Pagans and Heathens, as among ſome that live in the boſom of the Church. Some have not the Knowledg of God; I ſpeak to your ſhame. Many have not the Knowledg of God; It may be ſpoken to the confuſion of our faces How doth this darkneſs cover mens faces by Aitheiſm, prophanenes, and great negligence? They make it not their buſineſs to <hi>enquire after Knowledg.</hi> They greatly n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>glect the means of Knowledg, <hi>Prayer, Hearing, Reading, Inſtructing of others.</hi> Say a man be greatly Ignorant, and you ſay he hath enough to damn him to all eternity: He will commit any ſin; He will embrace any Idolatry; even as the man in the dark ſtumbles, and knows not where he goeth. Eſpecially, this is a ſure barre againſt receiving of the Sacrament, for that requires diſcerning of the Lords body, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining themſelves; which can never be done without a competent meaſure of Knowledg in Religion.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words contain the reaſon of <hi>Pauls</hi> prudence, in diſpenſing ſpiritual meat to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> milk, and not ſolid food. We may not preach all things to all people. There are gyants and dwarfs; there are carnal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</p>
                     <p>The words have no difficulty, only our Tranſlators ſupply a word, for in the Greek it is thus only, <hi>For hitherto ye were not able, neither are ye now able</hi>; they ſupply <hi>[to bear]</hi> or to concoct and digeſt; for he purſueth that metaphor, of making <hi>Truth</hi> the <hi>food</hi> of the ſoul. <hi>Veritas eſt cibus animi.</hi> Such a defective ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion we have of the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>The Word preached is commended in Scripture for ſeveral and divine operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now if thou haſt many years been under theſe droppings, and yet art a dry wilderneſſe, how unſufferable is it? In other things of the world, you think it not to be endured. You ſend your children to be taught, and if in many years they ſhould not yet be able to ſpell the Alphabet, you would think all coſt in vain. If year after year you plow, and prepare a field for Corn, and yet there come up nothing but weeds and thiſtles, this is a <hi>vanity of vanities, and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> What the <hi>Heathens</hi> ſpeak of their <hi>Tantalus,</hi> to be up to the chin in water, and yet ready to periſh for thirſt, is true in thee.</p>
                     <p>For opening this, let us conſider,<note place="margin">What are thoſe effects of the Miniſtry, for the defect whereof a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely blamed. 1. Intellectual effects.</note> 
                        <hi>What are thoſe choiſe and noble effects of the Miniſtry, for the defect whereof a people may be ſeverely blamed.</hi> And they are of two ſorts, <hi>Intellectual upon the underſtanding,</hi> or <hi>Pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

And for the firſt, <hi>That people will be found without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and under a great condemnation, who have not found thoſe intellectual effects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Illumination, and enlightning of the underſtanding, to believe the firſt principles and foundations of Religion.</hi> Every Science, and ſo that of Divinity hath its firſt principles, which are eaſie and plain. <hi>Principia luce ſuâ lucent,</hi> they ſhine with their own light, as the Sunne ſhineth with its own light, you need not another Sunne to ſee it. So that if theſe principles, this light be put on the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick, held out in the Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſtry, they of themſelves do eaſily enlighten the whole houſe; that is, Suppoſe a man come with attention and faith, (for <hi>oportet diſcentem credere,</hi> and <hi>principles cannot be proved</hi>;) but eſpecially the ſanctification of the Spirit of God is required. So though the Sunne be never ſo viſible, if the eye be not prepared, all is in vain to a blind man. Now then ſuppoſing this, Who can plead for that damnable ignorance in many people, that have lived ſo many years, where the Word hath been preached? What can ſuch ſay more than <hi>Heathens</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> that do all things to an unknown god (as you heard) and believe, and worſhip they know not what? I tell you, ſuch have not the firſt ſtone yet laid for any ſpiritual foundation. What do ſuch Bats and Owles
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101245:21"/>
in the Sunne-ſhine of the Goſpel? Oh if thou hadſt lived in <hi>Sodome</hi> or <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> it had not been ſuch a wonder, but in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be ſo blind, argueth thy caſe damnable!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Word preached expects this effect, not only to lay a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>but to build upwards, not only to plant, but to grow.</hi> Thus <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. the Offices in the Church are to bring us to a <hi>full ſtature in Chriſt. Paul</hi> went up and down to confirm and increaſe, where he had laid a foundation. Where God gives talents he looks for increaſe. The Miniſtry is a talent, of which God will require a ſtrict account: So that it's a juſt reproach to a people that live under the means, if they be not out of the lower form, if they have not left firſt and low principles, riſing to higher perfection: As <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſharply reprove the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for this want of growth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. Oh then ſit not down at the lower round in the ladder, ſtay not at the bottome of the hill. Chriſtianity is a race. There is work, and work enough for thee. Thus <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>His eyes may be opened to underſtand the wonderfull things of the Law,</hi> Pſal. 119. His eyes were already opened, and he had more <hi>knowledge than his teachars,</hi> yet he prayeth as fervently to have his eyes opened, as if he were a beginner, and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for thoſe <hi>already enlightned,</hi> that the <hi>Spirit of wiſdome and illumination might be upon them.</hi> What <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Timothy, Let thy profiting appear to all,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. ſo ſay we, you that hear and enjoy teaching, Let your profiting appear to all. Let all the world ſee, there is a vaſt difference between living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Miniſtry, or a negligent Miniſtry, and an inſtructing one. If Corn ſhould grow no better in improved grounds, then in the barren heath, it would be very ſtrange. To a blind man, the day and night is all one, he ſeeth as well at one time as another. Oh fear thy ſelf in a ſtate of blindneſſe, to whom preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and no preaching, the Miniſtry and no Miniſtry is all one, for thou makeſt no more progreſſe!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>A third Effect of the Miniſtry is, To eſtabliſh and ſettle in the truth, to give a ſound mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> For through mens corruptions, pride and vain-glory, the Miniſtry, as it may increaſe mens parts, ſo accidentally increaſe their errours. As <hi>April</hi>-ſhowrs that make the flowers freſh and ſweet, ſo cauſe many croking frogs alſo. This age doth teſtifie it; If men get any knowledge, any parts, or abilities, <hi>This is like new wine in old bottles,</hi> it breaketh the bottles. The ſails are too big for the ſhip, and ſo they are <hi>Doctores,</hi> before they be <hi>Diſcipuli,</hi> they are teachers of others before well taught themſelves. Now it's a ſhame and a blame for any people to runne into erroneous Doctrines, that enjoy a ſound Miniſtry. Mark that place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. ſpeaking of the Office of the Miniſtry, one effect he mentioneth is, <hi>That we ſhould not be carried away as children with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> Hence Miniſters are called <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Shepherds</hi>; and a great preſervative it is to attend upon them, and ſubmit to them, not with a blind obedience, but as owning the inſtitution of Chriſt, and the way to keep from falſhoods; and this is not to preach our ſelves, but your good. It's beſt for the ſheep to keep to his faithfull Shepherd. They are not infallible it's true, much leſſe art thou infallible; therefore a bleſſing is to be expected in Gods order.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>It is a ſhame to a people living under the Miniſtry of the Goſpel a long while, if they are not thereby furniſhed with abilities for thoſe ſeveral perſonal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that God requireth of them.</hi> As for example, <hi>Parents</hi> muſt bring up their children in the knowledge of the Lord. <hi>Private</hi> Chriſtians are to have the Word dwell ſo plentifully in them, that they are to admoniſh one another. The <hi>Huſband</hi> is to inſtruct his wife at home, if ſhe doubt of the things of Religion. They are to inſtruct, rebuke, as occaſion ſerveth. Now how uncomely is it (as we formerly ſhewed) if thou a man ſo old, ſo long hearing the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, canſt not diſcharge theſe perſonal duties? Oh the dreadfull account! Oh
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101245:21"/>
the many duties God looks for at your hands, which will not be expected from others!</p>
                     <p>In the next place, <hi>Let us obſerve, what a ſinne it is,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Practical Effects.</note> 
                        <hi>if people are not able to bear, or receive, the practical operations of the Word.</hi> For all knowledge, if it be not after godlineſſe, is a <hi>tinkling cymbal.</hi> The Word is not only the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but the tree of life alſo. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The Word is uſually cloathed with this Majeſty, as to awe mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to make them civil, to cauſe them to forbear many groſſe and rude wayes they were once accuſtomed unto.</hi> Thus <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtry, though it did not convert <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> yet it made him do many things <hi>gladly.</hi> The rocky and ſtony ground was a little mollified on the top to receive the Word, though it was not ſoft at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. The Word, though it doth not ſoak to the bottome of mens hearts, though it doth not enter ſo deep, yet it thaweth above ſometimes, and men grow more civil. This makes the wals fall down, though it doth not take the City. Oh woe then, and again woe to that man, to whom the Word hath not done ſo much as this, but he is as prophane as a very beaſt, as if he had lived in hell, and not under the preaching of the Word, which is called the kingdom of Heaven! The wild beaſts of the field, they hide themſelves, when once the day begins to break forth. And certainly, prophane, uncivil men, ſhould even call to the mountains and hils to cover them, rather than be ſeen in ſuch evil wayes. <hi>Thoſe that are drunk are drunk in the night,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.7. and they are called, <hi>works of darknſſe.</hi> Why then doſt thou ſtumble in the day? Thou haſt light to ſee where thou ſhouldſt walk. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of one ſort of wickedneſſe, <hi>That it was not ſo much as named among Heathens,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. Oh then, How many groſſe ſinnes are there, that ſhould not be ſo much as named, much leſſe practiſed among Chriſtians! It's a diſhonour even to the word of God, if thou ſhalt not do ſo much, which the very light of nature, and moral Philoſophy hath done among others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The word of God</hi> (which is indeed the proper work of it) <hi>doth convert, regenerate, make men new creatures, not only civil, but godly, doing things from God, and through God, and to God.</hi> Herein the word of God diſcovers it ſelf, to come from God, becauſe it makes men of a divine nature. <hi>Every agent aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Patient into its own nature:</hi> Fire will turn all things into fire: And thus the word of God coming from Heaven makes men heavenly.

Oh it's an happy thing, when a Miniſter can ſay, You are our Sermons to be ſeen and read of all men! All men by your lives may ſee what is preached to you, and what you hear.

With what delight and alacrity did they exhort one another to go to the houſe of the Lord? The preaching of the Word is like ſetting up ſpiritual trading and merchandize, how buſie and active ſhould men be? It's the Spring time, for ſpiritual Bees to make honey. It's the Summer time, for ſpiritual Ants to labour and treaſure up. <hi>Since the dayes of John Baptiſt untill now, the kingdome of Heaven ſuffers violence,</hi> Mat. 11.12. <hi>They take it by force.</hi> Thus the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture exhorts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>While it's called to day.</hi> And again, <hi>Now is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable time.</hi> Some are threatned to runne from Eaſt and Weſt, from North to South, becauſe of the famine of the Word, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.12. You ſhould do as <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the ſeven years plenty, he laid up againſt the ſeven years famine. Even <hi>Johns</hi> hearers, though they had no bottome of grace, did for a while rejoyce in his light. Oh then, how uncomfortable is it to ſee men live like bruit beaſts under the Miniſtry, not prizing of it, no wayes thankfull to God for it; but like the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal regard husks, when manna is near!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>It's a ſinne and reproach, if where the Word hath been long preached, there is not a preparedneſſe for, and conformity unto all the inſtituted Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Church is a ſpiritual Society, and have a viſible Communion, or external Forme; and that conſiſts in <hi>Preaching,</hi> in <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments,</hi> in <hi>godly Diſcipline, ſpiritual Cenſures upon obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Offenders.</hi> Now all Congregations ſhould be able to bear theſe things. When our Saviour told his Diſciples, <hi>That they muſt eat his fleſh, and drinke his bloud</hi>; ſome cried out, <hi>This is an hard ſaying, Who can bear it?</hi> John 6.60. <hi>and from that time forſook him.</hi> And thus it is in ſpiritual Diſcipline, to have comely Order about the Sacraments; all that walk diſorderly admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the contumacious caſt out; men cry out, who can bear it? and to this day they cannot bear it. Theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> had groſſe abuſes crept in about the Lords Supper, <hi>Men did not examine themſelves,</hi> they came <hi>drunke</hi> and <hi>irreverent.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle brings them to the firſt Inſtitution, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. Now theſe things particular Congregations ſhould be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>It is their ſhame, if they cannot bear and ſubmit unto all thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſelf-denyal, taking up the croſſe, preparation for perſecutions.</hi> We may obſerve, that our Saviour, and ſo the Apoſtles, did much endeavour to take men off from expectations of carnal advantages by the Goſpel. The Devil ſhewed all the glory of the world; but Chriſt all the miſery and temptations that would accompany the profeſſion of his Truth, <hi>Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my Names ſake,</hi> John 15.19.

                     <p>At this time, let us view the General, <hi>For ye are carnal.</hi> In what ſenſe the Apoſtle called them ſo, is explained, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. viz. <hi>not abſolutely, but compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</hi> They had the ſeed and root of grace, but yet corruption was alſo very prevalent in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> To what hath been ſaid in explication of this, you may make one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>Why the Apoſtle, if they were godly for the main, doth call them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: Is it not a certain Rule, that the denomination ought to be from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or better part? Do we not ſay, there is an heap of wheat, though ſome chaff and cockle be among it? And do not the Orthodox ſay thus to the Papiſts? For when the Papiſts ſay, That if there be corruption in every work we doe, if a godly man hath a principle of ſinne in him, as well as of grace; Then</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we may as well call him a wicked man as a godly man, we may as well call it a ſinfull action, as a godly action.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this it is anſwered, That ſeeing a godly man regenerated is made a new creature, and ſo that which is fundamentally predominant in him is grace; and ſinne is <hi>praeter naturam,</hi> beſide his nature. Inſomuch that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Being born of God, he doth not ſinne,</hi> 1 John 3.9. He is a godly man, but not perfect. As a ſick man is truly a man, if life be in him, though not a ſound, healthfull man. This muſt be granted; and therefore theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that were godly for the main (we ſpeak not of individuals, but indefinitely) when abſolutely conſidered, are called <hi>Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. and the <hi>Temple of the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>ſanctified ones in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But if we take them comparatively, as the Apoſtle here doth, then that Rule comes in, <hi>Minus boni reſpectu majoris, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet rationum mali.</hi> So that if theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were compared with others of greater progreſſe, they were carnal. Even as in learning, one of competent knowledge, compared to an eminent Scholar, is but an ignorant man: ſo that this is ſpoken by way of reproach unto them. They ſuffer thoſe remainders of corruption in them to prevail; they cut not off the hair, wherein the ſtrength of ſinne lieth; they have a flux of this noiſome blood running on them, and yet they ſeek not out to a Phyſician, to have it cured. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the reliques of corruption, which do abide in the godly,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> ought to be an heavy burden to them, againſt which they are daily to ſtrive and combate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As God, when he gave the <hi>Iſraelites Canaan</hi> in full poſſeſſion, yet let the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants and wild beaſts be ſtill there, not totally deſtroyed, that they might have daily exerciſe and dependance upon God. So it is here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though God hath put thy ſoul in full poſſeſſion of Chriſt; though thou art renewed and ſanctified, yet all that corruption within ſhall not be ſubdued; but this is left like a thorne in thy eyes, and a prick in thy ſide, to make thee pray often to God for his grace.

Hence are thoſe commands even to ſuch that are godly, <hi>To mortifie the deeds of the fleſh,</hi> Col. 3.5. And <hi>to crucifie them,</hi> Gal. 5.24. which argueth, ſinne hath ſome life in them ſtill. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. exhorts, <hi>That ſinne may not reign in their mortal bodies</hi>; He doth not ſay, let it not be, but let it not reign. Though the Tree be cut down, yet here is the ſtump and root in the godly. To open this, Conſider,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and ſins of the godly.</note>Firſt, <hi>That even the moſt ſpiritual that are, the Chriſtians of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, even thoſe that ſhine like Sunnes in the world, have yet ſpots, blemiſhes and wrinkles in them.</hi> So that not only theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> of an inferiour form, but even <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who reproveth thoſe for being carnal, yet <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of himſelf, <hi>That he is carnal, and that when he would do good, evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him.</hi> That Chapter doth excellently declare, what a great conflict and combate the people of God have in theſe: for when they would believe, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief hindereth them; when they would be heavenly-minded, earthlineſſe hinders them. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. the Apoſtle ſpeaks there univerſally of all the godly, of thoſe that are <hi>Pillars,</hi> as well as others, of the <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>yes</hi> and <hi>head</hi> in the <hi>body,</hi> as well as the <hi>feet; The Spirit luſteth againſt the fleſh, and the fleſh againſt the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>That the things you would not do, thoſe you do.</hi> So that it's plain, no godly man in the world, is inabled in his whole heart with all might to what is good, as <hi>Adam,</hi> or the Saints glorified in Heaven; but they have oppoſition within them. They have heart againſt heart, mind againſt mind, will againſt will, affections againſt affections. They are like a blind man, and a dead man coupled together. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did much diſpute this point, by reaſon of the <hi>Pelagians, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any man might be perfect in this life, free from all ſinne?</hi> And although he ſeemed not to deny, that a man might be, yet he affirms <hi>(de facto)</hi> none ever was. But that former alſo muſt be diſtinguiſhed of. For if you regard the power of God, no queſtion he can cure all diſeaſes. He that gives thee any degree of grace, can make thee altogether godly. God who made the world by degrees in the ſpace of ſix dayes, could have done it in a moment, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought he did. And ſo may we ſay, Men may be without ſinne. But if we ſpeak of the ordinary power of God, or his declared will, whereby he hath decreed not to give to men ſuch a meaſure of grace, as ſhall ſubdue all ſinne, then we ſay it cannot be: But the beſt gold will have ſome droſſe; The beſt Garden will have ſome weeds. Hence they have a perpetual patern of Prayer, which a <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Paul</hi> is to pray, as well as babes in Chriſtianity, that God would forgive their ſinne. So that this is an undoubted truth, that even the moſt holy carry about with them a body of ſinne, which they are alwayes crucifying.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Yet there are other Chriſtians, who have ſinne more prevalent over them, and are eaſier overcome, and theſe deſerve more to be called carnal than the former, their corruptions are more viſible than their grace.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> had ſeveral degrees of worthy valiant men; ſome were valiant and ſtrong, but did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by farre to the degree of the firſt Worthies. Such a degree there is in Chriſts ſouldiers; all have ſpiritual ſtrength, and the armour of Chriſt upon them; but there are ſome who are the worthies of the firſt rank; others there are, who are negligent and careleſſe, who often fall into the enemies hands, and get wounds and blows often to their conſciences. It's a ſad thing to ſee a godly man, not keeping his garments clean, but ſpotting and defiling them by the pitch in the world. <hi>They walk as men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; carnal, as others; proud, as others; earthly, as others; paſſionate, as others. Oh take heed, that thy life be not as the ſluggards field, all grown over with bryars and thorns! This is too often, that men hide their light in a buſhel; nay, loſe their ſavourineſſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though godlineſſe be in the bottome, yet nothing but bitterneſſe and corruption doth appear.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>As corruption doth thus abide in all the godly, and worketh differently,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101245:23"/>
ſo it doth ſometimes flame out into open fire; ſo that it's no longer the luſt and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinne within, but the groſſe operations without.</hi> In <hi>Peter,</hi> you ſee what a leak there was ready to drown the whole Ship. He perfidiouſly denieth his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with terrible curſings and execration. We need not tell of <hi>David</hi> and others.

It is greatly diſputed, <hi>Whether the ſinnes they may fall into, may be called reigning ſinnes?</hi> Some learned men ſay, I; ſome ſay, No: But they may be reconciled, by a true explication of the word <hi>[reigning]</hi> for they do not ſo reign, as to have full poſſeſſion, with plenary delight, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant content. Indeed <hi>David</hi> did deliberate and wilfully conſent to accompliſh his wickedneſſe; ſo that for the preſent, there was no actual reſiſting in him; yet there was the life of grace radically in him, he was kept by Gods power, and the promiſe againſt his own will. And thus in regard of that dominion of ſinne, for a while it might be ſaid to reign; but becauſe this was not perpetual, grace quickening of him, to recover again, it is juſtly ſaid not to reign. Now becauſe ſuch ſinnes may ariſe, and carry the whole man away captive; therefore the godly are exhorted. <hi>To watch and pray,</hi> 1 Pet 4, 7. Yea conſtantly to pray, <hi>That God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the next place, Let us conſider,<note place="margin">Whence it is that the godly do not fully conquer ſin.</note> 
                        <hi>Whence it is that the godly do not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſinne:</hi> For if you reſpect Chriſt he is greater than the Devil; and if you reſpect grace, that is more efficacious than ſinne; How then ſhould any luſts, paſſions or motions abide in us? Now the efficient grounds are theſe: And then the final grounds ſhall be mentioned afterwards.</p>
                     <p>The efficient, firſt, <hi>Becauſe original corruption, which is the fountain of thoſe ſtreams is not wholly dried up.</hi> We cannot expect the ſtreams ſhould be dried, when that is not. Marvel not then, if the godly are carnal, diffident, earthly, froward, for that which nouriſheth theſe is not deſtroyed. Though <hi>Samſons</hi> hair be cut off, yet it is not pulled up by the root. <hi>There is the law of ſin in the members,</hi> as well as <hi>the law of God written in their inward parts.</hi> So that there cannot but be thoſe ſinfull affections and corrupt deſires ſtirring in thee; theſe noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vapours cannot but exhale, as long as that filthy lake or bogge is within thee.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Spirit of God by which we come to mortifie theſe corruptions, doth not put forth its full power.</hi> It's a free agent, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. <hi>If ye through the Spirit, mortifie</hi>; So that by the Spirit of God, we come to conquer and ſubdue ſinne. Now this is not in our power, no more than the Apoſtles could miracles, when, and how much they liſted (though there be ſome difference between miraculous gifts and ſanctification.) If the Spirit of God did come upon thee in the full meaſure of ſanctification, then thou wouldſt of a leper, become all over clean; but Chriſt only received the Spirit without meaſure. It's ſtinted to thee, thou ſeeſt more and more to be daily done in Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Therefore doth corruption remain, Becauſe the inſtrument of Sanctification and Mortification, that alſo is imperfect and weak.</hi> Act. 10. <hi>Faith purifieth the heart,</hi> Rom. 11. Faith receiveth the fatneſſe of the Olive-tree. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſt dwels in the heart by faith.</hi> Heb. 11. All thoſe glorious works of righteouſneſſe were done by faith. So that if our faith be weak, the effects of it alſo will be weak; and that every mans faith is weak, appeareth, <hi>Becauſe we know but in part,</hi> and ſo can adhere and apply but in part.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Therefore doth corruption abide in us, Becauſe the Law of God is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101245:24"/>
pure and exact.</hi> This is not an efficient ground, ſo much as occaſional, to diſcover and manifeſt that this ſour leaven ſtill is in us. The Law of God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole man, an univerſality of the Subject and Object, and of Degrees, and of Time, which it's impoſſible for us to do; therefore the tranſgreſſion of the Law makes it to be ſinne. If the Law have not forbidden weak love, weak faith, it had been no more ſinne, than weak health, or weak ſtrength. It had been a languor, or penalty only, as the Papiſts ſay, not truly, and formally a ſinne.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, Obſerve the <hi>final grounds, Why God who is thus able to bid us be whole at once; Or as Chriſt, whom he cured corporally, he cured perfectly; he wrought no half-cures, why ſhould he not do thus in ſpiritual healings, as</hi> Caſtalio <hi>urgeth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe God intends in this life, to glorifie evangelical grace, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Goſpel by faith,</hi> as the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> abundantly witneſſe. Now if we had a righteouſneſſe of our own works, how could it be imputed without works? How could we with <hi>Paul</hi> account our own righteouſneſs dung and droſſe for the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith, if ours were gold? Oh then! how wiſe ſhould the godly man be?

                     <p>In the godly this ſinne is too vigorouſly alſo. Theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews James</hi> writeth to, were ready to devoure and conſume one another, by theſe Envyes. The Church of God, would alwaies abide like an Ark, compacted ſo cloſe together, that no waters could enter in; did not Envyings, and evil eyes upon one another, diſſolve the cement and ſodering, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are united. We ſhall find the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> and of Chriſt, even thoſe ſweet Roſes, to have theſe worms breed in them. When <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples ſaw the multitudes run after Chriſt, and there Maſter was not ſo much admired as before, they came in an envious manner, and complained of it. But how graciouſly did <hi>John</hi> labour to rebuke that ill ſpirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.30.? The Diſciples of Chriſt alſo, they were ſometimes upon envyings and proud contentions; (For theſe alwaies go together.) and ſtrived to have more greatneſs then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Yea, at that time when Chriſt informed them of Perſecutions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which ſhould be undergone for his ſake. So that you ſee, even the Children of God, (and that while they are low, and under Perſecutions of a common enemy,) are yet ready to have envyings and bitter affections one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. So remarkeable is that place, <hi>James</hi> 4.5. <hi>The ſpirit that is in us luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Envy.</hi> Even the ſpirit in the godly, luſteth to Envy: Is violently carried out that way.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101245:25"/>
envied God in his happineſs and glorious eſtate. And now, ſince he is condemned into eternal torments, he envies man; the godly man, that hath an intereſt in Chriſt. He is tormented to ſee men delivered out of his Chaines. He is troubled that others have good, though he hath no advantage by it. That ſo many men are damned, it's no advantage to the Devil; yea it increaſeth his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe they were tempted by him: yet his Envy and malice carrieth him out thus. Now, this deviliſh diſpoſition is in every envious man. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> cals it ſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.15. So that all the while thou art troubled to ſee it better with others then thee, thou art in a deviliſh frame. It's deviliſh wiſdome: It's deviliſh grief and vexation. Oh, how ſhould this make the People of God tremble at it!</p>
                     <p>Now, the <hi>good</hi> that is in others, for which this <hi>Envy</hi> may <hi>work,</hi> may be of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Natures.</hi> As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe of the Riches, Power, Greatneſs, and outward proſperity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Thy eye is evil, becauſe God giveth wealth to others, not to thee: Health to others, not to thee: Proſperity to others, not to thee. Thus <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> Brethren envied <hi>Joſeph</hi> becauſe of his Dream, that all their Sheafes ſhould bow to his Sheaf; and becauſe he had more of his Fathers love. Take heed then, of being troubled at the Proſperity, and the good condition of others. This is Envy. And, Shalt thou be bad to thy own ſoul, becauſe God is good to others? Becauſe God hath not given thee the good things others have, wilt thou throw away thy ſoul alſo? Or,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It may be, <hi>Becauſe of the Applauſe, and Honour, or Eſteem others have</hi>: Which will leſſen thine. This is powerfull Envy. When two Suns are (as it were) together, when the increaſe of one, will be the decreaſe of the other. This was the main quarrell, and the cauſe of all the Envy againſt Chriſt and his Diſciples. They ſaw the people runne after him: They ſaw multitudes following of him, and their wickedneſs and hypocriſie began to be diſcovered: And this made them mad with Envy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It may be ſtill higher: <hi>Becauſe of the Parts and Abilities that others have better then theirs.</hi> And it's a greater ſinne, to Envy others becauſe of their Religious Parts and Abilities, then for any outward mercy: Becauſe theſe are the free gift of Gods Spirit. Now for this were the great Envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings amongſt the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> They were a people living in a rich and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous City: They abounded more in Parts and Gifts, then any Church we read of. And ſo, here were the greateſt Envyings and Factions. Inſomuch, that it's farre more happy to have ſanctifying Graces, then inlarged Gifts: Farre more glorious to have Love, then large Knowledg. That made the Apoſtle to commend Love ſo much to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> undervaluing all Gifts in reſpect of that, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.29. We read there of a <hi>good man Envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> becauſe the Spirit of Propheſying was poured out upon others; and <hi>Moſes</hi> gives him a reproof for it. So that where there is the more Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, the more Parts in Religion; there (through mens corruptions) are many times more Envyings and Factions. Now the way to cure theſe, is not (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) to keepe people in <hi>ignorance,</hi> but to preſs <hi>mortification,</hi> and the <hi>true works of grace,</hi> above all Parts.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, That is the higheſt poyſon and wickedneſs that can be in Envy, <hi>viz. When it is for the Graces and Godlineſs of others.</hi> Thou haſt a wicked, malicious, and envious heart to others, meerly becauſe they are godly. Though this be ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a ſinne, that ſome make it a tendency to the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, yet how often is it practiſed? How many men are reproached, envied by their neighbours and others, meerly for their godlineſs? They are carried out with deviliſh ſpite, becauſe of that. If they were prophane, ſuperſtitious, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and diſſolute as they are, then there were no better men in the world.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101245:26"/>
But this maketh them the object of their envy, that they are godly. Thus <hi>Cain,</hi> he envyed, and ſo hated his brother <hi>Abel.</hi> We might have thought, there being no more men, then thoſe two, except their Father, they ſhould dearely have loved one another; but <hi>Abel</hi>'s works they were godly, and God had a reſpect to his ſacrifice, and not to <hi>Cain</hi>'s, and this made him envy, hate, and at laſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. And this might be charged upon the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> when Chriſt terrifieth them about the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt; for indeed as you heard, to envy, ſpite, and malice a man becauſe of his godlineſs, it's an high degree to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable ſinne: Look to it; there is too many guilty of this dolefull crime.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the <hi>object</hi> of Envy. In the next place let us conſider the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> who are prone to it. And</p>

The reaſon why <hi>Lycinius</hi> grew ſo deſperately mad againſt the Chriſtians, whom he had formerly defended, was, becauſe Chriſtians in their meetings, prayed for <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and not him; the ground of <hi>Saul</hi>'s envy and hatred to <hi>David,</hi> was becauſe the women ſang, <hi>Saul ſlew his thouſands, and David his ten thouſands.</hi> Phil. 1.19. <hi>Some preach Chriſt out of envy,</hi> Theſe were teachers, that out of envy to <hi>Paul,</hi> who had all the glory, took the occaſion, now he was impriſoned, and could not preach to ſet forth Chriſt; and they thought <hi>Paul</hi> like themſelves, ambitious of glory, and eſteem, and therefore that this would grieve and vex <hi>Paul</hi>; but ſuch was his grace, that he could rejoyce in it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Such are ſubject to Envy, who becauſe they cannot abide the good of others, they therefore ſtudy all the wayes to diſparage, and obſcure the name, and excellency of ſuch:</hi> If they have any failings, if there be any weakneſſes, they rake in them, talk of them, neglecting the good, as the Kite that flyeth over the pleaſant meadows, and delights upon the dunghills, and Carrion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an envious man diſcovers himſelf by his talk, his words; though ſuch a man hath never ſo much worth, and excellency, in him, yet that he will never mention; or if he do, it's only craftily, that others may not think, he doth it out of envy.

He prayed moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, as the great thing before his death, that the godly might be one, How then comes envyings, and bitter thoughts among you? you that ought to have one heart, one mind, yea to lay down your lives for one another: How comes this diveliſh ſinne to be in you?

                     <p>Let us in the next place, conſider the <hi>aggravation</hi> of this ſinne, and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the heatheniſh Poets, have deſcribed it in ſuch an ugly, loathſome,<note place="margin">The Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Envy.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſhape, that all may ſee the unlovelineſs of it; yet they being matter only of fancy, and witty invention, we ſhall draw the pourtraiture of it from the Word of God, <hi>which is a two-edged ſword,</hi> and every arrow from this qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, may juſtly ſtrike to the heart of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The wickedneſs of this ſinne, may be excellently illuſtrated by that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good it is oppoſite to</hi>; for this is a rule, <hi>That privation is the worſt, whoſe habit is the beſt,</hi> that is the greateſt evil, which is oppoſite to the greateſt good: Now there is a three-fold good that envy doth oppoſe, as <hi>fire water,</hi> and <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs light.</hi> 1. <hi>The infinite goodneſs in God.</hi> 2. <hi>The ineſtimable goodneſs in Chriſt.</hi> 3. <hi>The admirable goodneſs, in the grace of love, or charity</hi>: So that if you would know, how great an evil envy is, ſay, it is as great an evil, as God is good, as Chriſt is good; it oppoſeth Gods goodneſs, ſo that phraſe implyeth, <hi>Is thy eye evil, becauſe God is good?</hi> Mat. 20 15. that is not intenſively, but privatively, for envy doth take God and Chriſt from me, my neighbour from me, and my ſelf from my ſelf; it maketh Gods goodneſs, and thy neighbours goodneſs, to be his evil who envyeth; this bitterneſs upon thy heart, is becauſe God is ſuch a fountain of goodneſs, that he communicates his mercies freely: Were envy able to fall upon that pure, and ſpotleſs Majeſty of God, he would not have created the world, nor made ſuch glorious Angels, nor give ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perfections to ſome in the world? for many times God loſeth his glory by this meanes, when they do not praiſe him, but diſhonour him: yet for all this, behold the goodneſs of God, that doth ſo liberally diffuſe it ſelf, though his glory be obſcured thereby. Oh! if it lay in an envious man, to make men great, or admired, or deſpicable, and contemptible, how quickly would he make the world a poor Hoſpital, that he might have all the glory! Behold then, the venemous poiſon of this ſinne of envy, which doth grudge, and repine, at the glorious Attribute of God, his bounty, and liberality; that which <hi>David</hi> is ſo raviſhed with himſelf, and calls upon Angels, and other creatures, to praiſe God for, <hi>viz. His mercy which endureth for ever,</hi> this the envious man is vexed at. There was a ſeed of this bitter wormwood in <hi>Jonah,</hi> how diſcontented, and

Oh if an envious man would think, thus would I have God no better to me, then to ſuch an one! Should I be willing, to have the Lord deal with me, as I deſire to others? this might change him. It's related of <hi>Nero,</hi> an envious, cruel man, That he would ſometimes bewail, there were none of thoſe terrible judgements in his time, as in former ages; That there were no ſuddain earthquakes, no violent plagues, and ſuch ſore demonſtrations of Gods wrath: well might be called clay, and blood mingled together.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It oppoſeth that admirable goodneſs in Chriſt</hi>: Oh come with admiration, and read, and conſider, the life of Chriſt, and his death, and you will ſee, envy is as direct contrary to him, as the Serpent to the Dove! Conſider what he was, and yet how debaſing himſelf for our ſakes; <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equall with God,</hi> Phil. 2. for it was his due, being of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that he might alwayes have declared that infinite Majeſty: but he willingly doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure this Sunne in a cloud, this Divinity in a vail of fleſh; and when he doth not take the nature of Angels, but man, even then he doth act the condition of the great, and mighty, and honoured men of the world, but of the moſt contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, a worme, and no man; yea ſee how good to us, to thoſe that hated him, envied him; how deſtitute of a place to lay his head in; that ſupported all the world by his power, at his death how abuſed, ſcorned, reproached, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the moſt ignominious, and ſcurrilous manner. Oh admire all this, you that hear and believe! Had there been any gall in this Dove, any envy in Chriſt, would he have emptied himſelf, thus to make thee full? Would he have become poor, to make thee rich? Oh then if envy at any time ſtirre in thy heart, ſay, Did Chriſt do thus? Was he of this temper? and it muſt need fill thee with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The grace of love and charity is often prayed for, and that by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might have it; he prayeth for nothing ſo earneſtly as that.</hi> It is made the ſign and ſymptome of Chriſts Diſciples, not by miracles, not by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, but by love, ſhall all men know Chriſts Diſciples. It is a duty enjoyned alſo; for faith hath the preeminence in the upper region of juſtification, ſo love in the lower of ſanctification; now the nature of the grace of love, is to have <hi>idem velle,</hi> and <hi>idem nolle,</hi> to make all good things, and all bad things common: yea the ſoul of the lover, is not where it animateth, ſo much as where it loveth; <hi>Love ſeeketh not her own, love envieth not, love is not puffed up,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.4, 5. Oh then, if as in the Temple, every thing was covered with gold, ſo among Chriſtians, every word, and action, ſhould be covered with love: <hi>Let all your things be done with charity,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.14. Then what a damnable ſinne is envy, which breaks theſe ſilken cords? when theſe helliſh motions of envy ſtirre in thee, cry out for the Spirit of love; Oh ſay this is none of Chriſts Spirit, this is not a Goſpel Spirit! As love is the fullfilling of the law, ſo envy is the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> hang upon love, ſo they do all fall to the ground, where envy is; if then there were but theſe three objects to look on, God, Chriſt, and Charity, it might make a man to abhorre, to take this toad of envy in his breaſt. But</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is ſtill further abomination in this ſinne; for <hi>it's the very lively image of the Devil.</hi> There is nothing ſo like the Devil, as an envious man, with his hornes to puſh at every one, and his cloven foot to make diviſions, and wranglings: This you heard, this wiſdome, <hi>viz.</hi> whereby men make ſtrifes, and envyings, is ſaid to be diveliſh, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.15. Oh then! What accord hath Chriſt with <hi>Belial</hi>? Why art not thou aſhamed to look God, or good men in the face, that haſt this diveliſh temper in thee? As the <hi>Bafilisk</hi> doth ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101245:27"/>
hate man, that they ſay, he will take the very picture of him, if he can: Thus the envy and malice of the Devil, is ſo great againſt God, that becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vent himſelf upon God, therefore he doth upon man, made after Gods image, and although it be no profit to him, yea an encreaſe of his torment, to tempt man to ſinne, and to damne him, yet he delights to do it: Other ſinnes of Drunkeneſs, and Uncleanneſs, turn men into Beaſts, but this of envy, doth into Devils, inſomuch that an envious man, in the conſtant full power of it (I ſpeak not of motions, and temptations,) is farther off from godlineſs, then a beaſtly prophane man.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>This ſinne of Envy, is a mother-ſinne, a fountaine-ſinne.</hi> There is no wickedneſs in the world, but this ſinne will conceive it, and bring it forth: Through envy, they ſtoned <hi>Paul,</hi> through envy, they murdered Chriſt; all the perſecutors of Chriſtians, did burn with envy themſelves, before they burnt the Martyrs at the ſtake. Hence <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.5. the Apoſtle alledgeth that place, <hi>The ſpirit within us luſteth to envy,</hi> aiming at that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>The imagination of the thoughts of the heart are only evil, and that continually</hi>; Now he nameth not the general, but particularizeth in envy, as that which is the cheif cauſe of many ſinnes; <hi>For where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work</hi> Jam 3 16. Nay not only perſonal, private evils are in the womb of this, but all publique miſeries commonly begin from this ſpark of envy. A Commonwealth is made a field of bloud, through the envy of ambitious men; the Church is cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peices like the <hi>Levites</hi> wife, through envy of eccleſiaſtical perſons, inſomuch that we may ſay, all Kingdomes and Churches in ſome reſpects, have died of this diſeaſe: this hath cut all the nerves, whereby any ſociety is compacted together. Oh therefore pray we, that God would have out this incendiary, and Boutefeu from all Churches and States! The Devil is called the enemy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. and therefore the envious one, that came and ſowed tares; ſo that all the tares of diſcord, diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and different opinions, are ſowed by the envious one, that grudgeth at our peace and unity.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>This ſinne is a juſt torment to him that commits it.</hi> When a ſinne is a ſinne, and a puniſhment, it's the more deadly ſinne; now this of envy, it's a very gibbett, a very rack to him that is moved with it, he is like one poſſeſſed with the Devil, that formeth that is thrown into fire and water, his heart is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hell, he hath a torturing within him, as if ſo many Devils were pulling of him. The Heathen obſerved it ſaying, That the greateſt Tyrants that ever were, never found out a greater torment. And certainly if the motions and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of envy in the godly, be like ſo many Scorpions ſtings in them, what are they to wicked men, where envy is in its full power.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>This ſinne of Envy doth deprive Chriſtians of all exerciſe and comfort of common graces.</hi> The people of God are as building and lively ſtones compacted together: at the firſt beginning of the Goſpel they were with one heart, and one mind. The duties of communion and relation to one another, are frequently ſpoken of, ſuch as exhorting one another, reproving, comforting, whetting, and encouraging one another; compared therefore to members of the body, all which have need of another. Now if one member ſhould envy the good of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how quickly would the whole be conſumed? Thou haſt faith to help ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unbelief, thou art ſtrong to ſupport the weak, thou art quick to raiſe up him that is du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l, grace is not only for thy ſelf but to profit others with, as coals of fire together do enflame one another. Now envy that ſets all at diſtance, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth the nouriſhment that is to go to every part, and inſtead of helping and drawing out anothers graces, it draweth out their corruptions: this makes ſtrangeneſs, ſuspicions, uncharitable cenſures, ſo that Lambs become Tygers to one another, and Myrtle-trees Brambles.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>It's a tenacious inbred ſinne.</hi> You ſee even in the regenerate, theſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101245:28"/>
ſparkes of Hell are alive: Theſe worms will breed in the ſweeteſt Roſes: Theſe mothes in the fineſt Garments. So that the more contumacious and inherent this ſinne is, the greater cauſe to be afraid of it.</p>

                        <hi>Well, If it be ſo dangerous a ſinne, what Remedies may be uſed againſt it?</hi> If this Viper will ſtick on us, how may we (at leaſt) order it, ſo that it ſhall not ſtay on, ſo as to make us fall down dead by the poiſon of it. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Turn Envy into Pity</hi>; and this is an excellent cure. Nothing break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Envy, ſo ſoon as Pity. Now their is no good thou envieſt at in others, but it affords meditation of Pity and Prayer for them that have it, rather then Envy. For if they be wicked men, whoſe proſperity thou envieſt, <hi>David</hi> tels you, <hi>they ſtand in ſlippery places,</hi> and <hi>they are fatted to deſtruction.</hi> Does any envy the Garlands and Crowns that were put on Beaſts, when they went to be ſacrificed? The godly, who are ſo apt to look with an ill eye, at the great abundance, ſucceſs, and outward happineſs of wicked men, ſhould remember this; Their great Honours, are but like oyl poured into the fire, to make it burn hotter. And if he be godly that hath outward mercies, then he hath the greater account to give: He hath received more Talents, and ſo greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is expected. So that he is more to be prayed for: He having a greater Treaſure, is more obnoxious to theifts and dangers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Conſider <hi>That if inſtead of Envy, thou wouldſt bleſs and praiſe God for the Gifts and Graces beſtowed upon others, they would thereby be made thine.</hi> When thou canſt glorify God for the great abilities given to others, and rejoyce in the ſucceſs they have; though thy glory be obſcured, this makes it accountable to thee. For as he that wils, and conſents, and delights in other mens wickedneſs, makes theirs his, ſo it is in good things.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Be contented with thy condition. Envy</hi> commonly comes from diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at what is ours. If therefore thou canſt bleſs and praiſe God with joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, for what thou haſt, this will kill that ſnake of Envy in thy breaſt.</p>
                     <p>But thou maiſt ſay, <hi>How ſhall I know a juſt zeal againſt others, eſpecially when they have applauſe and followers in the world, (though in an evil way,) from Envy?</hi>

There ſome propheſied as well as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and others envied it for <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſake: They would have him have all the glory: For which they were blamed. Yet when <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> took too much upon them; and that all the people of God were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as well as they; <hi>Moſes</hi> was enraged againſt them: Not from Envy, but Zeal.</p>
                     <p>In the New Teſtament. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were hot againſt Chriſt, becauſe all the people followed him: And it's plain, Envy moved them. Yet there were falſe Apoſtles, that led captive ſilly women, and had many followers. Now <hi>Paul</hi> is ſevere againſt them; and it is not Envy, but Zeal. Thus the Miniſters of God, may preach againſt falſe Teachers that have many followers, and yet it be no Envy.</p>

He is a bramble that tears every one that cometh near him. Thus <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>ſtrifes</hi> and <hi>Contentions</hi> are made <hi>the manifeſt works of the fleſh.</hi> It's not a doubtfull or an hard matter, to determine whence they come. All thy jangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, clamours, and evil ſpeakings, they come from that gall and wormwood in thee. <hi>James</hi> 4.1. <hi>Whence come wars and fightings?</hi> He cals that ſtrife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them a <hi>Warre. Do they not come from the luſts that warre in your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</hi> See here; There is no man ſtriveth, and brawleth with another, but he hath a <hi>luſt</hi> in his <hi>heart,</hi> which ſtriveth and fighteth againſt his <hi>ſoul.</hi> Thou ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be <hi>wronged,</hi> to <hi>undoe</hi> another, but that <hi>anger</hi> in thy <hi>heart,</hi> will <hi>undoe</hi> and <hi>damn</hi> thy <hi>own ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Particular <hi>Luſts,</hi> are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Pride. Where pride is, there is Contention,</hi> Prov. 13.10. A proud man, he cannot but ſtrive, no more then fire cannot but ſet all on a flame, where it is. All the Diviſions and Troubles that are, either publique or private, come from Pride. <hi>Every man would have his will to be done</hi>: Whereas humility and lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs, that keeps all in peace and quietneſs. The Chimny that is higher then other parts of the houſe, puts out all the ſmoak and dark vapours; and thoſe ſometimes that would exalt themſelves above others, they muſt needs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporate their loathſome ſtomack againſt others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Ambition and vain glory</hi>; Which comes near to Pride. When men are ambitious for great earthly power, or the high places in the Church, this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many quarrels. <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s ambition for the Kingdom, what a terrible ſhake did it make in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> This ambition is an huge Whale, that quickly will ſwallow up all the good and welfare of others; and it's no leſs dangerous in the Church. Have not the Diviſions thereof, been through the ambition and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory of ſome, who have inordinately loved applaus, and many followers? This hath alwaies been like a Sword in the ſide of the Church, that hath brought out both blood and water.</p>

                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:101245:29"/>3. <hi>Malicious froward diſpoſitions.</hi> There are ſome of that rancorous, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent natures, that they cannot be quiet, but in the diſturbing of others: <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders</hi> that can live no where, but in the fire; never at reſt, but when they are in brawlings or contentions, that have not only their <hi>tongues,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, but their <hi>hearts</hi> alſo <hi>ſet on fire from hell,</hi> Jam. 3.6. As theſe are dangerous perſons in a Kingdome, for they do to it, as the Devil to the poſſeſſed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, throw it ſometimes in the water, and ſometimes in the fire; ſo they are alſo in Families, and in Townes. Theſe are curſed men. For as Peace-makers are bleſſed, ſo ſtrife-makers, and quarrel makers are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Covetouſneſſe and ſinfull love to the things of the world, that makes men quarrel and brawl.</hi> So that ſome ſay, thoſe two Pronouns <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> make all the ſtrife that is in the world; an unjuſt covetous deſire to have more than is thy own, or luſting after other mens, or diſcontent at thy own condition This makes thee fill the world with quarrels.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Impatience, when men know not how with patience and godly wiſdome to paſſe by many injuries and wrongs.</hi> The Scripture bids us <hi>overcome evil with good</hi>; and if <hi>a man ſtrike on one cheek to turn another,</hi> Luke 6.29. He doth not there forbid a lawfull reſiſtance of evil before a Magiſtrate, or a defence of his right, but all private revenge, and impatience of ſpirit, whereby we are ready to reſolve, As he hath done to me, I will do to him; Oh no! Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us a ſpirit of meekneſſe, of patience, to <hi>pray for thoſe that perſecute and hate us.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>In paſſionate and railing ſpeeches; Let all clamour and evil ſpeaking be laid aſide,</hi> Epheſ. 4.31. Mat. 5.22. <hi>Whoſoever is angry with his brother, calling him fool, is in danger of hell fire.</hi> Little do you think of this, whoſe mouths are as loathſome as open ſepulchres: Oh the names and foul language, that that mad rage makes thee caſt upon others! Whereas the <hi>Angel did not give the Devil rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſations</hi>; Thoſe foul mouths, they argue a foule heart; that black tongue of thine will at laſt be puniſhed with black darkneſſe in hell without repentance.</p>

Thou haſt a Devil in thy tongue, and the other hath in his ear, to whom thou ſpreadeſt theſe ſlanders.</hi> Thus Chriſt himſelf, How was he ſlandered? And <hi>Paul.</hi> Whereas the dogs with their tongues did lick <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſores whole, thou doeſt with thy tongue make the whole places ſore; But conſider that <hi>Pſalm</hi> of <hi>Doeg,</hi> a ſmall miſchievous ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, <hi>What ſhall be given unto thee, O thou lying tongue?

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A delight to go to Law, and to implead others at the Courts of Judicature.</hi> The <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſtrifes did break out in this manner, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. They went to Law with one another, <hi>Why do ye not rather ſuffer wrong,</hi> ſaith he? Now it's true, the Apoſtle doth not there prohibit all kind of going to Law for our own, but the readineſſe of heart thereunto, and the ſcandal of going before <hi>Heathens,</hi> and their want of preparation of heart to ſuffer wrong, rather than to go to that extremity; they did not try all other wayes of reconceliation firſt. And is not brawling and ſquabling the very trade, the meat and drink of many quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101245:30"/>
people? They will go to Law preſently. Indeed the Prophet ſaith, <hi>To the Law, to the teſtimony</hi>; but that Law would quickly moderate this. Thou wilt goe to Law whatſoever it coſt thee, what if it coſt thee thy ſoul, thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as it may doe by thy anger, malice, revenge and impatience therein?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>This civil or uncivil contention, rather is ſeen in the procuring of all that hurt and miſchief to others we can, either in Name or Eſtate.</hi> So that whereas the command is, to procure all good, thou art ready to do all miſchief to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. We might think theſe things need to be preached onely to <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> to <hi>Canibals</hi> or ſuch ſavage men; but even Chriſtians are turned ſuch horſes and mules, that they need this bit to be put in their mouths. So that you ſee, this ſtrife is in tongue and hand; and if the tongue hath a world of evil, how much evil then is there, when tongue, and hand, and heart are all full?</p>

                           <hi>The effects of</hi> ſinfull ſtrife <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi> religious matters.</note>As for <hi>ſtriving in religious matters,</hi> that is ſeen two wayes:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>When men are given to cavill and contradict the truth, though never ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſcovered, especially becauſe of the purity of it, becauſe it convinceth and arraigneth thy luſts, greatly condemning them.</hi> Thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly bent to oppoſe Chriſt; inſomuch that when they were ſilenced, and had nothing to ſay, they did as the Devil to him, <hi>Depart for a ſeaſon, and afterwards came to tempt him again.</hi> Take heed of ſuch a froward diſpoſition, it's farre from the nature of Chriſts Sheepe, which heare his voice, and follow him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>When men dote about Queſtions and Diſputes, that have no profit, or if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, yet attend not to them in their place.</hi> The Apoſtle condemneth this doting and ſtriving about words; and for this reaſon, <hi>Becauſe they profit not,</hi> Tit. 3.9. <hi>A man with needleſſe diſputes, is like a field that beareth nothing but bryars and thorns.</hi> There came a man to ask Chriſt, <hi>Whether many ſhould be ſaved?</hi> Our Saviour doth not anſwer the Queſtion directly, but bids him, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtraight gate,</hi> Luke 13.23. thereby rebuking his curioſity. And <hi>Zuinglius</hi> did truly obſerve and complain, <hi>That men ſeldome came from religious diſputes more crucified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more heavenly.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>This ſtriving temper is directly oppoſite to many commands, that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently preſſe love, brotherly kindneſſe, peaceableneſſe. As much as lyeth in you, have peace with all men,</hi> Rom. 12.18. <hi>Be affable, be courteous,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.8. Thus you ſee, as Chriſt himſelf did not ſtrive or lift up his voice in the ſtreet, but lived meekly, peaceably; ſo ought we.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe ſtrifes and quarrellings make all our prayers and Religion in vain.</hi> God heareth no prayer from that man, who is in anger and malice with others, <hi>Forgive us our ſins, as we forgive others.</hi> Yea, if a man have brought his gift to the altar, and remember ſuch a man hath ought againſt him, <hi>he muſt leave that, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,</hi> Mat. 5.24. Oh how could contentions and quarrels be thus among you, if this were thought on.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The relation we are in, commands peace and unity.</hi> There is <hi>one God, one Chriſt, one Spirit, one Baptiſm,</hi> Eph. 4.5. <hi>Why fall ye out ſeeing ye are Brethren</hi>: ſo that Chriſtianity is reproached, when you ſeek to devour one another; it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the faith of Chriſt never had any power over thee.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>good Contention,</hi> I mentioned, that is, <hi>When men ſtrive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the truths of God, for his honour and glory, when he is zealous to reprove and puniſh ſinne.</hi> There are many men that call this Contention, and this they condemn for turbulency; as <hi>Ahab</hi> called <hi>Elijah, the troubler of Iſrael,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101245:30"/>
he rebuked him, and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> for their cruelty and injuſtice. And thus <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> you heard, was accounted <hi>a man of ſtrife, that ſet all together by the ears.</hi> Now this ſtriving for God againſt the ſinnes, againſt the humours of men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be omitted without great <hi>ſacriledge.</hi> And if the ſuppreſſing of ſinne in an orderly way, make any ſtrife, it's thy fault, not his that is zealous. Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf came to <hi>ſet father againſt ſonne, and a mans enemies in his own houſe againſt him</hi>; but this was not the fault of Chriſts Doctrine, but of their corruption. And further, This ſtriving and trouble will work a good effect. The Angel that came down with healing, moved and troubled the water, but that was for good. So the Phyſician he ſtirreth the humours, he puts into great pain and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for a while, but this is the way to health. It's good to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the ſins of men; and better be a man of ſtrifes, in this ſenſe, then preach peace to ſinners.</p>

                     <p>In the next place, <hi>What makes diviſion or faction?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">What it is that goes to the making of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi> or <hi>faction</hi>
                        </note> And</p>

                           </gap>ſſe.</hi> We ſee all parties brand one another with diviſions and factions. The Papiſt cals the Proteſtant a Sectary, and that though a Metropolitane; and ſaith, <hi>The leaving of their Church, that had ſo much Antiquity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality, was a ſchiſme.</hi> The Metropolitane he maketh all thoſe guilty of ſchiſme, whether Biſhops or Presbyters, that recede from obedience to him, as appeareth in a late Book. <hi>(Hammond of Schiſme.)</hi> But it's not the calling, or the branding of any with the name of ſchiſme, that makes the thing ſo; but you muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cauſe and the matter. If <hi>Elijah,</hi> and ſome few with him, will not bow their knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> nor will not go with the multitude of Idolaters, this is no ſinfull diviſion or faction. When <hi>Arianiſme</hi> like a deluge did overflow the Church, the Orthodox, who were called <hi>Euſtathiani,</hi> from <hi>Euſtathius</hi> (the Preſident in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and a valiant Champion for the Truth) had their private and ſecret meetings, not daring to communicate in the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the <hi>Arians,</hi> yet no ſound man in judgement will brand theſe with ſchiſme. If the people of God come out from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſeparate from their uncleanneſſes, this is no ſchiſme or faction, but a duty, God commanded them. So that before we charge any with this crime, we muſt alwayes conſider, the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and the <hi>Matter,</hi> who hath the truth, who hath Gods Cauſe, otherwiſe men are hereticks and ſchiſmaticks to one another, and ſo they judge by partiality, not by the Rule. Neither is it enough for men to ſay, they have Scripture, or to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg Scripture, for that may be wreſted to their deſtruction, but the true ſenſe and meaning of it, which is attained by thoſe that walk humbly in Gods way, and uſe thoſe means God hath appointed in his Church. If therefore a man plead againſt the Idolatries, the impieties and falſhoods of other men; This is no faction; if ſo, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who condemneth theſe, had been the moſt factious man in the world; For who more zealous than he in Chriſts way againſt the ſuperſtitious Phariſees, and thoſe who pleaded the Law for Juſtification?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Faction and diviſion is ſeen, when though the matter be true, or good they ſtrive for, yet they do it not in a godly orderly way. He that ſtriveth is not crowned unleſſe he ſtrive lawfully,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.5. A good intention, even in a good matter without good order, is not warrantable. The <hi>Diſciples</hi> that would have <hi>fire come down from Heaven, knew not what ſpirit they were of. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzahs</hi> ſudden puniſhment for the touching of the Ark, ſhould make us look not only to a duty, but to the order of a duty. The Apoſtle layeth down this injunction, <hi>We muſt not do evil that good may come on it,</hi> Rom. 3.8. And he ſaith of thoſe teachers, that would make ſuch conſtructions from his Doctrine, <hi>That their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was juſt.</hi> The Apoſtle by the ſimilitude of members in the body, doth ſhew, how every member ſhould keep to his own office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:101245:32"/>A third thing in <hi>Diviſion</hi> is, <hi>When men do not keep to their proper places, to their Offices.</hi> If the foot will be the eye; if the hand will be the head; here is a monſter, not a comely body. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is very large in this, and oh that this age would obſerve it! To teach every member in the body to keep to its own Office, and to its own Calling, not to take one anothers operations, but to convey their mutual nouriſhment one to another in their proper way. In what a bleſſed Unity, and comely Order would the Church of God be, if every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber would do its proper work? The Apoſtle calling ſo much for humility and modeſty, and not to think of our ſelves above what we ought to do, fore-ſaw how hard a matter it would be for Chriſtians to keep up Unity and Concord among themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thus it's diviſion and faction, when the affections and paſſions of men are ſcured and imbittered with any carnal diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mpers; ſo that this ſinne doth affect the heart and ſpirit of a man, and then it breaks out into actions.</hi> Though men ſhould be in a good way, and are for the truth and glory of God, yet if they do this in anger, and paſſion, and frowardneſſe of heart, here is a ſinfull diviſion upon them, though for the matter and way it ſelf they be right: Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and truth needeth not our paſſions. So that all theſe, or any of theſe, is enough to make the diviſions in the Text here forbidden.</p>

                        </note>In the next place, <hi>What are the Cauſes, that make theſe the efficient cauſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The ignorance of men, as long as men, know but in part, have not perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the underſtanding; and this breedeth difference of opinions, and difference of opinions, difference of affections.</hi> The Apoſtle chargeth the wreſting of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to mens deſtruction, upon their ignorance. In which Epiſtle are many things hard to be underſtood, which the ignorant or unlearned wreſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. Thus our Saviour told them, <hi>They erred about the reſurrection, becauſe they knew not the Scripture,</hi> Mat. 2.29. So that thoſe who have but a ſlighty, flatry-knowledge in matters of Religion, they preſently runne into wayes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. Theſe are children eaſily ſeduced.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Self-confidence and arrogancy.</hi> When men think thoſe abilities, or that worth is in them, which indeed is not. This makes them bold, and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the Church. Thus <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.3. <hi>All the Congregation is holy</hi>; They thought there was as much in every perſon, as in the Prieſts whom God had ſet apart for that office. Oh what an excellent patern is that to all, which <hi>David</hi> giveth! <hi>O Lord, I have not lifted up my ſelf too high,</hi> or, <hi>to things above me!</hi> Pſal. 131.1. It was an excellent ſpeech of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>
                        <q>Heretiques with Scripture are like <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Sauls</hi> armour, they are too heavy, too weighty for them; in ſtead of defending themſelves, they are wounded with it.</q>
Hence the Apoſtle commands us, <hi>not to mind high things, Rom.</hi> 12.16. <hi>viz.</hi> which are above our power or capacity. We are all to grow in knowledge, and mind the things of Religion, but ſtill we muſt be ſenſible of our own weakneſſes. <hi>If any man think he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.2. Oh it's a dangerous thing, when a man that is weak doth not know his weakneſſe, but thinketh he doth know, as much as others!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The laſt efficient are (for theſe will come in better in the after ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) <hi>Worldly hopes and deſires of carnal advantages.</hi> What made <hi>Judas</hi> cauſe ſuch a ſad breach among the Diſciples, but earthly gain? The Apoſtle chargeth this upon many falſe Apoſtles, this made the ſhipwrack of their faith, and a good conſcience;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.5.</note> when men judge gain godlineſſe, judge gain Religion, and meaſure all things by this, it cannot but make great diviſions. Many of thoſe Hereticks in former times were ſo diſcontent, they miſſed that worldly greatneſſe and pomp they expected, which made <hi>Auſtin</hi> put this in the definition of an Heretick,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101245:32"/>
that he doth beget, or follow new opinions, <hi>Alicujus temporalis commodi gratiâ,</hi> for the ſake of ſome temporal advantage.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>There is an occaſional cauſe, but not efficient, and that hath been the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and ſcandalous lives of Church-officers.</hi> This hath many times made ſad rents. Church-officers by their looſe lives, and rigid cruelty, have made ſchiſmes, and then they cry out of them, and puniſh them. One cauſe of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians Montanizing</hi> was, the looſe lives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy. We ſee by Chriſts Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.45. it's no new thing for ſuch Officers to rule in Chriſts houſe, as ſhall <hi>drink and be drunk, and beat their fellow-ſervants, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the thoughts of their Maſters coming.</hi> Therefore the bloody cruelty, or licentious prophane lives of thoſe that have ruled in the Church, have made a juſt cauſe of troubles and diviſions; neither are thoſe that make the diviſion then to be blamed, if it be in that which is good, and after a good manner: but the actings and lives of ſuch Church-officers. I ſhould ſpeak of the final cauſes, but they will come in afterwards.</p>

You Proteſtants are fallen into manifold Sects; they will reckon up fourſcore factions.

As for the Proteſtants, they that take themſelves to be ſo indeed (for <hi>Socinians</hi> and others, we own them not) they differ not in fundamentals.

Oh what <hi>Antipodes</hi> are ſuch men to the Scripture! Either lay down the name of a Chriſtian, or elſe live above what men of the world do. As <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaid to a ſouldier, named <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:101245:33"/>
Either lay aſide his name, or elſe do valiant acts. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>If ye love them that love you, what ſingular thing do ye, do not even the publicans the ſame?</hi> Mark that, there is a godly ſingularity, and the people of God muſt be ſingular; not do ſo, or live ſo, as moſt men in the world do.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle in this phraſe, <hi>To live as men,</hi> or, <hi>According to man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">What is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this phraſe, <hi>To live as men.</hi>
                        </note> may imply theſe things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Meer men have no divine faith in the matters of Religion, wrought in them by the Spirit of God, but walk according to the natural dictates of conſcience and education, and ſo are for that Religion which they have been brought up in, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to, whether it be right or wrong, whether good or bad.</hi> This our Saviour cleareth, when <hi>Peter</hi> made that excellent Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>That Chriſt was the Sonne of God</hi>; our Saviour graciouſly accepts of it, and tels him, <hi>Fleſh and bloud hath not revealed this to him,</hi> Mat. 16.17. So that then, men walk as men in all matters of Religion; when they have no more than cuſtome, or the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Laws of the Land, where they live, no more than fleſh and blood hath made known to them. Thus we ſee the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi>; they all wilfully adhere to the Religion, they have been uſed to; and ſo many Chriſtians, believe in Chriſt, upon no better grounds than they do in their falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. Be not then any longer ſuch men, and ſervants of men, as the Apoſtle cals it; that is, to believe the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hs of Religion upon humane authority, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane motives. That our Saviour meaneth, when he bids us, <hi>Call no man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter on earth, becauſe Chriſt is the only Maſter,</hi> Mat. 23.8. Not that the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and teaching of Church officers is to be rejected (as ſome abſurdly would inferre from thoſe places) for we are commanded <hi>to hear them, and to enquire for the truth at their mouth</hi>; only it's not a divine faith, till it be upon divine grounds; <hi>Not as the word of men, but as the word of God,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2.13. It's a ſad thing to conſider, how many walk as men in this reſpect, being in matter of Religion, without any eyes of their own, as if another mans faith were to juſtifie them, and not their own!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>To walk as a meer man, is to propound ſome outward inferiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as the ultimate end, and chief felicity of our ſouls.</hi> Take a man, as a meer man, and the utmoſt end for which he labours and ſtrives in this world, is ſome earthly advantages. Oh but what ſaith the Apoſtle of true Chriſtians! <hi>We walk not by ſenſe, but by faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. <hi>And we behold not the things that are ſeen, but the things that are not ſeen.</hi> What made <hi>Moſes</hi> deny all that earthly greatneſſe he might have had in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court? Who would have made ſuch a choiſe as he did? To ſuffer reproaches for Chriſt, rather than the pleaſures of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> Why is this? <hi>Becauſe he ſaw him that was inviſible, and had an eye to the recompence of reward,</hi> Heb. 11. See then, <hi>Moſes</hi> more than a man, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to himſelf, as the greateſt happineſſe, the enjoyment of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. And as the Sunne puts out the leſſer light of the ſtarres, ſo this good in God, obſcured that in all earthly things. Then therefore men walk as men, when they look no further than the good things of this life, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, earthly pomp and greatneſſe; and as for the enjoyment of God, which is indeed the true end, that they come ſhort of. Oh do not then walk as men any longer, placing all your affections, thoughts and deſires in inferiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts! Is this to have your converſation in Heaven? Is this to ſit with Chriſt in heavenly places? Is this to make God your portion? Is not this rather to have the Serpents curſe upon you, to lick up the duſt of the earth, and to mind earthly-things?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>To walk as meer men, is to put confidence and hope onely in ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, and viſible inſtruments, not truſting the promiſe of God, or believing his power, that he reigneth and ruleth in Heaven and earth, doing what he pleaſeth.</hi> This is not only to walk as men, but as the wiſe men, and moſt admired men in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101245:34"/>
world. The Scripture brings in the thoughts of the wiſe men, as if God ſate in Heaven, and did not judge all things, as he pleaſed: <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart</hi> (and that fool is every meer man) <hi>there is no God,</hi> Pſal. 14.1. No Judge, no Governour; Therefore they look only to inſtruments, to ſecond cauſes, and they puff up themſelves, and grow inſolent, when they have theſe bladders to ſwim with: As on the other ſide, they ſink, even as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hoaſt, into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, when ſuch outward props are taken away. Know then, that all thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dejections, cares, and doubtfull thoughts, either about thy ſelf, or the publick, they argue thee to walk as a meer man. Our Saviour doth excellently ſhame his Diſciples for this, when uſing ſeveral Arguments to the Diſciples againſt their diſtruſt and carefulneſſe, he tels them, <hi>Such things the Gentiles and Heathens ſeek after,</hi> Mat. 6.7. So that to walk as men, is to be affected in our own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or in the publick good, as if there were no promiſe, no God; as if men were Omnipotent, as if men brought about all things. When <hi>Melancthon</hi> was often dejected, about the affairs of the Church, being prone to diſtruſt and fears, <hi>Luther</hi> told him, <hi>That God had bound up the affairs of the Church in one common place, which his Rhetorick and Logick had not, and that was faith.</hi> The godly were more than men, in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.3. when, being aſhamed of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal confidence, they ſaid, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon horſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>To walk like men, is to be full of falſhood, deceitfulneſſe, or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, to have no truth in heart or word one to another.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is a liar</hi>; and he makes that ſad complaint, <hi>Help Lord, for the good and faithfull man periſheth; every man ſpeaketh vanity to his neighbour,</hi> Pſal. 12.1. Oh this is the way of men upon the earth! Hence the Scripture exhorts us, <hi>Not to put truſt in men,</hi> (Pſal. 146.3.) <hi>no not in Princes, or the great ones of the world.</hi> Oh but all ſuch lying, hypocriſie and diſſimulation ſhould not be named among Chriſtians! <hi>Chriſtiana fides</hi> ſhould be farre more firm and reſolved, than <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na fides. Let us love</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>not in word only, but in heart and deed alſo,</hi> 1 John 3.18. The Chriſtians at firſt did meet together <hi>with one heart, and one accord.</hi> The very Poet ſaid, he hated him even to hell, who ſpake one thing with his mouth, and thought another thing in his heart. Know then, that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Artifices, and lying diſſimulations are farre from that truth that God deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the inward parts. Chriſts ſheep muſt not be the Devils foxes. It was the <hi>Heathens</hi> deſire, <hi>That his breſt might be as tranſparent as glaſs, that ſo all his thoughts within him might be ſeen.</hi> How ſhould this ſhame the guile, diſſimulations and falſhoods that are in men one to another?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>To walk as men, is here in the Text to be in anger, hatred, and revengefull thoughts one againſt another; whereas all beaſts agree among themſelves, even the ſavage Bears and Tygers, yea the Devils are not divided one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Man naturally finds nothing ſo ſweet, as revenge upon others. Therefore our Saviour, to ſhew that we muſt be more than man, bids us, <hi>Love our enemies, do good to thoſe that hate us, and deſpitefully uſe us,</hi> Mat. 5. This is a leſſon or duty that cannot be found in <hi>Tullies Offices</hi>; he thought it lawfull to be revenged upon enemies. Yea, <hi>Aquinas</hi> a great Schoolman thinketh, <hi>That to love and forgive our enemies is not a precept or command to all, but a counſel of perfection, to ſome of more perfect and admirable excellencies.</hi> Oh then, when you ſee men full of back-bitings, uncharitableneſſe, envyings, and revengefull purpoſes, you may ſee thoſe walk as men! When <hi>Jacob</hi> expected nothing but cruelty and bloudy revenge from <hi>Eſau,</hi> and finding the clean contrary, he ſaith, <hi>He ſaw his face like the Angel of God,</hi> above a meer man.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>To walk as men, is to make a mans ſelf the Alpha and Omega, the center wherein all the lines muſt meet.</hi> The Apoſtle reckoning up a Catalogue of monſtrous ſinners, he puts this in the front, <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of themſelves,</hi>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:101245:34"/>
2 Tim. 3.2. And Chriſt on the other ſide, requireth it as the fundamental quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in every Diſciple, <hi>To deny himſelf, and take up his croſs,</hi> Luk. 9.23. Now for a man to deny himſelf pleaſures his ſelf-intereſts, his ſelf-advantages, this doth argue men to be of God. It's noted as the great admirable perfection in Chriſt, whoſe copy we are to write after, <hi>That he emptied himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of no reputation,</hi> Phil. 2. That he pleaſed not himſelf; In nothing did he ſeek his own glory, his own eaſe, his own exaltation. And there is nothing can more demonſtrate Chriſtians to be above men, then to be as Chriſt was in this reſpect. It was a ſad complaint of old. <hi>All ſeek their own, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil, 2 21.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>To walk as man, is to commit any ſinne, rather then to be perſecuted for the truth of God. To ſwear, or forſwear, to turn into all ſhapes, to avoid danger.</hi> This Chriſt aimed at, when <hi>Peter</hi> would have him decline his ſufferings, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>Thou ſavoureſt not the things of God, but of man,</hi> Mat. 16.23. What is it to ſavour the things of a man? To do any thing, or to uſe any unlawful, and unwarrantable wayes to eſcape the preſent danger; ſuch are counted wiſe men, and crafty men, whereas this is diſhoneſty and ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and no wiſdome, for ſuch forſake their own mercy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Examination.</hi> How are all our Congregations? How live they? How walk they? Do they not live as men? yea, how many like bruit beaſts? how many like Devils? Oh whoſe image and ſuperſcription is this? Doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this? Doth his Word command ſuch things? Did Chriſt live thus in the world? Are ye not called to be holy as God is holy? Are ye not to do Gods will on earth, as Angels in heaven? Why then are ye as men? Who are you then that ſay, you will do as others, you will not be ſingular, you will not be ſtrict and preciſe? Thy Chriſtianity doth inforce thee to theſe things, if thou doſt hearken to it, If ye will be Chriſtians indeed, you muſt not live according to the faſhion of the world; yea the world moſt wonder that you runne not in the ſame exceſſe with them; that you will not ſwear, curſe, riot it, and live looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Do not pleaſe your ſelves with a meer title.</p>

Be aſhamed and bluſh, if thou art as men of the world, proud as they, earthly as they, peeviſh and diſcontented as thee. Oh when thou art overtaken with ſuch diſtempers, go and chide thy ſelf! Lord, how have I been a fooliſh, and ignorant man to day? I am like others of the world, I have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved my ſelf as one that is born of God, that hath a more divine Spirit! As it's a great ſhame to ſee a grown man ſpeaking and doing like a child; ſo it is here. As <hi>Michal</hi> in a ſinful ſcornfull way ſaid of <hi>David</hi> in a good action, we may of thee in a ſinful action, <hi>Thou haſt made thy ſelf as one of the vile ones to day,</hi> that frowardneſs, diſcontent paſſionateneſs, argueth thee to be like one of the world.</p>

                        <hi>That although it's the duty of people to have a great and high eſteem of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, yet they are not ſinfully and inordinately to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, or reſt meerly upon any mens perſons.</hi>

                     <p>You that are the ſheep of Chriſt, have a great duty required of you, you are to abound in all love and ready ſubmiſſion unto the doctrine of your faithfull Shepherds, and yet alſo, not ſo to admire any perſon, as <hi>thereby to be drawn into errours or falſhoods,</hi> they may poſſibly maintain.

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Yet this reſpect muſt not degenerate into ſinful admiration, ſo as facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſet up one Miniſter againſt another.</hi>

                     <p>Let us conſider the firſt part, and here I ſhall not ſpeak of that <hi>temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> and honour which Gods Word in ſeveral places commands, leſt by captious men we ſhould be thought to plead for our own ſelves; but for that <hi>ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> and entertainment of the Miniſtery, which is for your good not for ours: people are apt to think, if they come to hear us, if they commend our Sermons, that this is for an advantage; No, the powerfull receiveing of divine truths is for their good. The wearied traveller that drinks of the ſpring by the way, doth not benefit the fountain, but advantageth himſelf; now the ſpiritual reſpect or entertainment of the Miniſtery, lieth in theſe particulars.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Wherein the ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to the Miniſters of the Goſpel doth conſiſt.</note>1. <hi>Highly to account of the office and the work of the Miniſtery, as being the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution and appointment of Chriſt in his Church.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let a man account of us as the ſtewards of Chriſt.</hi> They are the officers ſet up in Chriſts houſe, to give the food of life, and <hi>God hath ſet in his Church, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and teachers,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.

they that were imployed in that office, were contemned.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Your ſpiritual reſpect lieth in the hearing of the Word preached, and the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Word with all gladneſs of heart.</hi> Thus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me,</hi> Luk, 10.16. and therefore they are compared to <hi>Embaſſadours,</hi> that do in <hi>Chriſts ſtead entreat you to be reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20.

Now if we dare not do theſe things, but diſcharge our work faithfully, we are had in no reſpect, and that for our very works ſake; ſo that the work of the Miniſtery informing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, and powerfully terrifying for ſinne and wickedneſs, that ought to be eſteemed by you.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>You ought to ſhew your ſpiritual reſpect and entertainment to the Miniſtery, in avoiding all thoſe evil and wicked wayes, which may grieve and make ſad the hearts of godly Miniſters.</hi> When <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaw his people walk ſo diſobedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſaid, His <hi>ſoul ſhould mourn in ſecret for them,</hi> Jer. 13.17. Did not Chriſt weep over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe ſhe refuſed the Prophets that were ſent to her. And <hi>Paul</hi> preſſing beleivers to unity and godlineſs, he uſeth this Argument, <hi>Fullfill ye my joy,</hi> Phil. 2.2. and again, <hi>We live, if ye ſtand faſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3.8. So that all the impieties and errours that any of you ſhall runne into, are like thornes in the eyes of a godly Miniſter, this will make them give their account with greif, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13 17. Oh that theſe wicked actions which greive the Spirit of God, which greive the hearts of godly men, and godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, ſhould not alſo greive thee. Now let us conſider, <hi>when this reſpect may degenerate into ſinful admiration.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Wherein our reſpect to the Miniſters of the Goſpel may run out into ſinfull admiration.</note>Firſt, <hi>When we ſet up the gifts and perſons of men, ſo as to neglect Chriſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and by them.</hi> If it be ſo great a ſinne in temporal and outward things, to take of the glory due to God, and attribute it to inſtruments; how much more is this in ſpiritual things? Therefore obſerve the Apoſtle, he to cure this deſeaſe amongſt them, takes them off from inſtruments, and bids them look up to God, <hi>What is Paul, and what is Apollo</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but inſtruments by which ye beleive, and God he only giveth the encreaſe,</hi> though others may <hi>plant</hi> and <hi>water</hi>; and that is the reaſon ſay ſome, why in the firſt Chapter of this firſt Epiſtle he doth ſo often name Jeſus Chriſt: to take them off from inſtruments, and to look more to him; not that the inſtruments are to be excluded, but God the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal agent is to be owned, and honoured. Reſt not then upon excellent parts and powerfull preaching, for it's God that worketh by theſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Then men ſinfully admire, when they ſet up the gifts and abilities of one, to the contempt of others.</hi> No doubt but God giveth variety of gifts, and ſome are more eminent then other, yet none are ſo to preferre the excellent, as to contemne and diſcourage the weaker. What the Apoſtle ſpeaketh about the ſeveral members of the Church, ſome are more excellent and honourable then others, yet the meaneſt is not to be diſpiſed, is alſo to be done about the ſeveral gifts and parts of Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then men ſinfully admire, when their failings and errours they will follow, and defend.</hi> If theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> that were for <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhould have been led aſide, as he did many to Circumciſion, this was their infirmity. In primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, <hi>Origen</hi> a famous and eminent man, proved a great temptation to the Church; for men had rather erre with him, then think the truth with others. Thus among the <hi>Sadducees</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> whatſoever the grandees of their ſect taught them, though it were that the left hand was the right, yet they thought themſelves bound to beleive it. But of this more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Let us make <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> Firſt <hi>of exhortation, to receive the Miniſtery of God, with that ſpiritual respect as you ought to do.</hi> The beſt praiſe and love you can have to the Miniſters of God in their work, is to turn all that is preached into practice; there is no ſinne for which God will ſooner be avenged, then this contempt of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: What is a greater contempt, then to be often invited, often exhorted to forſake thy ſinnes, yet to retain them ſtill? You do not deſpiſe or reject men, but God himſelf: God did for many yeares bear with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give her up to total deſtruction, till his <hi>Prophets</hi> were ſlighted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed; then they that would not have Ged rule over them, had the greateſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,

and proudeſt enemies to trample over them. Now there are divers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to give this ſpiritual entertainment to the Miniſtery. For</p>

As alſo this may informe us who are his inſtruments in this matter? Even ſuch as feel not the benefit of theſe Ordinances: there is nothing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to love the Miniſtery upon good grounds, but the ſpiritual good they receive by it. When theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſlighted <hi>Paul,</hi> and doubted about his call, he proveth it by experimental works on them. Conclude it therefore, that all thoſe men who cavil and oppoſe the Miniſtery, they are ſuch who know not what it was to get any ſpiritual good by that office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For while one ſaith I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollo, are ye not Carnal?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words (you have heard) prohibit a <hi>ſinfull admiration</hi> of any <hi>mans perſon,</hi> or <hi>gifts,</hi> though he be an Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though he be an eloquent <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo.</hi> More ſpiritual matter this Text will alſo afford; only I muſt firſt anſwer that Queſtion;<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Whether the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did indeed ſet up theſe eminent godly men as Heads, of Parties; or whether his meaning was, that they ſet up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe Apoſtles, and became factious Diſciples to ſuch: only the Apoſtle ſpareth to name them, thinking it wiſdome to do ſo, and inſtanceth in himſelf and other Pillars; teaching them hereby, that if ſuch as were faithfull and godly ought not to be exalted, how much leſs corrupt and falſe Teachers? Some are for the Affirmative, and ſome for the Negative,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but I think both Expoſitions may well be joyned together. For, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (ſome of them) did too much glory in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> and ſet them up. Otherwiſe; Why ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> bleſs God ſo much for that Providence, that <hi>he had bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſo few?</hi> For men were apt to ſet up thoſe that baptized them, as if they had been baptized into their name. Therefore, certainly the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did ſinfully reſt and glory in ſuch as <hi>Paul.</hi> Wherfore he takes them off, and excellently concludes, <hi>Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.13. Thus the firſt Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is true. Then that the other alſo is true, that although <hi>Paul</hi> inſtanceth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others, yet therby meaning other ambitious Teachers that affected Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, appeareth alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. where he ſaith, <hi>He had by a Figure tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred thoſe things to himſelf and Apollo, for their ſakes.</hi> That is, for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to teach them, that they muſt not think of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> above what they ſhould (as many of them did) much leſs of falſe ambitious corrupt Teachers, as many others alſo did.</p>
                     <p>This explained, we may obſerve two more Doctrines.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt and his Truth, are the foundation we muſt build upon. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles indeed, are called the <hi>foundations,</hi> Rev. 22.14. but they were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inſpired; and they were but <hi>ſecondary</hi> foundations, <hi>fundamenta fundata,</hi> not <hi>fundamemta fundantia,</hi> as Divines ſay. So that we are not Believers in <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi>: We are not the Apoſtles Believers, much leſs the Fathers, or any Doctors and Teachers in the world.

It is true, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is abuſed by ſome, as is to be ſhewed, when I come to ſpeak of thoſe, who ſaid they were of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in a ſinfull factious way. They were not for <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or any Miniſters; they cryed down all the Miniſtry: They are for Chriſt to teach them immediately. But thus farre the Doctrine is true, <hi>we may not be called after any mans name.</hi> We are not to ſet up any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Councils in Chriſts ſtead: We are not to believe in them. <hi>Homines non debent aedificari ſuper homines,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the opening of this, let us Conſider,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Names that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have been called by.</note>Firſt, <hi>The Names that Chriſtians have had in the New Teſtament, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Church.</hi> For by wiſe Names, we come to know the nature of things. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Chriſt did often call thoſe that followed him, his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Thus, <hi>He that would be his Diſciple, muſt hate Father and Mother for his ſake.</hi> And when the Apoſtles are ſent out, their Inſtruction is, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>make Diſciples.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there are the <hi>ſeventy Diſciples,</hi> who were in a Church-Office next the Apoſtles: but every follower of Chriſt, his Doctrine and way, was called a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple</hi>; but it is Chriſts Diſciples.<note place="margin">Diſciples.</note> They were never called the Apoſtles Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or any mans Diſciples. And certainly, this doth excellently denote what Chriſtians ſhould do, <hi>viz.</hi> Take that duty which God from Heaven command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us concerning Chriſt. Hear him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. a Diſciple is <hi>not to diſpute,</hi> but to <hi>believe.</hi> A Diſciple is wholly to <hi>learn</hi> and <hi>receive</hi> from his Maſter. And oh, how excellent would this be, if every Chriſtian would thus hearken to what Chriſt ſaith! If thou art Chriſts Diſciple, learn of him how to live; how to walk; how to obey. <hi>Lean not to thy own underſtanding</hi>; Lean not to others; for only Chriſt is Truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Believers.</note>Another Name (and that moſt frequent) was <hi>Believers.</hi> Chriſtians are often called by this title; None more frequent. And this alſo doth difference Chriſtians from all other ſects in the world. All the Philoſophers, they affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>knowing</hi> men, not <hi>believing. Averroes</hi> by ſcorn, called Chriſtians <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes,</hi> Believers: For ſuch as he, affected to know the Cauſes of things, and to inquire in the hidden ſecrets of Nature, counting it a diſgrace to believe upon meer Authority. Thus <hi>Julian</hi> upbraided Chriſtians with their <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve only.</hi> Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. The preaching of Chriſt, was accounted <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> to the Gentiles. They ſought for wiſdome, for ſtrong demonſtrations; but the Apoſtles meerly declaring and preaching ſuch Doctrines, were accounted <hi>fooliſh bablers.</hi> So that to be a Believer doth denote the captivating of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings unto the Word of God, and every ſublime thought, or reaſoning that doth exalt it ſelfe. And certainly, if a Chriſtian would think, how much he is to ſubmit his underſtanding to believe the Doctrines of the Scripture, it would much inable him alſo to believe the Promiſes for the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or in particular for his own ſelf. Faith of aſſent would breed Faith of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101245:37"/>
fideucial adherence. Should it be ſo great a matter to believe, that God will raiſe up the Church, when it hath no help? Or, ſubdue thy corruptions, when thou believeſt greater matters in Doctrine? As the Trinity, <hi>That God was made man</hi>; the <hi>reſurrection of the body.</hi> This is an excellent point to be preſſed, though not ſo proper here.</p>
                     <p>Another Name often attributed to Chriſtians, is, <hi>Saints. The Saints at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth:</hi> and in many places. Oh, the very Name of this title, ſhould ſtrike blaſting and confuſion into man! Art thou a <hi>Saint-lyer,</hi> a <hi>Saint-drunkard,</hi> a <hi>Saint-Blaſphemer?</hi> All that are Chriſtians, ſhould be Saints and Holy. And therefore the Scripture cals them by that Name. Not that all will be holy in a Church, no: There will be tares, as well as Wheat. Nor that we are to depart from a Church where wicked men are not caſt out: Or, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are to be adminiſtred to none, but who are truly godly, though they be free from groſs ſinnes; Theſe things cannot be inferred; only Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are called to be Saints, and are Saints by Calling, and ſo ſhould be in their lives. Oh, conſider this, you who are prophane Beaſts, and tremble at it!</p>
                     <p>But the moſt famous and diſtinguiſhing Name of the people of God, is, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> They were firſt called ſo at <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.26. Some have queſtioned, whether others did not then put this Name upon them by ſcorn and reproach, becauſe Chriſt was crucified; or whether they themſelves did not voluntarily take upon them this Name, as being a glory and honour to them. I rather think the latter, becauſe it's uſed as a Name of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. <hi>If any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) 1 Pet. 1.3. Now this title <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is of great importance. Many are apt to ſay, As they are a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, when there is no reall Chriſtianity in them. For to be a Chriſtian, is as much as to be one <hi>anointed:</hi> For as Chriſt was ſo called, becauſe <hi>annointed</hi> with all Graces in an unlimited manner; ſo every Member of Chriſt, is called a Chriſtian, becauſe <hi>anointed</hi> with Graces. Oh then, thou that glorieſt, in that thou art no Heathen, no Infidel, no Jew, but a Chriſtian; conſider whether this be not a vain boaſt! For is thy prophaneneſs, thy wickedneſs, thy impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the anointing of Gods Spirit? So that to have the reall power of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, is a difficult and ſtraight work.</p>
                     <p>In after times, the title <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſtill continued. And although they were ſometimes called <hi>Cornelians</hi> from <hi>Cornelius, Cyrillians</hi> from <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annitae</hi> from <hi>John Chryſoſtome, Euſtathiani</hi> from <hi>Euſtathius</hi>; yet they did not own theſe Names. And as Hereſies began to riſe up in many places, ſome teaching one thing, ſome another; the Chriſtian that kept to the true Faith, that was conſtantly and univerſally believed in all the ages of the Church, beginning from Chriſt and the Apoſtles times, was called <hi>Catholique,</hi> or univerſall; in which ſenſe he ſaid, <hi>Chriſtianus mihi nomen, Catholicus cognomen.</hi> So that to be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, was to believe that Faith which had been univerſally taught, firſt by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, afterwards by faithfull men in all ages. And for the <hi>Papiſt</hi> to call himſelf a <hi>Catholique,</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly degenerated from the Apoſtolical and Scripture Doctrine; and for them to make the <hi>Roman</hi> and the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church <hi>all one; is as abſurd, as if a man ſhould call</hi> London, <hi>or</hi> England, <hi>all the world.</hi> The Papiſt therefore is no Catholique in a true ſenſe; becauſe he cannot prove his Faith by the Apoſtolical Doctrine in the Scripture: yea, accuſeth the Scripture as inſufficient. And ſome of their learned men have confeſſed, that if they ſhould try thir cauſe by the Scripture meerly, it was gone. I ſhall inſtance in one famous Name,<note place="margin">Whence the name <hi>Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> came.</note> given to ſuch who truly own Chriſt and his Truths, and that is, <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> They were called thus, not many years ſince, in <hi>Luther</hi>'s time; whereas the Orthodox had got ſome indulgence for the profeſſion of their true Religion,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101245:38"/>
and pure worſhip. The Popiſh party did importune the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> to make an Edict at <hi>Worms,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Spires, That no Religion ſhould be publickly profeſſed and owned but the Roman.</hi> The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Party, both Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others, made a <hi>Solemn Proteſtation againſt that unjuſt Decree,</hi> and ever ſince all that reformed from Popery, have been called <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> So that all thoſe, who have a compliance with Popery, that admire their way in their heart, or act by their principles, cannot truly be called Proteſtants. Thus you have heard the chief names by which Chriſtians are called, <hi>And ſtill after no mans name.</hi> And whereas <hi>Papiſts</hi> call us <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> &amp;c. we indeed own <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſuch men for worthy and famous inſtruments of Gods glory in their time; but it is their calumny to call us after their Names. It is true, a man by way of difference or diſtinction, he may ſay a <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> to denote ſome peculiar opinion; but to own any man, as an Author of our Faith, or the foundation of Religion, is not conſiſtent with true Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>There are pregnant Reaſons for this:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe as our faith in regard of the efficient cauſe is the gift of God, ſo the object and motive of it, muſt be Gods authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y, becauſe he ſpeaks and revealeth ſuch things.</hi> Humane faith is, becauſe a man ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>h ſuch a thing; divine faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſaith ſo. Now ſee how carefull the Apoſtle was, that the Churches faith ſhould not be in humane wiſdome, but in the mighty power of God. And ſo the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> received it, <hi>not as the word of man, but as the word of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They had not dominion of their faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.24. They were not able to make any Articles of Faith neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. You ſee then, none may be called after men; we are not their Diſciples, their believers; for that which reſteth on men is but an humane faith, and we ought to have a divine faith. <hi>Men indeed may be inſtruments to propound the things to be believed, but the motive is a divine teſtimony, becauſe God ſaith ſo. Solomon</hi> by his wiſdome declared, to which woman the childe belonged to, but he did not cauſe the affections of the mother to the child: So faithfull Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church may declare the truth of God, but they cannot work faith in thee.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore we may not be called after men, to build on them, becauſe we are not baptized into any mans name; and we are onely to profeſſe thoſe, in whoſe name we are baptized into?</hi> 1 Cor. 1.13. <hi>Paul</hi> doth powerfully urge this Argument, why they might not ſay, they were of <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe they were not baptized into the name of <hi>Paul.</hi> So then his Diſciple thou art, and his badge thou onely art to wear, in whoſe name thou wert baptized; and that is not into the name of a man, but the <hi>Name of the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Apoſtle preſſeth another Argument; Was Paul crucified for you? Did Paul die for you,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.13. His meaning is, In him onely we are to believe, who is able to make our reconciliation with God, who hath wrought our Redemption for us. And therefore it's a very high ſinne to build your faith on a man; It's to make him a Saviour, it's to put him in Chriſts room.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Our Apoſtle urgeth a further Argument in the ſame Chapter, <hi>He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord: And Chriſt is made unto us Wiſdome.</hi> So all boaſting in men is to be excluded, as well as boaſting in works. Oh but what is the cauſe of ſo many errors, of ſo many diviſions! It's from boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in men, ſuch a man, and ſuch a man; and by this meanes the glory due to God is taken away.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Scripture makes it a great ſinne in matters of Religion, and the worſhip of God, to be ſervants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. Now what is it to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101245:38"/>
be a ſervant of men? when, as bruit beaſts, we are wholly led at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of others; believe what they bid us believe; worſhip with ſuch worſhip as they command; yet this hath been an univerſal ſinne in all ages of the Church. Men nuzzled in ignorance and pleaſing themſelves in their folly, have without any judgement or information from Gods Word taken ſuch a Religion, and followed ſuch a Worſhip, as hath been impoſed upon them. Hence they have been ſometimes of one Religion, and ſometimes of another, becauſe they have been ſervants to men, and not Diſciples of Chriſt. <hi>Malunt credere, quam judicare.</hi> Thus they offer an Aſſe for a ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Miniſters of God, though never ſo eminent, have been afraid of this, they have prohibited ſuch reſtings upon them.</hi> But of this in another Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That it's the property of godly Miniſters, not to bring men to themſelves, but to Chriſt.</p>

<q>That if he be a Proteſtant, then he muſt reade the Bible, and other Authours; and (ſaith he) I have not time to do that. Therefore I will be of the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for it's but believing as the Church, and as the Pope believeth. Now (ſaith the Jeſuite) God will at the Day of Judgement crown this man with glory for believing ſo, yea he merits by believing ſo.</q>
Now, how contrary is this to Scripture, which bids us, <hi>Search the Scriptures, Try the Spirits; Not think of man above what is meet?</hi> So that their Faith is an humane Faith, their Religion an humane Religion, believed for mans ſake. And that is the reaſon, why the people of the greateſt ignorance are moſt taken with it, for it commends ignorance, and pleaſeth the vulgar fancy with a gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip.</p>

Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if God would not have a Sacrifice without eyes, no more will he have a Faith, and a Religion without eyes!

And if that opinion of ſome be true, That in moſt Cities converted to the Faith, there were two Churches, the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtian Church, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtian Church, then this might foment the diviſion more; howſoever the Popiſh Interpreter laboureth under this difficulty, how they could be guilty of ſinfull factions, who advanced <hi>Peter</hi>: but they build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rotten foundation.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall not conſider any further this diviſion, that did exalt Inſtruments, and Miniſters too high.</p>
                     <p>I come therefore to thoſe that did offend on the contrary way, and that is ſuch, <hi>Who did ſo ſet up Chriſt, as to neglect</hi> Paul, Apollo, <hi>and the Inſtruments of their faith.</hi> For here two contrary factions are forbidden, which are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the Church; and oh that this age were not infected with this diſeaſe! Some did glory in their teachers, boaſting of them in a contentious way, to the contempt of others. Others again, they ranne into the clean contrary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned all Teachers, all the Prophets, and pretended to be taught by Chriſt onely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And I of Chriſt.</hi>] To open the word, we muſt acquaint you, that many of the Ancients thought, they that ſaid thus, <hi>I am of Chriſt,</hi> were not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, but are inſtanced in, as an example, that they all ſhould follow. Yea, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> thinketh this to be <hi>Pauls</hi> words; others ſaid, <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Apollo,</hi> but ſaith <hi>Paul, I am of Chriſt.</hi> Thus they expounded it, thinking it not matter of reproof, for any to ſay, they were of Chriſt, and (they ſay) <hi>Pauls</hi> arguments would hold for this, as much as they did againſt glorying in men. For though <hi>Paul</hi> was not crucified for them, yet Chriſt was. Though they were not baptized into <hi>Pauls</hi> name, yet they were into Chriſts. But to anſwer this: It's true abſolutely and ſimply, it's not a <hi>ſinne,</hi> but a <hi>duty,</hi> for every believer to ſay, he is of Chriſt, <hi>To call no man Maſter, but Chriſt,</hi> therefore he is called a Chriſtian, becauſe a worſhipper of Chriſt. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. uſeth this Argument, The believers were not <hi>Pauls,</hi> or <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes</hi>; but on the contrary, <hi>Whether Paul or Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all are yours</hi>; but then mark, he doth not ſay, <hi>Chriſt is yours, but you are Chriſts:</hi> So for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to ſay, They are Chriſts, is in the general a duty; but that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here reproveth, is ſuch a ſetting up of Chriſt, as doth <hi>oppoſe the Inſtruments</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:101245:41"/>
that Chriſt alſo hath appointed, and that the Apoſtle blameth thoſe, who ſaid, <hi>They were Chriſts,</hi> it's plain by the Context: It's told me by the houſe of <hi>Chloe,</hi> That there are diviſions and contentions. This was a fault complained of. And then he inſtanceth in the matter of the contentions, <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Apollo, I am of Chriſt.</hi> This is in the ſame manner reckoned as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; whereas if the Interpretation of the Ancients were true, the expreſſion muſt have been <hi>adverſative [But I am of Chriſt]</hi> And then the Argument following is plain, <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> viz. Is the Doctrine or Perſon of Chriſt divided? Hath <hi>Peter</hi> one Chriſt, <hi>Apollo</hi> another, or theſe immediate pretenders another Chriſt? Now theſe that ſet up Chriſt thus in a ſinfull way, may be either thoſe, <hi>that pretended immediate teachings by Chriſt,</hi> for ſuch were in the Apoſtles dayes; therefore he bids them, <hi>Try the Spirits,</hi> or ſuch,<note place="margin">1 John 4.1.</note> who happily might have heard Chriſt himſelf teaching in his own perſon, and ſo did wreſt thoſe Doctrines that Chriſt taught, and yet in their ſenſe made Chriſt the teacher of them, both may be included.</p>
                     <p>Although I muſt adde, That a further thing alſo is to be comprehended in this factious exalting of Chriſt, <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of many Sects, to appropriate Chriſt to themſelves, as if none had Chriſt but they. Thus the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did monopolize the word <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That although Chriſt onely is to be relied upon,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> as the Head of his Church, yet it is not his will, that under this pretence, wee ſhould deſpiſe, or contemne his Ministry, and the means of grace he hath appointed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that this Text, with the former,<note place="margin">Of a ſinfull ſetting up of Chriſt.</note> doth excellently bound the ſpirit of be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lievers; that though they delight and rejoyce in the gifts and office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, reaping much ſpiritual benefit by it; yet they are ſtill to look up to Chriſt in the Miniſtry, as the author of all increaſe. And on the other ſide, Though the Miniſtry can do no good without Chriſts teaching, and it's the Spirit that giveth grace, not the Miniſters; yet we muſt not ſo immediately depend on Chriſt and his Spirit, as to neglect the inſtruments, and means he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our Saviour cleareth this, when in one place, <hi>He ſends his Diſciples to preach, commanding all to hear them.</hi> And yet again, <hi>Bids us call no man maſter upon earth.</hi> Here is no contradiction; but if a Chriſtian be wiſe, he may excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently compoſe them. No man is to be called Maſter, principally and authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; yet Chriſt hath appointed Teachers and Doctors, by whom we are to believe.

                     <p>To underſtand this, Conſider,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That there are principal and efficient cauſes of grace and ſalvation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">There are principal and efficient Cauſes of grace, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate and inſtrumental.</note> 
                        <hi>and there are ſubordinate and inſtrumental, and theſe muſt not be confounded.</hi> A ſound mind muſt not make inſtrumentals, principals, as ignorant people doe, thinking the very Sacrament will ſave them. Nor yet muſt we exalt the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, to exclude the inſtrumental, as <hi>Enthuſihſts</hi> do. The Efficient Cauſe of all grace is attributed onely to God, or the three Perſons, the Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt, in their appropriated way. So that it's true, <hi>Every good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift comes from God the Father of lights,</hi> Jam. 1. <hi>No man can come to Chriſt, unleſſe the Father draw him,</hi> John 6.44. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He will
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101245:42"/>
draw all men to him,</hi> John 12.32. <hi>He is the chief ſhepherd of our ſouls: He is the truth, way, and life,</hi> John 14.6. <hi>The Spirit of God alſo, that leadeth into all truth, that ſanctifieth, that inlightneth the mind.</hi> So that when we have to do with a people, that do reſt upon outward meanes: As ſome thinke, the Miniſters gifts, the Miniſters parts, or the very coming of a Miniſter to them, and praying for them, while ſick, is enough to ſend them to Heaven. To ſuch hearers, we are much to preach of the efficient, principal cauſe of grace; We are to cry, <hi>Surſum corda</hi>; we are to ſay as the Angel to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, looking for Chriſt in the Sepulchre, <hi>He is riſen</hi>; Look up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: ſo to ſuch, who reſt upon external meanes and Inſtruments, Why look ye downwards, look upwards? We ſee among the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yea, and Chriſtians in the New Teſtament too, ſo great a proneneſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie on Inſtruments; but as in civil things we muſt not relie on an arme of fleſh; ſo neither in Church matters on a tongue or mouth of fleſh, as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, <hi>There are Subordinate and Inſtrumental means of Grace, which God, though he could doe all ſpiritual things immediately for us, and in us, yet he hath obliged us to the uſe of them.</hi> So that it is an high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, and ſuch may never expect the workings of his Spirit, or virtue from Chriſt, that doth not uſe thoſe inſtituted meanes he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                     <p>Now there is a three-fold Inſtrumental cauſe of Grace, [When we call them a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> we mean not a <hi>natural Cauſe</hi> producing Grace, by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent power, as fire doth burn; no, but onely <hi>inſtituted Cauſes,</hi>] God in the faithfull uſe of theſe, will worke Grace in us. And they are three eſpecially:</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The cheif in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſes of Grace.</note>Firſt, There is the <hi>Scripture</hi> the Word of God. This, as it is written, and conſigned into a Canon, is a Rule by which all muſt believe, worſhip, and live; Inſomuch that if a man pretend any Revelations or teachings, which are not warrantable by this written Word, he is to be held as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed; <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony,</hi> Iſai. 8.20. Chriſt himſelf ſtill directeth to the Scripture: <hi>Paul</hi> directs <hi>Timothy</hi> to the Scriptures; and <hi>Peter</hi> commends believers, <hi>That they did give heed to the Word of God, as a light ſhining in darke places,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. So then, the Scripture or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God, is one inſtrumental Cauſe of all our Faith and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It's the Rule God hath tied us to, we are not to receive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels from Heaven, <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.8. much leſſe men on earth againſt Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Inſtrumental Cauſe of Grace is, <hi>The Miniſtry appointed in the Church of God.</hi> It would be in vain to reckon up the places, that ſpeake of its uſefulneſſe and neceſſity. <hi>What is Paul, or Apollo, but inſtruments, or Miniſters by which ye believe?</hi> 1 Cor. 3.5. Though they are not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals, yet they are inſtruments. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. God hath <hi>given gifts to men, Paſtours and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints; That they be not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> Yea, they are called <hi>Fathers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>beget men to Chriſt</hi>; and they are ſaid, <hi>to ſave men,</hi> and <hi>convert</hi> men, becauſe they are inſtruments. Yea, they are called <hi>Workers with God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. What a great expreſſion is this? So that you ſee the Miniſtry is an inſtrumental cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>There are the Sacraments, when duely adminiſtred and received,</hi> There are many great expreſſions given to them. <hi>Bread and wine,</hi> (1 Cor. 10.) <hi>is the Communion of the Lords body and blood. Baptiſme is the putting on of Chriſt.</hi> Now the truth is, the greateſt error that ever was by putting too much in Inſtruments, hath been about the Sacraments. In Popery, the Scripture
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101245:42"/>
was farre enough from being ſet up too much, they diſparaged that, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it inſufficient and imperfect: but then for the Sacraments, they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, The very Act of receiving, is to work grace; and in this Popery ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people do ſtill remain, not conſidering that unworthy receivers, receive their damnation, as well as the worthy, Chriſt and his benefits; but when the Devil cannot deſtroy the power of godlineſſe, by tempting men to put too much confidence in inſtrumentals, then he brings about Atheiſm and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, by a total rejecting of them, oppoſing them to Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There have been <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> or <hi>Illuminatiſts,</hi> who have thought themſelves ſpiritual onely; That have either in whole or in part rejected theſe inſtrumentals. A dangerous deluſion it is, and hath many times ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized thoſe who have been hopefull in the wayes of godlineſſe, and had many parts and religious abilities, <hi>but wanting a ſure and ſound foundation,</hi> they living againſt the knowledge of truth, God hath given them up to ſuch deluſions; neither have they ſtayed in denying the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> but ſome of them have gone ſo farre, as to neglect the <hi>Scripture</hi> alſo, calling it <hi>the dead letter,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>a godly man is above the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Bible.</hi> Thus ſubtil is the Devil, that when he cannot deſtroy by open prophaneneſſe, he makes them decline too much on the right hand, lifting them up to ſome pinnacle, and then afterwards throwing them down by ſome dangerous temptation.</p>
                     <p>But this is a great ſinne ſo to advance Chriſt, and the Spirit, as to oppoſe his inſtituted means and Ordinances.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it's a preſumptuous tempting of God.</hi> For as in providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial things, if a man ſhould argue thus, <hi>Man liveth not by bread, but the Word of Gods mouth</hi>; Cloathes and food are nothing, if God do not give the bleſſing. If a man upon this Argument ſhould neglect all ſecondary helps, Would it not be a preſumptuous tempting of God? You know how angry God was with <hi>Ahaz</hi>; The Prophet promiſed unexpected deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and profered a ſigne, to confirme this; <hi>No</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ahaz</hi>) <hi>I will not tempt God, I will aske no ſigne,</hi> Iſai. 7.12. You might think this had been great faith, but it was great preſumption, he tempted God, while he ſaid, he would not: Thou mayeſt think, this is high and raiſed Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to have Chriſt onely, and the Spirit onely thy teachers: but if thou doeſt this, to exclude his inſtituted meanes, thou doeſt tempt God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It's great pride of heart, and diſobedient unthankefulneſſe to God, and that againſt his goodneſſe and wiſdome.</hi> It's Gods great goodneſſe, that he hath appointed men of the ſame mould with us, to deliver his Embaſſage. The people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the Law was given, could not bear the expreſſions of Gods Majeſty; and if God had appeared at any time, they thought they ſhould die preſently. Now God knowing our frailty and weakneſſe, did appoint men of the ſame nature and paſſions with us; and for thee to neglect this, is to be horribly unthankfull. And then the wiſdome of God is much magnified, by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, as the Apoſtle cals it (in the account of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) <hi>to ſave them</hi>; and thereupon he amplifieth Gods wiſdome, that <hi>chuſeth vile and contemptible things to confound the mighty and wiſe things of the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Take heed then of the neglect of the Miniſtry, and means of grace, it doth ariſe from that carnal pride, that cannot condiſcend to the ſeeming low means in Chriſts way.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, And I will name no more (other matter belonging to this, will come in afterwards.) <hi>It's the immediate furthering of the kingdom of Satan.</hi> Oh what a ſad thing is it, that which the prophane enemies, and Antichriſtian adverſaries
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101245:43"/>
did formerly endeavour to overthrow (to wit) the godly Miniſtry, and means of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thou ſhouldſt in another way do it! For the preaching of the Word, and the Miniſtry thereof, (how low ſoever it be with thee) yet the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture cals it, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> often, and that is in a great meaſure, the <hi>Kingdome</hi> we pray might <hi>come.</hi> And therefore tremble, and again tremble, left the Devil begin to undo thy ſoul, by withdrawing thee from the Miniſtry of Chriſt. Alas, thou thinkeſt to ſet againſt that, and overthrow that! But poor man, thou ſetteſt againſt thy ſoul, and overthroweſt thy owne ſoul! Doe not then entertain any opinion or practice, which opens a way to ſet Satan up in his Throne.</p>

Thus <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> calls himſelf <hi>the friend of the Bridegroom,</hi> Joh. 3.29. which is the duty of every Miniſter; the friend of the Bridegroom, which ſtandeth and heareth, rejoyceth greatly becauſe of the Bridegrooms voice. It's an alluſion to the cuſtome in thoſe dayes; the Bridegroom he had his friend and ſpokeſman to bring him into the Brides preſence, and he heard their conference; if there were a willing agreement between them concluded, then the friend rejoyced greatly. Thus it was with <hi>John,</hi> and alſo with every Miniſter: We are Chriſts ſpokeſmen, we wooe you, we entreat you, we bring you and Chriſt together every Sabbath day. Now if any ſoul will receive him, and be married to him, forſaking his former luſts, and all by-paſt ſinnes, then is the friend of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms joy greatly fullfilled; it would therefore be horrible unfaithfullneſs in us, if we ſhould do as <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s friend did to him, who got <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s wife for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>To open this Doctrine, Conſider in the general,<note place="margin">A twofold end of Preaching the Word.</note> There may be a twofold <hi>end of preaching the Word of God</hi>; Either a <hi>corrupt, ſinfull end,</hi> or a <hi>gracious, godly, plain,</hi> and <hi>upright end.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of many falſe Teachers that did cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Word, to pleaſe men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. and they ſought their own glory,<note place="margin">A corrupt end.</note> their own advantages, they did not deſire to make them Chriſts Diſciples, but their own, they intended their own greatneſs, their own profit by them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.13. Some falſe teachers, they perſwaded men to be <hi>circumciſed, that they might glory in their Diſciples fleſh,</hi> id eſt, That they might boaſt we have ſuch and ſuch followers, that will preſently embrace our doctrine, receive our commands, and ſuch a Miniſtery hath alwayes crept in the Church; for either they have aimed at external greatneſs, or elſe to propagate ſome falſe doctrines; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe wayes; the people were not taught to come to Chriſt, they were not brought to receive him as their Lord, but to reſt on them, as Teachers.<note place="margin">A good end.</note> Now ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> doth wonderfully diſclaim all ſuch corrupt preaching, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanneſs, or guil</hi>: We did not pleaſe men, we ſought not flattering words, we did not uſe the cloak of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, he did not under fair pretences rob them of their eſtates, as the <hi>Phariſees under pretence devoured widows houſes made of long prayers.</hi> O what a pure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent frame of heart was this, to diſclaim all ſuch baſe and corrupt ends! and ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> to theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. comforts himſelf with this teſtimony, <hi>That in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdome, he had behaved himſelf.</hi> Oh this is a precious cordial, when under all the cenſures, reproaches, and uncharitableneſs of the world to the Miniſtery, Miniſters can upon good grounds comfort themſelves, that they have walked in all godly ſincerity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the ſalvation of mens ſoules, and with tender bowels mourning for thoſe that go aſtray, rejoycing to ſee any perſon or families owning Chriſt, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up his wayes and Ordinances.</p>
                     <p>Now this point will be profitable for you the hearers, as well as the Preachers
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101245:44"/>
in the diſcovery of it.<note place="margin">Characters of that Miniſtry that ſeeks not you to applaud them, but to bring you to Chriſt.</note> And we will firſt give you <hi>ſure Characters of that Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which would bring you not to applaud them, but to give up your ſelves to Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>They that are ſo, do rejoyce in the grace and progreſs thereof in their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though they ſhould not eſteem, nor highly prize them.</hi> Oh this is a good ſign! Though thou doſt not applaud, or admire them, yet if they ſee thee walk in the wayes of godlineſs, and mortifie ſinne, they are glad of it, and praiſe God for it: this proveth plainly it's not themſelves they aime at Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.7. <hi>I pray God that ye do no evil, not that we ſhould appear approved, but that ye ſhould do that which is honeſt. Paul</hi> earneſtly prayeth, that they might not do any evil, eſpecially ſuch groſſe evils as ſhould deſerve his cenſure, not that he might be approved, he cared not for that, let them think what they will, and ſay what they will, if they keep from evil, he ſhall heartily be glad of it. To theſe very <hi>Corinthians</hi> alſo ſee what he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9, 10. <hi>We are fooles for Chriſts ſake, but ye are wiſe: Ye are honourable, but we are deſpiſed: Ye have reigned as Kings without us, and I would to God ye did reign.</hi> The Apoſtles meaning is, That they thought themſelves ſtrong, and rich in all grace, they deſpiſed <hi>Paul</hi> for his afflictions, and contempt the world poured upon him. Oh ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> this troubleth not me, I would ye did reign, I wiſh it were indeed ſo well with you as you think, and then for my part, I could be content with all the ſcorn and reproach I have in the world! Oh then when a Miniſtery is ſtill praying for, deſiring, and preſſing men to the reformation of their lives, and for all their reproaches, uncharitable judgements, he matters them not, if he could ſee them forſake ſinne, walk holily, obey the Lawes of Chriſt, let them account him a reprobate, the droſſe of men, any thing he careth not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Then the Miniſtry ſeeks to bring men to Chriſt, and not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they are faithfull, and bold to reprove men for their ſinnes.</hi> They do not ſeek to humour, or to pleaſe any men. Flattery is a debaſing ſinne in any, but in a Miniſter it's a kind of Sacriledge. Now thoſe places I mentioned, ſhew how <hi>Paul</hi> did abhorre ſuch a way, <hi>We uſe not flattering words, we came not in deceit.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. he ſaith, <hi>If he ſhould pleaſe men, viz.</hi> in their corruptions, in their luſts, <hi>He could not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi> But the falſe Teachers, that ſet up themſelves, and not Chriſt, <hi>They came with enticing words,</hi> they ſought to pleaſe. And thus the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Teachers in the Old Teſtament, they <hi>did daub with untempered mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> Ezek. 22.28. They preached <hi>peace, peace, to ſuch as went on in their wicked wayes</hi>; and <hi>by this meanes the Prieſts did beare rule over them.</hi> There cannot be a ſurer ſigne of Miniſters ſeeking themſelves, and not Chriſt, then when they will let every man alone in his way, not reprove them for their impieties and wickedneſſe. Alas, if he did intreat for Chriſt, if he came upon Chriſts buſineſſe, he would finde the Word of God, like fire burning in his bones, and he could not hold his peace. And this ſhould exceedingly convince people, to take all ſharp reproofs kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If we preſſe hard againſt any ſinne, thou liveſt in; for if we did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard our ſelves, we ſhould have more love in applying our ſelves to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour you, to encourage you, to do every thing for you, you deſire. But now, becauſe we come for God, and it's his Glory and Honour we are to propound, we dare not be ſo unfaithfull, as to conceale his anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch ſinnes. Oh, how ſhould this convince you! The Miniſter in this reproof, in rebuking of thoſe ſinnes, goeth againſt himſelf, he will be more hated, he will loſe by it, and yet will doe it, becauſe Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:101245:44"/>Thirdly, <hi>When a Miniſtry affects any new falſe waies, that cannot be juſtified by the Word,</hi> then it's a plain ſign he cometh for himſelf, and not for Chriſt. Chriſt himſelf would not arrogate, <hi>to come in his own Name,</hi> but in <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> And, <hi>The Doctrine I preach, is not mine, but my Fathers,</hi> Joh. 7.16. <hi>Whatſoever. I hear of my Father, that I do,</hi> Joh. 8.28. Lo here, and wonder, Chriſt himſelf, though the Treaſure of wiſdom, yet coming as ſent by God the Father, doth therefore ſtill attribute all his Doctrine to the Father. Now, if Chriſt do thus, ſhall any Miniſter, who pretends he cometh in Chriſts Name, teach any other Doctrine but Chriſts Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; Declare any thing but what is warranted by the written Word of God? <hi>I have delivered unto you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that which I have alſo received,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. And, <hi>Timothy is to keep that which was committed to him,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.14. So then, this is as an Argument of a Miniſtry ſeeking it ſelf, when it affecteth to broach new Opinions, that have no ſound foundation in the Word of God. They are not in this, ſubordinate Teachers to Chriſt: They do not learn out of the Word, but they themſelves are the chief Maſters therein.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Then they bring their people to themſelves, and not to Chriſt, when they ſeek only great external pomp, or earthly advantages, and not the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mens ſouls.</hi> In this, the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Roman Clergy have been induſtrious. How much craft? What artifice hath been uſed from age to age, to bring the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to that temporal greatneſs it is come unto? They have <hi>commended ignorance</hi>; been <hi>indulgent</hi> to men in luſts; fomented <hi>diſcord</hi> between Princes; raiſed up <hi>Civil Warres,</hi> where they could ſend their Incendiaries; <hi>forge lies</hi> about <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Donation; and many ſuch things. And all hath been to make themſelves great. But ſaith the Apoſtle in the name of godly Miniſters, <hi>We ſeek not yours, but you,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.14. The Apoſtle doth (indeed) urge it in ſeverall places, <hi>That thoſe, who ſow ſpiritual things, ſhould reap carnal</hi>; yea, <hi>and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy of double honour.</hi> But yet the principal and chief aim, muſt be the uniting of the people to Chriſt, and cauſing them to give up their Names to him.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Then doth the Ministry labour to bring to Chriſt, and not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they do not affect a tyranny, or dominion over the Faith and Conſciences of men.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Not having dominion over your Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> And <hi>Peter, Not lording it over Gods heritage,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.3. And that is eſpecially done, when they are unwilling, the things they preach, ſhould be tried by the Word. The <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended for trying <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine by the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.10. They are to compoſe thoſe duties together, to try all things, and yet to obey and ſubmit to their Guides.</p>
                     <p>Now the Grounds, <hi>Why</hi> a faithfull Miniſtry doth thus? Is,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>From their Calling and Condition; They are ſervants unto Chriſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Reaſons <hi>why</hi> a faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry doth thus.</note> They are Embaſſadours, and ſo act not in their own name. The ſervant in the Parable, that was commanded to traffique till his Maſter came, did not gain for himſelf, but his Maſter. Yea, as they are ſervants to Chriſt, ſo in ſome ſenſe, <hi>ſervants to the Church alſo. All are yours, whether Paul or Apollo.</hi> And, <hi>We preach our ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.5. They are not ſervants in this, <hi>as if they had their power from the Church, or did act in the Churches name,</hi> no: they act only in <hi>Chriſts Name.</hi> And, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt ſets them Overſeers,</hi> Act. 25. But they are Servants <hi>to the Church,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all their Parts and Abilities are <hi>finaliter,</hi> for the Uſe and Benefit of the Church. Seeing then, they are Servants, they may not take the glory and honour to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:101245:45"/>Secondly, <hi>As they dare not ſeek themſelves, but Chriſt, ſo if the people ſhould ſet them up inſtead of Chriſt, they dare not own it. Let no man think of us</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>above what he ought to do.</hi> When the <hi>Lyconians</hi> would have given Divine worſhip to the Apoſtles, they rent their cloathes, and were grieved at their blaſphemy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. How well pleaſing it is to God, that the Miniſters ſhould walk in all ſimplicity and plainneſs of ſpirit. Many Officers in the Church, have thought by carnal policy, and crafty deſignes, to have advanced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but nothing is ſo well-pleaſing to him, as for us to abound in all humility, ſelf-denyal, and publique affections to mens ſouls. If you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rage of the Devil, and the malice of wicked men, you would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how God hath preſerved a Miniſtry in all Ages. But as the Ark was not preſerved in the water, as Ships are by the skill of the Pilote, and other helps, but by Gods goodneſs: So it is with the Miniſtry and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. <hi>Of Exhortation to you the people.</hi> Hath the Miniſtry been uſefull to bring you effectually to Chriſt himſelf? This is that <hi>Paul</hi> deſired. You may hear much, you may pray much, you may be much affected with the matter preached, and yet all this while not cloſe with Chriſt; to receive him as a Saviour, and to obey him as a Lord. A woman may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Letters and Tokens of love from him whom ſhe loveth, and be much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to him, yet not married to him, nor enjoy him as her Husband: And ſo, thou maiſt have ſome affections and good deſires, but thou art not yet united to Chriſt. The work of the Miniſtry is not done, till we can leave you in the arms of Chriſt: Till we have prepared the way for Chriſt to lodg in your fouls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollo, but Miniſters by whom ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The former part of this Text hath been conſidered, <hi>viz. Paul</hi>'s modeſty and ſincerity in gaining people to Chriſt, and not to himſelf. Now let's conſider <hi>in what order, or rank of Cauſes the Apoſtle puts the Officers of the Church</hi>; and that is, in the <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſes.</hi> Wherein you may Obſerve, the <hi>Effect,</hi> viz. <hi>Faith.</hi> 2. The <hi>Manner</hi> of working it, it is by <hi>Miniſtery.</hi> They are not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agents. <hi>They are Miniſters by whom you believed.</hi> The Greek word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Deacons:</hi> And this is ſometimes uſed for a ſpecial Office in the Church, for thoſe who had the care of the poor. Thus the <hi>Elder</hi> and the <hi>Deacon,</hi> are ſometimes uſed for the <hi>ſetled</hi> Officers in the Church: but in this place and many others, the word is uſed largely for any Miniſtry or ſervice: And ſo the Apoſtles, and Elders, and Paſtours, may be called Deacons in this large ſenſe: <hi>viz.</hi> Such who by their labours and pains, ſerve the Church and its good. Obſerve, that this word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as almoſt all the reſt of the Greek words that denote the duty and quality of Church-Officers, ſignifie no dignity or honour, but care, diligence, and all ſolicitude. Thus the moſt glorious creatures have Names, ſignifying their Miniſtry and ſervice. The Hebrew word for the Sun, comes from a root that ſignifieth <hi>to ſerve</hi>; as alſo, for an <hi>Angel</hi> to be ſent by way of miniſtration. So the ſimple word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>Heſychius</hi> makes to ſignify, to make haſte, to runne to the markes end; alſo as a man by this much ſtriving ſtirreth up duſt (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:101245:45"/>So that the word in its native ſignification, denoteth that earneſt labour, and ſtriving, which men that runne to ſome mark uſually make, by ſtirring up ſo much duſt, that doth even obnubilate the aire; and from this it doth metaphorically ſignify, that labour, pains; yea, agony, and ſtriving, which the Miniſters of God ought to have in their work: As <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed it; <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7. Thus the word is opened, and it doth (as we told you) denote the quality and condition of the Officers of the Church, in reſpect of their <hi>Auditours.</hi> They are <hi>Miniſters,</hi> Inſtruments by which God works <hi>Faith</hi> in the Hearers.</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>That the Miniſtery in Gods Church is the Meanes and Inſtrumental Cauſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Miniſtry is the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed means to work Faith and all other Graces in the Hearers.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>This Point hath its good uſe, for this will teach you what you ſhould expect, pray, and hope for by the Miniſtry. How doth it beget and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Faith in thee? How doth it waſh thee, and make thee clean?</p>
                     <p>But let us be more particular. And</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We ſhall ſhew you how it's <hi>not an Inſtrumental Cauſe.</hi> And</p>

                        <hi>How it is.</hi> Only take <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. for an eminent place to confirm this Truth; where obſerve the excellent Gradation <hi>Paul</hi> makes:<note place="margin">How it is not an Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Cauſe.</note> 
                        <hi>None can call upon God, or pray, without Faith; and none can believe, unleſs they hear; and none can hear, unleſs they have a Preacher; and none can be a preacher, unleſs he be ſent.</hi> See what a dependence here is, and how ſtrong a place it is to prove the neceſſity of the Miniſtry. This premiſed, we go to the method propoſed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When we ſay, <hi>it's the inſtituted meanes,</hi> or <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe,</hi> it's not to be underſtood, <hi>as if the Miniſtry or Peaching of the Word, by any inward natural power of it ſelf, can work grace in the hearts of the Hearers</hi>; no: Experience witneſſeth, that after ten thouſand Sermons, men remain as ignorant, and as bruitiſh as before. The words reach only to the ear, but they make no forcible impreſſion upon the ſoul. So then, the Miniſtry doth not beget grace, as the fire burneth, or the hatchet cutteth; which are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments that work by their own inward diſpotion and power to pruduce their effects. This is good to obſerve, that ſo ſtill our hearts and prayers may be up to God, who works in and by the Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe it's not a natural Cauſe</hi>; therefore it doth not alſo <hi>work neceſſarily theſe Divine Effects in every ſubject,</hi> but <hi>where</hi> and <hi>when God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to apply it.</hi> The Sunne ſhineth every where, upon one thing as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: The fire burneth alwaies every where, in one place as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the Miniſtry doth not ſo, that is ſucceſsfull in one place and not in another: That works upon one Congregation, and not upon another. And herein Gods wiſdom makes a wonderfull difference. The moſt unlikely; the moſt indiſpoſed many times find the Miniſtry inlivening and quickning of them, when others are blinded and hardned. So, that though we ſhould have the Miniſtry of Angels, and of the moſt eminent men that ever lived, ſtill we muſt take heed, that by our unthanfulneſs, negligence, prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we do not provoke God to withdraw his power and preſence in the Miniſtry. For if it be ſo (as it is to be feared it is ſo to too many people) then the Miniſtry is but a ſhadow; or if a body, a body without a ſoul: It's but a dead letter: Yea, not only the Law, but the Goſpel and all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is but <hi>the miniſtration of death,</hi> and condemnation, when without Gods Spirit and power. As <hi>Elias</hi> ſervant, though he had his Maſters ſtaff, yet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101245:46"/>
that could do no good, to raiſe the dead Child, till <hi>Eliah</hi> came himſelf. Oh, then ſay, Lord, be thou in their Sermons; in their Miniſtry!</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How it is a Cauſe.</note>In the next place, let us ſhew how <hi>it's a Cauſe or Inſtituted Meanes?</hi> And that is thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>God hath appointed the conſtant and diligent uſe of this in the Church, and the peoples conſtant and diligent attending on it.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.2. <hi>Preach the word in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon.</hi> That ſignifieth the diligent diſpenſing of the Word. And then the people, they are commanded to <hi>be ſwift to hear,</hi> James 1.19. And, <hi>As new born babes, deſire the ſincere milk of the Word,</hi> 1 Pet. 2 2. So that God hath indiſpenſably commanded all people, of what degrees or rankes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, To hear and depend upon the Miniſtry: <hi>To wait at the gates of wiſdome: To obey and ſubmit themſelves to ſuch guides,</hi> Heb. 13. Let no man think himſelf too great, or too wiſe and learned, or too holy and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Theſe are ſoul-deſtructive waies. For as it is a wo to us, if we preach not the Goſpel; ſo it muſt be a wo to you, if you hear it not. For the ſame command that commands the diligent diſpenſing of this Word of life, doth alſo command to the conſtant receiving of it. Thus you ſee God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it. It is not indifferent whether you will hear or no: He hath not given any exemption to any.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>As God hath thus commanded, ſo he hath alſo graciouſly promiſed to go along with it.</hi> So that the Word works by reaſon of the Promiſe. God ſpeaks a word of command to the Miniſtry; Let it pull down ſinne; Let it build up grace: And then, it prevaileth againſt all oppoſition. Thus, when Chriſt gave his Apoſtles Commiſſion to make Diſciples, and to preach to all men, he encourageth them with this; <hi>That he would be with them to the end of the world,</hi> Mat. 28.20. Thus in this Chapter, <hi>Paul plants, and Apollo watereth, but God giveth the increaſe.</hi> So then, God hath commanded this way, thoſe meanes: and hath promiſed to be powerfull in them. And therefore it's God that ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: God that begetteth us: God that ſaveth by the Word. As you ſee the Husbandman, he prepareth the ground, he throweth in ſeed, but he cannot make it grow. In the Apoſtles time, and the firſt age of the Church, how wonderfull and admirable was the Word in propagating Faith? In converting men from their ſinne, and luſts? And all, becauſe God was mightily with them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Miniſtry is a meanes to beget Faith and Converſion, as it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Arguments to convince the underſtanding and Conſciences of men, as alſo with Arguments of terrour, or joy to move the affections.</hi> For this you muſt know, that although the Miniſtry works not by any inward power, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes; yet it is very ſutable to work upon men, by propounding Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Motives. And theſe being powerfully ſet home by God, make a wonderfull alteration, by conjunction of the judgment. So we may read of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he did by ſeverall Arguments, prove and demonſtrate that Jeſus was the Cſtriſt: So, that they could not gainſay him. Whereupon, they did either believe, or prove obſtinate oppoſers.</p>
                     <p>If you aske then, <hi>How comes the Miniſtry to be thus Inſtrumental?</hi> The <hi>Anſwer</hi> is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By a potent and ſtrong conviction of the Conſcience, declaring Grounds out of the Scripture.</hi> So that the Miniſtry is called the <hi>Candleſtick</hi> which holds out the light. The Word (indeed) <hi>is a two-edged Sword, dividing into the inwards</hi>: But there muſt be an hand to weild and govern it. The word is an hammer, but there muſt be an arm to ſtrike it home. And certainly, it's a wonder of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that people ſhould be led in ſuch captivity and ſlavery to their luſts, that though they ſit and hear, and are convinced, yet they believe not How often have we demonſtrated out of the Word, that thy luſts and diſſoluteneſs, are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101245:46"/>
ſinnes? And how often at the ſame time doth thy conſcience joyne with the Word, that thou art convinced? It's thy caſe, and thou art the man, yet thou art obſtinate, and doſt not reforme: Doth not the Word bind thee up, take away all thy cavils, ſtop thy mouth, thou haſt nothing to ſay? yet thou wilt be wicked, becauſe thou wilt be; and ſo the Word is inſtrumental to beget grace, becauſe it worketh upon the affections by the Miniſtery: There are Arguments of fear and terrour on one ſide, there are Arguments of love, glory, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality on the other. Now if humane O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>As it is meanes or inſtrumental in this manner;<note place="margin">The Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Cauſe.</note> ſo there are theſe four Properties of this inſtrumental cauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The Miniſtery is the only ordinary way</hi> that God hath appointed, either for the beginnings or encreaſe of grace. For the beginnings, Thus <hi>Faith</hi> is ſaid <hi>to come by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10.17. <hi>And God hath begotten us by his Word,</hi> Jam. 1.18. And for the encreaſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. You may there ſee it is for the compleating of us <hi>in a full ſtature in Chriſt.</hi> Thus as the ordinary way for a mans life is by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward food, and ſuſtenance; ſo the ordinary meanes of all ſpiritual life is by the Miniſtery of the Word. Indeed ſome propound particular caſes, as of Infants wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> cannot hear, or of deaf men, or of ſome perſons by unexpected calamities caſt where no Miniſtery is to be had; but we do not now ſpeak of extraordinary wayes, we know God did feed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with <hi>Manna</hi> from heaven, when they could have no ordinary food; but in Gods ordinary way, unleſs thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a miracle, the Miniſtery is the inſtrumental publique meanes. Indeed the godly <hi>example</hi> of others, and <hi>afflictions,</hi> theſe may much prepare the heart, but the Miniſtery that is the proper inſtrumental cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe it's the ordinary meanes, therefore it's the neceſſary meanes to which all are tied.</hi> We cannot be without it; if a man enjoy it not, his ſoul becomes like a barren wilderneſs, yea like a noiſome dunghill. Hence the Miniſters are compared to thoſe ſervants, that diſtribute convenient bread to others. As a houſe or family cannot be without bread, ſo neither can the Church without the preaching of the Word. The Miniſtery is frequently compared to rain, the ſame word in its root for to rain and to teach, and the preaching of it, to the plentifull ſeaſonable ſhowers that came upon the parched ground; ſo that as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Land or Kingdome cannot ſubſiſt without the rain from heaven, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people without theſe meanes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. When God commanded the clouds to rain no more upon his vineyard, his meaning was, he would take away the Paſtor, and the Teacher from them, and then woe be to that land.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>This inſtituted means is very unlikely for ſuch glorious effects to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ie.</hi> Hereupon it's very deſpicable and contemptible to humane reaſon. The Apoſtle calls it <hi>the fooliſhneſs of preaching,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. not that it is ſo indeed, <hi>for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t' the wiſdome of God to ſalvation</hi>; but the Apoſtle calls it ſo according to the principles of humane wiſdome. For whether you do regard the matter or manner of preaching, it's both very unlikely ever to produce ſuch effects: The matter is high, paradoxal, incredible to fleſh and blood; The manner of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is plain, without the affected wiſdome of the world, without either miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſignes, or ſcientifical demonſtrations, either of which would much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>It's the perpetual invariable means God hath appointed to the worlds end.</hi> When the Miniſtery and Preaching ſhall ceaſe, then ſhall all this

world with the things therein ceaſe: Thus <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. it's there ſaid to continue <hi>till Chriſts coming</hi>; and <hi>Paul</hi>'s direction about the Miniſtery muſt be kept till the <hi>coming of Chriſt.</hi> The former diſpenſation is altered, he hath taken away <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> the ſacrifices and Altars; but he will never take away Paſtors, and Teachers, and Sacraments, and theſe muſt abide as long as there is a Church on the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Examination.</hi> It's the Miniſtery, this is the ordinary, neceſſary, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed menans for faith, and other graces. Why then is it, that it hath not been ſo to thee? Oh it would be an heavy trouble to thee, thou wouldſt think God had ſome extraordinary jugement upon thee, if thou couldſt have no cloaths to warm, no food to nouriſh thee, no creature be that to thee, for which it is appointed. But behold a greater judgement then this, no Miniſtery doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thee, no Preaehing begets faith, or repentance in thee. In the Apoſtles times, What multitudes were converted by the Word? Yea in the firſt times of Reformation from Popery, How many did not only receive the truth in their minds, but grace in their hearts? they were not only converted from Popery, and ſuperſtition, but from prophaneſs and impiety? But now alas to whom is the power of God made known? Certainly the Word is the ſame, Gods arm is as ſtrong as ever; but men by their wilfull ignorance, by their unthankfulneſs, and rebelling againſt the light, have ſinned away the preſence and power of God from the Miniſtery, and then if God go not along with us, Alas what can we do! Oh that you who are hearers would deeply lay theſe things to heart! God ſaith his Word is an enlightning Word, a ſanctifying cleanſing Word: Why is it not ſo to thee? Why art thou no more reformed, then where there is no Preaching, no Miniſtery at all? The ſame curſing, ſwearing; the ſame luſts, pride, covetouſneſs, and ignorance. Is not all this, becauſe God doth not appear in his own Ordinances? Oh men without hope, How deſperate is ſuch mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition! for if the Miniſtery cure thee not, what will cure thee? Woe be to thee, if the Word that is ſo effectual and operative to others, be not alſo to thee</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Who is Paul? and who is Apollo? but Miniſters by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave every man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third thing in order to be diſcuſt, is the noble <hi>Effect,</hi> whereof the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is ſaid to be an <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe,</hi> viz. <hi>Ye believed.</hi> Faith is one of the moſt eminent <hi>Common-places</hi> in Divinity.

                     <p>I ſhall not at this time handle all the main particulars about it, becauſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt intends it not in this place. Onely take notice, that in ſtead of all the work of grace, repenting, reforming, he nameth <hi>believing,</hi> becauſe this is <hi>Initial</hi> and <hi>Introductory</hi> to all the reſt. The word <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Believing,</hi> is of a very large and fruitfull ſignification; but it's impertinent, at this time, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with it. Obſerve,</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101245:47"/>
becauſe it was not mixed with faith,</hi> Heb. 4.6. Here we ſee unbelief doth obſtruct and hinder the ſavoury effect of the Goſpel, <hi>But that is finally in thoſe that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>riſh,</hi> but in thoſe <hi>that ſhall be ſaved,</hi> God in his due time will by the Word preached work faith, <hi>viz.</hi> enlighten their minds, and open their hearts to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
                     <p>To open this Doctrine, <hi>Let us conſider the Nature of Faith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The nature of faith. It conſiſts in three Acts. 1. Knowledge.</note> 
                        <hi>and that is uſually ſaid to conſiſt in three acts</hi>; whether they be all eſſential, or ſome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhall not here determine.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, <hi>Knowledge and underſtanding. This is eternal life, to know thee, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> John. 17.3. Yea, it's a ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conviction of the mind. Hence it's called, <hi>The ſubſtance and evidence of things,</hi> Heb. 11.1. Believing in the ſoul is compared to the corporal ſeeing of the body. To ſay a blind faith, is as great a contradiction, as to ſay, a dark Sunne, or a cold fire. If it be faith, it doth ſee the ground of its belief. Indeed faith cannot comprehend the matter we believe, the Doctrine of the Trinity, the Incarnation of Chriſt, are like the dazelling Sunne to our Bats-eyes; but though faith cannot comprehend the matter believed, <hi>yet it knoweth the ground why it doth believe,</hi> in thoſe places of Scripture, and the teſtimony of Gods Word, which ſaith, It is thus and thus. Oh then! How farre are many from being believers? For ignorance covers their ſouls, as darkneſſe did the Chaos at the firſt. The very principles of <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>total</hi> ignorance whereof doth damn a man, yet is like a veil upon moſt mens eyes. Oh then conſider that knowledge and underſtanding is the neceſſary way to let in faith, or rather is a beginning and part of it! If thou hadſt loſt thy eyes, or wert ſmitten with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral blindneſſe; How much would it affect thee? But now thou haſt unbelief, and ſpiritual blindneſſe, yet it doth not break thy heart. Say no more, thou believeſt in Chriſt, thou believeſt in God, if thou knoweſt not what Chriſt and God is. Though ignorant people are full of their devotion, yet becauſe it's without knowledge and faith, it's as abominable as a Sacrifice without eyes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But knowledge is not all; How many Atheiſts are there,<note place="margin">2. Aſſent.</note> that know much, and underſtand the points of Religion, yet believe not? Therefore the ſecond <hi>Act of Faith is to Aſſent, to give credit to them, as true</hi>; and this indeed we mean, and Scripture alſo means this moſt commonly, when it ſpeaks of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Word of God, that is giving a firm and ſure aſſent to it, as true. Hence that expreſſion, <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance,</hi> Heb. 11.1. that is, by faith we make thoſe things that are future really ſubſiſt, as it were in our ſouls, as if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Thus Faith makes Heaven and Hell preſent. The Apoſtle excellently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, <hi>They behold not the things temporal, or ſeen, but the things eternal, which are not ſeen,</hi> 2 Cor. 4 18. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid, to have an earneſt eye of faith <hi>fixed upon the reward,</hi> and that is an act of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. And in this reſpect moſt fail; They do not firmly aſſent to the Doctrine of Gods Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, of a Day of Judgement, of giving an account of every evil word. Did they believe theſe things, as the Word of God, which cannot deceive, which cannot be falſe, how dared they live in ſuch profeſſed impieties? <hi>But the fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God,</hi> Pſal. 14.1. No Judgement, no Heaven, no Hell. If an humane faith can ſet men ſo much on work, when yet <hi>all men are lyars,</hi> what ſhall not a divine faith do?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>That which is the compleat and formal act of faith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. A reſting on Chriſt.</note> 
                        <hi>is a reſting on Chriſt, a receiving of him, a coming to him.</hi> Hence are thoſe emphatical expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which are in no humane Authours, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>To believe in God, in Chriſt</hi>; and this act of faith, is expreſſed by words of <hi>reſting, rolling</hi> the ſoul, <hi>waiting,</hi> and expecting, by <hi>receiving, imbracing.</hi> A godly man is called a <hi>member of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> is the <hi>ligament,</hi> and that which <hi>uniteth:</hi> a <hi>branch</hi> in the <hi>Olive-tree,</hi>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:101245:48"/>
faith is that whereby we <hi>receive</hi> fatneſſe of it. So that the power and life of faith lieth in this, that it gives up the ſoul to Chriſt, and receiveth Chriſt in the ſoul; hereby it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt dwels in our hearts by faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. And this act is only in the godly. This is the difference from all hypocrites, they are ſaid to <hi>believe,</hi> they <hi>know,</hi> they <hi>give credit</hi> to <hi>many things</hi>; and this works ſome ſlighty <hi>affections,</hi> but they are not <hi>united to Chriſt</hi>; they <hi>cleave</hi> not to him, ſo as to to be made <hi>one with him</hi>; They <hi>receive</hi> him not both as a <hi>Mediatour,</hi> and as an <hi>Head,</hi> to whom they will conform, and live as <hi>Members</hi> anſwerable to ſuch an <hi>Head.</hi> This then is the marrow, and the ſoul of faith, when a man <hi>ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſo aſſents,</hi> as thereby he is <hi>incorporated</hi> into Chriſt, <hi>receiving</hi> of his <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>influence</hi>; ſo that all is Chriſt (as it were) <hi>I no longer live, but Chriſt in me; and the life, I live, is by faith in Chriſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.20.</p>
                     <p>Now this faith thus deſcribed hath glorious Effects, and alſo many Properties, we will ſelect ſome of many. As</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Effects of faith <hi>ad intra.</hi>
                        </note>Firſt, <hi>The noble effect of Faith,</hi> ad intra, <hi>is to receive the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and thereby to make it ours</hi>; by which means <hi>faith</hi> is ſo often ſaid to <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie,</hi> and we are <hi>juſtified by faith</hi>; And <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo exceedingly deſire to be <hi>found, not in his own righteouſneſſe, but by that of faith in Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.9. This is the <hi>hand</hi> to put on thoſe glorious Robes to cover our nakedneſſe. This is the <hi>eye</hi> by which we look upon that exalted Serpent to be healed. It's <hi>not repenting, ſorrowing, reforming,</hi> no nor <hi>martyrdom</hi> it ſelf, that hath this honour, which <hi>faith</hi> hath; neither is this for any <hi>dignity,</hi> or <hi>worth</hi> of faith, but becauſe it's an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to receive the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> which no other grace can be. So that as the child new born, preſently moves it lips and mouth for the breſt, to be ſucking there: So the new born ſpiritual Infant immediately goeth out of its own works, it's own righteouſneſſe, and deſireth to be found in Chriſt onely. This way of believing is very paradoxal, and hidden to a guilty conſcience; <hi>Cain</hi> did not know it, <hi>Judas</hi> was not acquainted with it, and thereupon eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally periſhed.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond <hi>Effect of Faith</hi> ad intra, <hi>is to receive virtue and power from Chriſt, to ſubdue our corruptions, to conquer our ſinnes; ſo that faith is the inſtrument of Sanctification, as well as Juſtification.</hi> Thus we are <hi>Members,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Head; branches,</hi> and he the <hi>Vine</hi>; and as theſe are nouriſhed and enlivened, bringing forth fruit, by having ſap and virtue from the head or tree; ſo are we ſupplied with virtue and efficacy for all imperfections by faith from Chriſt. In ſo much that the excellent ready way to <hi>conquer any ſinne,</hi> to ſubdue any paſſion, or unruly affections, is by <hi>Faith to apply Chriſt to the ſoul.</hi> If the branch would flouriſh, it muſt not depart from the tree, but ſtill be ingraffed cloſer to receive power; and thus thy way to overcome any noiſome temptation, is not to keep off from Chriſt, to be diſcouraged by unbelief; but the more ſenſible thou art of thy weakneſſe and infirmities, to lay the faſter hold on Chriſt. But oh how hard is it, ere many of the children of God come to learn this good way! They lie diſcouraged in their combate and conflict with ſinne; they are aſhamed of their hypocriſie, their guile. Oh they are ſo unworthy, and ſo wretched, that they dare not come neer Chriſt, and this hinders them! Even as <hi>Peter</hi> out of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous humility, would not let Chriſt waſh his feet; but (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou ſhalt have no part in me,</hi> John 13.8. And then <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Not my feet, but my whole body alſo.</hi> Oh when thou comeſt to know how acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable it is to God, and how comfortable to thy own ſelf! In the midſt of all weakneſſes and failings, ſtill to catch hold on Chriſt, then thou wilt be inamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, ſaying, How fooliſh and ignorant have I been? Even like a beaſt, and an enemy to my own good. Therefore if thou art at any time overtaken with a ſinne, caſt not away thy faith alſo; That is, as if a ſouldier, becauſe he hath received a blow, ſhould throw away his weapon, by which he might offend his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101245:48"/>
enemy. If by thy doubts and diffidence, thou art kept off from Chriſt, how canſt thou ever get power againſt ſinne?</p>
                     <p>But let us come to the Effects <hi>ad extra:</hi> For all ſay, they believe;<note place="margin">Ad extra.</note> all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in Chriſt for their ſalvation; there is no man, though prophane and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, but he ſaith, he believeth in Chriſt with all his heart. Therefore there are <hi>Effects of faith ad extra,</hi> in the outward man, from which this Faith can never be ſeparated, no more than heat from fire, or light from the Sunne. As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>It purifieth a man inwardly and outwardly from all filthineſs.</hi> He that truly believeth, he cleanſeth himſelf from all filthineſs of fleſh and Spirit: <hi>Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. and we have not them to make uſe of, but by ſaith; eſpecially that is to our purpoſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Purifying their hearts by Faith,</hi> which is ſeen in a great manner, by cleanſing away that droſs, that mudde which is in every mans heart; every mans heart is a filthy poiſoned, noiſome fountain, and faith cleanſeth it, purifieth it. Thus <hi>John</hi> alſo, <hi>He that hath this hope,</hi> which is a neceſſary companion of faith, <hi>purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf even as God is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3. Come then thou who ſpeakeſt of thy faith: What is thy heart, thy life, are they clean? Thy heart men cannot enter into, that may be a cage of unclean birds, that may be a den of thieves; their <hi>pride, covetouſneſs, uncleanneſs</hi> may lodge, and none in the world condemne thee for it; but Faith would quickly diſpoſſeſs theſe, and make it clean for Chriſt to dwell in. And then thy life, How pure is that? Doſt thou talk of believing in Chriſt, when thou hateſt purity, makes a ſcoff and a taunt at it? I tell thee, if thou didſt believe, thou wouldſt be pure and ſtrict alſo. As <hi>Saul</hi> that went with no good will to the Prophets, when he came to them, the Spirit of God ſell on him, and he propheſied alſo. Thus thou that art a malicious enemy, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſcoffer at purity and holineſs, ſhould the Spirit of God once fall upon thee, thou wouldſt become pure and ſtrict alſo. Know then, a man can no more carry faith in his heart, and this not reforme his life; then oyntment about him, and that not diſcover it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Where there is a true lively Faith, that will make a ſtout, though wiſe confeſſion of the truth, when God doth require it.</hi> Rom. 10.10. <hi>With the heart man believeth, with the mouth confeſſion is made to ſalvation</hi>; and the Apoſtle, <hi>We believe, therefore we ſpeak,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. Indeed there is a faith about ſome diſputable poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaks terribly to the not confeſſion herein, <hi>He that ſhall not confeſſe me before men, though before a cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ity, equity, and every good worke.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> Jam 2. doth at large ſhew, <hi>That that man is but a vain man,</hi> and an hypocrite, one who couſens his own ſoul, that thinketh by faith to be ſaved, when this is not incarnated, and manifeſted in all godly converſation: Yea faith puts all graces on working, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. That ſeemeth to be the great wheel that ſets all others on going.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>He that doth truly believe, is not diſcouraged from his duty, becauſe of any trouble or perſecution in the world.</hi> Chriſt prayed for <hi>Peter, That his faith might not fail him.</hi> No danger, no fears could have drawn him into ſinne, had faith been active. It was faith made <hi>Moſes</hi> chuſe <hi>reproaches</hi> and <hi>perſecutions,</hi> rather than the <hi>glory of Aegypt.</hi> A man that liveth by ſenſe, and by worldly advantages, he cannot but with the <hi>Chamelion</hi> turn into every colour of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which is by him, becauſe worldly fear reigneth and ruleth in his heart; but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101245:49"/>
Faith that overcomes the world. If it conquer Devils and Hell, much more the world. Yea, it makes a man rejoyce in tribulations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Examination.</hi> Hath the Miniſtry had this effect to make you believe? Oh, you will ſay, Who doubts of that! Are we Atheiſts? Do you make Pagans and Infidels of us? Conſider, there is a great difference between the Title, Name, and Profeſſion of a Believer, and the reall Efficacy of it. It's ſaid, <hi>Simon Magus believed,</hi> becauſe he outwardly <hi>profeſſed</hi> ſo, yet he <hi>was</hi> in the ſtate of <hi>gall and bitterneſs.</hi> It's ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 2. ult. That <hi>many believed, but Chriſt would not commit himſelf to them, becauſe he knew what is in man.</hi> Therefore, Do you really believe all that the Scripture ſaith? And, if ſo? How dareſt thou lie, ſwear, deal unjuſtly? No: you flatter your ſelves. The Faith of theſe things, would make you tremble; yea, roar out: Oh! What ſhall I do to eſcape this great wrath! Therefore ſet Faith more on work, from day to day: I am no Atheiſt; I am a Chriſtian; I believe a Day of Judgment: Why then live I thus?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But Miniſters by whom ye belived, even as the Lord gave to every man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are come to the laſt Particular obſerveable in this Verſe, and that is the <hi>Efficient</hi> Cauſe of this Miniſtry and Service in the Church, with the <hi>variety</hi> of the Gifts of thoſe that are employed therein: <hi>Even as the Lord gave to every man.</hi> This the Apoſtle addeth, ſtill to take off all from the Inſtruments, and give it to God. They are indeed <hi>Pipes</hi> to conveigh Gods grace, but they can no longer runne, then this Fountain fils them. They are indeed ſpiritual <hi>Trumpets,</hi> to give warning of Gods wrath approaching, but they cannot breathe forth any ſound, but what the mouth of the Lord doth firſt breathe into them. So that although the Church of God, in reſpect of the ſeveral Gifts God beſtoweth on her Officers, be like the Queens Daughter, cloathed all in needle and embroidered work; Even as the Kings Daughters were wont to go in parti-coloured cloathes; Yet all this Ornament and comelineſs, is put upon her by God alone. So that every Miniſter hath a peculiar Gift; yet ſo, as all comes from above, from God to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of diverſity of Gifts in Miniſtry.</note>Doct. <hi>That God hath given ſeveral Gifts and Abilities to the Miniſters of the Church, and thereby makes uſe of them all, for his glorious ends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle doth in many places, delight to compare the Church to a <hi>mans body,</hi> where there are ſeveral parts, and every part hath its peculiar Office. There is the eye, the hand, the foot; and though all are not equally eminent, yet all are equally neceſſary. But 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5. you may ſee this excellently deſcribed: <hi>I here are diverſities of Gifts, and of Adminiſtrations, but all from the ſame Spirit, the ſame Lord, and all is for the ſame end. The manifeſtation of the Spirit is to profit withall.</hi> Whatſoever Abilities and Gifts God hath given, they are not for vain oſtentation: They are not for humane applauſe, but for uſe to profit withall. Inſomuch, that if any man ſhould ſhould uſe his parts, his abilities, to propagate errour, or to ſtrengthen men in wickedneſs, they did greatly abuſe the good Gifts of God, and turn wholeſome meat into poyſon.</p>
                     <p>To open this Doctrine, you may conſider, <hi>That the Gifts of God to the Church,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it ſelf is a Gift to the Church.</note> 
                        <hi>are (as to our purpoſe) of two ſorts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes the <hi>very Office</hi> and <hi>Function</hi> it ſelf is called <hi>a Gift.</hi> To be an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi>; to be a <hi>Paſtour</hi>; to be a <hi>Teacher</hi>; is a <hi>Gift.</hi> Thus <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. Yea,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101245:49"/>
Chriſts Aſcenſion. <hi>He gave Gifts to men.</hi> As Kings at their Coronations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute large and plentifull gifts. And what are theſe Gifts? <hi>Apoſtles, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, Paſtours and Teachers.</hi> Thus the very Office is a Gift, and that a great one too: More then all temporal mercies, though the ungratefull world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think ſo. Thus, the Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of the Word of God, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry given to the Jews, he addeth; <hi>He hath not done ſo to every Nation,</hi> Pſal. 147.20. Alas, for temporal mercies he had, he gave them peace, quietneſs, and plenty; all aboundance; and filled them with good things: but this was nothing to the Miniſtry of the Word. And certainly, no plenty, no quietneſs, no abundance, is a mercy equall to the Goſpel. Therefore <hi>Amos</hi> threatned <hi>the famine of the Word,</hi> as more terrible then that of <hi>Bread, Amos</hi> 8.11. But when will ſwine prize a Pearl, or carnal men the things that are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. But then</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſeveral Abilities,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Abilities</hi> and <hi>various Parts</hi> that Officers in the Church have, while they diſcharge their Office.</note> 
                        <hi>and various Parts that Officers in the Church have, while they diſcharge this Office.</hi> This we commonly call, ſuch a mans <hi>gifts</hi>: He hath a <hi>ſpecial gift</hi> in ſuch or ſuch a way. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>Word of Doctrine,</hi> ſome men hath, <hi>viz. doctrinally</hi> to open the ſenſe of the Scripture, and ſolidly to confirm it. And another man hath the <hi>Word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, Rom.</hi> 12.8. His Ability is, in applying throughly and powerfully the Doctrine confirmed to the Conſcience of the Hearers. And both theſe are admirably neceſſary. This is to be <hi>a ſhining and burning light. Shining</hi> by Doctrine, and <hi>burning</hi> by Application. Thus ſome have more Eloquent Gifts, others more plain and ſolid. <hi>Eſay</hi> is full of Eloquence, and <hi>Amos</hi> is more plain. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Qui dedit Petrum piſca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>rem dedit Cyprianum Rhetorem.</hi> God hath called plain men, yet inabled by Gifts, to preach his Word; and he hath alſo called eloquent men. The Hen (though with an hoarſe voice) can cluck her Chickens together, as well as the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale her young ones with a ſweet voice.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, <hi>This latter ſort of Gifts are of two ſorts</hi>: Either <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. And theſe are of two ſorts: 1. Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</note> ſuch as the Spirit of God gave <hi>immediately,</hi> without any humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry or labour. And thus in the Primitive Times of the Church, their Gifts were extraordinary: For though the Apoſtles were at firſt Tradeſmen and illiterate; yet ere they had a publique Commiſſion to preach to all the world, they had the Spirit of God extraordinarily deſcending on them in cloven Tongues: That as diverſity of Tongues did once deſtroy <hi>Babel,</hi> ſo this variety of Tongues, would deſtroy the Devils Kingdom. So that the gifts of Tongues, the gift of Interpretation, and many of thoſe things we read of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. they were extraordinary: According to the Propheſie of <hi>Joel, Act.</hi> 2. <hi>That God would pour his Spirit on them, and their old men, and young men, ſhould ſee Viſions, and dream Dreames.</hi> Theſe were extraordinary. But becauſe ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts were in the nature of Miracles to confirm the Apoſtles Doctrine, and their Miſſion from God, they now ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the ſecond place, there are <hi>Ordinary gifts</hi>; and they are ſuch, which by labour and ſtudy, and praying, we obtain at Gods hand. For even theſe ordinary abilities of learning, Parts, and gift of Doctrine, of Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they come by the bleſſing of God. And therefore, when God is angry, he blaſts men, and takes away their gifts from them. Now, theſe ordinary gifts, the Appoſtle ſuppoſeth, would be in Churches conſtituted after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture: Therefore it's required of every Elder, <hi>he ſhould be apt to teach,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.2. Yea, thoſe that had extraordinary gifts, did make uſe of ſtudy, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diligent paines. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy, to give himſelf to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that his profiting may appear to all men,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.13, 15. Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf made uſe of his <hi>Parchments.</hi> So that thoſe Lamps which were inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himſelf, did yet need the continuall oyl of their labour and paines.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101245:50"/>
And if this was true of thoſe extrordinary gifted perſons, how much more of ordinary? The Nurſe that feeds not, cannot long give milk; ſo neither the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſter that ſtudieth not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why all have not the ſame Gifts.</note>Now in the next place, Conſider the <hi>Ends, Why all have not the ſame Gifts, but ſome one way, ſome another.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby God doth declare his Wiſdome.</hi> His honour is magnified by theſe varieties. It argueth there is plenty and fulneſs of the Spirit with him. When God made the world, how many ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> and kinds of Creatures did he make, which no man can reckon up? And then, every individual in that <hi>Species,</hi> different by ſome individual Properties from one another. Every man hath a different face from another: Which variety of the creatures, doth wonderfully extoll the treaſure of his wiſdome. The Muſician ſheweth his skill, by his variety of Notes. When the Tabernacle was to be built, there was <hi>Aholiab,</hi> and <hi>Bezaliel,</hi> endowed with excellent wiſdome for that purpoſe. So that in this diverſity of Adminiſtrations, we may behold the wiſdome of God, and praiſe him much more in the Church Aſſemblies, then in beholding the creatures.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>God gives ſeveral Gifts, that ſo the meaneſt may not be deſpiſed, nor the greateſt puffed up</hi>: Becauſe they did not only all come from God, but they are in their harmony neceſſary. The foot is a neceſſary member as well as an eye, but the eye is more noble. So that where the meaneſt gifts are, if gifts, when faithfully and conſcionably imployed for the publique good, they are not to be contemned, becauſe Gods Gifts. And in this ſenſe, <hi>He that reproacheth the poor, reproacheth his Maker.</hi> Even as the leaſt creature in the world, is not without its proper uſe and office. And then, the greateſt gifts, they are but gifts, and therefore we muſt not arrogantly be puffed up with them. We muſt not take this wedge of gold, and make an Idol of it, and worſhip it. Great parts and gifts, have many times been great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and brought great miſery: As <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> ſpeaks of one that having ſpent his time in his Lectures, to prove that Chriſt was God, and being greatly applauded for it, he cried out and ſaid; <hi>O Jeſus, thou art beholding to me for thy Divinity this day</hi>! (Or to that effect.) Whereupon immediately this great Doctor was ſtricken with ſuch ignorance and forgetfulneſs, that for ever after, he could not ſo much as ſay the Lords Prayer, but as a little Child ſaid it to him. Let thoſe then that have Parts, take heed they do not promote the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Kingdom thereby; and ſo at laſt be curſed by God. <hi>Ornari à te Diabolus quaerit,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin</hi> to an Heathen, a great Scholar, whoſe Converſion he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured. But</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods main end of giving diverſity of Gifts, is, that ſo (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) men may be converted and healed.</hi> To one God gives <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Word of Exhortation</hi>; and all is, that if one prevail not, the other may. Thus there are ſome, who are Sonnes of <hi>Thunder,</hi> others that are Sonnes of <hi>Conſolation,</hi> that ſo both the way of terrour, and the way of mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may proſper. So that the diverſity of Gifts, is a great demonſtration of Gods willingneſs, that men ſhould repent and be healed. Our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry and his together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.16, 17, 18. which ſeemed to differ exceedingly, makes this uſe of it: <hi>John came unto you in a ſtrict extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way; he kept in the wilderneſs; he went in rough garments.</hi> And all this ridged way was to bring to repentance. <hi>The Sonne of man, he came eating and drinking, viz.</hi> in a more familiar and converſing way. And therefore he ſaith, it was like the Childrens play, <hi>We have piped to you, and you have not danced; mourned to you, and you have not wept.</hi> We have ſeveral waies treated with you; But behold! the wickedneſs of the people; they get good by neither. <hi>John</hi> that came that ridged way, they ſaid, he had a Devil; and Chriſt that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101245:50"/>
came that loving way, they ſaid, he had a Devil. Alwaies, wicked and ungodly men, they will have ſome fault to find with the Miniſtry; either this it wants, or that it wants. And all this is from the Devil, who hardens them againſt it, to their own deſtruction. Therefore let there be what Miniſtry they will, thoſe that are left by God, will reject it againſt their ſouls good, objecting ſome defect or other.</p>
                     <p>But I will haſten to that particular matter which concerneth the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Doth God make uſe of ſeverall Gifts for this end, to gain you; that if <hi>Boanerges</hi> do no good on you, <hi>Barnabas</hi> may? Then, <hi>How inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable and unjuſtifiable will the wickedneſs of all thoſe men be, who though they have lived under ſeveral gifts, and heard variety of Sermons, yet are ſtill the ſame ignorant and prophane people that ever they were?</hi> Shouldſt thou ſend thy Child to all kind of Teachers, and yet none of them do any good to him, thou wouldſt conclude, the fault is in the Childs dulneſs and incapacity, not in the Maſters Art, or method? Shouldſt thou in a dangerous Diſeaſe go to all kind of Phyſicians, and yet ſtill no cure, thou wouldſt fear leaſt thou art incurable, thou wouldſt no longer blame the Phyſician? And is not this as palpable here? Thou haſt gone to many Sermons, heard the ſeveral gifts of Divine Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet thou art as ungodly, and as averſe to holineſs as ever. Oh, do no more blame this or that kind of preaching (if profitable) but thy own barren and corrupt heart! Thou wouldſt have been a weed, though plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Paradiſe. Oh then, bethink your ſelves, and humble your ſelves, for unprofitableneſs under the means of grace! God (you hear) hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Officers in the Church, and diſtributed all gifts, only for your ſpiritual profit. And the Word, in the whole nature of it, is profitable either for <hi>Inſtruction, Reproof,</hi> or <hi>Correction,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. Now if profit, and only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit be intended by God, how wilt thou anſwer it at the laſt day, that haſt neither profited in knowledg or practiſe? In all earthly affairs, ſtill the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, <hi>Cuibono</hi>? What profit will this be? Why not at the end of every Sermon doſt thou not aske, How hath this profited me? Do I know more? Do I live more holily?</p>
                     <p>Now that miniſterial Gifts may be profitable to you, take theſe Rules.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Lay aſide all prejudices and cavils, either againſt the Miniſtry,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rules</hi> or <hi>Helps</hi> to profit by the Miniſtry.</note> 
                        <hi>or the matter, or the manner, when it is in an wholeſome and ſoul-ſaving way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</hi> Hence commonly ariſeth all unprofitableneſs, that Hearers are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with carnal prejudices, and as a man troubled with a noiſe in his head. Thus he that hath diſtempered affections in him, he will alwaies find ſome Argument, why the Word doth no good to him. Conſider, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in whom was the Treaſures of all Wiſdome; no man ſpake with ſuch Authority as he did; What wonderfull Miracles did he? And all thoſe Miracles were of good things only, either to heal the blind, or ſick, ſtill they were acts of Charity, as well as of power. And yet for all that, the Phariſees grew worſe rather than better, more envious and malicious, and ſo further off from repentance and grace: And why ſo? They were prepoſſeſſed with carnal prejudices; they had reſolved afore-hand to be the ſame men they were. And hereupon, Chriſt himſelf did convert very few in the time of his Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>He that would hear profitably, he muſt lay aſide all ſuperfluity of naughtineſs.</hi> He muſt not come doting upon, and engaged to his former luſts, for then he doth but mock God: as <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Hearers came and told him, they would do whatſoever God ſhould diſcover by him to them, while they did hope, it would be what they deſired; <hi>viz.</hi> that they might go down into <hi>Aegypt</hi>: but when they ſaw that could not be, then they plainly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101245:51"/>
and impudently told <hi>Jeremiah, They would not do what God bid them,</hi> Jer. 42. Thus thou pretendeſt by hearing and outward deportment, to do what God ſhall command thee, yet when thou comeſt to thy temptations, to thy luſts again, then thou wilt not obey, come then to hear, as one that finds ſinne a burden, thou art weary of it, thou wouldſt fain be freed from it. Oh thou wouldſt think it the greateſt mercy in the world to be freed from it: Now to ſuch an hearer God will make miniſterial gifts profitable.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Pray much unto God, and earneſtly look up unto him</hi>; For ſeeing they are but <hi>inſtruments,</hi> they do but <hi>plant</hi> and <hi>water, It's God that giveth the increaſe,</hi> then thou muſt lift up thy eyes and heart to him. And commonly the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is ſucceſſefull unto thee, according as thou prayeſt, <hi>Be it unto thee as thou haſt prayed,</hi> ſaith God. And hence it is no wonder, if ſo few are either enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in mind, or reformed in life. For who is there that ſtriveth and wreſtleth with God in prayer for a bleſſing therein? <hi>That can ſay, Lord, rather let not my bread nouriſh me, my clouts warm me, my fields give their increaſe, than the Miniſtry not be ſpiritually helpfull unto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>If thou wouldſt have the Word preached profitable to thee, hide it up in thy heart; be the clean beaſt that cheweth the end, meditate on theſe things.</hi> Thou thinkeſt all is done, when the Sermon is done, when the Sabbath is over; nay then thy work beginneth.

Oh then, take heed of formality in hearing and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and only hearing; for theſe things God will ſtrike thee with ſpiritual plagues, with a blind eye, an hard heart, that becauſe thou wouldſt not receive profit, God ſhall ſay, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee more</hi>; This a great part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians is plunged into; they are damned with a natural confuſion, every day more diſliking, more diſreliſhing the things that belong to their eternal peace.</p>

                     <p>To amplifie this Doctrine, many things are obſervable:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That he planted the Goſpel, it doth ſuppoſe all people to be a wilde, barbarous people, till the Goſpel both civilizeth and ſanctiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them.</hi> To <hi>plant</hi> is properly of Orchards, and Gardens, and Vineyards, and ſuppoſeth the great care and skill of him that plants. Thus God is ſaid to plant <hi>Eden,</hi> Gen 2.8. And ſo a people are made the Church and people of God by plantation, by Gods goodneſſe and power; of themſelves they are like wilde beaſts, not knowing the way of happineſſe. It was the cuſtome of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> becauſe they had the culture of Arts, and good Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to call other people <hi>Barbari,</hi> Barbarians: And thus the Apoſtle oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> together, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Barbarous</hi> comes from the Hebrew <hi>Bar, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But indeed, even the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were barbarous wild people comparatively, till the Goſpel came among them; They had no true knowledge or underſtanding, till the Word, the Rule of all wiſdome was diſcovered to them. Oh how ſhould this make us of <hi>England</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie the goodneſſe of God to this Land, who once had no Miniſtry of Chriſt, who were like ſo many lumps of earth, that worſhipped the Devil, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols of the world! They had their <hi>Dryades,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſpeaks of, that were like Witches ſerving for their Prieſts, that lived up and down in woody pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Why might not we have been born in thoſe days, while <hi>Britany</hi> was <hi>Paganiſh</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh? Antiquity</hi> in Religion is no good plea; for here was Idolatry, and the worſhip of the Devil before any knowledge of Chriſt. It's a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be born in ſuch times, in ſuch an age, and in ſuch places, where the name of Chriſt is publiſhed; for this is wholly in Gods diſpoſal; he hath determined to all men the times of their life and habitations.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Conſider, <hi>That in the Old Teſtament God did limit his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to the Jews only. In Judea only was ſalvation, and the knowledg of God, John</hi> 4 That was the <hi>Goſhen</hi> where light was, all the world elſe was darkneſſe. Indeed ſome few particular perſons, that were forrainers and ſtrangers, became proſelytes, and gave up their names to God; but there were no Countreys, or Nations, received the Word of God, but <hi>Judea</hi> onely. But when Chriſt came, then that partition wall was broken down; and after his death, he gave a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101245:52"/>
Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel to all the world: And thus the Word, like the Sunne in the Heavens, went from one end of the world to another, and none could hinder the courſe thereof. Yea, where <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours power and ſword could not get dominion, there the Apoſtles and their Succeſſours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and prevailed. And this, and no other is the Univerſal Grace, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaketh of, whereas formerly it was particular. Then Chriſt the ſtrong man came and bound the Devil, who had poſſeſſed the earth, and kept it in quiet ſlavery to him, ſo that under the times of the Goſpel, Chriſt hath been made known; where God hath ſent his Word, though it were into the utmoſt parts of the earth.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore that there might be ſpiritual plantations, and holy Colonies, the Lord Chriſt appointed extraordinary Officers, furniſhed with extraordinary abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to propagate the Goſpel.</hi> Theſe were called Apoſtles. It was for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and not ordinary Officers to plant Churches; ſo that they had a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to go and preach to any people in the world: They were not bound to keep reſidence at any one place, but to go from Nation to Nation, to diſſeminate the ſpiritual ſeed of the Goſpel; and that like muſtard ſeed at firſt, ſmall and little, preſently grew up to a tall tree, and ſpreaded its branches through the whole world. And as the Apoſtles had this univerſal commiſſion; ſo they were endued with power to work wonderfull miracles; for miracles were, becauſe of the Heathens and unbelievers. By theſe they confirmed their Doctrine and calling to be of God immediately, yet this was not ſo tied to the Apoſtolical Office, but that in af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er ages, many Countreys have received the Goſpel by other means, eſpecially perſecution, and the patient ſufferings of Chriſtians did much help thereunto: That as a captive Maid was a means to bring <hi>Naaman</hi> to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and his Worſhip; ſo captive perſons have been inſtrumental to make whole K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus God hath alwayes diſappointed the hopes of wicked men, and that very way, whereby they have thought to deſtroy the Goſpel, it hath flouriſhed more. It's the Vine that by pruning hath increaſed: As the grain of corn, except it die, cannot bring forth any fruit; ſo is it with the Goſpel: Theſe precious herbs, the more they are preſſed and pounced, the ſweeter ſmell they make.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Gods ſeverity and mercy hath been obſervable about the firſt planting of the Goſpel.</hi> For when a people have lived rebelliouſly and ſinfully under it a long time, then he takes it away, and gives it to another Nation. Thus God began with the <hi>Jews,</hi> told them, <hi>That to them the Word muſt be fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

The ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> Where are they? This <hi>Corinth,</hi> What is become of it? Thoſe that would not obey Chriſt, whoſe yoke was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, are forced to endure the iron chains and bonds of <hi>Mahom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t. Rome</hi> in this Apoſtles time <hi>had her faith publiſhed over the whole world,</hi> but is ſo apoſtatized, that her Idolatry and Hereſie is as much proclaimed: Inſomuch that the Epiſtle <hi>ad Romanos,</hi> is now in, or <hi>contra Romanos.</hi> The Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> is an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle againſt them, becauſe of the groſſe corruption of thoſe main points of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination and Juſtification, and other material points. Thus you ſee, how Gods adminiſtration is very various and dreadfull, he gives it to one Nation, and takes it from another. It's the judgement of ſome men, That the Goſpel will be taken from all theſe weſtern parts of the world, and given to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> and other parts; but how certain this is, none can tell. In theſe later dayes, we hear not of any Heatheniſh Nation converted, ſome glimmering light the Natives in <hi>New-England</hi> have received, that is the moſt that hath been done late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101245:52"/>
For as for the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> boaſting of their converſion of the <hi>Indians,</hi> the bloudy cruelty and horrible violence they have uſed, deplored even by ſome of their own parties, makes that but a fable It's the opinion of all, That Heathens and Pagans are not to be compelled to the true Faith, becauſe they are without the Church; and ſhe hath nothing to do with thoſe that are without the Church. Though Hereticks, and ſuch as are within may be compelled to the means of truth and ſalvation. Why then in theſe later dayes Heatheniſh Nations do not receive the faith, as in former times who can divine? Only the fervour and zeal of propagating the Goſpel, is far leſſe than formerly: Inſomuch that it is bewailed by a learned man, <hi>Hornbeck,</hi> that that injunction and command to go and preach the Goſpel to all Nations, is not enough laid to heart.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>In planting of Churches, commonly their infancy and beginning hath been more pure and godly, than the ſucceſſive ages.</hi> Take <hi>Rome</hi> in her naſcent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and their faith was eminent, but in her creſcent, or growing eſtate, ſhe preſently degenerated. All Churches have been at firſt planted, either by the Apoſtles themſelves, or Apoſtolical perſons, and they had purity of Doctrine and godlineſſe of order and life, onely then they were but few and obnoxious to perſecution, all which made them heavenly and holy, but when they began to be numerous and proſperous, and the meaning of the firſt planters was worne out, then the Church grew not like her ſelf. One of the ancienteſt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſtorians <hi>Egeſippus</hi> ſaith, of a pure Virgin, ſhe preſently became a Strumpet, becauſe of all that falſe and ſuperſtitious worſhip that crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Becauſe of that proneneſſe to degenerate, and from gold to become droſſe.</hi> Hence God hath in mercy raiſed up Reformers, and ſtirred up men with invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible zeal, being full of the holy Ghoſt, who have laboured to bring Churches to their firſt plantations and inſtitution. Thus the <hi>Jews,</hi> a people planted by God, yet many times ſo groſly corrupted through Idolatry and prophaneneſſe, that the Governours thereof are called <hi>Princes of Sodom and Gomorrah, Iſa.</hi> 1. Now to purge this fountain, How many zealous Prophets did God raiſe up in his time? And thus after Chriſts time, when the wine of Gods Word began to be mingled with the water of mens inventions, and all Religion was turned into a meer Pageantry, as in Popery, God then raiſed up <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and others, by whoſe means Chriſt became known again. Now there is a great difference between a plantation, and a Reformation. A Reformation doth not pretend to make new Churches, to bring a new faith in the world, as a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation doth, but only to file off all the ruſt that hath been by long cuſtome upon the Church of God; Plantation is to make <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pagans, Chriſtians</hi>; but Reformation is to make degenerate Chriſtians, who have degenerated in their knowledge, worſhip and life, to make ſuch remember their firſt in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What manner of perſons ſhould we be? <hi>Angli, quaſi Angeli,</hi> it was ſaid of old. Certainly, we ſhould be ſo in reſpect of knowledge, worſhip and godlineſſe. The Chriſtian Faith was by ſome received, long before we were called <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for in the eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth year after Chriſt, <hi>Egbertus</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> having got all the dominion into his own hands almoſt, made an univerſal ſanction, that the whole Nation ſhould be called the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> being named <hi>Brittans</hi> before. It is not my intent to enter into that Diſpute of the learned, who planted the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in <hi>England?</hi> As for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who would make one <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to be our Apoſtle, is ſo ridiculous, that it cannot be believed: for there were godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians already in the Iſland, that refuſed him, becauſe he was a ſuperſtitious proud

perſon, ſaying, <hi>The Spirit of God was not in him, becauſe there was not humility in him.</hi> The Goſpel was brought in here long before thoſe dayes. Some ſay, <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea:</hi> Some ſay, that <hi>Pudeus</hi> and <hi>Linus,</hi> whom the Apoſtle ſalutes, were <hi>Britains</hi>; For <hi>Martial</hi> in his <hi>Epigrams</hi> mentioneth them as <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> This is clear, that in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, the Goſpel was ſpread in this Iſland, and though unknown to the whole world, yet the word of God found it out; but to ſee our degeneration, it may make us aſtoniſhed, eſpecially in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſuperſtitious worſhip and prophaneneſſe. Oh, were we thus planted at firſt, or were we reformed to be thus? Do not many among us live like bruit beaſts, rather than Chriſtians? Setting aſide the name, what is there either for knowledg or life, more than is in a meer Pagan or Heathen? Oh the patience of God that ſhould continue the Goſpel thus long amongſt us!. Was there more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in other Churches, which yet God hath made deſolate places?

How can prophaneneſſe and beaſtly courſes be found amongſt us, when the light of God hath ſhined round about us? Bring therefore forth fruit, meet and worthy of ſuch an heavenly plantation, leſt the ſame God, that planted us, do at laſt pluck us up.

The Metaphor is taken from <hi>plants</hi> to mans ſoul, as the Garden is, of a wilderneſſe, planted with ſweet and precious herbs; but this is not enough, it is afterwards to be watered, elſe all will immediately decay: So it is here. Though we have received the principles of Chriſtianity, and are ſetled therein, yet if there be not continual <hi>watering,</hi> and pains taking, the Church of God will preſently become like a wilderneſſe. No Church is like Paradiſe at firſt, which being once planted needed not any water from Heaven, but rivers came from the midſt of it, to water it, and make it fruitfull. So that to <hi>water,</hi> is no more, <hi>then to uſe all thoſe miniſterial helps, that Chriſt hath appointed, that the ſpiritual ſeed once ſown, may grow up to a plentifull crop.</hi> God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. compared his Church to a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> which when he had beſtowed much coſt on, and for their unfruitfulneſſe was reſolved to deſtroy it, then, among other things, he commanded, <hi>That the clouds ſhould not rain on it.</hi> So that for God to deny ſpiritual watering to a people once planted, is a ſad fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of future deſolation.

                     </p>
                     <p>If the Husbandman ſhould ſow his ſeed, and never have any rain to drop fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his ſeed would rot under the ground. And the Gardener, who hath ſet his plants, hath had his water-pot to cheriſh and refreſh his dried plants. Now as the Apoſtles they planted, ſo there were Evangeliſts, who did either accompany the Apoſtles, or went where they had already planted, and further inſtructed

As the Sunne doth not come to the vertical point immediately, but by degrees; ſo neither do a Church, or people preſently arrive to the fullneſs of knowledge in the things of Chriſt, but they ſtill grow in more underſtanding. Thus the Apoſtle prayeth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. for the <hi>Epheſians</hi> already converted and enlightened, that they might have <hi>the Spirit of revelation and wiſdome, and may be able ſtill further to know the depth and breadth of Gods love in Chriſt</hi>: And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> commends Believers, that they did ſtill give heed to the Scripture, till the day-ſtarre did ariſe in their hearts, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19 Oh then, Who can bewail the imperfect and defective knowledge that is every where? The eyes that ſhould have grown clearer and clearer, are become blinder and blinder: You conſider not, that much more even about the very principles of Religion is yet to be underſtood, then moſt do underſtand. The Heathen even dying would ſtill deſire to learn and know more; how much rather ſhould Believers, ſeeing the objects to be known are ſo heavenly, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and neceſſary. The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> thought a little natural knowledge about the Heavens, better then a great deal of knowledge about the nature of ſublunary things: how much then is the ſupernatural knowledge of heavenly things in a practical way to be eſteemed, which will bring us to life everlaſting? Know then it's your great duty to come up to more underſtanding in Religion: Shall a <hi>David</hi> that had more knowledge then his Teachers, pray yet to have his eies opened? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. What fervent and earneſt prayers ſhould thou then have, that thou die not, and be damned in ignorance?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This <hi>watering</hi> lieth not only in advancing our knowledge, <hi>but in giving further and clearer Arguments to confirm our faith, and to make us unſhaken and ſtedfaſt.</hi> Oh we ſee for want of this particular, how many reeds there are that be ſhaken with every wind! They were indeed planted, but not well rooted, and what hath not a deep root, will immediately wither. Thus the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth often to <hi>ſtand ſtedfaſt and immoveable in the work of tho Lord</hi>:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. ult.</note> How can that be, but by being ſtrengthened more and more in believing. We read of the Diſciples, that ſometimes when any great miracle was wrought by our Saviour, it's ſaid, <hi>His Diſciples believed,</hi> Joh. 2.11. Why, did they not believe before? Yes, but now they were more confirmned; eſtabliſhment and confirmation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the truth, or in godlineſs, is a great matter, yea it is all in all. We read of a glorious likely building, but becauſe it was upon the <hi>ſands,</hi> therefore it fell down immediately, <hi>and the fall was great,</hi> Mat. 7.27. The third kind of ground miſcarryed after all the hopes it gave, becauſe it had no <hi>deep root,</hi> Mat. 13. So that a choice part of the Miniſters work, is to ſee, that whatſoever faith, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever holineſs there is, this be ſo confirmed, that it waver or wither not. We read of the Apoſtle going even to thoſe places that were already planted, that they might <hi>confirme</hi> thoſe that believed: Alas the things of Chriſt meet with ſo much ſubtilty to undermine them, and ſo much open violence to proſtrate them, that there needs daily confirmeing and following them! We are ſubject to many ſtrong winds, and violent blaſts, that unleſs deeply rooted, we cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:101245:54"/>Thirdly, <hi>This watering containeth direction about the beauty and order of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the government thereof, when once planted.</hi> As <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo neither <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> is not built on a day: The Church at her Infancy is not a prepared ſubject for thoſe many duties that are required of her, eſpecially <hi>the Church being a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men orderly knit together, there is need of governement, without which men inſtead of being Saints and Chriſtians, would be wild beaſts,</hi> and this muſt come in by degrees; it's an <hi>eſſential</hi> Church, before it can be a <hi>political</hi> one. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> after he had planted this Church, yet had not ſetled all things concerning the order of it, eſpecially he bewailed that irreverent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane receiving of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> which was amongſt them; therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>The reſt will I ſet in order when I come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. ult. So that herein alſo is a great work, the labouring to inſtruct, and bring people to a full confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to all that heavenly order, and godly courſe of life, which Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: We ſee men have quickly ſubmitted to the doctrine of Chriſt, who yet do not in their lives to the Laws of Chriſt; men may have a ſound faith, but a rotten and unſound converſation. Oh this is the blemiſh and reproach of Chriſtianity to this very day; Herein is great work ſtill for the Miniſterial employment: Though we are planted gardens, yet they are ſo full of noiſome weeds, and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous herbs, that there muſt be <hi>daily inſpection.</hi> Hath God planted thee, and watered thee for this only, to become a weed or a bramble? The work of the Miniſtery is neceſſary, as long as there is one bitter root growing up amongſt us: <hi>Eſau</hi> a prophane man is called a <hi>bitter root,</hi> Heb. 12.15. And ſo indeed every wicked man is a bitter root, bitter in himſelf, he is in the ſtate of <hi>gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> he is not a <hi>Naomi,</hi> but a <hi>Marah</hi>; though he doth not feel it, yet his ſoul is full of all miſery, and then he is bitter to others both actively and paſſively; actively in grieving, and troubling the ſoules of thoſe that are godly; and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively in being grieved at the godly; their doings, their actions, make heavy the hearts of the godly, as it was in <hi>Lot</hi> by the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Now then what care is here required, that there may be nothing in our Aſſemblies that may offend the pure eies of Gods glory.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>This watering lieth in the ſtirring up of men to fruitfullneſs in their places and relations.</hi> The end of watering is to make fruitfull; and thus all the ſpiritual plants in Gods garden, though they have deep root, yet need this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>watering.</hi> Barrenneſs is a great ſinne, even amongſt the godly, they may all fear God hath a controverſie with them. Oh the decayes and conſumptions that are upon Chriſtians graces! Now how may theſe withered plants be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to health and ſtrength again, but by the daily watering of the Miniſtery; theſe ſpiritual clouds are to drop fatneſs upon them, the barren heart under theſe waterings, is made like the tree planted by the rivers ſide; Here are fountaines to refreſh the thirſty ſoul: How diſtaſtfull unto God unfruitfullneſs and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs is, appeareth partly by thoſe terrible curſes, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee more</hi>; and at another time, <hi>Cut it down, why cumbers it the ground?</hi> And partly by that enraged anger againſt that ſervant who <hi>hid his talent in a napkin,</hi> Mat. 25. Conſider then it's not enough to receive the Truths of God, it is not enough to be once <hi>planted</hi> by him; but there muſt be fruit, and ſtill more fruit brought forth by thee: Therefore God as he hath appointed watering, ſo he hath an <hi>hook</hi> alſo to cut out all the weeds, to <hi>prune</hi> off all the branches, and theſe are <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>chaſtiſements</hi>; ſo great a matter is it to have people fruitfull and profitable in their places, to make the beſt they can for God, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his Kingdome: At the day of Judgement, it is not commiſſion of ſinnes, but omiſſion of duties,<note place="margin">Why there is ſuch daily need of theſe quickening graces.</note> for which they hear that dreadfull ſentence of departure into everlaſting torments. In theſe things mainly doth conſiſt this duty of watering.</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider, <hi>Why there is ſuch daily need of thoſe quickening means of grace.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:101245:54"/>Firſt, <hi>It doth ariſe from the heart,</hi> which is an <hi>unnatural</hi> ſoil to grace and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural things. The temporal curſe to the ground to bring forth nothing but <hi>thornes</hi> and <hi>thiſtles,</hi> is likewiſe ſpiritually true in us; of it ſelf, there come no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but evil thoughts, corrupt affections, diſtempered luſts, it's like an hell, from whence are unquenchable ſparkes of luſts: Were it not therefore for this daily watering and ſpiritual inſpection, the ſoul would immediately degenerate into a barren heath. Oh therefore call often for theſe waterpots! thy graces will quickly wither, thy heart is no kindly ſoil: As ſome grounds will bring cockle inſtead of wheat, ſuch is thy heart if not daily dropt upon, unleſs it be alwayes fenced, it will bear no crop.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The temptations that are ſo frequent and many, do likewiſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſtroy and wither all, if this conſtant watering be not.</hi> As there are <hi>Pauls</hi> to plant, and <hi>Apolloes</hi> to water, ſo there are alſo the Devils to plant, and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to water men in wickedneſs: Seeing therefore thou art in a daily expence of thy oil, thy lamp will quickly go out, if there be not daily ſupply; you had therefore need of quickening, need of thriving, when there be ſo many obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, ſo many hinderances, all is little enough to put thee forward; the Devil, the world, thy own heart draweth thee back; therefore thou needeſt daily draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>There needs watering, becauſe of that indiſpenſable duty to grow.</hi> to grow both in light and heat, to grow in head and heart; <hi>grow in the knowledge</hi> of God, and in grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. It being then a great ſinne to ſtand at a ſtay, to be dwarfes alwayes, to be Babes alwayes, God having appointed this as the way to grow, it behooveth thee the more diligently to wait on this water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Exhortation.</hi> To try whether you grow up into more knowledge and grace or no? Are ye more acquainted in the wayes of Religion and Piety? Know it's your duty not only to be planted, but to grow up exceedingly. Oh it's to be feared that many are dead at the very root, at the very heart, all the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the preaching, the exhorting makes them not ſtirre forward! If a man wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a plant dead at the root, or a dead ſtump of the tree, though he do it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times over, yet no leaves or fruit will ever grow on it; ſo when you ſee a people after much preaching, many exhortations, to be as ignorant, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane as ever; Oh ſay, theſe are dead at the very root, ſomething would ſprout forth, if there were life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Admonition.</hi> To the children of God to prize the Miniſtery, and means of grace. Be you as the thirſty land, and the Ordinances, like ſtreames of water; fruitfulneſs and flouriſhing in godlineſs is expreſſed for this end. We preach, and you are to hear: Let the things that are dying be ſtrengthened: Let thy decaying love be revived. Oh how will formality and deadneſs trouble thee at thy laſt hour; the barrenneſs of thy life will be terrible to thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But God gave the encreaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle (as you heard) doth excellently joyn theſe two things togeher, which the world is ſo apt to ſever, The <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>Gods efficacy</hi> therby: We may not reſt upon the <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> ſo as not to depend on Gods <hi>efficacy</hi>; we may not expect Gods <hi>efficacy,</hi> but in the <hi>Miniſtery.</hi> Here may be a ſweet <hi>ſubordination,</hi> mans corruption makes the oppoſition; ſo that this Text, as it doth divide the whole Miniſterial employment in two parts, <hi>planting</hi> and <hi>watering,</hi> ſo it attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth the cheifeſt and nobleſt of all to <hi>God,</hi> without whom the other abilities are in vain: The fat in the offerings was to be given to God, and God gives the fat to us in ſpiritual ſervices; the ſoul and life of all is expreſſed in this word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, it is one word in the Greek, but our Engliſh Tranſlatours, and ſo the Latin
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101245:55"/>
read it, <hi>giving the encreaſe</hi>: The Metaphor is eaſie. As the Gardiner ſets his herbs, waters them, but he cannot make them grow, he cannot make the leaſt flower that is, though he hath never ſo much skill: Thus it is here, though they be Miniſters of <hi>Seraphical</hi> affections, and <hi>Cherubinical</hi> knowledge, yet they cannot make the Word to proſper, and to encreaſe in the hearer; it's God doth that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.11. There you have ſuch ſimilitudes; ſo that this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part is an admirable direction to look above the abilities, above the parts and gifts of men: We think, Oh if we have ſuch a Miniſtery, all would be well! whereas <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> cannot give encreaſe.<note place="margin">God only gives ſucceſs to the Goſpel.</note> Obſerve</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That it's God only who can and will give encreaſe and ſpiritual ſucceſs to the Miniſterial labours in the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God that at firſt ſaid to the earth, which had no more natural power of it ſelf, then a ſtick or peice of wood, Increaſe and bring forth fruit; doth alſo ſpeak to ſuch exhortations, inſtructions, to convince and convert, when there is no inward ſtrength in them; and therefore howſoever the preaching of the Word be compared often to <hi>rain</hi> that falls on the ground, and makes the graſs to grow; yet there is this difference: The rain workes by a <hi>natural</hi> power, as a natural cauſe; but the Word of God only as an <hi>inſtituted</hi> and appointed cauſe by him. Did it work naturally, all that hear would be converted, every Sermon would work like thoſe of the Apoſtles, that brought home ſo many.</p>
                     <p>To open this. Conſider</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">God works in and by the Miniſtery.</note> 
                        <hi>That though God only gives the encreaſe, yet it is only in and through the Miniſtery.</hi> We muſt not make ſuch cavils: What uſe is there of Preaching? What need of the Miniſtery? Men will be as prophane, and as ungodly as ever, till God change the heart; for you may as well urge, What needs the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man plow, or ſow, or prepare the ground, it's God only that bleſſeth it? No, God hath inſtituted means, to which he hath bound us; and thoſe that will not hear <hi>Paul</hi> planting, or <hi>Apollo</hi> watering, may juſtly expect God will give no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: Therefore the Apoſtle foreſaw that great evil, of <hi>forſaking the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes,</hi> the Ordinances, and bids them take heed, as the forerunner of Apoſtacy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25, 26. If you take a tree from the River ſide, where it grew and brought forth fruit, and plant it in a wilderneſs, it will quickly wither.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">God works on whom, and when he will.</note>Secondly, <hi>As God giveth the encreaſe only, ſo the time when, and the perſons on whom, is wholly at his good pleaſure.</hi> The Lord makes the Word proſperous at one time, and not another; ſometimes it cometh like <hi>fire</hi> into the boſome, it burneth thee all over; at another time thou findeſt no operation: To ſome people it's like the leaves of the tree in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it's the <hi>healing of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it's the healing of people, it makes the ignorant to know, the prophane to become holy, it mollifieth the hard heart, it turneth a wilderneſs into a garden. But to another people, it's like ſalt that hath loſt its ſavour, or that maketh a place more barren, it maketh no reliſh, no taſt, no alteration. You would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a people ſhould ſit ſo long under the beames of the Sunne, and be no more coloured by it; preaching and no preaching is all one to him: this is the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it ſhould be not only marvellous in our eyes, but dreadfull to our ears; To ſome it is given to know and underſtand, but to others not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11.</p>
                     <p>Now let us conſider why God only giveth the encreaſe; and then the ends that God hath in this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives the encreaſe.</note>Firſt, <hi>God only can give the encreaſe, becauſe he only hath a ſoveraignty and power over the heart.</hi> Others may ſpeak to the ear, propound Arguments to perſwade; but to change the heart, to perſwade the heart indeed, that God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101245:55"/>
can who made the heart. Thus <hi>Noah</hi> prayeth or propheſieth, <hi>God perſwade Shem to dwell in the tents of Japhet</hi>; God perſwade him, or God will perſwade him, we tranſlate it enlarge; as if he ſhould ſay, all the men of the world, all Arguments cannot, till God overpower his heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.36. <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh.</hi> No Potentate, no Emperour, can ſay, I will give a man another heart. He may force the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but not change the heart. Hence it is, that the Scripture atttributes all the work of grace; to <hi>Believe,</hi> to <hi>Repent,</hi> only to God. Oh then! lift up your hearts on high, in every Sermon! Look up to thoſe Hils to Heaven, from whence comes Converſion! When the Apoſtles wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, they <hi>looked up to God,</hi> and the people, they <hi>glorified God</hi>; They were <hi>convinced none</hi> could do <hi>ſuch things,</hi> but <hi>God.</hi> And ſo, we Miniſters are to look up to God, and you people, that God may be glorified.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>God only can give the Increaſe, becauſe the Increaſe is of ſpiritual and ſupernatural conſideration</hi>: It's altogether Heavenly. Now, there is no proportion between humane abilities, and heavenly graces. There is no diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>Inter ordinem naturae &amp; ordinem gratiae</hi>: The order of nature, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of grace. All that the moſt able Miniſters can do, is within the compaſs of nature; but the fruits being Heavenly, muſt come otherwiſe. As in man, though a Child hath his body from the Father, yet the ſoul comes immediately from God; becauſe it's of an immaterial and immortal ſubſtance. Thus alſo Faith and Repentance being immaterial Graces, though the Miniſter may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and diſpoſe the Subject, yet the working of them is only from God. It's true (indeed) that the Parts and Abilities of one Miniſter, may be <hi>obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively</hi> better for Converſion, and more likely for profiting then another: They may propound <hi>ſtronger</hi> Arguments to convince the Conſcience: They may ſet thoſe Arguments home with greater life and vigour; as <hi>Apollo</hi> was ſaid to <hi>be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the Scripture.</hi> Thus one Miniſter may exceed another in Glory, as one Starre doth another: Yet, God only is the efficient Cauſe of <hi>every good and perfect Gift.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore God only giveth the increaſe, becauſe of the deep polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is in every man,</hi> who is not only blind and deaf, but dead. Now to what purpoſe is an eloquent Pathetical Oration to a dead man? <hi>David</hi> that did with ſo much affection, weep over dead <hi>Abſalom,</hi> yet could not bring him to life. So that the Preachers of the Word, differ from all the humane Oratours, Greek and Latin. They might by their eloquence and affections, perſwade their Hearers; for it was about Civil and Moral mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, about which men had underſtandings naturally able to perceive, and wils, naturally able to chooſe the things perſwaded: But Preaching is about thoſe things, to which man hath no underſtanding to believe, nor no heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. But <hi>God muſt give the hearing ear, and the ſeeing eye,</hi> elſe we miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry. So you are not to come to Sermons, as to humane Orations: Your own underſtanding, your own natural Parts, are enemies, and Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to good and holy things of God. <hi>There are two Parts of wiſdome</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lactantius</hi>) <hi>The former, to underſtand what things are falſe.</hi> 2. <hi>The ſecond, to know what things are true.</hi> We are to be untaught, undeceived, before we come to know heavenly things. So that all is of God, both the Word to be heard, and the Ear to hear. Both the Word to be believed, and the heart to believe. In the next place,</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider the <hi>Ends, Why all increaſe muſt be of God only:</hi> And that is, <hi>To preach Humility both to the Preacher, and to the People.</hi> The Apoſtle carrieth it wholly for this end, That <hi>he that glorieth, may glory in the Lord.</hi> And, <hi>That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The Miniſter.</hi> That <hi>Peter,</hi> who had ſo many thouſands converted by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101245:56"/>
his Sermon, that <hi>Paul,</hi> who was ſo exalted by God, that he might not be lifted up above meaſure. For alas, What have they done? It's God that gives the increaſe. It hath been the rock upon which many have ſplitted themſelves, that they have had followers and admirers. <hi>The Manichees</hi> (ſaid their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) <hi>did</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>pour out Manna.</hi> The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> would ſwear <hi>By the head of Donatus,</hi> as people do ſolemnly <hi>By God,</hi> to ſhew how they reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced him. Now that man (though greatly exalted by God) may be humble, he hath reſerved all ſucceſs to himſelf. It's not thou, that hath made the blind to ſee, or the lame to go: It's God that teacheth to profit. And it's ſaid, <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> Joh. 45. <hi>viz.</hi> Converted; becauſe man he gives the Miniſtry and outward ſervice only. Hence it is, that God makes many eminent Preachers, as he did ſome eminent Women go barren: They ſee not the fruit of their labours; they have ſpent themſelves in vain: They go Childleſs to the grave: They cannot ſay, <hi>Behold me and the Children whom thou haſt given me.</hi> Again</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It teacheth the People alſo to glorify God, not to reſt in the parts, and gifts of men.</hi> As <hi>Michal</hi> ſaid, <hi>Now God will bleſs me, becauſe I have a Levite in the houſe.</hi> So we are apt to ſay, Now we ſhall go to Heaven; Now we ſhall have ſalvation, becauſe we have ſuch Preaching. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be affected with, and admire the gifts of Miniſters: They may raviſh you, they may greatly move you; but you reſting on theſe meerly, find no ſucceſs at all. As it is ſaid, <hi>We do not know Chriſt after the fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.16. After humane conſiderations: So neither are we to know the Miniſtry, or preaching after ſuch carnal reſpects. That is admirable preaching, that is an excellent Sermon, which God makes ſpiritually to proſper in thy ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore God only gives the ſucceſs, that ſo we may ſeek and pray to him, and do all thoſe things that God may be pleaſed with.</hi> We may eaſily provoke God to turn Bread into Stones, and a pleaſant Poole, into a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                        <note place="margin">What we muſt do, that God may give the increaſe.</note>Now, that God may give increaſe, do theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Bewail by-paſt unthankfulneſs, and unfruitfulneſs.</hi> O Lord, How often have I been an hearer? How long have I gone to Sermons? Yet, What a barren wilderneſs is my heart? I ſay, bewail this: For, nothing provokes God more, to curſe the Miniſtry unto thee, then unfruitfulneſs. The ground that often receiveth rain, and bringeth no fruit, is nigh unto curſing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7. Why is <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſent with that dreadfull Meſſage, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. <hi>To make mens eyes blind, and their hearts fat,</hi> that they might not be converted; but <hi>becauſe ſeeing, they did not ſee, and hearing, they did not underſtand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Love that Preaching, which will more diſcover thy ſelf to thy ſelf.</hi> Which will acquaint thee with thy own deformities. As ſore eyes are afraid of the light, ſo many men, have ſo much guilt within, and live in ſo many ſecret corruptions, that they dare not have the Word come with all its might upon them. No wonder then, if God bleſs it not with increaſe, when thou loveſt it not, and bringeſt it not home to thee. Can the plaiſter cure, if thou art afraid to lay it to the ſore? They that are delivered up to Antechriſt, were ſo puniſhed, becauſe they did <hi>not receive the truth in the love of it,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.10. Yea, the very Heathens were delivered up to thoſe unnatural luſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>detained the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1. How then will God puniſh thee, who hateſt and kickeſt at thoſe things that would convert thee? <hi>Am I become your enemy, becauſe I tell you the truth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) Gal. 4.16. Thoſe things that have the beſt operation, have many times the unpleaſant taſte. Oh, ſay then, let the Sermon ſmite me; let it tell me of all that ever I did; I ſhall love it the better.</p>

                     <p>Uſe 1. <hi>Is it God that giveth the increaſe? Then we Miniſters are not to be inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately caſt down, if people receive no diuine ſtamp on them.</hi> If we <hi>water not</hi>; If we <hi>plant not</hi>; then, wo be to us: But when both is done, yet if there be no increaſe, that is our miſery, not our ſinne.

I have laboured more aboundantly,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> He doth not ſay, he had <hi>ſucceſs</hi> more then all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Did not the Prophets; yea, Chriſt himſelf complain for want of this ſpiritual increaſe? It cannot but grieve us, to ſee people damn themſelves: Yet, How can we hinder a wilfull people from deſtruction?</p>

To the people. <hi>Sigh and mourn unto God in earneſt Prayers for this increaſe.</hi> How terrible will it be, if the want of profiting be in your ſelves? You do not what God would have you. If the Patient diſtemper himſelf wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, all the Phyſick in the world cannot cure him. Know, there is ſome heavy curſe, why after all the planting and watering, yet God gives no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Oh! conſider, thy account is drawing on! Thy decay, and the Day of Judgment is approaching: God will not let his Word fall to the ground. It will be for life, or for death. Sigh then, and ſtrike upon the breaſt and thigh: Cry out, Oh! my leanneſs, my leanneſs! My barrenneſs, my bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs! Help Lord, for I am periſhing! Pray to God, that the Bleſſing upon man kind, to <hi>Increaſe and multiply,</hi> may be fulfilled on every Sermon, for thy good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But God gave the increaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have (out of the former part) handled the two-fold miniſterial Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Church-Officers, to <hi>Plant and Water</hi>: We continue a further amplification of the <hi>peculiar Operation,</hi> attributed unto <hi>God</hi> in all this; with that oppoſite diſtinction. <hi>But God gave the increaſe.</hi> The Metaphor (as you have heard) is taken from natural things, where though the induſtry and skill of the Gardener and Husbandman is required, yet <hi>God gives all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi>: (As is more to be ſhewed.) Now, this followeth, <hi>à minori ad majus</hi>: If in natural things, the Husbandman cannot make an Apple or Cherry, or the leaſt grain of Corn; much leſs in ſpiritual things can he make the nature of Grace and goodneſs. He cannot work the heart to believe, though he make a ſound in the ear. Yea, it's good to obſerve, that God in this ſpiritual induſtry, doth more give the Increaſe, then in natural. For in all the fruit and profit of natural things, God doth not exclude nature from ſome kind of co-effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, as the earth hath ſome inward power to help to the producing of the fruit thereof: But in this ſpiritual increaſe, God doth <hi>wholly</hi> exclude all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ability. Grace doth not fructify by the Miniſtry, as Herbs and Corn do in the ground; for, the ground is the Mother, and hath a kind of <hi>vivifical</hi> influence into them. But here, God works <hi>all</hi> and <hi>ſolely.</hi> So, that neither the Miniſtry without, or the natural power and freewill of man within, hath any joynt efficacy with God. And although the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are workers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1. that is not to be underſtood of the immediate
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101245:57"/>
efficiency of grace, for that cometh from him only, as the Beames of light comes immediately from the Sunne: But in reſpect of the outward Miniſtry, they make the external application of the remedy; but the power of grace, giveth the quickning. Even as men may ſay on the contrary by ſinne, Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal corruption, that <hi>plants</hi> ſinne; temptations, they <hi>water</hi> it, and the Devil, he <hi>giveth the increaſe.</hi> So then, it's not the learning, the eloquence, the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Miniſters words, but Gods ſecret and inviſible power, which doth accompany it, that makes a glorious change. From whence obſerve what was formerly taken notice off, but further to be enlarged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That it is God only, who makes the Miniſtry, and all Spiritual Meanes of Grace ſucceſsfull and proſperous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If God cloathe the graſs of the field, and make the Lillies to grow, how much more doth he cauſe the Miniſtry to fructify and bear fruit? At the firſt creation, God gave the word of Command, which worketh to this very day; <hi>Increaſe and multiply.</hi> So it is here, <hi>God doth all, from the beginning to the end of Grace.</hi> If we cannot turn the colour of an hair, much leſs the torrent and cuſtom of lives. If this had been in the Prophets power, <hi>Jeremy, Iſay,</hi> and others, they had not made ſuch complaint for their barren Miniſtry as they did.</p>

                        <hi>Wherein this work of God, to give Increaſe, doth conſiſt.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>In that ſpiritual Revelation and Illumination or opening of the eyes, whereby the mind underſtands and perceiveth the things of God.</hi> The word is compared to <hi>light,</hi> only God by this works above all light. For the Sunne, though it gives light, yet it doth not give a blind man eyes. He that cannot ſee the Sunne, the Sunne (though never ſo viſible) will not give him eyes: But now God by the Word, doth not only propound light, but gives inward light: That the ſoul cryeth out with more joy, then that blind man cured by Chriſt. For now, it knoweth what it did not know: Now he ſeeth terrible objects before his eyes, as <hi>Balaam</hi> at laſt did. If he had gone further, he had periſhed in the pit irrecoverably. A greater work then it is, and mighty from God the Father of Spirits, when a man can ſay, O Lord, I was as blind, as ſenſeleſs, as obſtinate as any! Yet, Oh! the glorious light of the Goſpel, that hath ſhined in my dark heart! This then, is a part of Divine <hi>Increaſe,</hi> when God maketh the <hi>morning Starre</hi> to riſe in thy ſoul. Thou that once didſt not perceive thy own miſery, or Gods mercy. Thou didſt not either know thy Diſeaſe, or the Remedy; Haſt now found God ſaying, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> upon the dark confuſion of thy ſoul. Should thou hear a thouſand and thouſand of powerfull Sermons, yet thou perceiveſt, knoweſt, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt nothing at all experimentally, till God give this ſeeing eve. Therefore you muſt know, the Scripture ſpeaks a ſtrange Paradox to humane reaſon: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eyes, they ſee not; ears, they hear not; hearts, they perceive not.</hi> That which the Scripture attributes to dumb Idols, it applieth to every natural man. Hath God given thee a ſpiritual ſight? Art thou not rather like the Owle, that ſeeth in the night, but not in the day? Thou haſt underſtanding in worldly earthly things: Thou canſt tell how to make thy wealth and earthly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to good, but thou haſt no knowledge in ſpiritual things. Who would think it poſſible, under ſo many Inſtructions, Informations, Convictions, that thou ſhouldſt be ſo blind, ſo ſottiſh? but God hath not given any <hi>Increaſe</hi> to thee. Oh! though God give thee outward increaſe; he maketh the Lands, and the Cattell, and the Corn to yeeld increaſe, but if not the Miniſtry to be
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101245:57"/>
likewiſe ſo to thee, though thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf, yet God curſeth thee!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods giving increaſe, lyeth in removing the negative incapacity, and the poſitive contrariety in all mens heart to the Word preached.</hi> As the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, he firſt prepareth the ground, by ſtocking up all thoſe Bryers and thornes, and removing all the ſtones that lie in the way, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch would hinder the Corns growth: So it is here, God takes away all that curſed and ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine nature which is in thee. Thou art naturally a Beaſt, a Devil; and, till God change thy nature, thou ſheweſt thy ſelf no better to the Meanes of Grace. Look upon the Prophets and Apoſtles in their Miniſtry; Were men any better then mad Dogs, and Lyons againſt them, till God changed them? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did plough and ſow upon rocks, till God made their Hearers the <hi>good ground.</hi> The Miniſters of God cannot do otherwiſe: All mens hearts are rocks. You may ſooner get water out of hard flints, then any godly ſorrow or compunction out of their hearts: No wonder then, if God only give the <hi>increaſe,</hi> becauſe he only can alter the nature of mens hearts. He maketh the ſtony heart, melting and bleeding: He makes the rough and violent, tame and mild. Oh then! in all our Preaching and ſoul-Adminiſtrations, look up higher, ſtill caſt your eyes upon God! <hi>Man doth not live by natural bread, but by the Word of Gods mouth</hi>: So, neither by the Spiritual Bread. O Lord, make our hearts, other hearts; our affections, other affections.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>God giveth the increaſe, when he makes the Word preached, to take root and ſetling in mens hearts.</hi> Our Saviour purpoſely takes notice of this, in his Parable of the Sower that went out to ſow, and the miſcarriage of the moſt hopefull crop, was becauſe it had no rooting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. While the Word is in the ear, or floating only in the affections, it's like ſeed on the grounds <hi>Surface</hi>; there will be no good of it, till it take inward rooting. This is called dwelling in a man: <hi>Let the Word dwell in your hearts,</hi> Col. 3.16. Let not our Sermons be as you your ſelves are, pilgrims and ſtrangers: God many times threatneth the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to root them out of the Land, as men do Trees and Plants, which is an irrecoverable deſtruction, when the root is pulled up, there is no hope: And one main cauſe was, becauſe the Word of God did not take any deep rooting in them. Think it not then enough, to hear it; no, nor to write it, or repeat it, or conferre of it; but let it be rooted in thy vital parts. If the ground you till and ſow, ſhould yeild no more increaſe, then thy heart doth to God, thou wouldſt give over thy labour as a vain thing: And one main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this barrenneſs is, thoſe things go not home to your hearts, they reach not to the inward parts.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>God giveth increaſe, when he makes this rooted Word to grow.</hi> For as there is in Corn, firſt the blade, and then the eare; it comes to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by degrees. So it is here; the Word carrieth a man up by degrees towards Heaven; he is firſt a dwarf, then a gyant; firſt a babe, then a man; firſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, then ſpiritual. Oh! it's much, that thy profiting ſhould no more appear! But we ſee, God, even when he hath planted a Vinyeard, hedged it in, made the Clouds to drop on it, yet it may bring forth wild grapes, for grapes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4.

The Children of God do not with

that fear and trembling conſider, Whether God gives the Miniſtry ſuch increaſe to their particular, or no. Oh it's a ſad thing to ſee the decayes and abatements that are even of godly mens graces! When God is the ſame God, the Word is the ſame Word, there is as much cauſe to grow as ever. Conſider, leſt thou live in ſuch ſinnes, that make God cauſe the Miniſtry to be barren to thee. Or elſe it may grow <hi>extenſively,</hi> and ſo God giveth <hi>increaſe,</hi> when the Word ſpreads it ſelf further, to moe perſons or Nations. Thoſe that do not mind, or regard heavenly things, do now lay them deeply to heart; and the people that ſate in darkneſſe, have now light ſhining on them. Thus our Saviour compared the Goſpel <hi>to a grain of muſtard-ſeed,</hi> Mat. 13.13. the leaſt of all ſeeds, which yet in time grow very great: and Gods power and goodneſſe hath been very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable herein, making the Word to thrive and proſper in thoſe parts, and amongſt that people, where the earthly, or material ſword could make no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. In theſe reſpects, <hi>God giveth the increaſe.</hi> The work may be of men, but the ſucceſſe is of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can give the increaſe?</note>Now the <hi>Grounds, Why God onely giveth increaſe,</hi> may be,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe even in natural bleſſings, and outward mercies, ſucceſſe is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God, not to men, much more in ſpirituals.</hi> Thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> attributes to God, <hi>That the ridges are full of corn, that cattel are fruitfull and do not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</hi> God he keeps the key of Heaven, and gives earthly bleſſings, as he pleaſeth. Thus <hi>the bleſſing of the Lord that makes rich,</hi> Prov. 10.22. And <hi>the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel is not many times to the ſtrong, or the race to ſwift, or wealth to the wiſe,</hi> Eccl. 12.9. <hi>but all is as God orders it.</hi> If then theſe ordinary mercies, which are who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural, are only by God, he gives <hi>life,</hi> he gives <hi>wealth,</hi> he gives <hi>ſtrength,</hi> how much more doth this hold in ſupernaturals?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>God only can give increaſe, Becauſe he onely hath the ſupream power and dominion over mens hearts.</hi> We are teachers to the ear, God is a teacher of the heart. God is the onely ſearcher of the heart, he knoweth the thoughts and inward affections of men; and ſo God only maketh and faſhioneth the hearts of men. Let us then look up with more earneſt prayer to God, that his <hi>Spirit would move upon theſe waters.</hi> Not only the Law, but the Goſpel is but the <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meerly,</hi> and the <hi>adminiſtration of death,</hi> if the Spirit of God doth not enliven it.<note place="margin">John 11.</note>

We judge famine and decayes of trading, hard and ſad times; but when God ſuffereth a ſpiritual decay, and withering on mens ſouls, this is more terrible.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>As in natural things, the Sunne could not ſhine, the fire burn, without God the Authour of nature; ſo neither in ſupernatural things can the Miniſtry en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten or convert, without God the Authour of grace. You might wonder, why the Apoſtle ſhould in ſeveral verſes preſſe this point; But the neceſſity of it may juſtly challenge a frequent inculcation. For even in our dayes, we ſhall ſee, that one main reaſon, why Gods word doth not pluck up all ſinne by the root, and plant all godlineſſe among a people, it's becauſe men pray not to God, ſeek not to God; they provoke him by unfruitfulneſſe, by a prophane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the means of grace, and ſo he turneth even a garden into a wilderneſſe to them, and bread into ſtones.</p>
                     <p>To open this,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">What the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth not mean, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is nothing</hi>?</note>Firſt, Let us conſider, <hi>What the Apoſtle doth not mean, in ſaying, The Miniſtry is nothing.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>He doth not mean, as if the Officers of the Church were not in their way and place neceſſary</hi>; for then the Apoſtle in the ſame tongue ſhould contradict himſelf, for he ſaith, <hi>We are workers together with God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1. Yea, this very Epiſtle might thereby be accounted nothing, becauſe, though <hi>Paul</hi> wrote the Epiſtle, yet it is God that giveth the ſucceſſe unto it. They are therefore in themſelves the neceſſary inſtitutions and means of grace. And we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to hear them, to wait on their Miniſtry, to ſubmit unto them in the Lord.</hi> Do not therefore conclude from this, the uſeleſneſſe and unneceſſarineſſe of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods word. For in other places, when the Scripture ſpeaks abſolutely, glorious and abſolute effects are attributed unto it; and it's called no leſſe than <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And if there be ſo much ado for an outward King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and earthly greatneſſe, how much rather ſhould this be prized and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>When the Apoſtle cals the Miniſtry nothing, the meaning is not, as if it were not ſufficient in its kind, to work thoſe things for which it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, otherwiſe this would reflect upon the wiſdom of God.</hi> For as in natural things, <hi>Fruſtra eſt illa potentia, quae nunquam reducitur actum.</hi> So in ſupernaturals al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. As we ſay, the Sunne is ſufficiently able to enlighten the whole world, yet blind men would never get any good, if the Lord did not open their eyes. So it is here, The Miniſtry faithfully diſcharged, is ſufficient to enlighten the minds, and convert the hearts of all that hear. No wickedneſſe ſo powerfull, no ſinne ſo rooted, but that is able to conquer and remove it; yet unleſſe God mould the heart, and give underſtanding, they periſh in their ſinnes, and take no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They are nothing, This is to be underſtood of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and preaching of it, as well as the Miniſters of the Law, and preaching that.</hi> For you might ſay, It is no wonder to hear <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>That the Law is a dead letter, that the miniſtration of the Law is killing,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. but to have this true alſo, that the Preachers of the Goſpel are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but dead and killing, this ſeemeth very hard. Now to anſwer this, know, That both the preaching of the Law and the Goſpel, if Chriſt do not enliven the Word, are dead letters, or dead preaching. Hence thoſe complaints, of <hi>Stretching out the hands in vain, and labouring in vain,</hi> are taken up in the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.16.21.</note> as well as the Old. And experience teacheth us, That where Chriſt is preached, and the Goſpel in a glorious manner promulged, yet it's but dead preaching to many. This voice doth not make them come out of the grave of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101245:59"/>
ſinne; onely herein the Law and the Goſpel differ, that the matter of the Law preſſed will condemn us, none being ever able to fulfill it. Yea, the godly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do all things the Law requireth, and ſo the Law is a killing letter to him. But the Goſpel, that comes with a moderation, where the graces of Gods Spirit are, though weak and imperfect, there, through Chriſt their weakneſſe is forgiven. So that the preaching of the Goſpel to a ſoul oppreſſed for ſinne, is like the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> to poor ſervants and indebted priſoners. Howſoever then the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel is ſaid to be <hi>the miniſtration of life, and of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. yet that is not to be underſtood ſimply of it ſelf; but as accompanied with the power of God. Hence the Goſpel is ſaid to be <hi>the power of God to ſalvation, Rom.</hi> 1.16. the power of God, not of man. It's not mans wiſdome, that our faith is grounded on. Thus much for what the Apoſtle meaneth not.</p>
                     <p>What he <hi>poſitively meaneth,</hi> or <hi>inferreth,</hi> are, Firſt, <hi>That it's not in the power or choiſe of the Miniſter, to make it effectual.</hi> He cannot bid or command the Word to work as he pleaſeth, for then the guilt of all mens ſouls, and the damnation of all would lie upon us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As our Divines ſay to the Papiſts, when they brag, The Pope hath the Keyes of power above all things, not only in earth, but in purgatory; Why then doth he ſuffer thoſe ſouls to lie tormented there, as he doth? So it would be here, Why are any damned? Why do any lie in their ſinnes, if the Miniſtry by its own power could convert them? No, the Miniſters of God they can only pray, they can mourn and grieve in ſecret to ſee the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the Word, and the wilfull reſolution in men to deſtroy their own ſouls; they can mourn over the dead, but they cannot recover them to life.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Apoſtle by this intends, that both the Miniſters and the people ſhould keep themſelves in their due bounds.</hi> The Miniſters, though never ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, though never ſo much applauded by a numerous company of Diſciples, yet they cannot make one black hair white; They cannot ſay of any people, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, That we by our own power have made ſuch believe. It's true, they are ſaid to be <hi>Fathers,</hi> and to <hi>beget men to the truth</hi>; but that is only inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally and metaphorically, by external application of the Word, not internal power; for ſo we have onely <hi>one Father in Heaven.</hi> Pride and ambition do eaſily breed in the moſt eminent parts, as worms in the ſweeteſt fruit; but when they ſhall conſider, that they are nothing, and God is all, this is a good way to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them; and then the people hereby are alſo taught much moderation. Some mens perſons they are apt to admire, Not ſuch a man in the world! Oh but what a great God is there in Heaven, without whom this man is nothing! This is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Idolatry, and that worſhip, which is to be given to Chriſt only, you give to inſtruments.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>In making the Miniſtry nothing, and God all; The Apoſtle would have both Miniſter and people in their Miniſtry, to have our hearts and eyes up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> As the Bird after every drop of water it ſips, looks up preſently to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo ſhouldſt thou. Lord, what the Miniſter hath ſpoken, what he hath preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, oh ſet it home with a bleſſing! Cauſe it to come like rain upon the new mowed graſſe! Oh the careleſſe and prophane hearing that is every where! This makes God give no increaſe; you matter it not, you believe not, you tremble not under it, you do not earneſtly pray about it. If a man have a leg or arm to be cut off, oh you deſire all you meet with, to pray about it; Why? becauſe it may coſt him his life. How much rather about every Sermon, every Duty that is preached, ſhouldſt thou pray, and again pray? Oh, it may be the damning of my immortal ſoul, to miſcarry therein!</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how may we addreſſe our ſelves to hear, and to the Miniſtry, ſo that God may make them ſomething to us?</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To be made <hi>ſomething,</hi> is, when the Word doth greatly wound thy heart, or comfort thee, when it makes a noiſe and a pain at thy very bowels, when it makes thee ſick at the very heart; when it makes thee cry out, Oh me, a wretched ſinner, what have I done? Whither ſhall I go? Ah wretch that I am! In what a wofull condition am I plunged? Sinne is on one ſide, hell on the other, the wrath of God above me, and all the curſes of the Law round about me. Then it's <hi>ſomething,</hi> then our words fall like hot burning coals upon your conſciences; you cannot ſleep, nor rove, but tremble under it. Now this will be done theſe wayes:</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Directions, how to <hi>hear the Word.</hi>
                        </note>Firſt, <hi>Make it a real and conſcientious matter, to pray unto God to give increaſe.</hi> As to the woman our Saviour ſaid, <hi>According to thy faith, ſo be it unto thee:</hi> So according to thy prepared prayer ſaith God, this Sermon, and this duty ſhall be bleſſed unto you. As your cruiſe is fitted, ſo will God pour in oil. If we then complain, that the Miniſtry works no more notable effects, that it makes no more tranſcendent alterations, judge whether the blame lie not on thy own ſelf. Prayer is that which moveth with God. Prayer is that in which the Sermon rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, produceth ſutable operations. The Word of God is a two-edged ſword; but prayer maketh it penetrate, that ſets God on work, and God ſets his Word on work. A man much in prayer, is alwayes much in profiting. As the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is to pray (Chriſt prayed much in the night, as he taught much in the day) ſo the hearer he alſo muſt pray much.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Exerciſe ſtrong and divine acts of faith, this will make the Miniſtry ſomething to thee. The Word profited not, becauſe it was not mingled with faith, Heb.</hi> 4.2. or as ſome interpret, becauſe by faith they were not mixed (as it were) with the Word, they were not incorporated into it, <hi>and who hath believed our report?</hi> Rom. 10. <hi>Faith is that which comes at firſt by hearing, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards makes hearing profitable.</hi> The Atheiſm and unbelief which is on mens hearts make the Word without efficacy, ſuch are prophane mockers. As you ſee, they <hi>deſpiſed the Prophets that often ſaid, The burden of the Lord, the burden of the Lord.</hi> Men believe not the things preached to be Gods truth, that they are Gods word, that they will be made good, whether they will or no; they are living words, and ſure words, and faith only layeth the firſt foundation of this ſpiritual building, believe the threatning, and thou dareſt no more gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Lay aſide all ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe,</hi> Jam. 1 21. If <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought not a young man a fit Auditour for his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> much leſſe is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane beaſt, wallowing in his filth fit for the Word. The ground muſt have all the bryars and thorns pulled up, ere the ſeed ſown can bring forth any fruit. No luſt, no ſinne lived in, hath ears to hear. When the Law was to be promulged, what waſhings and preparations were there for ſeveral dayes together? Thou that comeſt to the Miniſtry with all thy goar and filth upon thee, thou art a loathſome and an abominable object. Do men uſe to ſow in bogs and quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires? So neither doth the Word thrive in men of looſe and diſſolute lives. The Prophet in an indignation at the ſinfulneſſe of his people, crieth out, <hi>Hear, ô Heavens, and hearken, ô Earth!</hi> Iſa. 1.2. as if thoſe inſenſible creatures would more attend, than ſome men.</p>

Oh, how many are there to whom it's <hi>nothing!</hi> They make nothing of any Sermon they hear; yea, and people generally delight in ſuch a Miniſtry, that brings nothing to them. They love not, when it is like fire, like a two-edged ſword; they love not, when it troubles and diſquiets them for ſinne; the more it's nothing, and paſſeth away as nothing, the more contented they are. Oh people prepared for deſtructon! Oh people hated by God! For wherein doth God ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

then by cauſing the Word to be like fire in the bowels? Thoſe whom God loveth, they find the Miniſtery efficacious and vigorous: they find it to come with power and autority: they cry out great is the power of the Lord. Oh how it ſearcheth, how it tryeth, how it convinceth, how it conquers, nothing an ſtand before it!</p>

                     <p>THe Apoſtles ſcope is as you have heard to prevent factions and diviſions, both in Preachers and hearers; to unite them together in love and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for which he hath uſed ſeveral Arguments. And this eighth Verſe beginneth a new Medium to prove the neceſſity of concord, both among the Miniſters themſelves and the people: What is ſaid of men joyned in earthly power, <hi>Erunt inſuperabiles, ſi inſeperabiles</hi>; the ſame is true both of the Officers and members in the Church of God. Now the Argument the Apoſtle preſſeth, is to this effect, <hi>Thoſe that are one ought not to be divided, either by themſelves or by their hearers; But all the Officers in God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>So that you ſee, though there is diverſity of gifts and employmenss; yet they all agree in one; it's unity therefore among Miniſters and the people, that is made the ground of concord: This would be a very neceſſary ſubject in theſe times of multiplyed diviſions, it being very hard now a daies to ſay, <hi>He that watereth, and he that planteth are one</hi>: But I ſhall paſs it over briefly in one Sermon. Now this phraſe, <hi>They are one,</hi> is not to be underſtood eſſentially, as if they were one nature; in which ſence 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. it's ſaid, <hi>There are three that bear witneſs is heaven, and theſe three are one.</hi> Nor ſecondly are they one in reſpect of labour and worth; No, <hi>Paul laboured more abundantly then they all</hi>; and as the ſtarres differ from one another; ſo do the Miniſters of God in worth and ability: Therefore the Apoſtle prevents ſuch thoughts, by the words appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, <hi>Every man ſhall receive according to his own labour: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num ſunt non indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duo, non gradu, non donis, non vocatione, non autoritate, non tempore, non labore, nec non maerore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Baldwin</hi> on the place. But they are ſaid to be one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſcope and end for which the Miniſtery is appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> to gather a Church unto God, and to build them up in ſaith and godlineſs. Obſerve</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That although there is diverſity and variety in the gifts of the Miniſters, yet they all ought to agree in one.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>They are to have the ſame mind, the ſame ends, the ſame mouth: Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>According as he hath ſpoken by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which were from the beginning,</hi> Luk. 1.70. All the Prophets ever ſince the world began, had but one mouth; He doth not ſay the mouths, but the mouth: To ſhew there was no contrariety, no oppoſition, but all agreed in this. Thus it ſhould be, the mouth of the Miniſters of Chriſt; they ſhould go the ſame way, one ſhould not preach contrary to the other, one ſhould not deſtroy what the other affirmes. Hence our Saviour did ſo earneſtly pray, That his Diſciples <hi>might be one,</hi> Joh. 17. For what a ſcandal and offence would it have been, if they who were to be Teachers of the Word, and to lay the foundation of the Goſpel, ſhould not have agreed among themſelves? So that whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle preſſing unity, <hi>Eph</hi> 4.4, 5. doth reckon up ſeveral kinds of unities, <hi>One bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, one ſpirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one Baptiſme</hi>; ſo we may adde one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery;

The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth that, when he ſaith, <hi>If any be otherwiſe minded, the Lord will reveal even this alſo to him,</hi> Phil. 3.15.</p>

And <hi>John,</hi> would not have us ſo much as <hi>receive them in the houſe, or bid them God ſpeed,</hi> 2 Joh ver. 10, 11. and who doth ſo, he ſaith, <hi>is partaker of all his evil deeds.</hi> So then the Miniſtery ought to be one in reſpect of doctrine; to preach one God, one Chriſt, one Faith, one way to heaven; for they are not to be inverters, but keepers only of heavenly doctrine: <hi>Keep that good thing committed to thy truſt,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14.</p>

Oh what a comfort, and glorious ſight would it be, to ſee the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery not gratifying parties, not making intereſts, but affectionately advancing the glory of God, though they be accounted as the off ſcouring of the world! <hi>Paul</hi> he gave us this example, and we are to follow him. The ſecond end in which they are to agree, is the <hi>converſion of men,</hi> and <hi>edifying</hi> of them up in faith and godlineſs. If this be our end, that will quickly diſpell all other things that obtrude thmſelves; the ſalvation of mens ſouls, and tender bowels herein, would quickly make all one; but when men do not agree in the end, it's no wonder if they are contrary alſo in the meanes; when we deſire to preach our own notions, and our own opinions, more then to procure your ſalvation; it's no marvel if there be as many opinions as there are Miniſters. So then theſe two things would wonderfully unite, Gods glory, and the ſalvation of mens ſouls; and all our preaching, ſtudying, and labouring, ought to be for this.</p>

It was a gracious expreſſion of <hi>Calvin</hi> concerning <hi>Luther,</hi> who was an hot man, and apt to break out in violent expreſſions: Oh ſaith <hi>Calvin, I honour Luther as an eminent ſervant and inſtrument of God, though he ſhould call me a Devil a thouſand times over.</hi> When our Saviour had compared his Diſciples to ſalt, to ſhew it was not his meaning they ſhould be ſalt to one another, he ſaith, <hi>Have ſalt in your ſelves, and peace one with another,</hi> Mar 9.50. there muſt be ſalt and peace. Oh but as it is ſaid of <hi>Reuben,</hi> ſo may we ſay, for the diviſions of the Miniſters, and the diviſions of the people are great thoughts of heart.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>When the Miniſtery is not one, this is apt in the firſt place to beget atheiſm, and irreligion in the people.</hi> They begin to think that Religion is nothing but a matter of imagination, or invention; or elſe that there is no ſuch thing, and therefore they will regard it no more, they will look after it no more. Oh wo be to the world becauſe of offences in this kind! He that makes a diviſion from the true doctrine, or true ends of the Miniſtry; he had better never have been born; he that is a firebrand here, may fear to be a firebrand in hell: How many Atheiſts and prophane ſcoffers maieſt thou make by this diviſion of thine?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Where there is not this unity, it doth much grieve and unſetle the hearts of the godly.</hi> They know not what to do; they cannot tell what to take to; ſuch godly men ſay it's a ſinne, others as godly ſay it's not a ſinne: Now to thoſe that are tender, and would not ſinne for an whole world, this is a very racking and torturing of their conſciences: Oh what ſhall they do!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>When there is not this unity, prophaneneſs and ungodlineſs doth the more encreaſe; godlineſs doth exceedingly decay in the power of it.</hi> For while the Miniſters ſhould all, as one man, labour to deſtroy the kingdom of Satan, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage impiety, to make the heart of the wicked ſad, that he may return from his evil way: They commonly le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now we ſhall ſee the Apoſtle takes off much from ſuch controverſal diſputes, in which the eſſence of godlineſs doth not conſiſt. As <hi>the kingdom of heaven is not in meats and drinks, but in joy, and peace, and righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 14.17. ſo it's good to <hi>have the heart eſtabliſhed with grace, and not with meats,</hi> Heb. 14 9 and in other places, the Apoſtle calls thoſe things vain, which do not edifie; Not that the leaſt truths of God are to be neglected, yea all things are to be tryed, but this ſhould not be the main: the one thing neceſſary <hi>is to ſeek the kingdome of heaven, and the righteouſneſs thereof.</hi>

knowledge than others, and more grace and ſelf-denial than others, ſo long there will be differences. You ſee <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had a ſharpe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with one another. And the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the corrupt cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings that the ſtrong and weake Chriſtians had of one another, <hi>Romans</hi> 1.4.</p>

Now that is the reaſon, many do ſo ſtagger, and know not what to ſay or do: They are not ſtedfaſt and immoveable in faith; <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith</hi>; by his faith in particular. And then, though the whole world ſhould turn Sceptick, yet he would be as reſolute as a Stoick in the matters of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Humble your ſelves under theſe differences, when they goe not the ſame way, when they preach not the ſame things.</hi> Let theſe things fear and wound thy heart, as much as they do the Churches peace.

Say, Oh Lord, it's for our ſins that are the hearers, our unprofitableneſſe, our barrenneſſe and vanity, that God hath raiſed up ſuch a contentious ſpirit amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this is more neceſſary for us, than you, though neceſſary for both, let us ſee what Uſe you ought to make of it. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Is the Miniſtry thus one? Then when any doth ſet upon this maine worke, they meddle not with other things, they preach not about other thins: How inexcuſable will you be, if you anſwer not God thus calling of you? You cannot plead, Lord, we heard nothing but diſputes, nothing but controverſies; we were puzzled with one ſide, and with another ſide! Oh no! The plain and neceſſary things, without which thou couldſt not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, have every day ſounded in thy eares; Preaching hath not diſtracted, hath not filled you with troubleſome Diſputations, but wholeſome Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. It will therefore be thy greater wickedneſſe, if thou refuſe. Oh then, as all the Miniſtry are to be one in this way, ſo that all that hear were one alſo, that their thoughts, affections, ſtudy and utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were for the main neceſſary things! Oh conſider, you fruſtrate the Miniſtry of the proper end it hath, your edifying, your converſion! For this God hath appointed us to labour in preaching to you, and if you fail here, all is loſt.</p>

Then no wonder, if the Devil, when he cannot deſtroy preaching, yet makes it uſeleſſe and unprofitable, and that is, by raiſing diviſions and enmity. And thus he takes the old Rule, <hi>Divide &amp; impera,</hi> while he divides others, he himſelf reigneth alone, and his Kingdom is advanced.</p>

Why do you not deſire a new Scripture, and a new Bible as well? Oh it's a grievous thing to be weary of old truths, becauſe thou knoweſt them already!

                     <p>The former part of the verſe was an Argument againſt Diviſions amongſt Teachers and People. When all are one, there they ought not to be divided. Now this later part is a kind of an anticipation, or anſwer to an Objection, thus, <hi>How can they be one, who are ſo different in their parts, abilities and labour?</hi> The Apoſtle therefore doth by way of explication adde this: although they are one in their Office, Inſtitution, and End; yet there is a diverſity of Gifts and Labour, as alſo a diverſity of <hi>Reward.</hi>

If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wouldſt not be deprived of a reward, be ſure out of the Scripture, that it be Gods work for the matter of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It's acceptable labouring, when it is done in ſuch a manner.</hi> For God doth not accept of any labour for him, meerly from the painfulneſſe of it; <hi>For if a man give his body to be burnt, and have not love to God, it's nothing worth.</hi> Not (I ſay) from the painfulneſſe or length of time, but from other qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It's profitable working, when the perſons are firſt made the Lords, when they are juſtified and ſanctified. Make the tree good, and then the fruit will be good.</hi> The perſon muſt be firſt ſanctified, ere any work can be acceptable: He is an unclean perſon till then, and all things are unclean; <hi>To the defiled all things become defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> Tit. 1.15. Oh that people would attend to this! They only look to the good matter of the work; they pray, they give alms, they live ſoberly, but they have no knowledge about the root thereof. Are their perſons juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, their natures ſanctified, without which no work of God can be done acceptably.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>A Reward is due to that work only, which is done for Gods ſake, out of love to him.</hi> The Phariſees praying, and other acts of Religion, have a terrible verdict by Chriſt upon them, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, they have their reward,</hi> Mat. 6.2. O words of terrour and horrour! They did all thoſe acts to be ſeen of men, to be applauded by men, and they have their reward, this is all they ſhall have; our Saviour uſeth that affirmation, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you,</hi> when he ſpeaks earneſtly, and would have men diligently mind what he ſaith, <hi>Verily they have their reward.</hi> Oh what will the praiſe and glory of men avail thee, when thou and thy duties ſhall be caſt away! Know then this worm will devour thy gourd, vain glory, car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>al ends and deſigns upon Gods works, will make all to be thrown away. When the Devil cannot keep thee in the works of darkneſſe and of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, that thou wilt do them; then he indeavours to marre thy good works, by throwing ſome dead flie in this box of ointment, vain-glory, and ſelf-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>That work will onely have a reward, which is done with that meaſure and degree of love and fervency that it ought to be.</hi> Every Sacrifice was to be offered up with fire; and every duty is to be performed with much zeal, and inflamed affections to God. <hi>Fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11. <gap reason="foreign">

Have not many of Gods own people loſt their firſt praying, firſt hearing, their firſt zeal and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to good things? <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord negligently,</hi> Jer 48.10. Here is no reward, but a curſe to ſuch, who in Gods work are negligent and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101245:64"/>
careleſſe; and it's a great diſhonour to God, that thou ſhouldſt be fervent and active in the pleaſures of ſinne, in the ſervice of Satan, and not in Gods work.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>The work to be rewarded, is that which is conſtantly done with perſeverance, holding out to the end.</hi> Mat. 24.13. <hi>He that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved. If a righteous man leave his righteouſneſſe, and commit iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe that he hath done ſhall not be remembred,</hi> Ezek. 33.13. There are thoſe who begin in Gods work, and end in the Devils. There are thoſe who by the knowledge of God eſcape the pollution of the world, and then return again to their vomit, <hi>The later end of ſuch is worſe than their beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. Take <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> for a dreadfull inſtance, he leaveth all, and followeth Chriſt, he preacheth the Goſpel, he worketh miracles, he caſts out Devils from others, but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth an Apoſtate himſelf; the <hi>Devil enters into him at laſt,</hi> and ſo all thoſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good works periſh. Oh that thoſe who have an aguiſh goodneſſe, ſome good fits in time of danger, of diſeaſes! Then they will call upon God, then they will ſpeak of God, and do what is good. Oh that ſuch had an heart alwayes to do ſo! <hi>Bleſſed is he whom his maſter, when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing, Matth.</hi> 24.46.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>The work to be rewarded is, that which is done fully and plenarily.</hi> There is a full meaſure of grace to be heaped over. The Scripture ſpeaking of <hi>Caleb,</hi> as one that followed the Lord heartily, ſaith in the Hebrew, <hi>He fulfilled to go after the Lord,</hi> Deut. 1.36. that denoteth his whole heart was in it. Now there muſt be a three-fold fulneſſe in the work of the Lord:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A fulneſſe of the Subject.</hi> The united ſtrength of the heart muſt be joyned together; not to ſerve God with diſtractions, an heart for him, and an heart for the creature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>A fulneſſe of the Object</hi>; every work of the Lord. They are to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for every good work. You read of many that did many good things, <hi>Joaſh, Amaſiah, Herod,</hi> but becauſe they were not fully for every good work, they loſt this reward. Now of all works, thoſe that do more immediately relate to God, to the Goſpel, his truth, any work looking this way will be rewarded Hence a <hi>Cup of cold water given to a Prophet in the name of a Prophet,</hi> Mat. 10.41. in reference to this work, <hi>ſhall have a Prophets reward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And laſtly, <hi>Fulneſſe of degree. They are to abound in the work of the Lord</hi>; to adde one grace to another, to be rich in faith and other graces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Will a good work thus circumſtantiated be ſure to be rewarded? Then take heed of two contraries to this work of the Lord,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Of idleneſſe, unprofitableneſſe and unfruitfulneſſe.</hi> The way to Heaven is a way of labour, the work of faith, the labour of love, and the patience of hope, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. Every grace is laborious, and therefore we are commanded <hi>to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtraight gate,</hi> Luke 13.24. Oh ſet it down for a principle, ſuch a jolly, looſe and ſecure life, that I live, can never be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py! Chriſtianity is compared to <hi>running in a race,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.26, 27. <hi>to fighting and wreſtling; the ſubduing of ſinne, to mortifying and crucifying of the fleſh</hi>; What then will become of thy careleſneſſe, thy negligence? Oh fear, leſt God curſe thee, as the barren fig-tree, leſt he ſay, <hi>Caſt that unprofitable ſervant into everlaſting flames!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Take heed of the other contrary, upon which the greater wrath of God will fall, and that is, <hi>To do the Devils work.</hi> Our Saviour told the <hi>Phariſees, They are of the Devil, and his works they did,</hi> John 8.44. What were thoſe works? To oppoſe Chriſt in the Miniſtry, to rebell againſt that glorious light of the world? Men are poſſeſſed with the Devil in their ſouls, as well as in their bodies. Thus the Devil is ſaid <hi>to enter into Judas heart,</hi> and <hi>to fill Ananias heart</hi>; and when they are thus, then they only ſerve him, and fulfill his luſts. Lying,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101245:64"/>
that is the Devils work: Malicious oppoſing of godlineſs, and good men, that is the Devils work: Yea, all ſinne is in ſome ſenſe the work of the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. Therefore Chriſt is ſaid, to <hi>come into the world, to diſſolve the works of the Devil.</hi> Take heed then, leſt while thou ſhare with him in his works, that thou do alſo in his puniſhments: L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſt it be ſaid, <hi>Depart into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels</hi>; as alſo, <hi>his fellow workers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having conſidered what the <hi>work is,</hi> now let us conſider and admire at the <hi>Reward</hi>: And before we come to ſhew <hi>what</hi> Reward it is, take notice of a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi> or two.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There is an <hi>Eſſential Reward</hi>; and that is, <hi>The enjoyment of God in full Aſſurance and Delight.</hi> This, all that work for God are ſure to have. All that are made happy, have the ſame God, and the ſame Chriſt. They all agree in this. The dwarf and the gyant are both equall in this, as the Apple of the eye in a Child, as well as in a grown man, is able to ſee the ſame great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is an <hi>Accidental Reward</hi>; and that is, <hi>Some Degrees of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>: Becauſe of greater labour and ſufferings for Chriſt, one may partake of more Glory then another. For, though all the glorified Saints are compared to Stars, yet as one Star differeth from another in Glory; ſo it's here. In Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, all the godly are equall, though ſome men have more ſinnes pardoned then others; yet, the acceptation of them through Chriſt, is equall. So that intenſively, though not extenſively, all are alike juſtified. But in ſalvation, there are <hi>Thrones</hi> prepared for ſome above others. Neither in that ambitious Petition of the Mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> Children did our Saviour deny, there were chiefer places then other in his Kingdom, but he rebuked their carnal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions about ſuch things, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.33. Thus you have a Prophets Reward ſpoken of as a greater Reward then others, becauſe of their choice work for God; and the manifold contradictions they endure from ſinners, becauſe of their labour.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It's lawfull to encourage a mans ſelf in working for God, by this, that there is a Reward.</hi> There is a lawfull ſelf-ſeeking, <hi>viz.</hi> of immortality,<note place="margin">A lawfull ſelf-ſeeking.</note> and honour and glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. This is good to be obſerved, becauſe ſome tender people have been much troubled, as if they were gone no further then hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, becauſe they find ſuch deſires of Heaven and Glory, moving them in their duties. Oh! they think this is to ſerve God for their own ends! Did not Chriſt live and die for me, though he got nothing by me, and why ſhould not I for him? Now, two things we ſay to this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It's true, in every godly man, there is ſuch an ingenuous Principle of grace in him, that he loveth God and Chriſt for their own ſakes. Though there were no Heaven, no Hell, yet ſuch is his ſpiritual conſtitution, that he cannot but love God, and hate ſinne. The reaſon is, becauſe he is made a new Creature, hath a Divine nature: And that is, a ſpontaneous, free, and willing principle to what is holy, without any outward motives. As a dutifull Child loveth his Father (though poor,) though he hath no Inheritance to give him. As the Mother loveth her Child, and takes all that care about it, from an inward <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, when there is no hope of a reward. Hence the motions of grace are compared to <hi>thirſting</hi> and <hi>hungering.</hi> Now, you know,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> we do not uſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a reward to an hungry man, if he will eat. And thus you may ſee <hi>David</hi> often in thoſe pure ſtrains of love and longing after God, making him the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his delight, he loveth God, that he may love him more: And, he loveth him, becauſe he loveth him. If he ſaid of humane love, that it was a <hi>neſcio quid,</hi> burning in a mans breaſt; it's true of Divine love. But yet</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's lawfull for all this to ſtirre up a mans heart to this duty, becauſe of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101245:65"/>
glorious Reward God hath promiſed, both by <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Example. Precept</hi>: For in ſeveral places, the Scripture exhorteth to our duty; <hi>Becauſe our work will not be in vain,</hi> 1 Cor. 15 <hi>ult. We judge theſe afflictions light</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>while we behold the things that are not ſeen,</hi> 2 Cor 4. <hi>ult.</hi> Chriſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Diſciples the glory of Heaven, that thereby they might not be diſcouraged in doing or ſuffering for him. Now the Word of God, muſt ſtirre up an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull coveting in the heart, if ſeeking thus for eternal Glory were a ſinne. And then, we have the <hi>Example</hi> of Chriſt himſelf; He in all his Sufferings, had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus on the contrary, Faith and other Graces, they are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with joy in the holy Ghoſt. When a man keeps a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man, he hath a continual Feaſt, better then <hi>Dives,</hi> he fareth diliciouſly every day. <hi>Pindar,</hi> a very Heathen Poet, called a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>The ſweet Nurſe in old age</hi>; yea, in young age and all ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not but that the godly themſelves, may be many times in great trouble of ſpirit: You ſee <hi>David</hi> often crying out upon his <hi>ſoul,</hi> becauſe it was ſo <hi>caſt down,</hi> and calling upon himſelf to <hi>truſt in God.</hi> But this diſquietneſs in the godly, is cauſed partly by

their own fault, and partly by the Devil; he <hi>is a roaring Lyon,</hi> he diſquiets their peace, though God indeed ſuffer him, for his wiſe ends; as you ſee it was to <hi>Job.</hi> Oh then, that you would alwaies be doing Gods work! If you did but know how comfortable, and how ſweet it is above the labour for worldly things, your hearts would be enamoured with it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>When we do Gods work, he further rewards with more ſpiritual ſtrength, and enlargeth our Abilities; ſo that the more we work for God, the more we may.</hi>Thus in the Parable, <hi>He that had five, he gained ten,</hi> Luk. 19 16. <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given.</hi> And the promiſe is, That <hi>the godly ſhall not be faint or weary, but renew their ctrength like an Eagle,</hi> Iſa. 40.31. Yea, as they grow, ſo they ſhall perſevere and overcome, and be eſtabliſhed in what is good: Now this is a great Reward in a godly mans account, though the wicked regard it not. That they ſhall have more gracious ſtrength; that they ſhall grow up into further Communion with Chriſt; that their hearts and graces ſhall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Oh! How heartily doth the ſoul pray for theſe things, and grieve, when it finds a defect! Now, God hath promiſed this to thoſe that abour in his work.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>They are ſure to have Gods Protection and Preſence to ſupport them in all their labour.</hi> The Apoſtle cals it <hi>labour,</hi> and that which is <hi>accompanied with pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſe</hi>: And indeed, the whole work of grace is very troubleſome to fleſh and blood; their Combates and Conflicts within; and then very troubleſome to man without in the world, which makes the world hate and oppoſe them. Now then, the work of God being thus oppoſed within and without, did not God protect, did not he draw nigh with his ſupport, and deliver, or ſtrengthen; none were able to abide. Thus you ſee a three-fold encouragement the godly have to labour for the Lord, even in this life. Oh! Why then ſhould any be ſo diffident, as to think they ſhall loſe by God, that godlineſs will be an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to them! Do but be ſure, that thy work is Gods work, and thou doeſt it in Gods manner, and never fear the iſſue of things. <hi>God is not unrighteous</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to forget your ſufferings,</hi> Heb. 6.10. You read, that God <hi>put up all Davids teares into his bottle</hi>: As Chriſt would not have the leaſt frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bread loſt, ſo God will not let thee loſe one mite for him: Thou ſhalt never ſay, God hath hindered thee. When <hi>Abraham,</hi> for Gods glory, would take none of the King of <hi>Sodoms</hi> wealth, God preſently ſaid to him, <hi>I am thy exceeding great reward,</hi> Gen. 15.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, conſider <hi>What is the eternal Reward,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. In the life to come.</note> 
                        <hi>and how eye hath not ſeen, nor hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive.</hi> If the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi>'s ſpirit fainted within her, to ſee all the glory of <hi>Solomon,</hi> what then would it do, to behold all the glory of God, laid up for thoſe that love him! This is like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s waters, that riſe up higher and higher. God (by reaſon of the ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he hath over us, and becauſe we are his creatures, having all from him) might have commanded all our work and labour, and given us nothing when we had done; yea, he might have annhilated us immediately into our firſt nothing: for we were his ſervants, more then any can be ſervants to men: And our Saviour ſaith, What Maſter, though his Servant hath been at work, will bid him ſit down preſently, and not rather command him to wait on him? <hi>Doth he thank that ſervant after he hath done what is commanded,</hi> Luk. 17.9? Now then, if God (who might have given us no reward) ſhall yet out of his bounty give us a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, and that, not only in this life, but ſo glorious an one in the life to come: Here the ſoul may be amazed, and cry out, <hi>It's ſtreightned, It's ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> within it ſelf, not able to ſpeak of the bounleſs love of God! For, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how great a Reward it is.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>It is God himſelf,</hi> communicating his goodneſs,<note place="margin">The <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reward.</note> and comfort to him that hath done his work: <hi>Then ſhall we be with the Lord for ever.</hi> This is called <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101245:66"/>
of God</hi>; and, <hi>ſeeing him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. No longer <hi>as in a glaſs.</hi> It's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed, Whether formal Happineſs conſiſts in the acts of the underſtanding, as, <hi>knowing of God</hi>; or in the acts of the will, <hi>loving of him,</hi> and <hi>embracing of him</hi>: But we conclude, in both. So that this reward being God himſelf, as he told <hi>Abraham,</hi> it is infinite as he is, and as God himſelf is ineſtimable. <hi>Et tunc dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nè eum aeſtimans quando inaeſtimabilem dicimus, &amp; quicquid de Deo dici poteſt, eo ipſo eſt indignum, quia dici poteſt.</hi> Thus it is of the reward. The great mercy covenanted in the Promiſe, is, <hi>That God will be our God</hi>; and this is compleated in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>This reward lieth in the full glorification of the ſoul in all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, and body in all the parts thereof.</hi> The ſpirits of <hi>juſt men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12. There needs no more grace, no more holineſs; There is no more ſin or remorſe about it. It's like the higher Region, where no troubleſome meteor's are. Oh! What a bottomleſs ſubject is this! That thy <hi>underſtanding</hi> ſhould have no more darkneſs in it! Thy <hi>will,</hi> no more diſobedience in it! Thy <hi>heart,</hi> no more dulneſs or ſluggiſhneſs in it! Oh! you would think we were ſpeaking of ſome Platonical <hi>Idea,</hi> or metaphyſical abſtraction, and not of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity indeed: But yet the Scripture aſſures the godly of this Reward. And then for the body, it's made a glorious body; all vileneſs and loathſomeneſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: It's an immortal body: No more death, paines, or any diſtempers. This Honour will <hi>God</hi> put upon thoſe that labour for him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Eternity of this happineſs,</hi> that is aſtoniſhing alſo. <hi>We ſhall be with the Lord for ever,</hi> 1 Theſ 4.17. <hi>Come ye bleſſed, inherit everlaſting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Oh! Who would think much of the preſent ſervice or labour for God, when it will bring <hi>an eternal weight of Glory!</hi> Think what eternity is, if we poor mortals, that meaſure all things by time, can tell how to think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The fulneſs of this happineſs</hi>; an aggregation of all things that may make happy, either within or without. Therefore in the Scripture it's <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented</hi> by all thoſe things that are glorious in the world; a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> a <hi>Crown,</hi> a <hi>great Feaſt, Jeruſalem from above,</hi> is paved with all <hi>precious ſtones.</hi> This is only to lift up our hearts, and to ſay of all earthly glory, Alas, what is this to heavenly? If the taſte of this; if drops be ſo much, what then is the Ocean.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>vaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion</hi> that is between the <hi>work</hi> and the <hi>reward.</hi>
                        </note>Fifthly, Conſider <hi>the vaſt diſproportion of this, to thoſe works thou doſt for God.</hi> What equality is there between God and all thoſe glorious Priviledges, and thoſe duties thou doeſt? How can any plead merit or worth? Where can there be any truſting in our ſelves? Oh! you that think to be ſaved for your Prayers, Almſ-deeds, you know not what a great and glorious thing ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is! <hi>If a man ſhould have all the world given him for lifting up a ſtraw,</hi> it's no ſuch diſproportion as here is. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The one is <hi>infinite,</hi> and thou art a <hi>finite</hi> limited creature. <hi>The Angels are not found pure in his ſight,</hi> and what hope haſt thou?</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Thou haſt formerly been a <hi>ſervant</hi> to <hi>Satan,</hi> done his work; ſo that God might damn thee upon the old ſcore, though thou wert now able to do all things perfectly.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Whatſoever thou <hi>haſt</hi> done, is but thy <hi>duty:</hi> God need not reward thee, or might have beſtowed a leſs reward.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>All thou doeſt is but for a little time, that the little work thou haſt done for God, ſhould be rewarded to eternity.</hi> Here is matter of wonder: So that all theſe conſiderations ſhould teach deep humility. O wretched and fooliſh Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee! Thou faſteſt, thou prayeſt, and thinkeſt by this to be ſaved. O pray for eye-ſalve, to have thy eyes opened! Let this</p>

Oh when thou comeſt to enter into thy Maſters joy, thou wilt think, if it had been ten thouſand times more, it had been too little!</p>

                     <p>Firſt of all, The Apoſtle doth not here ſpeak of every particular man, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his converſion, as if we did work with God in that, by our own power and free-will.

                     <p>Neither in the ſecond place is the meaning, though of the Miniſters, <hi>As if they with God did work faith and repentance in the hearts of the hearers.</hi> No, the Apoſtle ſaid before, <hi>That God only gave the increaſe.

                     <p>In what ſence they are (you have heard) <hi>not</hi> by immediate producing of any ſpiritual effects, <hi>but</hi> by the external application of the Miniſtry to the people.

God in Creation did uſe no inſtruments at all.

Hence the Scripture doth ſo often attribute this mercy unto the preaching of the Word, yea and increaſe of grace afterwards.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place conſider, What Reaſons may be for this; Why God will uſe ſuch workers with him, he needeth not the parts or gifts of any.

When God delivered the Law himſelf, it was with ſuch terrour and majeſty, that they deſired, that God would not himſelf ſpeak any more to them; ſo that meer men would not be able to bear the immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the Divine Majeſty to them. Hence in the Old Teſtament, when any divine apparition was made; they preſently concluded, they ſhould die im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, <hi>Can any ſee God and live?</hi> Thus then it's Gods goodneſſe and love to appoint men of the ſame mould to be his meſſengers, to importune you in his ſtead.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101245:67"/>
This is more ſutable to you. As the Fowler catcheth many birds by one decoy, a bird of the ſame feather: or rather as the Apoſtle argueth concerning Chriſt, <hi>It became us to have ſuch an High-prieſt, that could be ſenſible of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and compaſſionate with us,</hi> Heb. 7. Thus it is here, it becometh us to have ſuch to bring us home unto God, that are affected with our eſtates, that have the ſame temptations in them, as other men. Hence the more <hi>experience,</hi> Gods Miniſters have of the work of <hi>grace,</hi> the <hi>temptations</hi> of Satan, the <hi>deceitfulneſſe</hi> of ſinne, the more fit they are to comfort others, or to deliver them out of ſnares. <hi>As face anſwereth face, ſo the heart of man anſwereth another, Prov.</hi> 27.19.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>He may do it to oblige us and tie us to his inſtituted means.</hi> It's a great caveat in the Scripture, and frequently urged, <hi>No man muſt follow the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of his own heart.</hi> And in the New Teſtament many Commands, <hi>To obey them that watch over them in the Lord, and to ſubmit to them for their workes ſake,</hi> Heb. 13. Thus alſo in the Sacrament, God, though he be not bound to them, he can work grace as he pleaſeth, yet he hath bound us. Therefore that no man might neglect or deſpiſe the Miniſtry, thinking, What needeth this prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, I may have grace by immediate revelations, God is not tied to theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals? Now God would prevent ſuch looſe principles, and bind us up to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted way, he will bind us, though he is not bound.</p>

The Scripture indeed commends to the Miniſters of God much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, much meekneſſe, and that they <hi>ſhould not Lord it over Gods heritage,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.3. But it's hard to diſcharge all miniſterial duties, eſpecially that of power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reproving of ſinne and Church-cenſures, and not to have this accounted pragmatical lordlineſſe.

For the Word is near you, and nigh unto you.</hi> Yea the Scripture maketh it a mercy, when we have men of our own tongue, and not a ſtrange one, that delivereth the Word unto us. Oh then, how ſpeechleſſe wilt thou be at the great day, when God ſhall arraign thee? Why haſt thou not left thy ſinnes! Why haſt thou not forſaken thy evil wayes? Did I not ſend Meſſengers of thy own fleſh and bloud? Did they not ſpeak in a tongue thou knoweſt and underſtoodeſt? Why then have ye been rebellious? Oh think of this! for there is no ſinne, that God will puniſh ſo ſeverely, as that his Meſſengers have come away doing no good to a people. God will one day make you know, what it is to have a labourer for him amongſt you, <hi>Then ſhall they know they had a Prophet among them,</hi> Ezek. 33.33.

Then, when in their own conſciences they ſhall be convinced: Oh we heard theſe things, we were told of theſe things, but rejected them!</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>God will hereby declare his power ſo much the more.</hi> For God to have labourers with him, doth not derogate from his power, but advanceth it the more; for when you ſee him work thoſe divine and admirable effects, by ſuch a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101245:68"/>
contemptible way in the judgment of fleſh and bloud, hereby God is the more ſet up. <hi>We have this treaſure in earthly veſſels, that the power may be of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> cals it, <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of preaching,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. that which is ſo <hi>mighty through God, to confound the great things, and wiſe things of the world,</hi> he cals it, <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of preaching,</hi> becauſe in carnal reaſon it is ſo, both in regard of the matter and the means, or meſſengers thereof. God could have immediately and ſuddenly deſtroyed <hi>Jericho</hi> with his command, but he would have them compaſſe the City ſeven times, and blow with Rams horns, and then the wals muſt fall down. Now Gods uſing ſuch unlikely means, made his power the more apparent, which made the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Our weapons are not carnal, but ſpiritual,</hi> but becauſe they are ſpiritual, may they not be deſpiſed? <hi>No, they are mighty to the caſting down of the ſtrong holds of ſinne, and whatſoever doth lift up it ſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5.</p>
                     <p>Now to this there needs one Caution to be added, <hi>viz. That this connexion between the labour of the Miniſter, and Gods working, is not natural, neceſſary and perpetual. Paul may plant, and Apollo may water, yet God give no increaſe.</hi> We may work, and yet neither the preſence or power of God be therein. It's not here as in the works of nature; there God hath made a perpetual and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Decree, where ſuch and ſuch cauſes work, he will alſo work; but this is not ſo. As for the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who will not acknowledge, that the Miniſtry, and Gods Spirit are ever divided; neither in the Sacraments, (Baptiſm for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) will allow a <hi>Baptiſmus externus,</hi> and <hi>internus,</hi> I know not how to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, much leſſe conſent to them.</p>
                     <p>Now if you ask, <hi>When may it fall out, that though the Miniſtry laboureth, yet God doth not work with it?</hi> I have ſpoken to this already; Reaſons may be on Gods part, the Miniſtrers and the peoples. I ſhall onely ſpeak to the hearers this two-fold duty, if they would have God work with us, if you would find the Lord in our Miniſtry, that howſoever it have no virtue or efficacy to others, yet it may have to you; do theſe two things,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Work with God in prayer, that he would work with the Miniſtry.</hi> Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual prayer is the firſt wheel that ſets all on going. Prayer is the <hi>key</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of a prayer, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Whatſoever God will do, he will do only to a praying people. It's like the Prophets arrow, if that be ſtuck not in the ground thrice, but often into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo often will it bring glorious effects. Now let this prayer be working two wayes:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the general, <hi>That God would ſet up ſpiritual labourers in every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> Our Saviour taught his Diſciples to pray, <hi>That God would ſend out la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into his harveſt,</hi> Matth. 9.38. Every particular Congregation without ſuch a worker with God, is like the world without a Sunne. Wo be to them that are thus alone.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Pray in particular, <hi>That Gods work by the Miniſters work may go home to thy heart.</hi> Be exceedingly afraid, that thy condition be not made like that of <hi>Sauls,</hi> whom God would not anſwer any kind of way. As <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſtruck the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> with <hi>Elijahs</hi> mantle, ſaying, <hi>Where is the God of Elijah?</hi> and preſently the waters did divide and give way, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.14. Do thou ſay, Oh where is that mighty God that wrought ſo with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and other ſervants of his!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed of ſuch ſinnes, as may provoke God, not to be with the Miniſtry.</hi> The word of God is not an hammer battering, is not a fire conſuming many times, becauſe of thy unthankfulneſs and rebellion. The <hi>Jews</hi> did ſo long ſin againſt God, that he forſook the Temple, and anſwered them no more there. Thus a people may quickly provoke God to leave the Ordinances, ſo that thou ſhalt find no benefit; no power in them, but even conſume in thy ſin.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Wonder not if the Miniſtry hath many times wrought ſuch powerfull effects</hi>; that the blind ſee, the poor are humbled, the lofty caſt down, and mens hearts changed, for God worketh with it.</p>

                     <p>The former part of this Text contained the deſcription of the Office of the Miniſters in the Church of God: <hi>They were labourers with God</hi>; This latter part deſcribeth the nature of <hi>the people, and the Church of God,</hi> in what ſuteable relation they ſtand in, <hi>viz. They are Gods husbandry, they are Gods building.</hi> Here is a two-fold Metaphor, and the firſt, that referreth to the compariſons the Apoſtle had uſed before, of <hi>watering</hi> and <hi>planting</hi>; Now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to this is Gods <hi>tillage:</hi> the latter, of <hi>building</hi> the Apoſtle proſecuteth in the following Verſes: Both theſe ſimilitudes tend to the ſame thing, yet they both have their peculiar ſignification likewiſe, and emphaſis. The firſt word <gap reason="foreign">

                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The power and goodneſs of God in making them ſo.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">What our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods <hi>huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry</hi> and <hi>building,</hi> joynt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly conſidered, implies.</note> A building is not of it ſelf; every body that ſeeth a houſe, preſently concludes the houſe did not make it ſelf; ſo if you ſee a field well husbanded, plowed, ſowed, and cloathed with goodly Corn, we all know, of it ſelf the earth would not do ſo: but rather its curſe is to bring forth briars, and thornes: So when you ſee a people leaving the ſinnes and ſuperſtitious Idolatry of the world, walking according to the rules revealed in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you muſt neceſſarily conclude, this men have not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they cannot have this by fleſh and blood. Hence God ſpeaking of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaid, <hi>He planted a Vine,</hi> Jer. 2.21. even as the pleaſant garden
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101245:69"/>
of <hi>Eden</hi> was planted at firſt. Thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaking not of our natural, but Church-Creation, ſaith, <hi>We are the ſheep of his paſture, he hath made us, and not we our ſelves,</hi> Pſal. 100 3. So then it is God that hath made us not only creatures, but a people believing in him, and worſhipping of him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It doth imply dominion and abſolute ſoveraignty over us.</hi> Even as the Maſter that buildeth the houſe, appointeth what cuſtomes and orders ſhall be in the houſe; the Husbandman appointeth what ſeed he pleaſeth for the ground, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>a Sonne over this houſe,</hi> whoſe houſe the godly are; he is there exalted above <hi>Moſes</hi> who was a faithfull ſervant in the houſe of God, and appointed what worſhip God commanded, but Chriſt was over the houſe, as well as over him that built it. This point is of great conſideration; for how durſt men in all ages have brought in ſuch ſuperſtition, ſuch hereſie, ſuch tyranny in the Church of God, if they had remembred there is but one Maſter in the houſe of God, one Law giver: All Officers are but ſervants, and not Maſters.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It denoteth propriety and intereſt that God hath a right to us, that we are his, and not our own.</hi> The houſe is the owners, he hath the propriety of it; and therefore the Scripture is not content with theſe ſimilitudes, but uſeth theſe that declare a ſweeter union, and nearer; as that of a wife to a husband, that of the body to the head: So that by this means, they who are indeed of this building, of this field; they are more happy then all others in the world, for God is in covenant with them. To them only God is their God, and they his people. And when the Pſalmiſt had ſpoken of all external felicity, ſaying, <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are the people that are in ſuch a caſe</hi>; he addeth, <hi>Yea, happy are the people whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 144.15. So then, we cannot name a greater Prerogative and Priviledge, then to be in ſuch a relation, all that God hath, is their's; his wiſdom, power, and goodneſs. Only by the way, take notice, that many are externally of this husbandry this building, that are not internally; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch have not the Promiſes made good to them in all reſpects. How hardly can we ſay of many people, <hi>They are Gods building</hi>? Yea, they are rather <hi>the Devils Den,</hi> and <hi>his Hell.</hi> (But more of this hereafter.)</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>It ſuppoſeth care, love, and protection:</hi> This floweth from the other. Propriety cauſeth care and love among men. What cares a man for another mans Field, another mans Corn, but he looketh to his own? He weedeth that, he fenceth that, he keepeth that from all violence: And this (certainly) ſhould encourage the godly in their conflict with ſinne. Oh! they complain of the weeds, thornes, that grow up in their heart, that choak the good ſeed; let them remember, they are Gods, as well as their own, and it belongs to him! It's for his honour and glory to have theſe thornes pulled up: It makes for Gods praiſe, that thy heart be a room ſwept and kept clear for him to lodge in. Oh! urge this in Prayer! O Lord, am I not thy husbandry? Is not my ſoul thy building? Why then lieth it thus ruinous? Why is it neglected by thee? It's not only my comfort, my happineſs, but thy glory and honour is intereſted in this.</p>
                     <p>Come we in the next place, to conſider the <hi>ſeveral ſimilitudes</hi>: And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Ye are Gods Husbandry.</hi> Take notice, that he doth not here ſpeak, of the inviſible and myſtical Church of Chriſt, but as they were <hi>a viſible Church at</hi> Corinth; <hi>As there was a viſible company of men, openly and publiquely profeſſing the Faith of Chriſt, and joyning together in an external Communion in holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</hi> Here is much in this, for it ſheweth how all our particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be; what manner of Societies, even ſuch as are Gods Husbandry, Gods Tillage, Building and Houſe. This is the great truth that people ſhould hearken after, that they walk worthy of ſuch glorious Titles and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:101245:69"/>This Relation of being Gods <hi>Husbandry,</hi> implieth ſomething <hi>on his part,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">What to be Gods Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. 1. On Gods part.</note> and many things <hi>on ours. On his part</hi>:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That he finds all people of themſelves like a barren wilderneſs, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs deſert.</hi> The Curſe upon the ground, is fulfilled in them, to <hi>bring forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but briers and thornes.</hi> All the things of grace and godlineſs, are not only above our natures, but contrary to them: Even as if a man ſhould ſee a piece of ground like the very rocks, that no Husbandry could ever do any good on it: The ſame are all people, when the Word comes at firſt to them. In other expreſſions it's called <hi>raiſing up Children to Abraham out of ſtones.</hi> And as wild beaſts delight to be in the wilderneſs, that is their habitation: Thus are all men till converted by the Word, ſo many wild beaſts carried away with bruitiſh luſts, in the wilderneſs of the world; which makes the Scripture compare them ſo often to ſuch things. Oh then, bewail the roughneſs and obſtinacy in thy heart to what is godly.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It ſuppoſeth that grace and godlineſs is wholly planted by God in their ſouls</hi>; for this floweth from the other. Seeing we are ſuch a barren wilderneſs, what fruit can ever be expected from us? All the fruit then, of righteouſneſs and godlineſs doth come wholly from him: We of our ſelves ſtand like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rotten fruitleſs trees, to be curſed by God, and cut down for the fire; but it's the grace of God, that works the beginnings and increaſe of all godlineſs in them. Marvell not then, if you ſee a people under the ſweeteſt and beſt ſeaſons of grace, to be yet barren and unprofitable; for this fruitfulneſs is only of God. Oh, we would wonder, that a people who know ſo much, who hear ſo much, that have clouds ſo often raining on them, ſhould yet be like ſo many ſtones and rocks! Oh, this is the wrath and judgment of God to be trembled under it! For he makes one to grow and not another; He cauſeth grace to ſpring up in one, and not another.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>This ſuppoſeth that God likewiſe giveth all the ſeaſons, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of growth and fruitfulneſs.</hi> As the Gardiner, he looketh to his times when he muſt water the Plants, leſt they die: The ſeaſon of the year helpeth to grow, as well as the nature of the ſoil: <hi>Annus non ager fructificat.</hi> Hence God when he is angry, he threatneth that he will command his clouds not to rain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.

                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>A willingneſs to have the Word of God prepare and wound our ſouls</hi>; even tearing our heart to pieces, that ſo the Word as ſeed, may fructifie. This is that the Scripture cals, <hi>plowing up the fallow ground,</hi> Jer. 4.3. That is, when the Law and Threatnings of the Word enter into our very bowels; is like the Plough, that makes deep furrows in the heart. Oh then, that the ſecure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and quiet heart, that hath thus many years layen quiet and at eaſe, feeling no grief nor trouble, may at laſt be wounded and cut aſſunder! This is not an acceptable pleaſing work to you, but very neceſſary it is: Could the ground be ſenſible, it would feel the plow making torments and rents in the bowels of it. Thus it is here; the Law of God, the Word of God, that comes like a two-edged ſword in thy bowels; that bloweth like a ſtrong tempeſt, and ſhakes thy ſinnes at the very root. Oh, expect not healing, and peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, till you have been thus diſquieted! Do not then quarrell at the Word of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101245:70"/>
God, but rather bleſs him for the power of it, when it changeth the whole face of a Congregation; filleth thee with many ſad and anxious thoughts; ſends thee home enquiring, <hi>Lord, what ſhall I do? What will become of me?</hi> The Pſalmiſt complains of wicked men, <hi>They made long furrows upon his back</hi>; but this is happy, when the <hi>word</hi> makes <hi>deep furrows</hi> in thy <hi>heart</hi>; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it's but ſowing upon the high-way, which comes to no good.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>This implieth that you ſhould anſwer the ſatisfaction of that Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, whoſe Husbandry you are.</hi> Who will bear that ground, which after much labour and coſt, brings forth no fruit at all? Now, God hath greatly complained of this, that <hi>when he looked for grapes, behold wild grapes</hi>; when he looked for righteouſneſs, behold Hemlock. Oh, this will confound you at the day of Judgment! This will be your condemnation. This you will never endure, that God hath cauſed his ſeed to be ſown, given you an excellent ſeed-time, precious ſeaſons of grace, but you for fruit, have brought forth briers. We read of Chriſt, that when he looked for fruit on a Fig-tree, and ſaw none, he curſed it for ever, although the Text ſaith, <hi>it was not the time,</hi> or <hi>ſeaſon for figs,</hi> Mat. 11.13. Oh then, with what a grievous Curſe, may God curſe thee, when the time and ſeaſon is of fruit, and thou haſt none! Oh, bethink your ſelves, how you ſhall anſwer God in this matter!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It ſuppoſeth a carefull improvement of all thoſe means which God uſeth for our ſpiritual good.</hi> If we be Gods Husbandry, we are patiently to receive, and fruitfully to improve whatſoever may make for our fruitfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>Now the meanes are of two ſorts, either <hi>eſſential,</hi> and intire and perfect; ſuch as the <hi>hearing</hi> of the Word, <hi>praying, godly Communion</hi>; or, <hi>accidentall</hi> and occaſional, ſuch as <hi>afflictions, troubles,</hi> and <hi>perſecutions.</hi> Even as the pruning of the Vine, the burning of the Ground makes it fruitfull; ſo all the troubles, calamities and miſeries, that God brings on his Husbandry, is to make them more fertile. They need a Winter as well as a Sommer. If thou then deſpiſeſt the Miniſtry; thou art careleſs under the means of grace, no wonder if thou art no better then Heathens, or Pagans, that live in the wilderneſs. Thou that art a tree planted by the River ſide, yet bringeſt forth no fruit, thy condemnation is near.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Conſider <hi>how neer ſuch a people are to utter ruine</hi>; while you are but neer it, there is ſome hope of ſcaping, if you ſeek out; who after all Gods Husbandry, are the ſame ignorant and prophane people ſtill. The Apoſtle is plain in this; <hi>The ground that often receives rain, and yet brings forth nothing but briers and thornes, is nigh unto curſing,</hi> Heb. 6.8. <hi>It is nigh,</hi> that is a mercy; but at laſt it will be actually curſed, and thrown in the fire. Thou that art a wicked man in Gods field, it will be worſe with thee then all the wicked men in the world, that are not Gods Church. Let there be a weed in a Corn-field or a Garden, it is ſure to be weeded up; whereas, if it had been in the Heath or high-way, it might have grown long enough. Oh, then ſay, it cannot be that I ſhould hold long with this wickedneſs in Gods field, his judgments will overtake me.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Gods houſe, or a Church,<note place="margin">Of Gods houſe.</note> is not properly the building made of timber and ſtones. When we call that place a Church, or the houſe of God, it is onely by a Trope, the perſons contained put for the place containing; and we can hardly in the New Teſtament find it ſo called; yea ſome learned men ſay not at all: to be ſure, there is but one place (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22) contended for, that Church is put for the place where believers meet. It is true, ſome other places are preſſed for this ſenſe, but with great conſtraint. But in our common ſpeech we call the material building a <hi>Church figuratively</hi>; as <hi>Civitas</hi> is ſometimes put for the place, whereas <hi>properly</hi> it ſignifieth the Community of men met together by ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way. So <hi>Synagogue</hi> doth properly ſignifie the company gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or their gathering together, though afterwards for the place, as in the Scriptures often. Thus cuſtome hath authorized it about the word <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now ſee what degeneration grew in time. The <hi>Material building,</hi> which they called the <hi>Church, the Houſe of God,</hi> they gave a relative ſanctity to; they made it <hi>holyer</hi> then other places, but a reall ſanctity, or perſonal holineſs of thoſe men, who indeed were the Church, and the Houſe of God, that they perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and deſtroyed. <hi>Iſidore Peluſiota,</hi> in an Epiſtle of his, ſpeaketh excellently to this purpoſe, reproving a Biſhop that adorned the Church-building with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and coſtly Ornaments, but perſecuted thoſe that were the Church indeed. The latter he calleth <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>s about holineſs in places. Gods Houſe, Gods Church, are the perſons and men that do outwardly profeſs his way, and live accordingly: <hi>Whoſe Houſe we are.</hi> Heb. 3 6. With thoſe God is preſent. Indeed 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. we read of a <hi>Temple,</hi> a great ſtately Houſe dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, with a relative holineſs, with Prayers that God would be preſent there; his eyes and his heart would be in that place. But to argue from that Temple, to our material Churches, it's very unſafe: [<q>It is true, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Made</hi>
                           <pb n="118" facs="tcp:101245:71"/>
(whoſe opinion about the relative holineſs of Churches in Goſpel times, is publiquely known) doth endeavour to anſwer this Argument thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That though we have not ſuch a command as the Jews had about the Temple for our Churches, yet by Analogy, ſuch a Jewiſh command will bind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

So then, they erre on one hand too rigidly, who think we may not call this material building, <hi>a Church</hi>: for, we may call it ſo, by a figure, which is ordinary about ſuch things. And they on the other hand, who take of their thoughts from minding the true Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and Houſe of God, by holineſs and purity of life, addicting themſelves to curious building, goodly Images, and external worſhip. But this occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally only. We ſee here, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of perſons, and not of places; and he ſaith, <hi>They are Gods building.</hi> All our particular Societies ſhould be of ſuch men for knowledge and godlineſs, that we may ſay they are Gods Houſe, not the Devils den.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>What</hi> Gods building, <hi>and</hi> our being his houſe <hi>implieth.</hi>
                        </note>Now this compariſon of <hi>building,</hi> ſuppoſeth theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That a people of themſelves, are nothing but ſo much rubbiſh and ſit fuel for Hell fire</hi>; and that it's God who makes them this glorious building; That as you ſee the Temple was built by excellent art; The trees in the forreſt, and the ſtones in the quarrey, could never have prepar'd themſelves, nor put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſo goodly a ſtructure: So it is here. Men by their own power, their own ability and ſtrength, could never become a fit habitation for the Lord to reſt in. We are not born but made the houſe and building of God: ſo that although by our birth and education we may have many Church-priveledges, being born of Chriſtian Parents; yet we have no ſaving priviledges, till God hath wrought ſomething upon every mans ſoul in particular, that it may be his faith, his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, his patience, and ſo indeed the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It implyeth that the matter of this building ſhould be ſound, precious, and ſubſtantial.</hi> The material Temple was built of the choiceſt ſtone, and moſt excellent timber; and the Apoſtle in this Chapter, ſuppoſeth this houſe to be built of gold and ſtone, and that the building of hay and ſtubble is very abſurd and dangerous: which although it be chiefly to be underſtood of the Doctrine, yet it hath ſome relation alſo to the perſons conſtituting a Church. It's the great Queſtion in this age, <hi>What is the matter of a Church? What perſons ought to be taken in, to conſtitute a Church?</hi> I ſhall not touch on that now. It is one thing to ſay, What ſhould be, and another thing, What the Scripture fore-tels will be. It's true, all that are of this building, ſhould be really and truly ſound both in Doctrine and life; and where any of heretical Doctrines, or prophane lives have got into this houſe, the Scripture commands ſuch to be caſt out, as being a diſhonour and a burden to the houſe: but yet it alſo fore-tels, that there will be tares among the wheat. That in this houſe there will be veſſels of honour and of diſhonour. But more of this anon. This is certain, we cannot ſufficiently lament to ſee the ruines of Gods houſe in this ſpiritual ſenſe. As they wept to ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the ſecond time built, becauſe it came ſo ſhort of the luſtre and glory, the former Temple had: So may we mourn exceedingly to ſee what our particular Congregations are, comparatively to primitive Inſtitutions, and the patern upon the Mount. Indeed this Church had ſome weeds; but how reſtleſſe is <hi>Paul</hi> to pull them out? Oh how deſirous, as he ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>to preſent them a pure Virgin to Chriſt,</hi> free from all falſe worſhip, and all foul tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! Oh that you would think of this, what ye ought to be! <hi>Holineſſe to the Lord,</hi> ſhould be writ on your hands, fore-heads, and whole converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It implieth the gracious preſence and power of God among his people.</hi>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:101245:71"/>
An houſe is the place, where a man dwels and continually reſides; and this is one great reaſon, why God uſeth this Metaphor to ſhew with what re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the Covenant of grace runnes from this, when the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. had ſhewed, <hi>That there ought to be no agreement between the Temple of God and Idols,</hi> he addeth, <hi>They are the Temple of the living God</hi>; and therefore what he inferreth, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people,</hi>

                        </gap>, As the Apoſtle to deſcribe the innate power of original ſinne ſaid, <hi>It dwelled in him.</hi> So it is here, God to deſcribe how intimate, familiar and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous his preſence is, ſaith, <hi>He will dwell in them.</hi> This particular then ſheweth, there are many in this houſe, that are not of this houſe; for how is Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and power manifeſted in them? Nay, doth not the Devil and ſinne diſcover themſelves dwelling in them? Do they manifeſt any thing but the blackneſſe of darkneſſe in their words and works? Glory not then of being in the houſe of God, if you find not the powerfull preſence of God in you; which is two wayes; by ſanctification and conſolation. In theſe two wayes God doth diſcover himſelf, he fils with grace, and conſolation, he ſanctifieth and comforts, <hi>They are in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>This houſe or building doth imply, God to be the Maſter therein, that he only may preſcribe the Laws and orders, what ſhall be done, and what not, he appoints every one his work, and his labour.</hi> All the Officers in the Church are but ſervants. None may take upon them to appoint what is to be believed? How God muſt be worſhipped? This is of great conſideration. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>more faithfull in this houſe, than Moſes in the former,</hi> Heb. 3. Hence came the neglect of all true Worſhip and piety, becauſe the orders and laws of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter are not followed. Come then and be afraid, thou that liveſt in prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and impiety, what Law, what order hath God for this in his houſe? His Houſe is an Houſe of Prayer: Ye are to be a praying people, but thou art a curſing and blaſpheming wretch: In his Houſe every veſſel was holy, but thou art a loathſome veſſel of all impiety and filthineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Here is this further in this <hi>building; It's not an ordinary building, but a ſacred and an holy one.</hi> Therefore (as you heard) they are called, <hi>The Temple of the living God.</hi> Now then, what an aſtoniſhing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this? Thoſe that are of this Houſe, muſt be ſeparated unto God, from all prophane and common things; even as the Temple might not be polluted by any common action. And hence is that phraſe, <hi>They are ſanctified</hi>; that is, they are made holy, by a peculiar dedication unto God. Therefore in that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17. when the Apoſtle had ſaid they were <hi>the Temple of the living God,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this Exhortation; <hi>Therefore come out from among them, and touch no unclean thing.</hi> Oh then, if you would be thought the Houſe and Temple of the Lord, conſider what <hi>Communion hath light with darkneſs</hi>! What <hi>agreement is there between Chriſt and Belial?</hi> Be not then forgetfull of this, when thou art tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted unto any groſſe impiety.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>It being an houſe, all within are ſervants, and ſo they are to do their Maſters worke, to live to him. Whatſoever you do, do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 31. All thoſe ſervants in the Parable, called for by the Maſter, and bid <hi>to merchandize till he came,</hi> Luke 19 12. And thoſe who have been eminent in Gods work, they have this title in a peculiar manner. Thus <hi>Moſes the ſervant of God,</hi> and <hi>Paul the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi> Now (alas) who thinketh of theſe things? Every man lives to himſelf, to his own eaſe, gain and advantage. We walk not as ſervants, who though they have gained never ſo much, yet ſay, this is none of ours, we may not do with it what we pleaſe, <hi>Servus non eſt perſona, ſedres,</hi> ſaith the Civil Law. Thus, this health, this wealth, theſe parts, this time is none of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

would this be for every one to think, I am ſet in this place, I am in this relation, I have theſe helpes to ſerve God with! This is my chiefe end.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>It ſuppoſeth Order and Government.</hi> The Church of God is an Houſe; now that hath domeſtical Laws. There are Oeconomicks as well as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks; it doth not deſerve the name of an houſe, where there is no body to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nor none to obey, but all do as they liſt. And muſt not this be much more in the ſpiritual houſe of God. <hi>Paul</hi> did rejoyce to ſee the Churches Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and her faith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. her Faith for Doctrine, her Order for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hence the Scripture ſpeaks of thoſe that govern, and thoſe that are to obey; and God who is not a God of confuſion, hath not left every man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and think, and maintain what he lift. Hence are thoſe ſpiritual cenſures, of reproving, admoniſhing and caſting out a man, <hi>Some walk diſorderly,</hi>

                        </gap>, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.11. it's an excellent word, it ſignifieth ſuch an exact order, as in an army, none may break his rank. Thus God hath ſet a ſpiritual order in his Church; ſome are eyes, ſome hands, ſome to preach, ſome to hear, ſome to rule, ſome to obey; and it's a monſter, and not a body, when every member would be an eye, every private man a publick Officer in the Church. This would be a <hi>Babel,</hi> and not Gods houſe.</p>

Are we not of the ſame houſe? <hi>How comely a thing is it to ſee brethren dwell together in unity?</hi> Pſal. 133.1, 2. It's compared to that <hi>precious ointment poured on Aaron.</hi> We reade in one Parable of ſome wicked ſervants, that were drunken, and did beat their fellow ſervants; but how ſevere will their Maſter be againſt ſuch? How much reſpect have Laws given to the material building, that none might quarrel or fight in the Church or Church-yard? Now it's a farre greater matter to have thoſe brawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and contentions in the ſpiritual houſe of God. The primitive Chriſtians were remarkable for all this, when they all had one heart, and one mind; If it be a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Chriſts body, then one member muſt not fight with another.</p>
                     <p>

Oh how unworthy are we of ſuch names! Know then that of all places, Gods judgement will firſt begin with his own people, <hi>Then judgement muſt begin at the houſe of God.</hi> Your condemnation will be greater than thoſe who never were dignified with ſuch titles. Study Reformation every one in his particular, leſt Chriſt take up a rod and whip to cleanſe his Temple. Certainly all our particular Congregations need much building, much reforming; this hath made ſo many ſad queſtions, Whether they may be called Churches, becauſe ſo many ignorant and prophane abound every where. Let us labour to take away theſe blemiſhes; woe be to thoſe that give theſe offences: you go on from one luſt to another, and never think what order God hath left to guide you by. What purity, zeal, mortification ought to be every where? To be like an heavenly orb full of glorious ſtars. What doth the prophane man, the liar, the proud man, the beaſtly drunkard in Gods houſe? A maſter of a family, that loveth God, and hath care of his own ſoul, will not let ſuch a perſon dwell in his own houſe; and do you think God will ſuffer it? So then look not only to your own ſins, as private perſons, but as ſervants in ſo many houſes. Pray for godly order, comely ſociety.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now becauſe the grace of God is <hi>two-fold,</hi> either of <hi>aſiſtance</hi> and common miniſtration in the ſervice of God, whereby we have <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi>; or, of <hi>Sanctification</hi> and holineſs: We ſhall have <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledging both.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>aſiſtance</hi> or gifts: So <hi>Paul, I laboured more then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. And ſpeaking in part of his Miniſterial imployment, he ſaith; <hi>We are not able of our ſelves to think a thought,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5.</p>
                     <p>And then for the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> whereby of a wretched ſinner, and open perſecuter, he became a faithfull and bold Diſciple of Chriſt. This he doth often enlarge upon, making it <hi>grace, free grace, riches of grace</hi>; yea, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary grace</hi>: that all the ages to come, might take notice of it. As then thou art affected with the ſenſe of thy ſinfulneſs and impotency, and art thereby prone to adore the fulneſs of Gods grace; ſo, thou maiſt have a diſcovery of the work of grace upon thy heart. It doth not only conſiſt in <hi>mortifying</hi> ſinne, in crucifiing of luſts, but in <hi>gratitude</hi> and thankfulneſs to his <hi>grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now when we ſay, <hi>a godly man acknowledgeth all to grace</hi>: Conſider,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>He doth it heartily, ſeriouſly</hi>: It cometh from his bowels:<note place="margin">The Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of praiſing Gods grace.</note> All within him, is called upon to <hi>bleſs God.</hi> What is a more formall and ordinary phraſe, then to ſay, <hi>I thank God? I bleſs God</hi>? But the gracious doing of it, is like fire in the bowels. Obſerve <hi>Paul Eph.</hi> 1. how copious and overflowing he is in bleſſing of God for his manifold graces to the godly? No fountain doth runne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore ſweetly, fully, and purely then he doth. Oh, his heart is an happy ſpring,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101245:73"/>
from whence comes ſuch <hi>Rivers of living water</hi>! And thus <hi>David</hi> his Pſalms, are the ſweet liquour running over, by the boyling, that the fire of his zeal doth make. He ſeemeth to be a Diſtillatory over the fire, droping ſweet and precious water. So then, to acknowledge grace, is a duty that poſſeſſeth the whole man, if ever his ſoul be in a transfiguration. If ever his heart be conſumed within him, it's in matter of the grace and favour of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>This acknowledgment is accompanied with a renouncing all his own works</hi>: His own ſtrength, his own duties, he doth not ſo much as think of them, nor mention them; Yea, he is afraid of them: He cryeth, <hi>Wo unto him,</hi> if grace be not ready to plead for him. Thus you have <hi>Paul</hi> running from his <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſpeaking worſe of them, then ſome do of their very ſinnes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. And why? Only to exalt the grace of God in Chriſt. That proud and arrogant Phariſee, he could thank God: <hi>I thank thee, I am no extortioner, nor ſuch a ſinner as this Publican,</hi> Luk. 18.81. You ſee, he could thank God, who yet truſted in his works, and expected Juſtification by them. Therefore then you thank God, when you have no inward ſecret confidence in your works; when you have no inward reſt upon the goodneſs of your heart, and your actions. I tell you, this is the ſecret poiſon that deſtroyeth many. If men are not Publicans, then they are commonly Phariſees. To be a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, is to live in ſome groſſe, notorious, and filthy ſinne. And if they are not ſuch, then how apt are men to be Phariſees? that is, to truſt in an external righteouſneſs, and outward conformity unto the Law of God. Now, <hi>this ſin</hi> is a very <hi>damnable one,</hi> becauſe <hi>it doth immediately oppoſe Chriſt in the whole work, and neceſſity of mediation.</hi> For, if ſo be <hi>thy actions, thy doings,</hi> be to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>conſiderable, what need is there of Chriſt?</hi> If <hi>thy teares can do away thy ſinne, what need is there of the blood of Chriſt?</hi> Oh, take heed then, of this inward confidence in thy ſelf! <hi>We are of the Circumciſion, who rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> Phil. 3.3. Our Saviour ſpoke a Parable againſt thoſe that <hi>truſted in their own righteouſneſs,</hi> Luk. 18. All godlineſs doth not lie in renouncing of thy luſts, and thy filthy ſinnes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of thy righteouſneſs and thy duties. Then thou art a pure and Evangelical and Goſpel Chriſtian, when thou goeſt out of this latter as well as the former.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>This acknowledging it muſt be from an inward ſenſe of our own ſinne and unworthineſs, how ill we have deſerved at Gods hand.</hi> No man can ever praiſe grace, that hath not felt the ſting of ſinne, the power of the Law. When <hi>Paul</hi> had diſcovered the ſpiritual and accurate nature of the Law; how impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it was to keep it; how grievous the Curſes are; this made him ſo much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie grace. Therefore all thoſe, that <hi>preach up free grace,</hi> and cry <hi>downe the preaching of the Law,</hi> and the <hi>convincing of men of their ſinne, in all the aggravations of it,</hi> do indeed <hi>deſtroy grace.</hi> None do eſteem the dead <hi>Serpent,</hi> but he that hath been ſtung with a <hi>live Serpent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>He muſt wholly and ſolely acknowledge grace.</hi> He muſt not give ſome piece to grace, and the reſt to his own free-will: He muſt not by grace, mean the outward manifeſtation and revelation of it, but the inward ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of it. <hi>Pelagius</hi> was an Heretique, that denyed grace, yet being often convinced by the Orthodox, at laſt he granted grace; and grace neceſſary for every good work: but all this while he called <hi>nature grace</hi>; or, <hi>the meer revelation of the Goſpel.</hi> And ſo now, the Arminians and Papiſts, they do exceedingly (in a ſeeming appearance) acknowledge grace, but when it comes to a ſecret ſcanning, it's but a <hi>partiall</hi> grace, not a <hi>totall</hi> grace. It's a grace that requireth thy free-will, as well as thy free-will grace. It was well ſaid of <hi>Bonaventure</hi> the Schoolman, <hi>That if a man muſt erre, it's
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101245:73"/>
better and ſafer erring in giving too much to grace, then too little.</hi> See then, thou detract not in the leaſt meaſure from grace, but give it both <hi>totum</hi> and <hi>tota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter,</hi> all and the whole.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>He muſt ſet up this grace of God in a Scripture way.</hi> Not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe godlineſs or holineſs, or to ſinne more ſecurely and boldly: This is not to acknowledge grace, but to abuſe grace. <hi>Shall we ſinne</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that grace may abound?</hi> (Rom. 6.1.) <hi>God forbid.</hi> See with what indignation and diſgrace he ſpeaks it, <hi>God forbid.</hi> Oh then, farre be thou from drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down ſuch deadly poiſon, as to think becauſe grace is free, thou art alſo freed from duty. There is ſuch a peſtilential corruption in mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that makes uſe of grace, to patronize ſinne: To harden and embolden a man in evil, becauſe God is gracious; Oh know, God is not gracious, but a conſuming fire to ſuch!</p>
                     <p>In the next place,<note place="margin">Why the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Gods grace.</note> conſider <hi>Why the godly are ſo ſenſible of Gods grace.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>This is the final Cauſe of all the good that God doth enable us unto:</hi> This is all he looks for. We cannot adde to God any more happineſs then he hath: We cannot make him more bleſſed: All that we can do, is to acknowledge his grace, to publiſh this to all the world. Thus <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>That we ſhould be to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi> And again: <hi>That we ſhould ſhew forth the power of him, who hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2 9. So then, it was a very heavy and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinne, if the people of God ſhould not abound and be diligent herein; for this is all God looks for: for this he made us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he converted thee, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened thy eyes, turned thy heart to him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Children of God are endowed with an ingenuous, free, and excellent ſpirit</hi>: Therefore they cannot but confeſs by whom it is they have obtained grace. If he ſaid of humane learning, <hi>Ingenuum eſt,</hi> It's an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous thing, to confeſs by whom thou haſt profited; How much more have the Children of God this ingenuity.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The reall ſting, ſmart, and danger they have been in, makes their heart full, and mouth full of the grace of God. Paul</hi> that was ſo neer Hels mouth, for him to be ſaved, all the world could not make him hold his tongue, but he muſt <hi>publiſh the grace of Chriſt.</hi> Men that have been in the deep, in the Whales belly, in the Lyons mouth, for theſe to be delivered, they muſt ſing of grace, ſpeak of grace, and plead for grace. Oh then, fear the leſs thy heart is affected with Gods grace, that the leſs it hath been affected with the greatneſs of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>They are an humble debaſed people in themſelves.</hi> They have low thoughts of all that they do: And therefore it is, that they are ſo precious with God. <hi>He dwels in the Heavens, and in the humble heart,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. <hi>Be ye cloathed with humility,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.5. That muſt be a <hi>garment all over us.</hi> And wherein is humility more ſeen, then in giving all to God?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>They muſt needs acknowledge grace, becauſe they have the experience, how hard it is to do any thing ſpiritualy, and upon heavenly grounds.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they are ever inabled thereunto, they cannot but exalt grace. Nothing is done graciouſly and acceptably unto God, unleſs it be from a ſanctified nature, and divine principle; and unleſs it be from a heavenly and divine motive, from God, and to God. Now natural men, never conſider the gracious doing of any thing, and therefore do not extol grace.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>To praiſe and exalt the grace of God, it's a very profitable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious duty alſo.</hi> It's two waies profitable.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It procures more grace and mercies from God.</hi> James 4.6. <hi>He giveth grace to the humble.</hi> The only way to have new mercies, is to acknowledge the grace of God for the mercies. It's an heatheniſh thing, <hi>to ſacrifice to our own nets, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101245:74"/>
our own power. Tully</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was a fooliſh thing, to thank God for our vertues, becauſe they were in our own power</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he was ignorant of the Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>This acknowledging of grace, will enlarge a man, and make a man more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ready in all the waies of God.</hi> It's like oyl to the wheele; It's like wings to the bird. Duties done with the ſpirit of praiſe and thankſgiving, have great life and vigour in them.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Scripture is the only foundation of our faith.</note>We will begin with the firſt, <hi>The foundation of our faith, or divine aſſent in matters of Religion.</hi> What is that which every man muſt build his faith upon? What is the foundation he muſt lay there? And that is <hi>the Word of God,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and written for our inſtruction in thoſe Canonical Books of the Scripture. When we come to believe the matters of our ſalvation; the <hi>ultimate motive</hi> into which all is to be reſolved, is, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>The word of God hath ſpoken it.</hi> It's not <hi>antiquity, univerſality,</hi> or the <hi>laws of the Land,</hi> or the <hi>tradition of our fathers,</hi> that is the warrantable foundation, but the <hi>Scripture</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> is commended for <hi>attending to the Scriptures, which are able to make him wiſe to ſalvation through faith,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.17, 18. So that although other things be required by way of helps and means, as prayer, interpretation of the Scripture, Gods aſſiſtance, the guidance of the Miniſtry; yet by way of a <hi>Foundation,</hi> or a <hi>Rule,</hi> that is the <hi>Scripture only.</hi> As God at firſt put all the light into the Sunne, and the Starres ſhine by a borrowed light from it: So God hath now put all ſupernatural light into the Scripture; and all guides are to ſhine by that. Hence it is ſo often compared to a <hi>light,</hi> and a <hi>lamp unto our feet</hi>; So that the Miniſters of the Word do then lay a good foundation, when in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrine, and truths to be believed, they build them on the Scripture, make them a Scripture-auditory, a people that dare not, that will not take any matter of faith, but upon Scripture-grounds. Thus thoſe <hi>Bereans</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for a noble and ingenuous people, that compared what <hi>Paul</hi> preached with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they then had, whether it was conſonant to them or no, <hi>Act.</hi> 17 11. So that that people, who know nothing of the Scripture, are not inſtructed by the Word, have not their faith, their Religion from it; all they offer to God is a Sacrifice without eyes, they do believe they know not what.</p>
                     <p>Now that the written word of God is the only foundation of our Chriſtian faith, appeareth by theſe Reaſons,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Reaſ. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note>Firſt, <hi>A Chriſtian faith ought to be a divine, ſupernatural faith, not a bare humane faith.</hi> Now nothing can be the ground of a divine faith, but a divine authority, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Argument ſuggeſted by God himſelf. Moſt men that call themſelves Chriſtians have no more than an humane faith in matters of Religion. They believe thus, becauſe their parents did ſo, becauſe the Laws of the Land compell them to do ſo. Thus they have no other grounds of faith, then the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Papiſts</hi> have for themſelves; but as <hi>copper</hi> is not gold, ſo neither is this humane faith, that holy and Chriſtian perſwaſion, which the Spirit of God through the Word works in man, becauſe revealed in the Word, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. They are commended, <hi>That they did not receive the Word preached, as the word of men, but as indeed the word of God,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.13. So that whoſoever hath an holy faith, he muſt have a divine perſwaſion for this, from the Authority of God; that as an humane faith is, becauſe humane authority ſpeaks it: ſo a divine faith, becauſe God revealeth it in the Scripture. But (alas) generally our people can no more look into theſe things, then an Owl in the dazelling Sun. How few are perſwaded of the true Doctrine of Chriſt from this Divine Authority, becauſe God hath ſaid thus, God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thus? Oh then believe no longer as <hi>men!</hi> Do not think, or ſpeak as <hi>men,</hi> but as thoſe who have God perſwading you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Reaſ. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note>Secondly, <hi>The Scriptures are only the foundation, becauſe they are the immediate verity or truth, coming from God, who is the firſt eſſential truth.</hi> They have not only a Divine Authority, but evident <hi>infallibility.</hi> As God himſelf is Truth, and is not like man, that may lie: So his Word is likewiſe Truth, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie, or deceive, as the writings of men. Therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. they are ſaid to be <hi>purer, than gold ſeven times refined.</hi> And it's ſaid, <hi>The Scripture that cannot lie,</hi> or cannot be broken, <hi>John</hi> 10.35. It's an heavy judgement to be delivered up in matters of ſalvation to believe a lie. It's the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual curſe that is threatned to thoſe of the Antichriſtian apoſtaſie, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:101245:75"/>
2.11. Now they muſt needs be thus puniſhed, that forſake the Scripture, and build upon other foundations. Seeing then the Scripture doth contain infallible truth onely, and not one <hi>iota,</hi> or <hi>tittle</hi> of that can fall to the ground, and in all other foundations that may be laid, there may be falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, errour, and grand Impoſtures: Let then thoſe hearers that are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to keep a good faith, walk by this Rule. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaid, <hi>Never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect good from that man, who is not ſearching of the Scriptures, attending to the Scriptures.</hi> It's an heavy grievous ſinne, that in your family, in your cloſets, you do no more acquaint your ſelves with the Bible. Take a Tree from the River ſide, and plant it in a wilderneſſe, what can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but a withering? And thus it is, if you take a man from the Scripture, his ſeeming faith, graces, godlineſſe will all preſently va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Scriptures onely are the foundation of faith, becauſe they are onely immutable and unmoveable.</hi> They abide alwayes the ſame, they are not ſubject to changes, to perturbations of affections, as men are. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils conſiſted of men carried by paſſions and intereſts. Even in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the four firſt Councils, there were great ſidings, great ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities particular intereſts and parties: and therefore unleſſe we had an unchangeable foundation, we muſt be mutable <hi>Camelions.</hi> Now the word of God, that is ſaid <hi>To abide for ever</hi>; whereas all <hi>fleſh is graſſe, and the glory thereof fadeth away,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.24, 25. It's called the <hi>eternal Goſpel, Revel.</hi> 14.6. So then, that which was three thouſand yeares agoe, is ſtill true, becauſe the Scriptures are ſtill the ſame. There is no new Bible, though there may be many new opinions, and new Sects. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the Government of a Nation by Lawes above the wils and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary reſolutions of men, becauſe Lawes are fixed and known. And ſo it is in the Church of God, that hath a known Law and Rule. Therefore it is an hainous errour, which the learned note in <hi>Cuſanus,</hi> though otherwiſe not a very bad man, in affirming,
<q>That the Scripture is to be interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Secundum currentem ſtatum Eccleſiae,</hi> according to the preſent courſe, and exigency of the Church; and therefore in ſome age thoſe things are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which in another are rejected.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Scripture is only to be laid for a foundation, becauſe this onely is ſtrong enough to ſupport and bear up in ſad hours of temptation, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times of perſecutions.</hi> Who would be cheated or diſtinguiſhed out of the Truth by ſubtil Hereticks, or ſcared and terrified by violent oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers? Therefore we had need be built upon ſuch a rock, that can endure all waves. How could the Martyrs have reſiſted to blood, had not they had Scripture-aſſurance? <hi>Luther</hi> had this temptation, <hi>Tune ſolus ſapis,</hi> &amp;c. and nothing but the Scripture confirmed him. Our Saviour quelled Satans temptations by arrows out of the Scripture quiver. When a man comes to die, may he not be aſſaulted about the truth of his faith, whether he die not in hereſie or damnable opinions, and nothing but the Scripture can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him?</p>
                     <p>Now for the matter of Doctrine to be believed,<note place="margin">Four rotten, weak and falſe foundations. 1. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church.</note> ſome men lay four rotten and weak foundations; others may be reduced to this.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that of the <hi>Papiſt, The Authority of the Church, and the Pope; being wholly ignorant themſelves, but reſting all on their Authority. Bellarmine</hi> doth not bluſh to expound that place, <hi>Behold I lay in Zion a foundation ſtone,</hi> ſecondarily to the Pope. Now although we grant, That the Miniſtry of the true Church is very uſefull and neceſſary, as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our faith, and the preſervation of it: In which ſenſe it's called, <hi>The pillar and ground of the Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. yet it is onely a Miniſtry,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101245:76"/>
not a Magiſtry. It's a political Pillar upon which Edicts uſe to hang for Declaration of the Magiſtrates will, not an Architectonical Pillar, that beares up the houſe. So that <hi>Auſtins</hi> ſpeech is true, <hi>I had not believed the Goſpel had not the Authority of the Church moved me,</hi> (viz.) <hi>by way of introduction and preparation.</hi> As the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did to the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> who at firſt believed, becauſe ſhe told them, but afterwards they believed for Chriſts own ſake. We do not believe in the Church, as we doe in the matter revealed in the Scripture. Therefore that ignorant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith, to believe what the Church ſaith, is not a Scripture-faith, faith of knowledge; beſides then, every member muſt believe according to that Church he is of, and ſeeing there are Churches againſt Churches, there ſhall alſo be faith againſt faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">2. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</note>The ſecond foundation men lay, is, <hi>The Authority of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</hi> This is a meer political faith. Many men have no other apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion about Religion, than the Laws of the Land, wherein they live. They matter not, whether true or falſe, whether acceptable to God, or conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Scripture, but this is commanded, and this they do. As <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid in his time,
<q>He obſerved that Worſhip of their gods, <hi>Non tanquam Diis grata,</hi> but <hi>legibus juſſa,</hi> not as acceptable to the gods, but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lawes.</q>
But the Apoſtles example is clean contrary; for they preached a faith to be believed, that was contradictory to that Religion, which was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by humane authority, and they reſolve thus, <hi>It's better to obey God than man,</hi> Act. 5 29.</p>

So the Jews, when they worſhipped <hi>Baal-Berith, Baal-Phegor,</hi> and <hi>Dagon,</hi> and <hi>Aſhtaroth,</hi> they did point blanck thwart the firſt Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods before me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Gods worſhip is corrupted, when we do indeed worſhip the true God, but not by ſuch means and wayes of worſhip as he hath appointed, but in ſuch a manner as we in our immaginations think beſt.</hi> This God often doth caution againſt, that they ſhould not go after the the <hi>imaginations of their own heart.</hi> Thus they ſet up <hi>groves</hi> and <hi>high places</hi>: Thus <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made a <hi>golden calf.</hi> They intended the ſolemn worſhip of the true God, but only they forſook the true manner of worſhip he had commanded.</p>

Men are prone to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent new wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note>Fourthly, There is a neceſſity of laying a good foundation, <hi>Becauſe our hearts do in nothing more preſumptuouſly work then in the worſhip of God.</hi> There is a ſecret delight and pleaſure men have to make a worſhip of their own, as Children have to make Babies. The Scripture fore ſeeth this, and therefore doth ſo often bid men take heed; and they muſt not <hi>follow their own hearts,</hi> and they muſt not go in the way <hi>they ſhall chooſe,</hi> and they muſt not do <hi>what ſeemeth good in their own eyes.</hi> Theſe ſtrict Prohibitions do ſuppoſe an itching inclination in men to make a worſhip of their own, and the ſeveral ages of the Church have given ſad experiences of this ſinne. The Church which had at firſt a ſimple, plain, and ſpiritual worſhip of God, became to abound more in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ceremonies then the Jews, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his time complained. If then it be ſo dangerous to erre about the worſhip of God, <hi>What is that ſure and stedfaſt Foundation</hi> which both Miniſters and people muſt build upon? And that is, <hi>Only the Command and Divine Inſtitution of God himſelf.</hi> I do not ſpeak of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> circumſtances, as time and place, but whatſoever is the <hi>eſſence</hi> or part of the worſhip of God; or the <hi>meanes</hi> thereof, that muſt have a poſitive Command, and a divine Inſtitution. The <hi>ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which forbids all kinds, or parts, or meanes of worſhip, which any man ſhall make to himſelf, doth thereby command that <hi>only</hi> which God hath appointed. So that as all that money is to be rejected as not currant, which hath not the legall ſuperſcription on it; ſo alſo all that worſhip is to be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſed, of which you cannot ſay, This the Lord requireth; This the Lord hath Commanded. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth to this purpoſe, apply a ſentence of <hi>Socrates: God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is to be worſhiped only in that manner as he himſelf willeth and appointeth.</hi> Oh, the purity of Ordinances that we ſhould have enjoyed! And how beautifull would the Tabernacle of the Lord have been, if this Foundation

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>There is expreſs Scripture to keep cloſe to Gods Commandement.</hi>

The <hi>right hand</hi> is, when men out of pretended zeal, and good intentions ſet up that which God hath not commanded. We are not then in our worſhip to offer a Sacrifice without eyes, which then we do, when we have not Gods Word a light to direct us: We are not to be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ke Sheep that follow thoſe that go before: <hi>Non quà cundum eſt, ſed quâ itur,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid. Hence thoſe Phariſees that were ſo diligent and officious in their invented worſhip, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in two or three words throweth it all down: <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi> And, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me,</hi> Mark. 11.7. See there is no worſhip, no ſervice of God, but thou muſt be able to anſwer this Queſtion, <hi>Who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it?

                        </gap>ties, this is the ſaddeſt, when thy Religion and Worſhip will be found an empty vain thing: It hath not advantaged thy ſoul: There is no reward laid up for it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Therefore muſt Gods Inſtitution be a foundation, <hi>Becauſe when we have to do with God, whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſinne,</hi> Rom. 14.23. There was a great diſpute in the Church about <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>not eating,</hi> about <hi>obſerving daies</hi> and <hi>not obſerving</hi>; ſome placed worſhip in <hi>that</hi> which others <hi>did not</hi>: Now among other things, what golden Rules doth the Apoſtle lay down, and this chiefly; <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſinne</hi>? Whatſoever is not of perſwaſion, that it's lawfull and acceptable to God, if I do it, it is a ſinne: And now, How can any man be perſwaded that is acceptable to God, which is not commanded by him, which is not his will? Had any man in the Old Teſtament, brought a dog or any other unclean be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſt to be ſacrificed, had not this been a great diſhonour to God? The head in every ſacrifice was to be thrown away, <hi>to ſhew</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>that mans own invention is not to be attended unto in the worſhip of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods Inſtitution and Command muſt be the foundation, otherwiſe all our worſhip would come from ignorance, and it would be endleſs.</hi> From <hi>ignorance,</hi> for the <hi>Word of God,</hi> that only is compared unto <hi>light</hi>; ſo that every one walketh in <hi>darkneſs</hi> that is not thus directed. Therefore <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. that woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who pleaded ſo carnaly for her falſe worſhip, <hi>Our fathers they worſhiped here, and art thou greater then our fathers?</hi> Our Saviour tels her, <hi>They worſhiped they did not know what.</hi> It was a worſhip they had no Command, no Inſtitution for, and ſo they did, they knew not what. As it would come from ignorance, ſo it would be an <hi>endleſs worſhip</hi>; for if we have not Gods Inſtitution, then every man may adde what he pleaſeth. As we ſee in Popery, what a multitude of Ceremonies are introduced, which they make worſhip of God? And by what reaſon they do theſe, they may bring in ten thouſand more: And it cannot be otherwiſe, if once you take away this ſure foundation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>To the true and right worſhip of God, there is a gracious Promiſe of preſence, acceptance, and bleſſing. I ſaid not to Jacob, ſeek my face in vain,</hi> Iſa. 45.19. Thus take up all the ſorts of worſhip, Prayer, and miniſtration
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101245:78"/>
of Sacraments, Preaching of the Word; theſe things (if done in Gods order) return full of precious mercies to thoſe that are imployed therein. Now if we are not conformable to this Command, we may never look for any Promiſe, for theſe two are alwaies joyned together. As in the old Teſtament God promiſed to anſwer by <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> ſuppoſe the High-Prieſt had taken two other <hi>ſtones,</hi> would the Lord have anſwered him? No: it was not according to his inſtitution. What a great breach did God make upon <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> becauſe God was not ſought in his <hi>due order,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.9. So then, as no man, or company of men can make a new <hi>Article</hi> of Faith, or can inſtitute a Sacrament, becauſe they cannot give the grace ſignified; ſo it's in matter of worſhip, they cannot appoint new worſhip.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>But you may ſay, <hi>Why ſhould it be ſuch a ſinne to worſhip God any way a man pleaſeth? And the more waies he multiplyeth the worſhip of God, may it not be the more acceptable to him? Do not men hereby ſhew their</hi> good affections, <hi>and</hi> zeal <hi>to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>m? Can a man worſhip him too much? Can we exceed in any way of worſhip of him? As we cannot love him too much, nor delight in him too much, ſo neither can we worſhip him too much?</hi> This doth ſatisfie ſome men in their multiplyed waies of worſhip.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>The Anſwer is this: <hi>There can be no exceſs in the formality of true and lawfull worſhip</hi>; ſo a man is to worſhip God <hi>wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> all his might,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi>; but in the <hi>matter of the worſhip there may be an exceſs</hi>: That is, a man may take up more means and parts of worſhip then God hath appointed, and ſo thereby there is a ſinfull exceſs: So that all thy good intentions, and zealous devotions, they have no acceptance with God; and whileſt thou thinkeſt to honour him, thou doeſt diſhonour him. Even a <hi>Platoniſt</hi> Philoſopher ſaid, <hi>That a ſuperſtitious man was Gods flatterer, not his friend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this is the rather to be obſerved, becauſe there are few whom the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God pleaſeth. Oh, that Text <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. <hi>My Father ſeeketh ſuch as worſhip him in ſpirit and truth,</hi> is worth the gold of <hi>Ophir</hi>! See all Chriſts Inſtitutions, the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, of the Lords Supper; though they be full of majeſty and gravity, yet alſo full of plainneſs and ſimplicity.</p>
                     <p>Now inſtead of this <hi>true foundation,</hi> there are three <hi>rotten ones.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The imagination of a mans heart</hi>: This God doth often and often <hi>forbid.</hi> Oh, it's not enough to ſay, Methinks this is very good worſhip; Methinks this is excellent! There muſt be more then a methinks.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>A deſire to ſatisfie and pleaſe the ſenſe.</hi> The Prophet cals them, <hi>Their goodly Images</hi>: As <hi>Eve</hi> ſaw the fruit, that it was comely, and good to eate: O miſerable deluſion! All worſhip of God is the exerciſe of thy faith, to draw out ſpiritual Meditations, not to pleaſe the eye. Yet all thoſe goodly Images, and curious Ornaments, were only to ſatisfie the eye.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Antiquity, Cuſtom, and tradition of Fathers. Auſtin</hi> complained much of this, <hi>Vah tibi flumen moris humani quis reſiſtet? Our father worſhipped here,</hi> ſaith the woman. That of <hi>Cyprians</hi> is commended, <hi>Antiquas mihi Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt ſaid he was truth, not Cuſtom,</hi> ſaith the Father. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument all Jews, Turks, and Heathens pleaded againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction.</hi> How neceſſary is it to be well ſetled in this foundation of Gods worſhip? Oh, where ſhall we find a ſpiritual people, that delight in the ſimple, pure, and plain Inſtitutions of Chriſt! That ſay, Hitherto I muſt go, and no further. That as the poſſeſſed party ſaid, <hi>Paul I know, and Peter I know; but who are you?</hi> Thus, this worſhip I know, and that I know; but who brought in this? Who appointed this?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:101245:78"/>
                        <hi>As a wiſe maſter-builder, I have laid the foundation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The third <hi>Foundation</hi> every faithfull Miniſter is to lay in the hearts of his <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> is for <hi>Comfort and Salvation.</hi> But this I ſhall reſerve, as more properly to be handled in <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>The laſt therefore I ſhall inſiſt on, is, <hi>The foundation for outward practice of holy actions.</hi> It's not enough to pray, to hear: It's not enough to exerciſe the acts of any grace; but we are ſtill to conſider upon what foundation theſe are built.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore, firſt, lay down the foundation of all <hi>practiſed holineſſe,</hi> then the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of this.</p>
                     <p>The foundation therefore of every good duty or work we do,<note place="margin">
                           <p>Of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
                           <p>The parts are, 1. It's dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, Gods Word.</p>
                        </note> hath theſe parts:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>There is a foundation by way of a Direction or Rule, to which every thing we do muſt be commenſurate, and by which it muſt be regulated, now that is the Word of God.</hi> For Gods word is not only a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> but of <hi>Manners.</hi> And as thou muſt be of no other Religion, than the Word directs to; ſo thou muſt do no <hi>other actions,</hi> or live any other life, than that guides thee too. Therefore when it's commended for a <hi>lamp,</hi> or a <hi>light,</hi> it is to a mans <hi>feet,</hi> that they do not <hi>ſlip</hi> or <hi>fall, By them thy ſervant is forewarned,</hi> Pſal. 19. <hi>And as many as walk by this Rule, peace on them,</hi> Gal. 6.16. So that we ſhall never come to doe any truly good action all our life time, unleſſe we do it according to this Rule; which doth not onely informe about the <hi>Duty,</hi> but the <hi>manner, end,</hi> and all other qualifications. So then whoſoever doth not <hi>pray,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks of praying: who doth not <hi>repent,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks of it, he faileth in a very foundation; he hath not laid, as yet, ſo much as an hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beginning for his ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond part of that foundation we muſt lay for the practice of holineſs,<note place="margin">2. The juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> is, <hi>The Juſtification and Reconciliation of our perſons with God through Chriſt.</hi> For till our perſons be thus accepted of, though we ſhould give our bodies to be burnt for the Truth of Chriſt, it would not be accepted of. Thus God <hi>had reſpect to Abel,</hi> and then to his <hi>offerings,</hi> Heb. 11. We are by faith to be <hi>planted</hi> in Chriſt, and then as his <hi>branches,</hi> we are able to bring forth <hi>fruit.</hi> Now this truth is very tranſcendent to our thoughts. Who doth not think it is in Divinity, as they ſpeak in moral Philoſophy, <hi>Juſt a agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ſumus juſti,</hi> by doing good actions we come to be made good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God? This is that dangerous Poſition which the Apoſtle doth ſo often oppoſe, ſhewing grace and works can never be brought together in the ſame ſubject. We muſt therefore in this matter wholly goe out of our own ſelves; we muſt attend to the acceptation of our perſons firſt, otherwiſe all our beſt workes are damnable and loathſome to God; we are ſtubble, and he is fire. Though the Papiſts thinks it hard Doctrine, yet it is ſure enough, that every man unjuſtified, doth ſinne and provoke God in every thing he doth.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Another foundation he muſt lay is,<note place="margin">3. A receiving power from Chriſt.</note> 
                        <hi>To receive power and ſtrength from Chriſt onely, both in the beginning and progreſſe of all good actions. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me ye can do nothing,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15. The branch ſeparated from the Vine is dried and withered. <hi>James</hi> 1.17. <hi>Every good and perfect gift, comes from God alone.</hi> As all light is from the Sunne; <hi>I can doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 4.13. He is the Head, and the Member receiveth all its vertue and power from it. So then, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thinketh to ſet upon any good work, by his own ability, is like <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> when his hair was cut off; alas thoſe <hi>Philiſtims</hi> of luſts are too ſtrong
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101245:79"/>
for him, he cannot goe out againſt thoſe <hi>Goliahs</hi> of temptations, but in the Name of the Lord. Now here is the ignorance of moſt people: they that ſhould not reſolve to ſay ſo much, as that they will go to this, or that place, <hi>unleſſe the Lord will.</hi> Thoſe that cannot adde <hi>a cubit unto their own ſtature,</hi> do yet think by their own ſtrength to work out their ſalvation. Oh know, thou haſt laid no ſure foundation, unleſſe all thy ſtrength and power be fetched from Chriſt! Thou art too weak a child to go, unleſſe he hold thee. Chriſt is the rock we muſt be built upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">4. A renewed and ſanctified nature.</note>Fourthly, The laſt part of this foundation is, <hi>A renewed and ſanctified Nature.</hi> And this is of great conſequence. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> though ſo great a Maſter in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and exact in the external obedience of the Law, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of this, did fundamentally erre in all his obedience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of all points, you ſee our Saviour chiefly inſiſts on this, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe a man be borne again,</hi> John 3. This was a very ſtrange paradox to him, and it's no leſſe to thouſands of people, who goe on in a formall cuſtomary road, they regard the worke done, the action it ſelf, but never the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the nature from whence it is to flow: Whereas this is all in all, <hi>Make the Tree good, and then the fruit will be good,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12 33, The Spring and Fountain muſt firſt be clean, ere the ſtreames be: The root ſweet, ere the fruit be. Why then art thou pleaſing thy ſelfe with the actions thou doeſt, when thou art in the old, polluted, defiled nature? <hi>Can men gather grapes of thornes, or figs of thiſtles?</hi> Let thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal actions be never ſo religious, ſo glorious, they are but like fine flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on the dunghill, or on a dead corpſe, there muſt be the inward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, the inward filthineſſe cured firſt. Oh that men had ears to hear this! Oh that God would give you underſtanding in this thing! For till the <hi>Old man be put off, and the New man put on,</hi> you are ſtill in your ſinnes; all that you do is fit fuell for Hell, none can deliver you from it, till there be a change. Thus unleſſe Miniſters and people beginne here, though they ſhould build of gold and precious ſtone, the foundation is but of <hi>hay and ſtubble,</hi> and that is worſt of all. And certainly, if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle make it ſo hard a thing to be ſaved, though a man doe lay a <hi>good foundation,</hi> if he build <hi>hay and ſtubble on it:</hi> How impoſſible will that mans ſalvation be, whoſe foundation is hay and ſtubble? Mark then, and conſider theſe things in your whole converſation: Let every good action have theſe four foundation ſtones under it: The Scripture to direct, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to accept through Chriſts merit, Chriſt to inable through his Spirit, and a renewed nature to ſanctifie. For, as it was with the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the gold in the Temple, <hi>The gold did not ſanctifie the Temple, but the Temple the gold:</hi> So it is here, our actions, our duties doe not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies us, do not juſtifie us, but theſe priviledges ſanctifie and juſtifie our actions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why we ſhould be carefull of <hi>laying theſe foundations</hi> for every good <hi>action.</hi>
                        </note>Now let us conſider, Why we are to be carefull about laying this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it's very dangerous, and it's very eaſie to miſcarry in this matter</hi> As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid about the Trinity,
<q>That in any matter, <hi>Nec faciliùs, nec periculoſiùs erratur.</hi>
                        </q>
Thus it is here, Not more dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe eternal life and death is more immediately concerned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The welfare of thy immortal ſoul ſhould be more unto thee, than all the world, <hi>and that is in thy actions:</hi> If the foundation be not well laid, thou art undone for ever. In matters of mens eſtates, or of their bodily life, how carefull are they to go upon a ſure foundation? Only they wilfully ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their ruine in the matters of their ſoule. Thou wouldſt be unwilling to live in an houſe, whoſe foundation was rotten, thou wouldſt feare the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101245:79"/>
falling of it about thy eares every hour. Oh but what feare and tremble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould ſeize upon thee, leſt all the good thou haſt promiſed thy ſelfe in thy ſoules way, ſhould fall to the ground for want of a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Conſider then, Am I in the right? <hi>Timor facit conſiliativum,</hi> Fear would make thee jealous and ſuſpicious. As we erre dangerouſly; ſo here</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>We miſtake eaſily.</hi> We ſee the greateſt part of Chriſtians ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attend to theſe things. And withall the difference between true and falſe foundations is ſpiritually to be diſcerned. Now the blinde man doth eaſily ſwallow any flie. The hypocrites foundation, and the true godly mans are very much alike; and without much prayer, humiliation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, we cannot practically diſcerne the difference. Oh then ſay, I do the outward works of Religion, I am carefull to diſcharge them! But how eaſie may I build all upon a falſe foundation? The Parable our Saviour propounded of a <hi>wiſe builder,</hi> and a <hi>fooliſh one,</hi> ſhould alwayes ſtick upon you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. Did he ſpeak it in vain, you are all builders? And every one is either building a <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or a <hi>Babel. Apelles</hi> was ſo carefull in drawing his lines, becauſe he would <hi>pingere aeternitati,</hi> as he ſaid. All thy actions do build either to an eternity of miſery, or an eternity of happineſs. Be then in an holy trembling; every prayer, every word, every action hath influence to eternal life, or eternal torment.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore we muſt look to our foundation, becauſe of the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion that will be at laſt on thoſe, who have failed therein.</hi> Thus it was with the fooliſh builder, when the tempeſts aroſe his houſe fell, and the <hi>fall was great.</hi> It was terrible and dreadfull. He did not think ſo, he looked for a comfortable and quiet poſſeſſion, but it proved otherwiſe. So it is here: Thou haſt lived thus many yeares, thou haſt gone on in a cuſtomary way of religious duties, thou haſt performed them over and over again, but haſt never looked to a foundation. Oh the confuſion that will fill thy face, when at the Day of Judgement, God ſhall ſay for all thoſe duties, <hi>I know you not!</hi> When you ſhall ſee all theſe to be a broken Reed to truſt unto. Oh if men would but conſider afore-hand, what the agonies and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are, that will then fall upon them, they would conſider and ſearch, and never give over, till all be ſure! What confuſion was upon the fooliſh Virgins? How did they bewail their condition, running up and down, if there might be any hope? But all is too late.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Therefore lay a good foundation, <hi>For if this be wanting, thou doeſt nothing but ſinne in all thou doeſt.</hi> Not onely thoſe plain groſs acts of ſin, but all thy <hi>civil, natural,</hi> and <hi>religious actions,</hi> as coming from thee, are altogether ſinnes. <hi>To the unclean all things are unclean,</hi> Titus 1.13. <hi>Who can bring a cleane thing out of an uncleane?</hi> The bad Tree brings forth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bad fruit. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11. Oh then! How terrible is thy eſtate, who haſt not laid this foundation? Thou art damning thy ſelf all day long: Thy eating, thy drinking, thy waking, yea thy praying, thy hearing, as they come from thee, are ſinnes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. As the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>In the third place, let us take notice, <hi>What are thoſe weak,</hi>

                        <hi>and rotten founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that many men build upon in regard of their practice?</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>A conformity to the life of others; they do as moſt do, they ſhall ſpeed as well as they; what would ye have them to be ſingular, to be different from others?</hi> This is a moſt rotten foundation, which many ſupport themſelves
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101245:80"/>
with. Now the Scripture is expreſſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> Exod. 23.2. Doeſt thou not know, that the moſt are damned? And wilt thou do as the moſt? Take <hi>Lot</hi> for an example, he was but one man, and his righteous ſoul was ſo farre from conforming to them, that it was tormented with ſeeing and hearing their unrighteous deeds, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. Our Saviour tels his Diſciples, <hi>They muſt do ſome ſingular thing to the world, Mat.</hi> 6.47. <hi>Gratias ago Deo, quod dignus ſum, quod mundus oderit,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaid, I thank God, that I am worthy to be hated by the world.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Others build upon a partial practice of good things.</hi> The hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>Jews</hi> they reſted upon their Temple, their Sacrifices, their outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; in the mean while their hands were full of bloud, of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and injuſtice. So then, whoſoever builds his ſalvation upon his parts, his duties, his joyes, his enlargements, and doth not perform all the acts of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, truth and equity to men, this mans foundation is ſelf. Others they build upon their moral righteouſneſſe, and juſt converſation to men; they lie not, they defraud not, none can accuſe them of diſhoneſt dealing; but then for the religious duties of prayer, humiliation, and different walking to the world, there they exceedingly fail likewiſe. Theſe build on a rotten foundation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Anothrr rotten foundation is, <hi>The meer work done.</hi> They conſider no more than the external act of Religion, of Juſtice, of Charity, and ſo they think they have obeyed the Commandment, and kept the duty, if they have done this. This was the <hi>Phariſees</hi> foundation; But what woes doth Chriſt pronounce againſt them? He bids them look inward, cleanſe the heart, the fountain: And certainly, God being a Spirit, he will have all things done ſpiritually to him. This <hi>opus operatum</hi> is the foundation of moſt mens Religion, not attending to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereas it is a known ſaying, God loveth Adverbs better than Nouns; not what, but how is this and this done?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Another rotten foundation is, <hi>The goodneſſe, yea ſuppoſed perfection of the work they do:</hi> Eſpecially if men be poiſoned with Popiſh Doctrines about the ability to keep all the Commandments of God, and that what they do is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of ſalvation. Some Popiſh Interpreters do greedily catch at that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19 where <hi>rich men are exhorted to works of liberality, that thereby they may lay up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation.</hi> But by this good foundation is meant a certain and ſure happineſs, which is not merited by ſuch actions, but graciouſly promiſed as a reward. This is a moſt preſumptuous and arrogant foundation, thus to build upon thy own ſelf, and with the <hi>Phariſee</hi> to truſt in thy own righteouſneſs. How different was <hi>Paul</hi> from this? he laid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foundation, when he <hi>deſired to be found, not in his own righteouſneſs, but in that of Chriſts,</hi> Phil. 3.18. Now all this ariſeth from a great ignorance of that total and univerſal pollution of man by nature.</p>

                        </hi> to be awakened in this point. What is the foundation that you have laid for a godly life? How are all your duties and actions built? Are they founded upon Chriſt for ſtrength, upon Scripture for direction, upon juſtification for acceptance upon a ſanctified nature for the root of all? Then bleſſed, and thrice bleſſed art thou; bleſſed now in this life, but more at thy death, and the day of Judgment, when the condition of wicked men will be moſt curſed and miſerable. <hi>But to whom hath the Lord revealed this? Whoſe ear doth God open to underſtand this?</hi> Oh what a confuſion will it be, to ſee all thy Religion, all thy morality thrown into hell, for want of a ſure foundation? It's a matter of heavenly skill and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſo to do thy duties, as they ſhall eternally live with thee. What is a tree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a root in the midſt of a ſtorm? What is a ſhip without an anchor? The ſame art thou, who haſt no ſound bottom to ſtand upon. Think then, whether this Sermon may not make thee to begin all anew? Thou muſt pull down all thy old building, and raiſe up a new one.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It's not vain-glory, or ſelf conceit, but ſometimes a neceſſary duty to juſtifie themſelves and their Office; otherwiſe, the diſhonour would much redound to God, and danger be conveyed to mens ſouls.</p>
                     <p>To clear this, (though I intend to be brief in it) becauſe as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> that eloquent Authour. <hi>He praiſed eloquence to the Heavens, that he himſelf might be carried up with it.</hi> So people are apt to think what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſay in this caſe, they do it for their own ends. I ſhall only inſtance <hi>in what caſes they may do it, and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>; for he that doth it, had need be an <hi>Argus</hi> full of the eyes of wiſdom and prudence, the matter is ſo nice and obnoxious to ill interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

                        <note place="margin">In what caſes Miniſters may magnifie their Work and Office.</note> 
                        <hi>when falſe and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſlanders and calumnies are raiſed againſt them by the ingratitude of the world</hi>: When they deviſe all manner of evil, and lay it to their charge; here they are bound to preſerve their good name, and declare the good things they have done, and of what neceſſary uſe their Office is. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent mores ſuas odores, &amp; colores; odores in famâ, colores conſcientiâ.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's not enough that our conſciences be not black or pale through guilt, but that we be <hi>the ſweet ſavour of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes it, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.15. Now this cannot be, unleſſe they diſcover the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and weakneſſe of any unjuſt aſperſions. Thus Chriſt himſelf, when the Jewes talked of ſtoning him; <hi>For which of my good works do you ſtone me</hi>? John 10 32. And ſo the Miniſters of God may plead, Why are you become enemies and adverſaries? Is it becauſe we convince of ſinne? we inform of duty? we labour the eternal ſalvation of mens ſouls? In ſuch a caſe as this, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>When there ariſe falſe Teachers, that under specious and fair words would draw away their people to errours and falſehoods, it is then lawfull to juſtifie themſelves.</hi> This you ſhall obſerve very frequently in <hi>Paul.</hi> The ground of ſaying this in this Text, was, that the people might not regard other foundations then he had laid. And ſo in another place, eſpecially 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.22, 23. he doth at large reckon up both his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and alſo his indefatigable ſufferings for the Goſpel ſake, and is very copious in it; yet all this was no vain glory. Why? becauſe it
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101245:81"/>
was in oppoſition to falſe Teachers, who laboured to bring him into diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem; who endeavoured to repreſent <hi>Paul</hi> contemptible: And this makes him exalt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>When their is an undermining, or open endeavouring to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the very Office of the Miniſtry</hi>; to make it common. Herein alſo we ſee how men, farre from any pride and wild fire, have been zealouſly inflamed. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3. There ſome took upon them to invade the Prieſts Office: <hi>Ye take too much upon you; all the Congregation is holy as well as you: Wherefore lift you up your ſelves above the people of God.</hi> How did this fact provoke <hi>Moſes,</hi> that was the meekeſt man upon the earth, and farre from ſelf-ſeeking and revenge? <hi>If theſe men die a common death, the Lord hath not ſent me: And immediately the earth ſwallowed them up all, and all that appertained to them.</hi> Thoſe that did ſinfully ſtrive to be as high as others, God throweth them lower then others. They lifted up themſelves to Heaven, and he caſteth them lower then the earth. Hence the Apoſtle, <hi>Let a man account of us as the Miniſters and Stewards of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1. <hi>Let a man,</hi> he ſpeaketh indefinitely, though never ſo great a man, ſo learned a man, ſo gifted or gracious a man.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee there is a neceſſary cauſe of vindication, when the Office it ſelf is ſhaken.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In theſe two general Caſes, which may comprehend all the reſt, they may ſet up their <hi>work</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>When the glory of God is apparently concerned in their ſufferings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement,</hi> when it is plain that reproach and diſhonour will redound upon God himſelf; then it's no modeſty or humility to hold their tongue. And the Reaſon is, they are Embaſſadours and Meſſengers ſent by God. Now, whatſoever reproach and ſcorn is caſt upon them, redounds to him that ſent them. And</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>When there is an evident utility and profit for the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paul</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Epiſtles, ſpeaks ſo much about himſelf, not that he regarded applauſe, or had any carnal deſignes; no, he could <hi>appeal to God,</hi> and had the <hi>teſtimony of his Conſcience</hi>; but it was for the good of Believers, that they might not be <hi>ſeduced, or led aſide in damnable waies.</hi> So that it is for your good, and not ours, if theſe things be ſpoken off.</p>
                     <p>But now here are Cautions in ſuch ſelf-juſtification:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>We muſt attribute nothing to our ſelves, as of our ſelves. Paul</hi> in this very Text, ſpeaks of <hi>the grace of God</hi>: He is but the Trumpet, that ſounds not of it ſelf, but from the mouth that breatheth in it: He is but the Pen of the Writer: And therefore ſee how carefull he is in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, leſt any man ſhould <hi>think of him above what he ought to think,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.6 Oh, this is an admirable convincing way! When what we ſay, is ſtill with the acknowledgement of grace, and we are afraid men ſhould look to our parts, to our abilities, more then to Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It's ſo to be done, that it may plainly be ſeen, we ſeek not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny earthly greatneſs, or glory of our own, but only that Chriſt and his own way may be acknowledged.</hi> We ſee Chriſt himſelf, though he thought it no robbery to be equall with God, yet looking upon himſelf as ſent by the Father, he ſaith; <hi>I ſeek not my own glory,</hi> (Joh. 8.15.) <hi>but the glory of my Father that ſent me.</hi> Oh, admirable pattern for us to follow! And when <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpoken of this authority and power he had, and preſſed them ſo to walk, as that he might not come with a rod, and was afraid he ſhould come to them otherwiſe then they deſired, addeth; <hi>Though we be accounted as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,</hi> Cor. 1.2. Undervalue and deſpiſe us as you pleaſe, yet if you be holy,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101245:81"/>
and keep in the truth, I ſhall <hi>rejoyce in my debaſements.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>It muſt be neceſſarily, not voluntarily; even compelled to it.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had exalted his ſufferings, <hi>I ſpeak as a fool, you have complled me,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.11. Could he have done his duty without it, he would. Eſpecially you have a notable inſtance of <hi>Paul</hi>'s modeſty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. where being to relate ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Viſions and Revelations, ſee with what humility he doth it; you cannot tell whether it was <hi>Paul</hi> or no: <hi>I knew a man in Chriſt, above fourteen years ago.</hi> He had kept it ſilent all that while. Certainly by this we ſee, that whoſoever God giveth extraordinary diſpenſations, he fils the perſons with much modeſty: They do not boaſt of them: They do not deſpiſe others. And thus <hi>John</hi> the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, whereas the other, when they ſpeak of the Diſciple <hi>beloved by Chriſt,</hi> named him, <hi>John</hi> himſelf doth not, becauſe he was the man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtrustion to people.</hi> To take heed how the Devil or his Inſtruments ever ſeduce you, ſo as to contemn or withdraw from the faithfull and powerfull Miniſtry of the Word. No marvell the Devil aſſaults it, becauſe it is the only En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to batter down his Kingdom. <hi>I ſaw Satan fall from heaven like lightning,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, when he ſent his Diſciples to preach, <hi>Luk</hi> 10.18. Certainly, thou haſt never got good by it, or haſt forgot it, in that thou doeſt reject it. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth this Argument to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they ſhould remember the proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in him to themwards, <hi>was not weak, but mighty,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.3. And let not this happily take thee off: Thou heareſt no more then thou knoweſt already: I would come, if every day I might have new things, new queſtions, and new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. For what is this but to be weary of the old Bible, and to deſire a new. <hi>To write the ſame things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>to you, it's ſafe,</hi> Phil. 3 1. It's a ſafe and ſound way to hear the ſame neceſſary ſoul-ſaving things: for the affections are <hi>ſlow to receive,</hi> though the underſtanding be quick. You are not weary of the ſame ſun, though it riſe every day.</p>
                     <p>We proceed to the next particular in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Event</hi> or conſequent of <hi>Paul</hi>'s foundation, <hi>Another buildeth thereon.</hi> So then, <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles laid the foundation, in that they planted Churches at firſt; and all that are to come after, are only to build on that. They muſt not divulge any new ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Articles of Faith, we muſt reſt content with what is done by them already. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That people are not to expect that Miniſters ſhould bring any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine them what is laid by Chriſt and the Apoſtles already.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Religion is matter of Doctrine which we receive from the Scriptures, not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of invention, that we make of our own head. Thus even <hi>Timothy</hi> is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only to build upon, not to lay any foundation: <hi>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy charge,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.20 <hi>That good thing comitted to thy truſt.</hi> The neceſſary truths of ſalvation are <hi>depoſited</hi> in the Scripture, and committed to <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men.</hi> Now they muſt look they deliver the ſame: <hi>Aurum accepiſti, aurum redde,</hi> as <hi>Lyriuenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>To open this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſider, <hi>That the Apoſtles ſent by Chriſt, made it their buſineſs to inform in all things neceſſary to be believed and done.</hi> They declared the <hi>whole counſel</hi> of God by a lively voice, preaching to thoſe that lived in thoſe daies: It is true, they likewiſe informed of many other truths and duties in Religion, that were not fundamental; but ſtill whereſoever they came, they preached Faith in Chriſt, and Rpentance: Faith in Chriſt, that required the knowledg of things to be believed; and Repentance, that was about things to be done. And indeed, if the Apoſtles had not laid down all things neceſſary, their Commiſſion would have been very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and it would have redounded to Gods diſhonour to ſend ſuch fooliſh builders, that could not lay a <hi>ſound foundation.</hi> So that it is horrible preſumption for any to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101245:82"/>
think, that God hath revealed more to them then the Apoſtles. What the Apoſtles had not revealed to them as neceſſary, we are not to think it neceſſary. Therefore</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>When the Apoſtles were to leave the earth, and could no longer by a living voice commend thoſe neceſſary things to them, it pleaſed God, that what they had delivered by mouth, ſhould be commended to writing. Theſe things are written</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi>) <hi>that believing we might have eternal life.</hi> So then, the believing of things written is enough to <hi>bring eternal life,</hi> Joh. 20 31. And <hi>Timothy</hi> is commended, that <hi>from the youth up, he was acquainted with the Scriptures, which were able to make him wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. Since therefore the Apoſtles were taken into Heaven, the foundations that we have to build on, are the Scriptures only. Hence though Chriſt be here called the foundation, yet the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> alſo are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>foundation,</hi> Eph. 2.20. <hi>upon which Believers are built; viz.</hi> ſecondary foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. So that to expect neceſſary things beyond the Scripture, is as vain as to look for another Meſſiah with the Jews. He that cannot ſee with one ſun would not ſee with an hundred.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The uſe of Preaching not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the fulneſs of the Scripture.</note>3. <hi>Although the neceſſary foundations be thus laid, yet our preaching, and your hearing is not in vain</hi>; for there is this further work to be done.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Thoſe neceſſary things we are to explain more diſtinctly, and confirm more plainly, that ſo Faith may be the more ſetled.</hi> Neceſſary Principles of Religion, have many excellent concluſions latent in them; as fire lyeth in a ſtone, which doth not appear, but by ſtriking out. The Miniſtry therefore is, to explain, and diſtinctly to interprete theſe things. As the candle, though of it ſelf it hath light enough, yet unleſs put on a candleſtick, it cannot enlighten the whole room: ſo the Word of God, though it be full of light, yet there muſt be the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and application of it. Therefore they are commanded <hi>to divide the Word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.15. The bread muſt be broken and digeſted, elſe it cannot nouriſh. So that this building lyeth in the further explication of what is believed: We do not preach <hi>nova</hi> but <hi>novè,</hi> not new things, but in a new manner.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though we are only to build on this foundation, and no new thing be expected, yet matters of Religion may be ſaid to be <hi>new in themſelves,</hi> or <hi>unto us.</hi> In <hi>themſelves,</hi> and ſo certainly there can be no new thing preached; for as there cannot be a new Chriſt, or a new Scripture, ſo neither any new Faith: Yea, the Apoſtles and Chriſt himſelf, did not bring any new neceſſary matter of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to what the Patriarchs and Prophets had before. The Old Teſtament and the New are the ſame for the ſubſtance of Salvation, though there be new Rites, and new Sacraments, and a clear explication. But in the ſecond place, things may be <hi>new to us</hi>: As in Popery, when the reformed Divines firſt preached Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith, denyed the merit of works, as alſo the Pope to be head of the Church: Theſe were ſaid to bring a new Goſpel: but it was a ſlander, it was new only to men corrupted with errors, and living in ignorance, as the ſun is new to a man that was blind, but hath received his ſight.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>This building upon the foundation lyeth in the powerfull application of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truths, to the hearts and conſciencies of men.</hi> For the Scripture that ſpeaks ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, the Miniſtry that is to come particularly; that doth as <hi>Eliſha,</hi> laid himſelf upon the Child mouth to mouth, and body to body, that ſo life might be procured. To do by particular application of what is ſpoken generally in the Word, this is the Miniſtry.</p>

Oh, take heed of being weary of any point in Religion, becauſe thou knoweſt it already! There is a ſinfull itching both in Preachers and Hearers, many times in theſe things: As they were weary of the Manna, becauſe uſed to it. We are indeed to grow in knowledg and in light, both Perſons and Churches are to grow in a reformation; yet they muſt grow within the ſame kind, as a Child groweth in the parts of man-kind, he doth not degenerate into another nature.</p>

                     <p>Now the <hi>Object</hi> of this Exhortation is, <hi>To take heed what they build.</hi> To <hi>build</hi> after the foundation is laid, is the ſame with <hi>watering</hi> after <hi>planting.</hi> And it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a further continuation and illuſtration, explication and application, as alſo a clearer confirmation of that matter, which is already laid down by the Apoſtles.

                     <p>They are with much care, fear and trembling, to conſider, how they build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scriptures.

                     </p>
                     <p>To amplifie this conſider, <hi>There may be a two-fold building or ADDITION to the Word of God,</hi> either <hi>Deſtructive</hi> and <hi>Corruptive,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Why Miniſters muſt take heed how they build upon the true foundation. 1. On Gods part.</note>In the next place, Let us conſider, <hi>Why we ought ſo to take heed,</hi> and that is to be manifeſt in many reſpects:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>From God himſelf, his glory and honour is greatly concerned herein.</hi> For when we come in his Name, and pretend his Word, and indeed it is our own; What is this but an high offence to God? God doth ſeverely threaten thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that broached their own thoughts, and preached the lies of their own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, yet ſaid, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> It's no dallying matter; it's a matter wherein much <hi>prayer,</hi> much <hi>humility,</hi> and many <hi>graces</hi> are to be exerciſed, leſt we ſhould highly diſhonour God. Oh if this were written in mens hearts, they would be more tender and fearfull in delivering their opinions, in ſaying, This is the ſenſe, or that is the ſenſe. For when thou ſayeſt, This is the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, This is the truth of God, it behoveth thee again and again to conſider, leſt thou put thy lie, thy falſhood, thy ſinfull imagination on God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>On Gods part, we are to take heed, Becauſe he hath ſo ſeverely threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all thoſe that adde or detract to his Word.</hi> Any that ſhall alter theſe foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or change theſe bounds. If it be ſo hainous a matter among men to <hi>remove a land-mark,</hi> and to confound ſuch bounds, how much more here? That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not to <hi>adde or take away,</hi> is ſet home with a terrible threatning, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.18. <hi>If any ſhall adde, God ſhall adde unto him the plagues that are in this book.</hi> Oh ſee then, what thou delivereſt out of Scripture, as Gods word, for the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are threatned to ſuch as offend herein! And <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Adde not unto his words, leſt he reprove thee.</hi> Thou challengeſt any adverſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute thee, ſee here, God will confute thee, he will reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. Thou thinkeſt happily ſuch and ſuch an adverſary will reprove thee, take heed God doth not become thy enemy for ſuch an opinion. Oh then while we are preaching, and delivering our heavenly meſſage to you; we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a dreadfull account; we are to pray, and fear, and conſider leſt God find us liars, and reprove us at laſt.</p>

                        <note place="margin">2. On the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples part.</note>Secondly, <hi>On the peoples part.</hi> Therefore we ought greatly to take heed. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The word of God in the true ſenſe of it, is the onely food and nouriſhment of the ſoul.</hi> That onely doth nouriſh and cauſe to grow.

How great a crime is it to poiſon any fountain, where all people fetch their water? And thus all they do: and if it be not poiſon, yet it's but <hi>chaff.

All corrupt errours, though not fundamental, are called <hi>hay and ſtubble.</hi> It behoveth us therefore to take heed what we do, that we give you not gall for honey, poiſon for food. The Apoſtle compareth all Miniſters in himſelf to a <hi>tender nurſe,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2 now ſhe is carefull to give fit and convenient food to her child: Scripture-truths only can give nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p n="3">3.

No man naturally can love the Bible, in the true and heavenly ſenſe of it, (no more than a malefactour can his Judge), for that condemneth ſin, that convinceth of folly, that ſpareth not, that flattereth not. As the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not endure the light on <hi>Moſes</hi> his face, but they would have a veil on it: So neither are people able to receive the true and pure ſenſe of the Scripture; it is too glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, too ſpiritual, therefore they put a veil upon it. Hence you ſee how quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly errours and falſe doctrines, eſpecially ſuch which give licence to ſinne, get a multitude of diſciples. <hi>Paul</hi> complained of this, when he ſaid, <hi>They would ſuffer falſe teachers to abuſe them, to oppreſſe them,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.20.

                     <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>He is to be laid down as the only foundation, in reſpect of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and inſtruction.</hi> We are to preach and ſet up him, as the great Prophet and Teacher of his Church.

Hence he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of betimes, as the great Prophet <hi>whom God would raiſe up</hi> for his Church; and for this end he is ſo often called <hi>the Word,</hi> becauſe he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal unto us Gods will, and God from Heaven commanded <hi>all to hear him, Mat.</hi> 17.5. All the Prophets were the Prophets of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; all the Officers in the new Teſtament, are the Officers of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So that we are to declare that all people, who expect Inſtruction, Reformation, and any profit by the Miniſtry, muſt not build on man, but Chriſt. And this is the chief ſcope here.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101245:85"/>
No man may lay any other foundation: No man may ſet up any other Doctor or Teacher, <hi>viz.</hi> principal, but him; as is to be ſeen in the former Chapter. <hi>And that is the reaſon</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>why</hi> Paul <hi>doth ſo often name Jeſus Chriſt in that Chapter.</hi> And no marvell if he be the foundation, for none Teacheth as he, both objectively and ſubjectively. We all reveal the Object, and propound the Doctrine to your ears, though none did ſo objectively as he did; but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively none can teach as he: He giveth the underſtanding heart; he opens the eyes to ſee, and the ears to hear. Never therefore expect the powerfull effect of the Miniſtry, unleſs thou build on Chriſt more then the parts of a man. The abilities of the man, theſe are but like <hi>Gehazi</hi> with the Prophets ſtaff, they will not raiſe the dead Child, unleſs Chriſt come himſelf. It's true, we muſt not ſet up a teaching of Chriſt, in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the Miniſtry, as ſome did: They would have no Miniſtry at all, but expect to be taught by him; yet as we muſt neceſſarily uſe it, ſo it muſt be ſubordinate to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>We muſt preach Chriſt the foundation of all ſtrength and power, from whom we receive all ability to do any thing that is good.</hi> To lay free-will for a foundation; to preach up mans power, for Chriſts power, will be found <hi>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence Chriſt is compared to the <hi>Olive-tree,</hi> from whence we have all our <hi>fatneſs,</hi> Rom. 11. And he cals himſelf the <hi>life</hi> and the <hi>way, Joh.</hi> 11.25.

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt is preached as a foundation, when he is exalted in our Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iſtry, to be the head of the Church, and he that governeth all things.</hi> The head is for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and government, and alſo for lively influence and nouriſhment. And thus Chriſt is 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 1. to the 15. What divine and admirable exaltations are there of Chriſt, ſetting him up above all things, and making him the head of the Church, which is his body? Oh, the preaching of Chriſts Head-ſhip and ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is of great conſequence! There had never been ſuch bold preſumption, to be an univerſal head in the Church; never ſuch tyranical government therein; never ſuch Angel-worſhip, and invocation of Saints, and a thouſand of thoſe derrogatory Doctrines, had Chriſt been exalted as Head. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They brought in worſhip of Angels, becauſe they held not the Head,</hi> Col. 3.19 And that blaſphemous Doctrine, of making the Pope an head of the Church, though they would extenuate it, by calling him a <hi>miniſterial head,</hi> is a groſs invaſion of Chriſts right. Though <hi>Chriſt thought it no robbery to be equall with God,</hi> yet the Pope ought to think it robbery to be equall with Chriſt. Who then can excuſe <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> from <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> who is not afraid to apply that promſe of <hi>Eſay, Behold I lay in Zion a foundation ſtone,</hi> to the Pope, though ſecondarily? Look we then, that are Miniſters, and you that are people, <hi>To keep this Doctrine pure.</hi> Chriſt is the head of the Church: All direction and government muſt be from him: All vivificall influence into the Churches is by his ſpirit. So that as the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live or move without the ſoul, ſo neither can the Churches of Chriſt ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101245:85"/>
move, without life received from him. The Scripture doth often delight to uſe this ſimilitude.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Chriſt is to be ſet up the only foundation, in reſpect of mediation and interceſſion with God.</hi> We can have no approach to God without him, becauſe of the great gulf ſin hath raiſed between him and us. <hi>He is a conſuming fire,</hi> and we are <hi>ſtubble,</hi> without Chriſt. Concerning <hi>Deus Abſolutus,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> would ſay, <hi>The ſoul of a man may not think of him without horrour, or deſpair; but as he is</hi> Deus relatus, <hi>related to us in Chriſt.</hi> And this is (indeed) the primary, and the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſetting up of Chriſt as the foundation, when we again and again inſtruct you of what diſtance and contrariety there is between God and a ſinner; and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his mediation there can be an agreement. <hi>There is one Mediator,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. No man may, can, dare, to draw nigh to God, or think of him, without this Mediatour. Oh, but how practically ignorant are people of Chriſt herein! They do not go to God in Chriſts Name: They do not deſire, by Faith to bring Chriſt (as it were) into Gods preſence, that he may behold us in him; that we may be <hi>Jacobs</hi> in our eldeſt Brothers cloaths. As <hi>Joah</hi> bid the Meſſenger tell <hi>David,</hi> when his anger ſhould riſe, becauſe they had the worſe in battell, that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah is ſlain</hi>; and this quieted <hi>David.</hi> So it's here: When the wrath of God ſhall be ready to ariſe againſt thee, <hi>Why haſt thou b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oken this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Why haſt thou traſgreſſed this Law?</hi> Then ſay, <hi>Chriſt was killed: Chriſt was the Lamb ſlain.</hi> And this will appeaſe the wrath of God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.1. Chriſt is there deſcribed with a <hi>rainbow</hi> upon his head, very fitly. As God ſaid, <hi>He would not drown the world any more, but look upon the rainbow,</hi> and remember that <hi>Covenant of mercy</hi>: So it's here; God will not damn the poor ſinner repenting and believing, but he will remember this rainbow; he will look on Chriſt. Now this preaching of Chriſt, hath been wonderfully obſcured in ſetting up other Mediatours, other Interceſſours; ſo that Chriſt was ſeldom ſpoken of, but the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Francis,</hi> and others. And this very point was the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of coming out of Popery, The obſcuring of Chriſts Mediatourſhip. They equalized St <hi>Francis</hi> to Chriſt: They (indeed) ſaid, the way to Heaven was by Chriſt, but it was <hi>eaſier</hi> by St <hi>Francis.</hi> So that if you look upon the Doctrine of other Mediatours, about the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; about their Canonized Saints; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Images; about Indulgences Oh, the black clouds that were drawn over that glorious Sunne of righteouſneſs! Let then Miniſters and people keep to this; look to this: For without it, all the marrow of Religion is loſt. Only by Chriſt his mediation with God. God is an enemy to me, and I to God. And for this end were all thoſe Sacrifices appointed in the old adminiſtration, to ſhew, that by Chriſt was all reconcilement and atonement. <hi>Do not thou then think thy teares muſt do that, which belongs to Chriſts blood. Thy teares, thy humiliation, thy broken heart</hi> for ſinne, is indeed neceſſary; but to think by theſe to have a mediation with God, is to build another foundation then what the Apoſtles laid. And truly, if ſinne be rightly conſidered, in the infinite aggravation of it, we we muſt quickly yeeld, none but who is an infinite perſon, can be our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>From this floweth another neceſſary way of preaching Chriſt a foundation,</hi> viz. <hi>Of acceptation of our perſons and duties. Our Juſtification</hi> is built only on him, and all the ſweet ſavour that our <hi>duties</hi> have, is through him. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> doth frequently make Chriſt the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh, they would have better hearts, more fruitfull lives! and they complain and complain, but they do not make uſe of Chriſts ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for all their wants.

The ignorance, ſtubbornneſſe, and ſtupidity of moſt hearers, do call for the two-edged ſword to wound and cut, not for balm and oyl to be poured in their wounds. But yet certainly, this is our main work, to preach Chriſt in this his heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Although, to ſpeak properly, (as is to be ſhewed in time) to preach Chriſt, is to preach alſo all the duties, all the threatnings, all the Commands Chriſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. To preach Repentance, is to preach Chriſt; but we take it moſt ſtrictly in this place. Oh then, that our Auditories were ſuch, to whom Chriſt in all his glory might be diſplayed; ſuch as we might have into this Wine-celler every day; ſuch as might be invited to this Banquet, and heavenly Feaſt that the Goſpel hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. A people that know the the need of Chriſt; that deſire and thirſt after Chriſt: That ſay with the Church, <hi>I will hold him, and will not let him go. Bernard</hi> did not like to read <hi>Tully</hi>'s Works in all his eloquence, becauſe he did not find Chriſt there.

                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>He is to be preached as the Fountain of all the happineſs, joy, and ſpiritual content the godly hearer can have.</hi> We are to preach Chriſt as the center in whom all the lines of your hope, love, and deſire are to meet. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, <hi>I determined to know nothing but Chriſt crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2. The Greek words are comparative, <hi>Chriſt crucified rather then any thing elſe.</hi> There is no Doctrine, no Opinion; there is no outward or earthly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that I deſire to know, but Chriſt. And in many other places, you have <hi>Paul</hi> deſpiſing and renouncing all priviledges: To be <hi>a Jew, was nothing; Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, was nothing:</hi> To be <hi>an Apoſtle,</hi> to be <hi>a pure Roman</hi>; all theſe <hi>were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> with <hi>Paul, in reſpect of the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that Chriſt is compared to our <hi>King,</hi> to our <hi>Husband,</hi> to our <hi>Head</hi>; becauſe all our affections, deſires, and inclinations, ſhould be towards him. And this is ſo neceſſary a foundation, that <hi>no man can be Christs Diſciple,</hi> that doth not attain to this; that <hi>doth not hate Father, and Mother, and Children, for his ſake.</hi> Oh then, conſider, Where is thy joy, thy love? Upon whom is thy heart ſet? If it be on any thing but Chriſt, thou erreſt in the Foundation. Oh, but how hard a thing is it, thus to Diſciple our Auditours! Some have the world for Chriſt, ſome their luſt for Chriſt; and thus inſtead of building gold and precious Stones, they build dung and ſilth.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, <hi>Chriſt is to be preached as the perſon with whom we are to cloſe in all Ordinances.</hi> We are to look for Chriſt, and enjoy him in every Prayer, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ordinance. Any duty without Chriſt, is like the body without the ſoul; the ſhadow without the ſubſtance. <hi>Truly</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>our Communion and fellowſhip is with the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.3. Thus Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>come to us, and ſup with us</hi>: By which phraſes is implyed, that the heart of a man ſhould not reſt in any duty, and ſtay there, but go to Chriſt in it. As they that looked for Chriſts body, were not content to ſee the linen where his body lay, but did ſtill ſeek after him: It was not enough for the Church to be in the Garden where the Spices and Flowers did ſmell, unleſs ſhe found her Beloved there. And thus it's not enough to come to any duty, to pray, to hear, to draw nigh in any Ordinance, unleſs we meet with Chriſt himſelf. But to whom are theſe things known? Is it not with us as with little Children, they can take a Book, they look on it, turn over the leaves, but know not any of the ſenſe of it? Thus it is with many people, they come to pray, to hear, to the Ordinances; but to ſpeak of Chriſt enjoyed by them, to have ſpiritual Communion with Chriſt in them, is ſuch ſpiritual ſenſe, they underſtand not. That was the great ſinne of the Jews, they reſted in the Ordinances and duties of the Law, and never looked out to Chriſt: And againſt this the Apoſtle doth ſo vehemently diſpute. And thus we do with Ordinances of the Goſpel, people generally reſt in the external performance of them, and not on Chriſt in them; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>We are to preach Chriſt, not only as the foundation of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to God, but of all Gods gracious actions and viſitations to us.</hi> We are not only to come to God in Chriſts name, but to expect that God will come to us through Chriſt. <hi>God is in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.19. <hi>We are juſtified in Chriſt, and ſaved in Chriſt.</hi> All Gods gracious actions vouchſafed to us, are founded upon Chriſt as the meritorious cauſe of them. It's rue the indeed, <hi>predeſtination,</hi> though it be <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> for the accompliſhment of all our ſpiritual mercies, yet it was not <hi>for Chriſt.</hi> This the Orthodox do well maintain by Scripture, that Gods predeſtinating of us in the Original of it, is wholly from the ſovereign power, and good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God; yea, that Chriſt himſelf is the <hi>effect</hi> of Predeſtination, from that <hi>good pleaſure of his, he gave his Sonne for us.</hi> But then all the <hi>eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world did look to Chriſt, they typified him. <hi>Noah</hi> offered a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>God did ſmell a ſweet ſavour of reſt,</hi> Gen. 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>1. Alas, Could the material Sacrifice do that? God careth not for the Rammes and Bullocks upon the hils, it ſmels there offenſive; but it was becauſe of Chriſt. <hi>Burnt Offerings and Sacrifices thou wouldst not have, then ſaid I, Lord I come,</hi> Heb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10.9. All thoſe Rammes, thoſe Bullocks, thoſe Goats, they all did typifie a Chriſt. The people that then lived, ought not to think, that pardon of ſin could be had by ſhedding of their blood. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the Covenant of grace that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and renewed ſo many times, did relate to Chriſt, the <hi>ſeed</hi> in whom all Nations were to be made bleſſed. And it's good to conſider how, when the Church was in any great extremity, the Prophets would then comfort it about Chriſt. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. <hi>To us a Sonne is born.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. he doth as plainly propheſie Chriſts ſufferings, as the Evangeliſts relate it; inſomuch, that ſome have called <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the fifth Evangeliſt. And the Prophet <hi>Micha, He ſhall be our peace, when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into our land,</hi> Mich. 5.5. Thus then you ſee, that all the Old Teſtament doth wholly tend to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Chriſt; and as for the New Teſtament, that is wholly ſpent, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in relating the Hiſtory, or the gracious Effects of Chriſt; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning all Doctrines and Opinions that would ſet up any thing in Chriſts room.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:101245:87"/>Secondly, <hi>As the Scripture, ſo Gods great purpoſe and counſell from all eternity, was, to ſet up Chriſt, and to have him glorified.</hi> Therefore would God take ſuch a way, as that by his Sonne all mercy ſhould be obtained, that ſo all honour, glory, and praiſe, might be for ever given to him. Hence it is, that we read of God the Father ſometimes appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a glorious manner, and owning of him. <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> viz. <hi>with man kind,</hi> (Mat. 3.17.) <hi>hear him.</hi> It's diſputed among Divines, whether there could be any other way for our Redemption and Salvation, but by him; but who can tell, what God abſolutely may do, or not do? To be ſure, God hath determined on this way, as that wherein the glory of the Father, and of the Sonne, may be more magnified. If then God was pleaſed to have all glory gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Chriſt, and to have him ſet up in all things, it's a great Reaſon we ſhould honour him, whom God would have us honour.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>We muſt preach Chriſt the foundation, becauſe in him there is ſuch a Treaſure of the riches of Gods Grace, and Gods Love</hi>; that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, they were never ſatisfied with this point. How greatly the Angels were affected when Chriſt came into the world, there Hymne ſignifieth: As alſo how ſpeedy they were to be Evangeliſts, to bring glad tydings of a Chriſt. <hi>Glory be to God on high, in earth peace, and good will to men,</hi> Luke 2.14. This Song is the foundation of all Religion and Comfort. Yea, <hi>The Angels</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12.) <hi>deſire to ſearch into this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery:</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to <hi>ſtoop down,</hi> as they did to look into the Sepulchre, or as men do to behold themſelves in a Glaſs. If therefore the Angels, ſuch pure and heavenly ſubſtances, be ſo affected with this way and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, how much more we? For we need him more then they. Some Divines indeed, ſay, <hi>The Angels needed Chriſt to confirm them</hi>: And in this ſenſe, he is their Head; but a Mediatour of an atonement, he was not unto them as he is to us. Conſider that place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10. By the Church and the Miniſtery thereof, the manifold wiſdome and riches of Gods grace in Chriſt, are made known. So that the very Angels are glad to hear, and know this Doctrine about Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Therefore are we to exalt Chriſt in our Miniſtry, to lay him the foundation, becauſe in Heaven, though Chriſt will then lay down the exerciſe of his Mediatory Kingdom, yet the glory and honour muſt be given unto him for ever.</hi> The Saints in Heaven, will for ever acknowledge the glory, the happineſs, the bleſſedneſſe they have to be by Chriſt. Is it not neceſſary therefore to inſtruct you in that work, which we are to do to all eternity? Chriſt is not to be laid aſide in Heaven. His blood, his ſufferings, his atonement will never be forgotten: For, only by Chriſt, is their ſuch a place as an Heaven; only by him is ſalvation poſſible. Why then ſhould not that truth fill our mouths and our hearts here, which will poſſeſſe our ſouls to all eternity?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The neceſſity of preaching Chriſt the foundation, <hi>ariſeth from the ignorance of people, who do groſſely erre about Chriſt, both Doctrinally and Practically.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doctrinally</hi>: For though <hi>Chriſt</hi> be in every mans mouth, yet few have knowledge of his <hi>Perſon</hi> and his <hi>Offices.</hi> Though they be called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet they can give no good account of their <hi>knowledge</hi> of him. And if <hi>this be eternal life to know Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> John 17.2. certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the groſſe and notorious <hi>ignorance</hi> in many, proclaimeth them farre off from the Kingdom of Heaven. How canſt thou hope in Chriſt, and believe in Chriſt, who knoweſt not what Chriſt was, and for what end he came into the world?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:101245:88"/>And then <hi>Practically</hi> many are <hi>ignorant</hi> of him. They feel not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of him as a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> as a <hi>Mediatour</hi>: They perceive not at what a diſtance ſinne hath caſt them from all hopes: They feel not the <hi>arrows of the Almighty darted into them</hi>: They <hi>feel</hi> no <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>The neceſſity appeareth, becauſe of the ſubtilty and emnity of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>; who hath continually ſet himſelf againſt Chriſt and his Church. I hat as at the firſt ingreſſe into Chriſts Miniſtry, he violently aſſaulted him, and never left oppoſing his perſon, ſo ever ſince he hath laboured to obſcure Chriſt, and traduce his way. In the firſt age of the Church, then he ſet againſt the Perſon of Chriſt: Hence came up thoſe many Heretiques, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying he was <hi>God,</hi> ſaying, He was <hi>only man</hi>; Others, <hi>Only God,</hi> and not a man, but <hi>in the appearance of a man.</hi> Some confounded his <hi>Natures,</hi> ſome multiplied his <hi>Perſonality</hi>; ſo that all the ſubtile power of the Devil, was, to overthrow the Perſon of Chriſt. But in this latter age, he ſet againſt the Offices of Chriſt. And thus in Popery (though Socinians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive thoſe old blaſphemies) his Prieſtly Office, his Prophetical, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; all thoſe were quite darkned by their Maſſe and Indulgences: and many ſuch abhominable derogations from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>We have the more need to exalt Chriſt, becauſe there is pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in every man to truſt in his own works</hi>; To reſt upon his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; To advance and ſet up nature. Now, ſo much as theſe are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, ſo much is Chriſt debaſed. We ſee our own natures in the Jews, though it was in thoſe glorious times, wherein Chriſt, and the Apoſtles manifeſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet men did ſtill ſeek to be juſtified by the works they had done: Their endeavour was <hi>to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe,</hi> though that, like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark, did fall to the ground before Chriſt; and truly, ſuch were greater enemies to Chriſt, more then prophane Publicans and ſinners. So that the Scripture preaching of Chriſt, will drive men out of their civil righteouſneſs, out of their formality, and confidence in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which is the ſtrongeſt hold that the Miniſtry hath to batter. We may ſooner diſſolve thoſe groſſe acts of wickedneſſe, then remove this mountain of ſelf-righteouſneſſe. Yet, if Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, his worth be all, why wilt thou be a Chriſt to thy ſelf?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction.</hi> What matter of wo and lamentation it is, to ſee ſo few build upon this foundation? <hi>Some put their truſt in riches, in charriots and horſes</hi>; ſome in the <hi>works they do</hi>; and thus Chriſt, whom God deſigned to be all over glorious, is not glorified by us. Examine your ſelves in this one thing among others, Is Chriſt the bottom and foundation of all thy <hi>love, joy,</hi> and <hi>delight?</hi> Art thou affected with him in a ſpiritual manner, as the Church is? Is <hi>he the chiefeſt of ten thouſands?</hi> Do men of the world come and ask thee, <hi>What is thy beloved more then others?</hi> What is there in Chriſt, more then any thing elſe? Canſt thou ſay, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> to him who asked why ſuch colours refreſh ſight, <hi>It was a blind mans queſtion?</hi> So, this is a natural mans, an earthly mans queſtion.

                     <p>In how many particulars Chriſt is to be preached as a foundation, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereof, you have heard.

                        <hi>For is not the Doctrine about a</hi> God, <hi>that there is a</hi> God, <hi>and but</hi> one God; <hi>Is not this a foundation? Doth not the Apoſtle ſay,</hi> He that would come to God, muſt believe that he is, and a rewarder of thoſe that ſeek him? <hi>So that this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation muſt be laid, as well as about Chriſt. And it's made</hi> eternal life, to know God the Father, the only true God, as well as Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.12. <hi>Where the object of our faith, that is fundamental, is divided into that of</hi> God, <hi>and of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>the</hi>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Thus alſo the Doctrine of the</hi> Trinity, <hi>That there are</hi> three, <hi>and theſe</hi> one God, <hi>is a foundation, becauſe we are</hi> baptized <hi>into the</hi> Name <hi>of theſe</hi> three, <hi>and the knowledge of them muſt needs be funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To anſwer this. When we ſay, Chriſt is to be laid as the only foundation,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that is <hi>excluſive of all humane foundations,</hi> it doth not <hi>exclude</hi> God the Father, or God the holy Ghoſt, but <hi>inclu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es</hi> them rather. So then, we are not to preach Jeſus Chriſt, as the foundation of all our comfort, peace and ſalvation, as that God the Father, and the holy Ghoſt are to be ſhut out of this. No, they had all their appropriated working in this great Redemption of mankind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in thoſe places, where God the Father is ſaid to be the <hi>only God,</hi> and <hi>one God,</hi> that is not excluſive of the other perſons, but of <hi>made</hi> and <hi>feigned gods,</hi> of <hi>Idols</hi> made <hi>gods by men</hi>: So it's here, Chriſt Jeſus is preached as the foundation, yet God the Father, and the holy Ghoſt, have their peculiar workings alſo, though only the ſecond Perſon is the Mediator.</p>
                     <p>And therefore ſecondly, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus cannot be preached as the foundation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Doctrine of God the Father, and the holy Ghoſt be alſo made known.</hi> Hence are thoſe expreſſions, <hi>He that knoweth the Sonne, knoweth the Father alſo.</hi> And, <hi>He that denieth the Sonne, denieth the Father; And he that honoureth the Sonne, honoureth the Father,</hi> John 8.19. John 5.23. The Doctrine of Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, cannot be laid down without the Doctrine of God the Father, giving his Sonne to be thus a Mediatour for us, and the Spirit of God, as applying, working, and ſealing all thoſe benefits, that Chriſt hath purchaſed. Hence Chriſt doth often acknowledge the Father in that work he came to do for mankind. So that Chriſt Jeſus is the foundation; but there may be a more explicite revealing of what is neceſſarily implied in this foundation.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Objection is, <hi>Is Chriſt only to be preached as the foundation?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                        <hi>And are people to be built upon him? Then what need Miniſters preach of any thing elſe but Chriſt? What need they preach of faith and repentance? Eſpecially, Why ſhould they preach of the threatnings, and the curſe of the Law, of the torments of Hell? Doth it become the Miniſters of the Goſpel to be ſonnes of thunder? Have they any work to do, but to offer Chriſt to every one? Every Sermon, ſhould it not be an</hi> Ho <hi>to every one that is thirſty, naked, or miſerable, that is burdened and laden to come to Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus indeed ſome have runne into extremity,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and thought Chriſt was not preached, becauſe he is not alwayes proffered as a Saviour to ſinners, but the Law and Duties, and Hell torments are preached. Now to this we ſay many things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When the Miniſters of God preach duties, the work of repentance, or
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101245:89"/>
mortification; they preach them not as foundations, <hi>They do not lay them in Chriſts room, and therefore they do not croſſe this Text.</hi> Doth not this <hi>Paul,</hi> who is ſo carefull to lay no other foundation but Chriſt, diligently exhort in other places to avoid ſinne, to live in the fervent practice of holy duties? Who is more zealous in this way than <hi>Paul? Paul</hi> to theſe very <hi>Corinthians,</hi> hath many ſevere admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, to make them humble and ſorrowfull for their ſinnes, yet he did not lay another foundation, becauſe theſe are <hi>preached only as the way whereby Chriſt may be obtained.</hi> We do not then tranſgreſſe this Text, when we preach repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the ſinner, humility to the proud man, heavenly-mindedneſs to the earthly man, righteouſnneſſe to the unjuſt man, chaſtity to the unclean man. We do not forget our Office, we do not runne from our Text, becauſe we preach them not as a foundation. Indeed if any preach them ſo as to reſt on them, to put confidence in them, this man layeth another foundation; but ſo do not the Orthodox, we preach <hi>Chriſt the meritorious cauſe, duties are the way, not the cauſe.</hi> And although Chriſt be ſaid to be in a different ſenſe the way, yet duties are the way, Chriſt is the way effectively and meritorious; but ſo are not duties.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though the Miniſters are to lay no other foundation, <hi>yet they are to build upon this</hi>; they muſt enlarge themſelves in the explication of this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They muſt not build hay or ſtubble, but gold and precious ſtone: So that we are not only to lay the foundation, but to adde all other things that may make us a comely building upon Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To preach Chriſt, is not only to preach Chriſt as the <hi>Object matter, but all the things Chriſt would have us to preach.</hi> That is to be obſerved, we preach Chriſt when we preach all thoſe things he hath commanded, as well as when he is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of our Sermons. When <hi>Paul</hi> about the Lords Supper ſaid, <hi>I delivered unto you, that alſo which I received of the Lord Chriſt.</hi> Here he preached Chriſt, as well as when he ſaid, <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> So that here may be a great miſtake, thou thinkeſt Chriſt is never preached, but when he is named, when he is the matter of the Doctrine and Uſe: Yet, when we preach the whole counſel of God, and deliver what ever he hath commanded us to reveal to our people, then we preach Chriſt. Thus the Apoſtles in their voyages and journeys where they went, are ſaid to preach Chriſt; and in thoſe Sermons, they did not onely preach Jeſus to be the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> but alſo commanded all other duties of faith, repentance, love, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditories did require.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>We are to preach duties, but in reference to Chriſt.</hi> Take any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grace, that the Miniſters of the Goſpel provoke men to; this cannot be done without bringing the ſoul to Chriſt; and therefore though the Miniſters of the Goſpel do not in every Sermon name it, yet it is to be ſuppoſed: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, take repentance; we ſay, every ungodly ſinner, unleſſe he repent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſinne be a burden, an heavy bitterneſſe to him, and he fully forſake it, he muſt neceſſarily periſh. Now many wayes Chriſt is concerned in this. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>He cannot repent and be humbled for ſinne, unleſſe Chriſt give him ſtrength. Without me ye can do nothing. The branch ſeparated from the tree hath no moiſture, no juyce in it,</hi> John 15. Thus a man without Chriſt hath <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, an hard heart, a withered heart, an heart without any moiſture, any ſoftneſſe, ſo then Chriſt is here implied.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Repentance cannot be Evangelical and filial, without Gods love in Chriſt. Judas</hi> did repent, the Scripture cals it ſo, but becauſe there was only gall in it, and no honey, only horrour and terrours, and no faith to allay thoſe waves; Therefore his very repenting and deſpairing was a grievous ſinne. So then to preach ſuch a repentance as driveth from God, filleth the heart with curſed hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101245:89"/>
and hated of God, and thereby to runne to hils and mountains to cover us from God: Or to put a man upon ſuch penal and afflicting labours to the fleſh, that may ſatisfie and appeaſe God: This is to bid men bring wild and ſour grapes for ſweet: This is to preach from Chriſt, not to preach Chriſt. But repentance truly preached is to have our ſorrow for ſinne, <hi>accompanied with faith</hi> in the promiſes, and a <hi>reſting upon tht bloud of Chriſt.</hi> Thus as it is in repentance, ſo in every grace. When we preach it, we preach Chriſt, becauſe by him we only have ability to do it, and through him only have acceptation, and as we ſaid, though the Miniſters in every exhortation do not thus name Chriſt, yet this is to be ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, We do not tranſgreſſe this Text, no not when we preach the Law, the threatnings, the torments of hell, becauſe theſe are to <hi>drive us out of our ſelves, to make us ſee our own poverty and wickedneſſe, that ſo Chriſt may be the more welcome.</hi> Chriſt himſelf, though ſometimes he cals the heavy loaden to him in a meek way; yet when he hath to do with ſuch as truſted in their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and found no need of his Mediatorſhip, he cals them <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> he bids a woe to them, he threatens them with hell. And <hi>Paul</hi> tels you in his own experience, he had never come to prize Chriſt, to eſteem him, <hi>had not the Law diſcovered ſinne to be out of meaſure ſinfull</hi>; then he <hi>died,</hi> then he was <hi>undone,</hi> then, <hi>Oh miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me? What ſhall I doe?</hi> And thus <hi>Peter</hi> converted three thouſand by conviction of a particular ſinne they had committed, <hi>viz.</hi> the murder of Chriſt, and the aggravation of it, and this pricked them at heart. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> being called to preach of faith in Chriſt to <hi>Felix,</hi> he preſently preacheth about <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>temperance,</hi> becauſe <hi>Felix</hi> lived in the two contrary vices; and alſo of the <hi>Judgement to come.</hi> Thus he would have brought <hi>Felix</hi> to the eſteem of Chriſt. So that to preach the Law in the purity of it, in the curſing nature of it; to preach hell, and the eternal torments thereof, is neceſſary, becauſe this is to <hi>make way for Chriſt.</hi> This is to put iron in the fire, that ſo being ſoftened, it may be put into any faſhion.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have removed the Objections, and ſhewed you, That though other things are to be preached beſides Chriſt, yet <hi>reductively all things are brought to him at laſt.</hi> They are but as the rivers that come from the Sea, and empty themſelves therein.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>They are a ſound ſtedfaſt people, not carried away as the chaff, and ſtraw is with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> Heb. 13. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and for ever</hi>; and then followeth, <hi>Be not carried about with divers and ſtrange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</hi> The Connexion is thus made by ſome, The truth of Chriſt, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt is ſtill the ſame. And therefore do you retain the ſame ſtedfaſt faith. Oh when men are not built on Chriſts Doctrine, but their own opinions, their own conceits, they have <hi>Reubens</hi> curſe, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable like water!</hi> Col 2. They that fell to the worſhipping of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> did not <hi>hold the head</hi>; Look then to what thy faith, thy ſoul is bottomed upon, whether Chriſt be thy teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or thou be thy own teacher. Now this ſtedfaſtneſſe and immoveableneſſe of thoſe that are founded on Chriſt, appeareth in their reſiſting of the violence of perſecution, and the ſubtilty of hereſies. In the one, the Devil is a roaring Lion: In the other, he is a gliſtring, ſliding Serpent. The one is like the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wind to the traveller, that by force would pull off his garments: The other like the hot Sunne-beams, that by degrees maketh him throw them away. Oh this is excellent comfort, in the winnowing to be found wheat and not chaff; in the fire to be gold, and not droſſe! God you hear in this Text, will have a fire, to try all mens doctrines, and if it be ſtubble and hay, it will quickly be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

                        <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and a ſtranger they will not hear, or follow, John</hi> 10.5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>A people built on Chriſt, will not be formal and customary in religious duties, resting upon the performance of them, but carried out to Chriſt himſelf.</hi> Oh who can bewail this enough! How are all duties of Religion, but as the picture without a ſubſtance, as a body without the ſoul? They pray, and hear, and hear, and pray, but cloſe not with Chriſt in theſe things. Thus as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi> for the golden veſſels that were in the Temple, put in materials of braſſe. So whereas the people of God in their ſpirituality, fervency and heavenly mindedneſſe had their hearts up to Chriſt; Now they think all is done with the external labour of the lips, or bowing of the body. We may ſay to you thus affected in your duties, as they that were looking for Chriſt in the Sepulchre, <hi>He is riſen, he is not here.</hi> As falſe teachers, that brought in the works of the Law, and the duties of the Law, did put theſe in ſtead of a Chriſt; ſo do Chriſtians make their Duties, their Ordinances, their Performances a very Idol-Chriſt to ſave them, but thoſe that are built on Chriſt know better.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe that are ſetled and founded on Chriſt, they have ſpiritual ſtrength, and holy vigour communicated to them in the wayes of godlineſſe.</hi> For though Chriſt be here called a foundation, and that giveth only ſupport, yet in other places he is the <hi>root of the Vine</hi>; the <hi>Head,</hi> which denotes more than a meer foundation, <hi>viz</hi> not only ſupporting, but conveying all grace, and lively nouriſhment to the godly heart, whereby they grow up and increaſe to more degrees of holineſſe. Now this is a wofull ſpectacle to ſee a people the ſame, both for knowledge and life, they were many years ago; no more underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heavenly things, no more growth in faith, in zeal, in communion with God. Even as the picture on the wall that is ſtill the ſame, not one cubit is ever made to the ſtature thereof.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Thoſe that are built on Chriſt, receive of the Spirit of Chriſt, in all the works of it.</hi> A ſpirit making thee pray with groans unutterable, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, a ſanctifying ſpirit, or ſealing and aſſuring ſpirit. An auditory deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Gods Spirit, is like a <hi>Golgotha, a place of dead mens skuls,</hi> or rather dead hearts: They ſavour no ſpiriual duty, priviledge, or motive. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> are ſaid to have Chriſt amongſt them, becauſe they had the Spirit of God in the gifts and operations thereof.</p>
                     <p>

Are you like the green leaves in the river? The Locuſts did not eat or conſume, and not the dried ones prepared for any falling off?

                     <p>Now theſe are allegorical expreſſions, and you may ask, <hi>What is the plain meaning of them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some therefore of the Ancients underſtood by <hi>gold and precious ſtones,</hi> godly and holy works: And by <hi>hay or ſtubble,</hi> evil and wicked works: or, as <hi>Auſtin,</hi> inordinate affections and deſires to earthly things, preferring them before Chriſt. It is true, the ſame Author calleth this Text, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus è difficilimis locis,</hi> one of thoſe moſt difficult places, to which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> relateth. But this his interpretation cannot be the meaning here, partly becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, Thoſe that <hi>build hay and ſtubble</hi> ſhall be ſaved, though by fire, whereas thoſe that live in wickedneſſe and inordinate love of the world, cannot be ſaved under any notion whatſoever; And partly, becauſe the Apoſtle reſtraineth his matter to thoſe that are builders, and they are Doctors and Teachers, not to all believers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Some by <hi>gold and precious ſtones,</hi> underſtand the pure and ſolid preaching of the Word; and by <hi>hay and ſtubble,</hi> curious light, and vain affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of humane eloquence. And indeed this is part of the Apoſtles meaning, as appeareth by the ſharp reproof of thoſe Teachers for their carnal, humane wiſdom. But</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That which is chiefly the meaning is, the <hi>matter</hi> they preach; <hi>Gold and ſilver</hi> is the <hi>pure and ſincere Doctrine,</hi> that is agreeing with the foundation. <hi>Hay and ſtubble</hi> are corrupt and ſinfull errours, which diſagree from it. He doth not by hay and ſtubble ſpeak of ſuch dangerous, and damnable hereſies that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the foundation, ſuch are not ſaved, though by fire, but they bring upon themſelves ſwift damnation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. but leſſer errours and falſhoods, which do not overthrow, yet are no wayes agreeable or ſutable to the foundation. As if you ſhould ſet a glorious Palace with marble wals, and pillars of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but then a wooden rooff, and thatch covering with ſtraw; how ridiculous would this be? Such is every mans preaching, though he keep the foundation, that addeth diſſentaneons Doctrine thereunto.</p>

                     <p>To open the Doctrine, let us conſider, What is implied in this, when the truths of Chriſt are thus called <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>precious ſtones?</hi> And</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:101245:91"/>
                        <note place="margin">1. In reſpect of the matter.</note>Firſt, <hi>The preciouſneſſe of them is hereby declared, They ought to be eſteemed and deſired by us, as much as the covetous man deſires his gold and ſilver.</hi> The truths of Chriſt are ſometimes compared to <hi>milk,</hi> for the nouriſhing vertue in them: Sometimes to <hi>honey,</hi> and the <hi>honey-comb,</hi> for the ſpiritual ſweetneſſe and refreſhment the godly find therein; and ſometimes to <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>precious ſtones,</hi> becauſe of the admirable excellency and worth in them. Hence we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>To contend for the faith,</hi> Jud. v. 3. to be in an agony; Why? It's more worth than gold. This made the holy Martyrs willingly die for it, they thought it more precious than life; they thought it no loſſe to be deprived of their own gold and ſilver to teſtifie to this, and to propagate it to their poſterity. The Apoſtle cals it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>That good thing committed to thee. To you that believe Chriſt is precious,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. and ſo is every truth of Chriſts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It doth denote the rarity of it.</hi> It's hardly and difficultly obtained: Gold and ſilver is not ſo common as the ſtones of the ſtreet: There are but few mines of gold, to the mountains of earth. And thus for the moſt part, the Churches of God have been ſo corrupted with errours, that very little gold did appear. It was a rare thing to have any one truth of God made known. In the Old Teſtament, under many Kings, Idolatry and Superſtition had ſo prevailed, that the book of the Law of God in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> time was a rare thing; and in <hi>Aſa</hi>'s time, <hi>They had been without the Law, and a teaching Prophet for a long while,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15 3. And in Popery not only the covering was thus deformed, but the very foundations were ſhaken. So that it's not ſo eaſie a matter to obtain the truth, that is found out with much prayer, humility, holineſſe of life, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious uſing of all means appointed by God. There are few, it may be none, who though they build gold and ſilver, do not alſo adde ſome hay and ſtubble. So that this very expreſſion, Truths are gold, are precious ſtones, and they lie one by one, called therefore <hi>uniones,</hi> they ſay ſhould teach us, not to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, not to reſt in our own underſtanding. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. Some make it a metaphor from thoſe that with much labour dig in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mine of gold. So that the Scripture that is the mine, where all the gold and ſilver is, there we muſt dig, thence we muſt repleniſh our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Teirdly, <hi>There is implied the durableneſſe and conſtancy of it.</hi> Gold will not melt away in the fire, or be conſumed as hay and ſtubble will. And thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle alludeth to afterwards, <hi>He ſhall be ſaved, ſo as by fire, and the fire ſhall try every mans work.</hi> He ſpeaks of a <hi>probatory,</hi> and not a <hi>purgatory</hi> fire; that is, <hi>afflictions,</hi> or the light of Gods word ſhall burn all this ſtubble. So that the truths of God they are ſo conſtant and abiding, that when a man comes to be afflicted, to be perſecuted, to be undone for the truth of God, this will abide. <hi>What is the chaff to the wheat?</hi> Jer. 23.28. When a wind comes, the chaff is blown away. And therefore this ſhould make all very carefull herein, both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and people. God will have his fire; there will be winds and tempeſts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be gold or ſtubble, wheat or chaff, then it will be diſcovered, whereas divers and ſtrange erroneous Doctrines, they have not been willing to come to the fire. Every Hereſie in the Church went up and down like <hi>Cain</hi> trembling, left every place of Scripture that met it, ſhould kill it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The truths of Chriſt are compared to gold and ſilver, <hi>Becauſe of the ſolidity and ponderoſity of them, they are weighty and heavy.</hi> Whereas errors are compared to <hi>hay and ſtubble</hi>; what is lighter than theſe? And therefore ſuch as give way to falſhood, they are ſaid <hi>to be carried away with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> Epheſ. 4.14. as if they were ſo many feathers or ſtraws. Whatſoever opinion then is accompanied with vanity, levity and emptineſſe, it's not ſolid, grave and ſubſtantial, refuſe that. It is ſaid, <hi>Solomons</hi> ſhips, they went for gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> and they brought home pearls. Thus do many men, they make us, if
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101245:91"/>
they ſought out the admirable and ſolid truths of God, and they bring Peacocks, empty, gaudy flouriſhings of wit, or curious opinions. This is not the weighty and ſolid truth of God.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, They are compared to gold, <hi>Becauſe of the purity and ſincerity in them.</hi> The truths of God, they have an holy ſimplicity and ſincerity, and therefore falſe Teachers are ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. to corrupt the pure word of God, as huckſters do their wine. <hi>David</hi> compareth Gods word to <hi>pure gold, even ſeven times refined,</hi> Pſal. 19 And hereby it becomes a very dangerous ſinne, for any to counterfeit it, or corrupt it. If among men their Laws make it a capital crime to counterfeit, or clip their coin, certainly God will account it no leſſe hainous a ſinne to do ſo with his truths. As it's gold for ſincerity; ſo it's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the water of life, for its purity. And as <hi>Iſaac</hi> complained of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> as the greateſt injury that could be to ſtop up his wels with earth; and it's a matter of death to poiſon a fountain or ſpring where men uſe to drink; ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and hainous a ſinne it muſt be, to infect the pure ſtreams of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, that people ſhould thereby ſuck down their own poiſon.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, It's compared to gold, <hi>for the efficacy and choice vertue thereof.</hi> Gold is not only of price and eſteem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it hath it's powerfull operations in medicinal wayes againſt bodily diſeaſes. And thus certainly the truths of God are, when received by faith, they are mighty to the caſting down of all the ſtrong holds of ſinne; they are powerfull to overthrow the greateſt oppoſitions, <hi>Sanctifie them by thy truth, thy word is truth,</hi> John 17. Thus it's ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>To convert the ſoul,</hi> as the learned there interpret, it is, <hi>revive the ſoul to bring life again</hi>; when a man by diſcouragements and dejections is even ſwooning away. Oh then theſe golden truths of Chriſt, they have a ſpecial influence upon the heart of a man, to revive againſt faintings, to diſpel all diſtempers, and to preſerve againſt all languiſhings.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, They are compared to gold and ſilver, <hi>For the uſefulneſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſſe to all things. Money anſwereth all things,</hi> ſaith the Wiſeman, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.19. Many outward comforts in this world may be had for gold and ſilver; you may have friends, food, raiment. Hence the <hi>Heathens</hi> made <hi>Pluto</hi> wealth, a god, becauſe it wrought all things among men, <hi>Clauſum aur â cuſtodit Jovem. Horace</hi> ſpake of the covetous man, He keeps his god in his cheſt; And covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is called <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Col. 3.5. Thus gold and ſilver prevail in the world: And therefore <hi>Balaam</hi> to expreſſe his reſolvedneſſe not to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Though Balaak would give him an houſe full of gold, yet he would not curſe them.</hi> But alas, what are theſe to the truths of Chriſt? They are profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>able for ſuch things, which material gold and ſilver cannot do. <hi>Judas,</hi> when tormented in in his conſcience foa ſinne, What could his thirty pieces of ſilver comfort him? Could that eaſe his conſcience? Give gold and ſilver to the damned men in hell, will that comfort them? There are many mercies that all the gold and ſilver in the world cannot help us unto; but now there is no condition, no doubt, no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, no want, but the truths of Chriſt are very profitable unto. The truth of <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>faith</hi> in Chriſt, Is not that more worth than the gold of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir?</hi> What precious and powerfull operations hath it upon the hearts of the godly?</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, The truths of Chriſt are compared to gold and precious ſtones. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are able to enrich a man with all graces.</hi> There is ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wealth, as well as earthly and temporal; and the truths of God are of the firſt ſort. Thus the <hi>poor of this world,</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>rich in faith,</hi> Jam. 2 5. And <hi>Chriſt became poor to make us rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9 not in outward reſpects, or external greatneſſe, but in internal, and ſpiritual riches. Mark that counſel, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.18. to the Church, who thought her ſelf rich, and needing nothing, <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayeſt be rich.</hi> Oh that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101245:92"/>
people were ſpiritual! You ſee here is gold offered to all, and he is indeed fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh that refuſeth this. There is many a man with gold and ſilver, and much wealth in this world, and yet is very poor towards God. When our Saviour had declared that Parable of <hi>Dives,</hi> and the eternal torment he had after his great pleaſures, he concludeth, <hi>So is every man that is rich in the treaſures of this world, and is not rich towards God,</hi> Luke 12.21.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>To build gold and precious ſtones on this foundation, is not onely to preach ſound and pure matter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. In reſpect of the way and manner of preaching them.</note> 
                        <hi>but this matter in a pure and exact way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this golden way of preaching, to be <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> and <hi>Chryſologues</hi> indeed, conſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>In preaching of them after Scripture Authority, when they are conveyed unto you, as having the ſtamp and Authority of God.</hi> The Prophets came with, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi>; and this like thunder may make the ſtouteſt trees to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The ſayings of any men in the world, though never ſo eminent, are not brought in religious matters for confirmation, but illuſtration: And it's a great proficiency in hearers, when they affect and delight in ſuch preaching <hi>Auſtin</hi> while a <hi>Marcionite,</hi> and a great <hi>Humaniſt,</hi> had much ado to delight in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, becauſe he did not find ſuch humane eloquence; but when he came to find the words thereof like fiery darts and arrows in his ſoul, then he was raviſhed with the excelle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>condly, <hi>It's to preach them with Scripture gravity and ſolidity.</hi> As the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.11. he doth not ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap> having more of divine inſpirations than humane acquiſitions. The more of mens wits, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and conceits, the leſſe of God, and ſo carrieth the leſſe reverence and awe. And this the Apoſtle doth greatly aim at: Thoſe falſe teachers came with cunning and enticing words, and ſo deceived; whereas the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>That the Goſpel came unto them not in humane eloquence, but in demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, and of the power of God.</hi> Indeed humane parts, and humane arts, they are to be uſed but as ſervants, not as miſtreſſes. It's <hi>Auſtins</hi> alluſion, concerning <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                        <q>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> took gold, and jewels, and earings from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and turned them to their own uſe; and ſo we may take humane abilities and excellencies, and make them contribute to the Goſpel; only they muſt not be affected, nor made the principal.</q>
As the flowers that may be in a Corn field, all the plowing and ſowing was not for them, but for corn. Chriſts truths you ſee are precious ſtones, and they need no painting.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are to be preached with Scripture ſimplicity in reſpect of aims and ends.</hi> For though a man ſhould build gold and ſilver, yet if it be for humane glory, and earthly greatneſſe, he builds hay and ſtubble, though this be known to God only: But this fire will diſcover the ſecrets of mens hearts. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not only to look to what we build, but why we build; Is it the glory of God, the ſalvation of mens ſouls? This will be comfortable at the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of all things.</p>
                     <p>

                        </gap> with gold, and they brought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones to it; and thus is the Church of God ſtill to be built, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.19. And as in <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes, God made gold as common as the ſtones in ſtreets: So in theſe later dayes, thoſe golden truths, which before were rare and precious, now are common; but the common familiarity of them hath brought contempt and neglect of them; elſe thou wouldſt take up every truth of Chriſt, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearl. Theſe are the beſt Jewels in the ear. Oh but who can bewail the ſwiniſh luſts of men, who had rather have their droſſe, than thoſe pearls! No wonder God hath brought ſo many terrible judgements upon us; for we have

been wanton under the choiſeſt and moſt precious mercies, even the holy truths of God. Every Sermon hath been throwing pearl to ſome ſwine, to bruitiſh wicked men, that in ſtead of loving of them, have turned again, and rent them, as much as lieth in their power.</p>

For the Apoſtle alludes to ſome kind of building, which a man may imagine in his mind, whoſe foundation and chief parts is of gold and ſilver; but all the ſuperſtructure wood, hay and ſtubble. This would be a moſt deformed and incongruous ſight, as the Poets <hi>Mulier formoſa ſupernè,</hi> but <hi>aeſinit in piſcem.</hi> Now do but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what contemptible, unprofitable and vain matter, all falſe doctrines, though never ſo gloriouſly dreſſed, are by theſe ſimilitudes, even like <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi> Ape in mans cloaths.

Philoſophers ſay, It's a dry exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from the earth, and violently beaten back again from Heaven: So is any falſe Doctrine, it comes from earthly and carnal luſts and deſires; and it is beaten back by God from Heaven, he doth not own it; <hi>Quid vento levius?</hi> and ſo theſe winds of Doctrine are uncertain; ſometimes they blow in the North, ſometimes in the South, even as neceſſity and carnal advantages drive them, and which is more, not only the Doctrine is thus light and empty; but the builders are ſuch as their Doctrine; the Doctrine is ſtubble, and they are ſtubble; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>Be not carried away with them,</hi> as if the perſons were nothing but ſtraw: Even as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>They that made Idols were wholly like them:</hi> Thus it is here.

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>When the Apoſtle cals theſe errours hay and ſtubble, he doth not ſpeak of fundamental errours neither, but ſuch as are conſiſtent with, and built on the true foundation.</hi> They do not damne the Authour of them, but they make his ſalvation difficult; <hi>He ſhall be ſaved, but by fire.</hi> For as for thoſe Doctrines that race up the foundations, <hi>Peter</hi> cals them <hi>damnable hereſies,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons them with <hi>Idolatries, Witchcrafts,</hi> and all the groſſe ſinnes that palpably exclude from the Kingdome of Heaven, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Yea, if an Angel from Heaven</hi> ſhould bring ſuch a Doctrine, we <hi>were to hold him accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1.8, 9. And all the faithfull are commanded, <hi>Not to bid ſuch an one, God ſpeed,</hi> John 2. Epiſt. As <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle would not <hi>waſh</hi> himſelf in that <hi>Bath,</hi> where <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Heretique had been. So that theſe expreſſions of <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble,</hi> are onely for leſſer errours. But thoſe that are in Folio, (as it were,) they are <hi>poiſon</hi>; They are the <hi>venome</hi> of the <hi>red Dragon</hi>; They are like the <hi>Plague</hi> that ſtrikes dead into Hell quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without a ſpeedy recovery. So that as all ſinnes are not alike, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are all errours: And we are to make a difference between thoſe that are fundamental, <hi>Circa-fundamental,</hi> and <hi>Super-fundamental,</hi> as a man may ſo ſay. As in ſickneſſes, ſome are mortal, and deprive of life immediately; others are not ſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why errors are called <hi>hay and ſtubble.</hi>
                        </note>In the ſecond place, Let us conſider, why the Apoſtle cals errours by ſuch names, <hi>wood, hay and ſtubble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe of the vileneſſe and contemptibleneſſe of them.</hi> Men if they did underſtand the Scripture, and walk by that Rule, would no more regard them than the ſtraw under their feet, as we ſay. For as the true Doctrines of Chriſt were compared to gold, becauſe of their precious and excellent nature; ſo errours are called ſtubble, becauſe of their baſe and vile nature. In the Old Teſtament the names of <hi>Idols</hi> were names of contempt and ſcorn, <hi>Baal-Phegor,</hi> and <hi>Baal-zebub,</hi> and thus here, the ſinfull opinions that men deliver are ſtraw and ſtubble.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle deſcribeth the Idolatry of the Heathens under this ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>That they turned the Image of God into an Oxe that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hay</hi>; and truly all that love and delight in errours doe ſo. They who ſhould be after the Image of God, delighting in precious and heavenly truths, make themſelves like the beaſt that eats hay. Vitiated and corrupted ſtomacks will eat traſh; and ſo diſtempered minds and corrupted will receive falſhoods.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It's compared to hay and ſtubble, for the levity and uncertainty of it.</hi> What ſolidity hath a ſtraw that is blown up and down with every winde? Now the lightneſſe and uncertainty appeareth in three things,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It cannot abide the touchſtone, it cannot endure to be tried.</hi> Straw cannot endure the fire. The thief, or he that doth evil, <hi>hateth the light,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>John</hi> 3.20. Counterfeit and baſe coin cannot abide the touchſtone; whereas the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> when they preached, they were willing to have their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines tried by the Scripture; and the <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended for making ſuch an enquiry, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. The Owls and the Bats cannot endure the day. As
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101245:93"/>
ſoon as errour is detected, it is confuted, whereas the precious truths of God, they grow more excellent and glorious by the trial of them. The wheat loſeth nothing by winnowing; the iron by filing. By all the errours and hereſies that ever have been, truth hath gotten the advantage: As the ark was the more lifted up to Heaven by the waters:</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It's uncertainty is ſeen in the divers ſhapes and moulds it hath, denying and affirming.</hi> As <hi>Tertullian</hi> of the <hi>Peacock, Multicolor, verſicolor, nunquam idem &amp; tamen ſemper idem.</hi> Thus erroneous Doctrines are alwayes in new dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in a new garb, as they are neceſſitated by truth. How often was <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm interpoluted?</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle cals the dealing of ſuch perſons who uſe to ſow theſe tares <gap reason="foreign">

Wicked men ſhall grow worſe and worſe; one errour draweth on another: When a man begins to tumble down the hill, it's hard ſtaying ere he come to the bottom. And therefore when thou once beginneſt to wander from the truth, fear thy ſelf thou wilt preſently be in a wilderneſſe; yea thou wilt be like an <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael</hi> in time.

                     <p>Thirdly, Errours are compared to hay and ſtubble, <hi>For the uſeleſneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſſe of them.</hi> They are but fig leaves to cover our nakedneſſe; and that will appear in theſe particulars:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They do not truly inform and enlighten the mind.</hi> Truth is light, and doth inform and inſtruct the mind; but all errours do bring more darkneſſe; ſo that while they think they know more then they did, they know leſſe. Hence they are ſaid to be <hi>men of corrupt minds,</hi> 1 Tim. 6 5. and <hi>deluded,</hi> or <hi>deceived.</hi> Oh, what a dreadfull thing may this be, for thee to think thou haſt more light than ever, when it may be thou art in more darkneſſe than ever?

This be aſſured of, that in ſuch ſinnes of injuſtice, there can be no pardon, till there be reſtitution, or a prepared heart for it. The firſt thing that troubled <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when he was converted, was his wronging of others, <hi>If I wronged any</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I reſtore him fourfold, Luke</hi> 19.8.

that the arrow ſhould kill no more at mid-day, hath done this alſo wonderfully in his Church. The day did declare <hi>Arianiſm, Pelagianiſm, Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>To enlarge this Doctrine, conſider theſe things,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In that the Scripture cals the time of manifeſtation, a <hi>Day,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is light, and the Sunne beams; it doth excellently imply, <hi>That all the while there are corruptions in Doctrine and Worſhip, that time is a time of darkneſſe.</hi> Let men never ſo much rejoyce in them, and count them happy times, yet the Scripture cals them dark times. So that to take away the truths of God, the pure worſhip of God, is indeed, <hi>Solem è mundo tollere,</hi> to take the Sunne out of the firmament. All the while the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was without the Law and the Prophet, without true teaching of the Word of God; they were in a worſe condition than the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in their <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſſe, for that hindred them onely in their bodily motions, and outward accommodations; but this tends to the deſtruction and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul and body. The true Miniſters of Gods word are compared to <hi>light,</hi> and to <hi>ſalt,</hi> Matth. 5 13. <hi>Nihil Sole &amp; ſale utilius,</hi> both are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and uſefull. They are called the <hi>Starres,</hi> and it muſt needs be a dark night, when no ſtarres ſhine. Since the Apoſtles times, the Church of God hath many times come under ſuch dark times, that it hath been like the old Chaos, when darkneſſe covered the deep. Take we heed then of calling <hi>darkneſſe light, there is a woe to thoſe that do ſo,</hi> Iſa. 5.20. as ſome do the times of Reformation, the times of Deformation. If theſe corrupt Doctrines, which come from the prince of darkneſſe, thou calleſt light, as coming from the Father of lights; Thou intitleſt God to the Devils work, and that is no mean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>in. This ſhould teach the godly what to think under the overflowing of errours, to account them dark and ſad times.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Errors are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>Secondly, There are no fooliſh builders that thus deform Gods Temple, <hi>but they are by Gods permiſſion</hi>; in his wrath and anger, becauſe men have abuſed his truth, and waxed wanton under it, therefore hath he <hi>ſent the ſpirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion and errours amongst men,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.10. For this you muſt know, though God be not the Authour of any evil, and it were blaſphemy to aſcribe ſinne to him, as the cauſe of it; yet, as a <hi>juſt Judge</hi> he doth not onely <hi>ſuffer,</hi> but alſo <hi>order,</hi> that hereſies and corruptions ſhall be in the Church. <hi>They are of the Lord by permiſſion and ordination, though not effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and approbation.</hi> Thus in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3. <hi>If there ariſe a falſe Prophet, I the Lord do it to try you.</hi> And in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time, you may reade of many <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits in the falſe Prophets,</hi> yet they could not goe to delude ſuch or ſuch, <hi>till God gave them leave,</hi> 2 Chron. 18.21. Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>There muſt be hereſies:</hi> Why muſt there be ſo? God to puniſh mens corruptions, their pride, their ignorance, their wilfull abuſe of his knowledge, will ſuffer ſuch things to be. Though he hath a gracious <hi>end, That the approved may be made manifeſt</hi>; That as all the <hi>perſecutions,</hi> which have been in the Church were from God as a juſt Judge, to exerciſe the <hi>patience</hi> of it: So all the hereſies and errours which have been, were to exerciſe the <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>true faith</hi> of the Church. So that howſoever times of overflowing of errours be dark and uncomfortable times, yet to conſider the cauſe, is farre more uncomfortable, for theſe came from mens corruptions, and Satans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations, as alſo from a provoked God in Heaven, who puniſheth our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer unthankfulneſſe and diſobedience, with corrupt ends and practices: As it's ſaid, <hi>Becauſe men did not receive the truth in love, God gave them up to believe a lie,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.10. So that it's hard to ſay, whether is more ſad to conſider the nature of the errours, that diſhonour God, or the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101245:99"/>
cauſe of them, which is Gods anger againſt a people for barrenneſſe and unthankfulneſſe. God then hath his times, when for the ſinnes of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he lets Satan looſe, and ſuffers this red Dragon to vent his dreadfull poiſon</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>As the corrupt errours of men came from Gods anger, ſo in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he hath appointed times, wherein he will purge and take away their droſſe.</hi> For theſe Church-burthens and Church-corruptions have been farre more heavy upon Gods people, than State-oppreſſions. Therefore the firſt thing that <hi>Gideon</hi> did, who was raiſed up by God, to be a Judge to deliver <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> from their cruel oppreſſions, was to remove their Altars, and all their Idolatry: he began with God firſt, <hi>Judges</hi> 6.28. And ſo when <hi>Moſes</hi> had gathered the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into a body, and they were capable of a Civil Government, yet the firſt thing he doth, is to preſcribe them Lawes concerning the worſhip of God; and in the Decalogue, the firſt Table is for the Duties relating to God. By this you ſee, That corruptions in Gods worſhip and truth, as they are greater ſinnes than others; they are talents when others are pounds; ſo they lie more heavily upon the people of God, they bewail them more. <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was <hi>Aegypt,</hi> did not ſo much trouble the godly, as it was <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>dome</hi>; the Idolatry more than the cruelty offended the people of God. This being ſo, God among temporal promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of deliverance, of righteouſneſſe and peace, doth alſo comfort the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with times of Reformation in his Church, that this hay end ſtubble ſhall no longer ſtand to diſhonour his building. Thus God by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> promiſeth. <hi>To purge away their droſſe, and to take away their tinne from them,</hi> Iſai. 1.25. which doth relate to their Church-ſinnes, their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, as well as State-ſinnes. And by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> you have a glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe concerning Church-Reformation, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36.25. as well as temporal, <hi>He will give them to ſee their Idolatries, ſo that they ſhall be confounded and never open their mouths.</hi> Eſpecially, God hath thoſe times, when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be aſhamed of their errours, of their ſuperſtitions, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver open their mouths again to plead for them, or juſtifie them, <hi>When they ſhall ſee the patterne of the Mount,</hi> Ezekiel 43.10. You have a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble promiſe, <hi>Malachi</hi> 3 3 where upon Chriſts coming, there is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a glorious reſtauration, <hi>He ſhall ſit as a refiner and purifier of ſilver, and he ſhall purifie the ſonnes of Levi.</hi> Chriſt when he came into the world found all Gods worſhip groſſely polluted; all the Prieſts had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed themſelves: Now this was one end of Chriſts preaching to purifie them, to cleanſe them from theſe defilements. It's true, prophane and worldly men, or meer Atheiſtical Politicians, they make no matter about Gods truth, they make advantage of any Religion that ſerveth a deſigne; but this was the great worke of Chriſts Miniſtery, to make a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Doctrine and Worſhip. Though this was very unpleaſing to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt men, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Who can abide the day of his coming?</hi> It is even like a day of judgement to them. It is obſervable what our Saviour ſaith, as much to our purpoſe, and parallel with the Text, <hi>John</hi> 4.23. <hi>The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and truth.</hi> You ſee how God hath his houre, his time and ſeaſon for ſuch a thing; and then when that is come, they ſhall worſhip, God will ſo over-rule, enlighten, and perſwade mens hearts, that they cannot but yeeld. Such an hour or time God had, when we reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of Popery, <hi>Then darkneſſe covered the face of the earth:</hi> The Sunne, and the Moone, and the Starres were turned into blood: The Officers of the Church, who ſhould have had light to inſtruct, did cruelly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101245:100"/>
and bloodily perſecute ſuch as did hold the truth. Now, though all the world was thus in darkneſſe, yet when God raiſed up thoſe inſtruments of his truth, <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Calvin,</hi> and others: They were no more able to ſtop the ſpreading of the Goſpel, then they could hinder the Sunne from running its race. Gods hour was come, and then the eyes of men would be opened. There were many perſons, before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s time, learned and godly men, that did withſtand Popiſh errours, that died in contradiction of them; but yet the world was not awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they did not thinke of coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> till Gods time was come.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>This Day of Gods revealing, may be a long while, as to our expectation.</hi> God may ſuffer corruptions to cover all the body of the Church: You may ſee onely chaffe, and no wheat; and this may be a long while; ſo that the godly doe even languiſh under their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19 14. to his knowledge, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to viſible appearance, he onely was left to vindicate the pure Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Worſhip of God; And in what a temptation was he about it? It's true, God told him, <hi>He had reſerved ſeven thouſand that had not bowed their knees to Baal,</hi> that did not communicate in Idolatry: But what was ſeven thouſand to all the people of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> No more than the glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Harveſt. And thus alſo we might ſhew, how in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, when errours had once got poſſeſſion in it; they were like the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> and the wilde beaſts in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which could hardly be deſtroyed. <hi>Donatiſme</hi> laſted above two hundred yeares. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianiſme,</hi> and <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> though but ſparkes, yet kindled ſuch a fire, that it was not extinguiſhed in many generations. So that we may ſay of this time, as Chriſt to the Diſciples, <hi>It is not for us to know the times and ſeaſons,</hi> when God will reſtore his Church to her purity. That is enough, which our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Every plant that is not of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers planting, ſhall be rooted out,</hi> Matth. 15.13. That is an excellent place, compared with this Text: God hath his time, when he will root out all the plants, that he did not plant in his owne Vineyard: But how long it will be, ere this day breake forth, God hath not diſcovered to us.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things thus explained, Let us conſider the Reaſons, <hi>Why God will have a Day to declare mens workes in matter of falſe Doctrines?</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the truth of God is deare and precious to him.</hi> Chriſt himſelfe makes it one main reaſon, why he came into the world, <hi>(viz.) To beare witneſſe to Gods truth:</hi> So that Divines ſay,
<q>Though Chriſts death in reſpect of God the Father appointing him to be a Sacrifice for ſinne, was <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, an attonement or expiation, yet if you doe reſpect men, before whom he made a good Confeſſion, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 6.13. So it was <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, a <hi>Martyrdome</hi>; Chriſt died a Martyr, as well as a Mediatour, becauſe by his blood he witneſſed Gods truth.</q>
You ſee then, how deare his truths are to him: And the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> among other arguments, uſeth this, <hi>It's time for thee, Lord, to work, for men have made void thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.126. And though it be but the leaſt Commandment, yet if any man ſhall teach men to breake it, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of Heaven, that is, he ſhall be none at all in the Church here (as ſome expound) and of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hereafter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.19. Know then, that not only prophane lives, but corrupt Doctrines do provoke God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:101245:100"/>Secondly, <hi>It's neceſſary there ſhould be a time, becauſe of the people who belong to Gods grace, that they may ſee their errours, and bewail them</hi>: That they may redeem the time, by pulling down their hay and ſtubble, and building gold and ſilver. Thus <hi>Luther,</hi> and all the firſt Reformers (alas) they had a long time built hay and ſtubble, till God opened their eyes, and then they were as much for truth as once againſt it. How could the people of God come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> if this day were not? And if there be ſo much joy, for reducing one ſtraying Sheep, how much more of wandering Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>In reſpect of men hardened in their errours, that their obſtinacy may appear the more:</hi> That when they will not ſee, though the day appear, who then can juſtifie them? Thus the Phariſees, the proper builders of <hi>hay and ſtubble,</hi> yet Chriſt tels them, <hi>He came into the world, that they might not ſee.</hi> Their blindneſſe was the more increaſed by his light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Admonition,</hi> To embrace thoſe daies of light and Revelation, which God brings into the world. Do not dote upon thy own Opinions; thy old corrupt Doctrines and Worſhip: It's no longer night, the day appeareth. It's true, ſuch a day is very terrible to men, who are wholly corrupted with their errours: As <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. The Prophet ſpeaking of his coming to <hi>purify the ſons of Levi,</hi> cryeth out; <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming</hi>? It's as terrible (you heard) as the Day of Judgment to them. Certainly, to ſuperſtitious and idololatrical perſons, the day of Reformation is a terrible day: They cannot abide the purity and holineſſe of it. Do not diſpute, but wiſely obſerve when God cauſeth ſuch daies to ariſe upon thee; thy blindneſſe will be the more inexcuſeable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Becauſe it ſhall be revealed by fire, and the fire ſhall try every mans work of what ſort it is.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We now proceed to the <hi>manner,</hi> or <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> by which the Day of God ſhall declare it, and that is <hi>by fire.</hi> This is the place that hath raiſed much fire of contention, while Expoſitours differ about the interpretation of <hi>fire. Auſtin</hi> (as you have heard) thought it one of <hi>Paul</hi>'s hard places, to be underſtood; and is ſo modeſt, that he profeſſeth he had rather learn from others, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate any thing himſelf. This Text the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make the chief place for <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>; therefore <hi>Bellermine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Purga. cap.</hi> 5. is very large in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this place, calling it as <hi>difficillimum</hi> for <hi>tiliſſimum,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>one of the moſt difficult places of the whole Scripture, and yet moſt profitable, becauſe the Catholiques build their Eccleſiaſtical Doctrines on this place, <hi>viz</hi> That there are venial ſins, and that there is Purgatory.</q>
Indeed, he doth in part Orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expound the <hi>fire</hi> in this verſe, ſaying, <hi>Herein we do not diſſent from</hi> Calvin <hi>and</hi> Martyr; but he would eſtabliſh it on verſe 15. Of which in its time. But it's well, that if there be ſuch a fire, it's only of <hi>hay and ſtubble,</hi> and will not laſt long. By <hi>Purgatory fire,</hi> they mean a ſevere puniſhment, though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo terrible as Hell; in which place they go, that are good for the main, but yet have many ſinnes cleaving to them, from which they were not purged in this life. If you ask for a text of Scripture, ſome ſay, <hi>It cannot be proved by Scripture, but only it's a Church tradition</hi>: Others, as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> labour to prove it by Scripture, but by very obſcure texts, ſuch as theſe are. Now, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things, to Faith or Salvation, are ſome where or other, laid down plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scripture. But that this is <hi>only a probatory fire,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> a <hi>a purgatory,</hi> as they hold, appeareth by this clear Argument. They hold that <hi>only wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ſhall come into the purgatory fire, <hi>but</hi> the Apoſtle makes <hi>all actions, good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> to come under this fire. <hi>The fire ſhall try every mans work.</hi> If it be gold
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101245:101"/>
or precious ſtones, it muſt be tried by fire, as well as hay or ſtubble; whereas, purgatory fire is only for hay and ſtubble. And this ſufficiently clears the place from any ſuch corrupt gloſſe, which would build hay and ſtubble, even from that very text that threatens fire to ſuch Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>But it's not enough to confute a falſe interpretation, unleſſe we give a true. What then is meant by <hi>fire?</hi> And</p>

                        <note place="margin">What is meant by <hi>fire.</hi>
                        </note>Firſt, We will take it for granted (though ſome think otherwiſe) that <hi>fire</hi> is uſed in the ſame ſenſe by the Apoſtle in theſe verſes. <hi>It's revealed by fire. The fire ſhall try. Yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is a difference between the Word and Afflictions, becauſe <hi>though afflictions have a voice</hi> as well as the Word, and the rod ſpeaks as well as Gods Word, <hi>yet the word of God doth it diſtinctly and plainly, afflictions in a general manner.</hi> They tell us God is angry; they tell us they come for ſinne; but why and wherein, or what are the ſinnes, that Gods Word doth only inform us.

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The word of God is inſtrumental to open the eyes, to enlighten the dark underſtanding. David</hi> doth wonderfully commend the Scripture for this uſe, that it was <hi>a lanthorn to his feet, and a lamp to his paths</hi>; whereby he became wiſe, and underſtood even more then his <hi>Teachers,</hi> Pſal. 119. This is the <hi>EYE-SALVE.</hi> For want of ſearching into the Scriptures, it was they erred ſo groſſely about the <hi>reſurrection.</hi> When Chriſt is promiſed to be as <hi>a refining fire</hi> (Mal. 3.) <hi>to the Sons of Levi,</hi> how did he this, but by the clearing of the Word from Phariſaical interpretations? And <hi>Eſtius,</hi> though a Papiſt, thinks this place alludes to that of <hi>Malachi</hi>; and indeed there is a great reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The word of God is fire to try mens works, becauſe it containeth all matter neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> So that when we believe <hi>hoc credimus, quod nihil ultra credere debemus</hi>: the Scriptures are ſaid to be <hi>able to make us wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3 15. If nature doth not fail in natural neceſſities, much leſſe will the Scripture in ſupernatural. <hi>Theſe things are written, that believing you might have eternal life,</hi> Joh. 20.31. As God at firſt put all the light into the Sunne, ſo he hath all neceſſary things into the Scripture. The Word of God then will manifeſt and reveal, both <hi>objectively,</hi> in diſcovering that matter which is true, and <hi>ſubjectively,</hi> in preparing the eye to ſee, which is more then the Sun can do: Though that enlighten the <hi>medium,</hi> yet it cannot give a ſeeing eye to the blind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:101245:102"/>Thirdly, <hi>The word of God will be a fire to try, becauſe it doth direct to all thoſe means whereby we may come out of all errours.</hi> As</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It preſſeth <hi>humility, not to lean to our underſtanding. God will teach the humble his way,</hi> Pſal. 25. Though ſuch may a long while wander, yet they will come back, and then they are not aſhamed to recant before the whole world. <hi>Peter</hi> commends <hi>Paul</hi> for the <hi>wiſdom given him of God,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.15. and yet we know how <hi>Paul</hi> reproved <hi>Peter to the face,</hi> as is related <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. This was great humility in <hi>Peter,</hi> to love and commend the excellencies in <hi>Paul</hi> for all this. <hi>Auſtin</hi> wrote his Retractations at the latter end of his age, which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great humility.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Scripture bids us <hi>love that truth we do know,</hi> and ſo <hi>farre as we have obtained, to obey,</hi> and to <hi>walk according to that Rule,</hi> Phil. 3.16 You heard laſt day, <hi>That errours are not only mens ſins, but their puniſhments likewiſe.

                     <p n="3">3. The Scripture directs to <hi>earneſt Prayer</hi>: That is the <hi>Key to open Heavens Treaſury. Ask and ye ſhall have.

Prayer muſt begin, and Prayer muſt end all reading, and hearing, and all meditations. To ſtudy much without Prayer, to read much without Prayer, is like the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack that eats much, but wants natural heat for digeſtion.</p>

The Papiſts call the Scripture, <hi>The Heretiques Book</hi>; and <hi>Luther</hi> did ſo alſo, but upon different grounds: For the Papiſts, they ſay the blame on the Scripture, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it inſufficient, imperfect, a noſe of wax: but <hi>Luther,</hi> on mens <hi>corruptions,</hi> that prophanely and preſumptuouſly put that ſenſe on it, which it doth not own.

                        <hi>The Scripture is the only Rule, but not the only Means</hi>; for, elſe there needed no <hi>praying,</hi> there needed not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, nor the <hi>Miniſtry</hi>; but God hath appointed Miniſters in his Church, who by way of Office, are to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete and explain Scripture.

                     <p>Thirdly, This good building of truth, doth not only abide the fire,<note place="margin">Truth willing to be tryed.</note> 
                        <hi>but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth the fire</hi>; it's willing to come to the Touchſtone. <hi>The thief hateth the light becauſe his deeds are evil.</hi> Hereſie and falſe Doctrine doth not love the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, no more then the Owle the Sunne. Hence it is, that being provoked to go to the Scriptures, they accuſe the Scriptures of inſufficiency and imperfction. It's a ſaying of <hi>Lindan</hi> a great Papiſt, living in the firſt time of the Reformation, <hi>That it had been better, if they had never yeilded to the Proteſtants to prove things by Scripture, but kept only to tradition.</hi> Whenſoever any erroneus perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to diſparage, or to dethrone the Scripture, not to adore the fulneſſe and ſufficiency of it, as a Rule, ſuſpect that man; he is like the Elephant, which becauſe he cannot endure to ſee himſelf in the water, is ſaid to diſturbe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muddy it. So that the truths of God do not ſhun the fiery tryal.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Truths of God, built by a ſpiritual builder, do not only abide the fiery tryal, but they grow more illuſtrious and glorious thereby.</hi>

Many doubts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and as the winds, ſhaking of ſome trees, make the root the faſter, ſo the difference and diſputes about Religion, though they do hurt to ſome, yet to ſound and ſolid men, they have made them more eſtabliſhed. <hi>Nil tam certum, quam quod è dubio certum</hi> Which made an Antient ſay excellent well, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Not only the Truths of God in their Nature,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The effects of truth alſo upon the heart, will abide this try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</note> 
                        <hi>but alſo in the proper and genuine effects upon the Hearers, they alſo abide, and will endure the tryal.</hi> Now the Truths of God revealed in the Scripture, among other Effects, have theſe notable ones.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To <hi>aſſure</hi> and <hi>perſwade</hi> the heart of the certainty of them. Hence <hi>faith</hi> is called <hi>aſſurance</hi>; and, <hi>full aſſurance.</hi> Heb. 10.22 And <hi>The ſubſtance of things</hi> Heb. 11.1. So that where Gods Truth hath been fully received, there it eſtabliſheth the heart. It's not <hi>carried away with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> There are few that we can ſay of, that <hi>they have received the truth, not as the word of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101245:107"/>
man, but as the word of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.13. Many are ſo fickle, ſo inconſtant, ſo unſetled, that they are ready every day to have a new Faith; this is, becauſe the Word is not received as Gods Word, but as a mans Opinion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> notable <hi>Effect,</hi> is, <hi>To regenerate and make us new creatures</hi>: And this is alſo an incorruptible effect, no ſinne, or Devil, or the temptations of the world ſhall be able to obliterate that heavenly Image or Picture, the Word of God hath drawn upon ſuch a mans ſoul. Thus 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23, 24. <hi>Being born not of corruptible, but the incorruptible ſeed,</hi> which is ſaid to <hi>abide, though all fleſh and the flower thereof doth periſh.</hi> It's true indeed, <hi>Davids</hi> grace, and <hi>Peters</hi> grace, in the fiery tryal of ſinne, ſeemed to be quite extinct; but they were as the trees in winter, which have life in the root, though no ſignes of life appear by fruit, or leaves. If therefore you ſee any, who ſeemed to have been rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the Word, totally Apoſtatize and fall off, take the Scriptures ſaying up, <hi>They went from us, becauſe they were not of us,</hi> Joh. 2.19. No true Starres can indeed fall from Heaven, meteor's may. Thus not only the truths we preach, but even you that are Hearers, ought to be our work, and an abiding work. The Apoſtle cals the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> his <hi>Epiſtle, to be ſeen and read of all men,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.2. You are to be as walking Sermon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The forgetfull or unprofitable Hearer, doth as much as lies in him, to make the truths of God, of no more durable operation then humane figments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Object.</note>Now to this Doctrine, there is an obvious and palpable <hi>Objection: How can we ſay, that the true and Orthodox building in Chriſts Church, will abide all ſtormes? Do we not read frequently, that in the Church truth hath been condemned, errour owned? All thoſe Martyrs, that loſt their lives for the truths of God, were they not condemned as heretiques? Hath not errour alwaies found more upholders then the truth? Was not the Lord Chriſt condemned, and that by a Council of the Prieſts and Elders of</hi> Jeruſalem? <hi>Was not the whole world turned</hi> Arrian? <hi>And in our forefathers daies, was not the</hi> Aegyptian <hi>darkneſſe of Popery, covering the whole world? Was not the Maſſe, Tranſubſtantiation and Image worſhip, ſet up as the principal truths of God? And are there not men that write,</hi> the time will come, when the Word, Trinity, Co-eſſential, <hi>or</hi> Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, <hi>ſhall be as much hated as</hi> Maſſe <hi>and</hi> Tranſubſtantiation?</p>
                     <p>To this Objection, we <hi>Anſwer</hi>: That thoſe matters of fact cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>yet the Doctrine is true</hi>; for, thoſe oppreſſions and overwhelmings of the truth, were but for a while. The truth of God did abide the fire, even then, and afterwards prevailed more then ever. The Sunne for a while, may be in an Eclipſe, and hidden by black cloudes, but at laſt it's light doth prevail. We do not ſay, that in every place, and at every time, truth alwaies is extolled, and errour condemned, <hi>but in time it will be.</hi> It's with the truths of Chriſt, as it was with Chriſt himſelf; he ſeemed to be overcome by his adverſaries, he was <hi>dead and buried,</hi> yet he had a glorious Reſurrection and Aſcenſion. So that as God <hi>would not ſuffer his holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> ſo neither will he let his holy Truths. But as in Chriſt, his bones (by Gods providence) were not to be broken, the ſeat of ſtrength, ſo neither can the bones of Truth be. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Day ſhall declare it</hi>; that is, the time appointed by God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>This abiding or decaying, muſt not be judged by carnall reaſon, but by the eye of Faith</hi> It's enough that to the godly and Believers, though but a few, truth is acknowledged, though the greater part of the world vote for an errour. Chriſt himſelf was not owned for the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but by a very few that had the eye of Faith; the greater part denyed him. To every mans eye, the Sunnne is leſſe then the whole world, but to art it is farre bigger. <hi>That therefore is ſaid to abide the fire, which indeed, and to the eye of Faith doth ſo. Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children,</hi> Mat. 11.19.</p>

                     <p>This being ſo clear, we would wonder, what ſhould make the Popiſh Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters dream of a <hi>Purgatory fire</hi>; for they hold Purgatory a real fire, even as that of Hell; but the Apoſtles expreſſion is, <hi>As it were by fire</hi>; which denoteth a meer ſimilitude and compariſon, Gods examination and judgement; as alſo the Word, and heavy afflictions, theſe are the fire, which he muſt go thorow.</p>

Thus the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> are as induſtrious as the Devil, compaſſing the whole world, to make a prey of mens ſouls: But all this labour will accuſe them the more. The Wiſeman obſerveth great vanity in all worldly labour: but eſpecially in matters of Religion to labour in vain, there to loſe all thy nights and thy dayes, and thy ſtudy, and thy pains, is beyond expreſſion miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>They will loſe their inward peace and comfort of conſcience.</hi> How many that have turned aſide from the truth to errour, have found tormenting worms gnawing their conſcience? They have not found it a light ſinne, witneſſe <hi>Spira,</hi> and many others. <hi>He that denieth me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>him will I deny before the Father and the holy Angels, and the whole world,</hi> Mat. 10.33.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101245:109"/>
indeed there can be no ſound comfort, but upon Scripture truths; for Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence will go along only with his own truths. Even as it is in his Sacraments, Gods grace will be exhibited, and true comfort conveyed only in his inſtituted Sacraments; if men ſhould appoint any of their own head, they cannot look for his preſence and efficacy. So it is here, If men broach errours and falſe wayes, God will not own them; a fire of ſtraw and ſtubble will give but ſhort and little comfort to a cold man.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>They loſe, though not the total ſeed of grace, yet the degree and fervency of it; yea in regard of outward appearance all ſeemeth to be loſt.</hi> They have not that tenderneſſe, that ſtrictneſſe they once had. Hence the Apoſtle couples, <hi>The ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience together,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19 Loſe one, and you loſe the other. How carefull is the Apoſtle to forbid all thoſe diſputes, which do not tend to godlineſſe, and which do not edifie? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16. The ſhell-fiſh was unclean, it had but little meat in it, and a great deal of difficulty to get it. Men given wholly to diſpute, do not mind the affectionate part of godlineſſe. Grapes do not uſually grow on ſuch thorns. This then ſhould make every one look to what he buildeth; take heed thou art not falling into a noiſom pit; look leſt that when thy eye groweth dark, thy whole body will quickly grow dark; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in grace is a great provocation of God. To decay in thy eſtate, in thy health, are ſad things; but in thy love to God, in thy fervency, in thy zeal, is much more miſerable. <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and do thy firſt works,</hi> Rev. 2.5. It's our duty to grow in grace, and for thee to do the clean contrary, to decay in grace muſt needs provoke. Now part of this growing in grace, is to keep ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly to the truth. That is very obſervable, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 17. <hi>They muſt not fall from their ſtedfaſtneſſe,</hi> And how ſhall that be? <hi>By growing in grace and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>

He doth uſe (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) a good word in a ſad and evil matter, Every one may ſee this is forced. We ſtand therefore to the former explication, as that which is moſt genuine.

Thus <hi>the Church of Corinth, the Churches in Aſia.</hi> Now how great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is this very word <hi>Church?</hi> For a people to be a <hi>Church,</hi> the word ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as much as a company of people called out of the ignorance, idolatry, and prophaneneſſe of the world, to worſhip and ſerve God in his way, and to obey his Laws. So that when men come to be of this body, they are to renounce all their former prophaneneſſe and wickedneſſe, and live a life conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word, which is the Churches Charter, and by which it walketh. Thus all our Congregations ſhould be men called out of the ignorance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe of the world, to live according to Gods Rule. But where are the perſons or the Societies that do this? Are not many of our Aſſemblies in the world and of the world ſtill, in reſpect of converſation? There will be ſcandals and offences in the Churches of God too often; but <hi>woe be to ſuch,</hi> who by their prophaneneſſe, idolatry, and wickedneſſe, give ſo many ſcandals as to make us accounted a <hi>Babylon,</hi> a <hi>Sodome,</hi> or as the world. Indeed, they who do thus charge us, go beyond their line: for we have a true Church, and a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and true Ordinances; only the lives of men are generally ſo corrupt and wicked, ſo ignorant and beaſtly, that they are ſpots in our Aſſemblies, and a grievous reproach to that holy Profeſſion which we have taken upon us. So then, if we would have our Congregations and perſons freed from all theſe defilements, <hi>remember what the word</hi> Church <hi>is; a company called out of the world.</hi> And as for ignorant and prophane men, the orders of Chriſt are to endeavour their reformation, but if they continue obſtinate, then they are to be caſt out. As the Clouds that are exhaled from the earth, which though <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial</hi> in nature, yet follow the <hi>motions</hi> of the Heavens; ſo though in our <hi>original</hi> we be of the <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>are duſt and aſhes,</hi> yet by this <hi>heavenly call,</hi> we are <hi>wholly</hi> to live a <hi>heavenly converſation.</hi> Is it for Starres to be like the dung of the earth? Is it for a <hi>Church</hi> to be a prophane, ignorant, and worldly people? Oh, this very title ſhould raiſe up your hearts! Are we not a Church, <hi>perſons called out of wickedneſſe?</hi> Why then are we ſuch Apoſtates, as to degenerate from our Titles and Names? If Chriſt complained of <hi>thoſe</hi> that had made the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Temple a den of thieves,</hi> Mat. 21.13. will he not alſo of ſuch, who ſhall make his Church a ſtew, a dunghill, a place of wickedneſſe and ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? I beſeech you know theſe things, and conſider them better: If you would have the <hi>Name</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> have the <hi>nature, Life,</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> of a <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The conſideration that we <hi>are the people of God, in a more peculiar manner then all the Nations of the world, that do not know God.</hi> This alſo ſhould affect us. This is that Covenant of Grace God enters into, <hi>I will be their
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101245:112"/>
God, and they ſhall be my people,</hi> Jer. 7.23. 2 Cor. 6.16. Yea, <hi>a peculiar people</hi>; Gods <hi>Jewels,</hi> Gods <hi>Treaſure,</hi> Deut. 26.18. Pſal. 135.4. Tit. 2.14. Now conſider how great an obligation lyeth upon ſuch as are <hi>Gods people: They draw nigh to God in all duties of Communion, and God draweth nigh to them in all diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of grace.</hi> But how much holineſſe, faith, and purity, is required of ſuch? Did <hi>Ahaſueros</hi> command thoſe Virgins to be ſo many daies perſuming and preparing themſelves to come into his preſence, what preparation then ought to be in us, when we draw nigh to ſuch an excellent Majeſty? If you ask what are the duties of Communion with God? <hi>Prayer</hi> and other religious <hi>approaches</hi> are: And if we did know what theſe things were, we would throw away all our rags, and every thing that may offend his pure eyes.</p>
                     <p>Now herein people not diligently meditate, <hi>Whoſe ſervants do we profeſſe our ſelves to be? Into whoſe preſence are we going, when we come to pray and humble our ſouls</hi>? May we not ſay to every prophane and formal man, <hi>Know ye not,</hi> that Prayer is a Communion with the moſt high God? <hi>Know ye not,</hi> that the Word you hear, is the Word of the great and living God? And if ſo, Why doeſt thou ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e no more heed? Why doſt thou not prepare thy ſelf with fear and trembling? So that if people would conſider what it is to come and ſtand before God, how the Angels cover their faces, this would make them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently throw away all their unſeemlineſſe upon them. Remember him in the Parable, that <hi>came without a wedding garment,</hi> Mat. 22.12. So then, think of this more, <hi>how great that God is, how precious and choice thoſe duties are, which you go about.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If we did conſider, <hi>That the Word of God is the Rule all ought to walk by, when once they give in their names to Chriſt</hi>: This alſo would be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial antidote againſt all ſinne. You that are Chriſtians, are not to live as you liſt, to make your covetous, ambitious, or malicious luſts your laws, but you muſt take Gods Word to be your guidance. Thus <hi>David</hi> profeſſed of himſelf, that he made the Word a <hi>light and lanthorn to his feet,</hi> and thereby he was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned from ſinne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. So <hi>a young man,</hi> though unruly and maſterfull, yet <hi>he may cleanſe his way by attending unto Gods Word,</hi> Pſal. 119. This is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bath that may waſh away all our filth. Now where is the man that attends to this? Doth the Bible allow me to be thus and thus prophane? Doth the Word of God ſuffer me to be thus licentious? Oh, ye know not what you do! Should ye not know, that when you are <hi>Baptized,</hi> that thereby you do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe a ſubmiſſion to Chriſt and his Laws, to walk in an orderly conformity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: What the Word ſaith do, you will do; what that forbids, you will abſtain from: Yet how few do order their converſation hereunto; Oh, that we might prevail with you in this particular! Take the Bible to be your Guide, to be your Rule; write after that Copy: Let it be that heavenly Glaſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which thou wilt dreſſe thy ſelf. <hi>Know ye not, that this is the Law you must walk by, you muſt think and ſpeak by.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The very name and title of a Chriſtian, if men did conſider how much were in that, what great alterations and changes would it make.</hi> Thou glorieſt in the title of a Chriſtian: Thou wouldſt judge it the greateſt reproach that could be, to be accounted <hi>no Chriſtian.</hi> But what is a <hi>Chriſtian?</hi> not a meer title, a meer idle name, it is as much as one <hi>anointed with all the graces of Gods Spirit.</hi> As Chriſt was therefore called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>annoinned by God with all abilities and ſufficiency for that work of Redempt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>on</hi>; ſo we are called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> because we as Members from that Head, <hi>are anointed with fit graces for our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places and Relations.</hi> So that this ſpiritual and precious oyntment is poured upon every one that is a Chriſtian indeed. But as God complaineth of ſome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9. who <hi>ſaid they were Jewſ, but were not, but of the Synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>; ſo God will in time judge all thoſe that ſay they are Chriſtians, and are
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101245:113"/>
not, but are of Satan, doing his work. Now if you look into many a mans life, you may call that no more Chriſtianity, then a noiſome dunghill a bed of Spices. <hi>What is Chriſtianity?</hi> ſaid <hi>Nazianzen</hi>; and he giveth this definition, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a likeneſſe or reſemblance of God, according to mans ability.</hi> As if a man ſhould ſay, Thou wert a rich man, and thou findeſt thy ſelf in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty: That thou art an healthfull, ſtrong man, but thou findeſt thy pains and infirmities. What? Wouldſt thou regard the titles and names of things, if thou find the clear contrary? So it ſhould be here; I am called a Chriſtian, but I have not the humility of Chriſt, the meekneſſe of Chriſt, the zeal of Gods glory which Chriſt had: What will this name avail me, when the reality is wanting. I intreat you think of this more.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The conſideration <hi>of a Believer, hath much efficacy likewiſe in it, and ſhould be like fire in our bowels.</hi> Doeſt thou <hi>believe</hi>? Art thou no Atheiſt, no mocker and ſcorner, no ſcepticall, or diſputer in matters of Religion, but a ſerious, ſtedfaſt, and conſtant <hi>Believer?</hi> this is enough to make all within and without thee conſonant to Gods will. For take but two or three particular Objects of thy Faith, which thou ſaieſt thou doeſt with thy whole heart <hi>believe,</hi> thou canſt not, thou dareſt not deny them. As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Thou believeſt there is a God, who is omniſcient and omnipotent, who judgeth the world, whoſe eyes are alwaies upon thee. David</hi> was much affected with this, <hi>That God knew his ſiting down, and riſing up, and that he could not go from his preſence,</hi> but <hi>God was every where preſent with him,</hi> Pſal. 139. Now if you do <hi>believe</hi> this indeed, how dareſt thou do thoſe things in ſecret, which thou wouldſt not have the world know? Is not God in thy Chamber, in the Cloſet with thee? And ſo, How dareſt thou have heart-ſinnes, ſaying, All is well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the world doth not behold it? Thou haſt proud thoughts, malicious thoughts. How dareſt thou do this, if thou doeſt <hi>believe</hi> the eye of God is upon thee? Oh then, when thou art ſolicited to any evil way, ſay, <hi>Oh, my ſoul, knoweſt thou not that God is here!</hi> Am I afraid of a mans eye, and yet he cannot damn me, he cannot throw me into Hell? and do I not tremble at Gods eye?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To inſtance no more, <hi>Thou believeſt a Day of Judgment appointed, when all men muſt appear to give an account of what they have done in this world,</hi> when Chriſt ſhall <hi>come as a Judge in flaming fire, to take vengeance upon all that obey not the Goſpel.</hi> Thoſe Lamps that the fooliſh Virgins had, as well as the wiſe, are that outward profeſſion of Chriſts coming, and an outward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to meet him. Now to believe ſuch a day coming, of ſo impartiall a Judge, in ſuch a terrible manner, might it not take off every man from his deareſt ſinnes? The Apoſtle ſpeaking (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11.) of this expectation, and how the <hi>whole world ſhall be then on fire,</hi> he cryeth out, <hi>What manner of perſons ought we to be?</hi> For Heathens and Atheiſts that believe not this Day, it's no marvell, if they eat and drink and take no care; but how is it, that thou a <hi>Believer</hi> of theſe things, art not in Prayer often, in faſting and humiliation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference hereunto?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction.</hi> The reaſon of the deluge of all errours and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is for want of good logick: They do not inferre good concluſions from good Premiſes. For to be a <hi>Church,</hi> to be <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; to be <hi>Believers</hi> of ſuch ſure and certain things, do not thoſe inferre to all, <hi>What manner of perſons ſhould we be</hi> in all godlineſſe and holineſſe of Converſation? Do you not know theſe things? Are not theſe things acknowledged by all? How then can wickedneſſe and ſinne be found in any mans life? Oh, men be either deſperate Atheiſts or, mad fools! Atheiſts, if we believe not theſe things; fools, if we believe, yet our lives not anſwerable thereunto. What wilt thou plead at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? What will thy own conſcience ſay for thee? Wilt thou not become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101245:113"/>
ſpeechleſſe, not able to open thy mouth, when God ſhall command to take ſuch a ſinner, ſuch a wicked man, and bind him hand and foot, and throw him into Hell? If theſe things be not true, deny them; if you cannot, you dare not deny them, then go home, and mourn in ſecret, and meditate in ſecret on theſe things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Know ye not, that ye are the Temple of God?</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Introductive</hi> Preface hath been diſpatched, we come to the <hi>Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it ſelf; and therein we are to conſider the <hi>Subject, who</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. And</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>[Ye]</hi> may be taken both <hi>Collectively,</hi> as a <hi>Church,</hi> a Community, a Society; as the Temple was not one ſtone, but a multitude of ſtones artificially built together. And</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Diſtributively. [Ye]</hi> that is, <hi>every man</hi> is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt. As 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Your bodies are the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But the firſt ſenſe, is here chiefly to be retained; he ſpeaketh to them as a Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Here is the <hi>Matter</hi> we are compared to, <hi>The Temple of God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How the word <hi>Temple</hi> is uſed in Scripture.</note> I ſhall ſpeak more of this in verſe 17 Only the word <hi>[Temple]</hi> is uſed ſometimes for that <hi>magnificent</hi> and glorious building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where God had appointed all his worſhip. Sometimes it is uſed for <hi>Heaven,</hi> as being that glorious Palace wherein the Majeſty of God doth effectualy demonſtrate it ſelf. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>r,</hi> becauſe all behold the glory of the Heavens; as alſo ſome ſay, <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere</hi> from <hi>ſidus.</hi> But metaphorically, the word ſignifieth,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>Body of Chriſt. Deſtroy this Temple</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>and in three daies I will build it up,</hi> Joh. 2.19.<note place="margin">What it doth ſignifie.</note> And if the Temple were holy becauſe of the <hi>Schechinah,</hi> the habitation of Gods preſence there, how much rather doth Chriſts body deſerve to be called the Temple, becauſe the Godhead dwelled in it ſo fully, for <hi>the company of Believers</hi> aſſembled and joyned together in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and worſhip of God? So that as God promiſed to commune with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from between the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> and did there graciouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite himſelf; ſo it is here. Thus then, as the Temple was a peculiar place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to God, wherein God promiſed his gracious preſence, ſo it is with a company of Believers joyned together in a Church way. Concerning the holineſſe of the Temple, more in verſe 17.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Temple.</note> 
                        <hi>That the People of God met together to worſhip him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his way, are the Spiritual Temple of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ancient Temple was not more glorious and admirable to the humane eye, then ſuch Societies ſhould be to the eye of Faith. Thus <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is ſaid <hi>to fit in the Temple of God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.4. that is, in the Church of God, where the true Church was. And learned men think, that latter part of <hi>Exekiel</hi>'s propheſie, though very obſcure, concerning the meaſuring of the Temple, is nothing but the Promiſe of the building of the Church in the new Teſtament, in an heavenly and glorious manner. <hi>The Scripture
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101245:114"/>
delights to allude to thoſe ancient uſages in the Old Teſtament.</hi> So that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Duties, are ſometimes called <hi>Sacrifices</hi>; thus the people of God, a <hi>Temple,</hi> in this place.</p>
                     <p>To open this Doctrine,<note place="margin">What there is in the Church aluſively to the Temple.</note> let us conſider what is in the Church <hi>alluſively</hi> to the <hi>Temple.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The Materials for the Temple were to be poliſhed and fitted by art, ere they could be made part of the building</hi>: The trees and timber of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the ſtones of themſelves, were not fit for that goodly ſtructure; but they had Inſtruments of art going over them to prepare them; and thus it is ere a people come in to be made Members of a Church: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there muſt be a Divine efficacy and power paſſing over them. We of our ſelves, have not Faith, have not preparedneſſe for ſuch Church duties, till God doth enable us. Look we therefore, how we come into the Church of God. How is it brought about, that we are ſo? If there be nothing but nature and cuſtome, or becauſe we are born in ſuch places; if we have no more for our being Chriſtians, then Jews have for being Jews. Turkes for being Turkes; this is not to be Gods Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple indeed. No; that muſt be ſaid to thee, which was to <hi>Peter, Fleſh and blood hath not revealed this to thee,</hi> Mat. 16.17. Hence the Church of God is compared to a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> to a <hi>Garden</hi>; all which are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſo, but by art and induſtry are made ſuch. Thus, it is here; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Societies and Meetings are in reference to God, it is wholly of his making.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Materials of the Temple were very excellent and precious,</hi> of <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>ſilver,</hi> &amp;c. not <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble.</hi> The beſt ſtone, the beſt wood, that would not putrifie; and all things were covered over with gold, and the gold was to be pure gold; even the very ſnuffers were to be of gold. Now what did this repreſent, but to ſhew what kind of people thoſe ſhould be, who were of the Church of God; even as much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the others, as gold and precious ſtones from pibble ſtones; as precious wood from bryers? So then, if we be the Temple of God, we ought to be a <hi>people of more noble and heavenly Converſation then the world can reach unto.</hi> There ought to be no ſinfull debaſing waies amongſt us. As <hi>Michall,</hi> though falſly, ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> dancing before the Ark, <hi>Thou haſt made thy ſelf like one of the vile fellowes of the Land</hi>; it is thus truly with thee, if thou runneſt into any exceſſe of ryot that the world greedily purſueth, Thou haſt made thy ſelf like a Dunghill, not Gods Temple.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Temple was full of external glory</hi>: A magnificent place, admired by Heathens. And we ſee what weeping there was of the old men, that <hi>the glory of the latter Temple was not like that of the former,</hi> Ezra 3.10. Now the glory of Chriſtians is likewiſe great, but in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly way. <hi>The Church is all glorious within,</hi> Pſalms 45 13. The Goſpel that is preached, is ſtiled a <hi>glorious Goſpel,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.11 And the Spirit of God, <hi>The Spirit of glory,</hi> 1 Peter 4.14. It's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>That the glory of the ſecond Temple, ſhould farre exceed that of the first,</hi> Hag. 2.9. Now how was that made good? not in any outward glory, but becauſe Chriſt in a ſpiritual manner, did reform all thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Doctrines, and <hi>did ſit as a refiner to purifie the Sonnes of Levi.</hi> This was glory, to have the ſpiritual worſhip of God. It's true, this is not the glory of the world, which the Devil ſheweth, and ſo many do fall down and worſhip it; <hi>but to a ſpiritual eye, that judgeth ſpiritually theſe things are the greateſt glory.</hi> Who would think that the Preaching of of the Goſpel deſerved ſuch a Title as a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi>?
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101245:114"/>
The moſt ſublime and tranſcendent perfection that can be: Yet, What is more ordinary in Scripture, then to dignifie it by that Name? Do not then account the glory of the Church to lye in goodly Edifices, in glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ornaments, in ſtately Images, but in <hi>pure Doctrine, Godly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and an <hi>Holy life.</hi> Such times, are glorious times; ſuch Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations uſe to raviſh a godly heart. <hi>David</hi> cryed out, <hi>How amiable were the Tabernacles of the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> Pſalmes 84.1.10. <hi>And one day there, was better then many any where elſe.</hi> And all, becauſe of the Spiritual enjoying of God in them. It's the excellency of a Pearl to be in its native luſtre; to paint that, would diſgrace it; ſo it's the excellency of all ſpiritual Ordinances and Inſtitutions, to be in their pure native appointment; and to adde to them by goodly Inventions, is but to diſparage them. Jeſus Chriſt, had no external glory, yet to the Spiritual Believer, <hi>Chriſt is precious,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.7.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Temple was in a peculiar manner holy, in reſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buildings,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith in the next verſe. Now when we ſay it was Holy, we do not mean an holineſſe <hi>inherent,</hi> as Angels and men are holy, but of <hi>Dedication</hi> and <hi>Conſecration</hi>; a <hi>relative</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; being ſet apart by Gods ſpecial Command to ſuch an uſe. And therefore the Synagogues of the Jews, neither our material Churches have ſuch an holineſſe; as is to be ſhewed, when we come to the 18 verſe. For that is a neceſſary point to handle, to take of men from ſuperſtitious thoughts about holy places.</p>
                     <p>Among the Jews, there was a <hi>relative</hi> or <hi>typicall</hi> Holineſſe: The <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> was an <hi>Holy Temple, Jeruſalem</hi> is called the <hi>Holy City</hi>; yea, every Jew, is called an <hi>Holy</hi> perſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.5. and Gentiles are <hi>unclean,</hi> as appeareth by that Viſion to <hi>Peter, Call no man unholy or unclean,</hi> Acts 10.38. But of this more. This is enough, to ſhew that the Temple was peculiarly dedicated to God, and had a relative Holineſſe. Thus <hi>all Believers,</hi> they are in a ſpiritual manner Dedicated to God: They are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the world, and ſinne: They are not to live in the ſame wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe and impiety, as men of the world do. Oh Beloved, What a ſtrong Obligation is this to us all to live holily! We are ſeparated from the world: We are not to have ſuch thoughts, ſuch lives, ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the world hath. <hi>Procul, O Procul eſſe prophani,</hi> they would cry, in reſpect of their heatheniſh Temples; and this is much more true of the Church of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded to pull off the ſhooes of his feet, becauſe the place was holy, <hi>Exodus</hi> 3.5. Oh, much rather muſt thou pluck off thy ſinfull luſts, thy carnal pleaſures! For God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Ordinances are holy, about which thou art conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
                     <p>Fifthy, <hi>Becauſe of this relative Holineſſe, it was a Capitall crime to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file this Temple.</hi> There were Porters ſet at the Gate, to keep out all unclean things, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.19 No unclean thing might be brought therein, and ſo it is here; becauſe the people of God are a company joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſuch an holy manner, for ſuch holy ends. Therefore they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>caſt out all unclean perſons,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. <hi>ult.</hi> Here comes in the <hi>Neceſſity of godly Diſcipline and Excommunication,</hi> which is meerly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal, not vindicative; for edification, not deſtruction. Thus the inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, an unclean veſſel in this Temple, he was to be caſt out: <hi>Caſt out from among you that wicked perſon,</hi> 1 Corinth 5. The Church ſhould be like an excellent diſciplin'd Army. <hi>Therefore if any man walk</hi>

This ſpiritual Sword is in the Church, as the temporal one in the Common-wealth. Neither is this power given in vain, but that men who do ill, might be afraid. In the Primitive times, this godly Diſcipline was admirably executed, as appeares by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but when this weeding-hook was laid aſide, or abuſed, Gods Garden was runne over with weeds.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>That which was the glory of the Temple, and the life of it, was Gods gracious preſence.</hi> From thence he did hear prayer, there he accepted Sacrifices, thence he commanded bleſſings. His promiſe was, that <hi>he would put his Name there,</hi> and this ſtill continued in Gods Church. <hi>When two or three are gathered together in my Name, I will be there in the midſt of them,</hi> Mat. 18.20. Though God be every where in the world, yet his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is only in his Church. This is the Cloſet or Privy-Chamber; this is the Garden wherein he walks.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Here only are the Priviledges of grace</hi>: Here only is <hi>Juſtification, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, Sanctification.</hi> This is the <hi>Pool</hi> of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> wherein the Angel comes down.

There is no pardon of ſinnes among Heathens; God indeed, doth many times differ his temporal judgments upon Heathens, and he heareth their prayers and groanes, as their natural deſires, even as he doth the young Ravens; but their is no gracious anſwer of any Prayer, nor any pardon of the leaſt ſinne. Thus they are, as ſome places of the earth, where (they ſay) it is alwaies night; Ice and cold alwaies, no Sunne beames to comfort and refreſh.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Here only is the Foundation of all graces, or the Mediatour by whom God is gracious to us</hi> As (they ſay) in <hi>Aegypt</hi> there is never any rain from Heaven; ſo all that part of mankind, which is without Chriſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh not of gracious influences of Heaven; God is a conſuming fire to them.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Only in the Church are ſuch perſons, who are qualified for graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Priviledges.</hi> Here only is <hi>true Piety</hi>; here only is <hi>Faith, Repentance</hi>: Here only men do in a right manner pray to God.

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Points will be very profitable.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt is God.</hi> There have not only <hi>Heretiques</hi> of old, as the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> or of late in other Countries, as <hi>Polonia,</hi> and <hi>Tranſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Servetus,</hi> and the <hi>Socinians</hi>; but even ſome in this land very lately, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained privately, but have publiſhed Books on purpoſe to prove the Holy Ghoſt not to be God of the ſame eſſence with the Father and the Sonne. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there was a long contention, whether verball or real, it's diſputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Greek Churches and the Latin Churches, about the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, whether from the Father, and the Sonne alſo, or Father only; but no doubt at all about the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>I intend to handle this point Practically, yet ſo, as firſt Doctrinally to inform your judgments about the truth of it: and that I may do it the more orderly, you muſt know, that thoſe who have denyed the holy Ghoſt to be God, have been divided into two waies. Either</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Such who have thought him to be no <hi>Perſon,</hi> but to be an <hi>attribute</hi> or operation in and from God, which in man we would call an <hi>accident:</hi> So that as Gods wiſdome, Gods anger and power, they do not make a diſtinct Perſon (they ſay:) So neither doth this concerning the holy Ghoſt, but is no more than the mighty power of God putting forth it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Others make him a <hi>Perſon,</hi> yet not a <hi>God,</hi> but in the fore-front of the Angels; they make him the chief Angel, as (they ſay) there is a Prince of Devils. But the Scripture is very clear to overthrow thoſe damnable Hereſies. And</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">That he is a <hi>Perſon.</hi>
                        </note>1. <hi>That he is a Perſon, not an attribute,</hi> appeareth, <hi>by all thoſe perſonal ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that are given to him.</hi> So that by what arguments we can prove God the Father, or any man to be a Perſon, by the ſame we may prove the holy Ghoſt to be a Perſon; as that form in which we are baptized, <hi>Into the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 28.19. To be baptized into the name of one, argueth that one to be a Perſon: And how abſurd would it be to ſay, the Father and the Sonne are Perſons, but the holy Ghoſt is an attribute or operation? So <hi>There are three that dear witneſſe in Heaven, the Father, the Sonne, and the Spirit,</hi> 1 John 5.7. <hi>Three</hi>] he doth not ſay three things; but <hi>three</hi> (viz.) <hi>Perſons,</hi> as appeareth by the perſonal operations. <hi>Theſe bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Heaven</hi>] Some reade, <hi>The Spirit of God deſcended in the ſhape of a Dove</hi>; which plainly denoteth a thing ſubſiſting, not an attribute. We are ſaid, <hi>To ſin againſt him,</hi> which muſt needs imply a perſon, <hi>Thou haſt lied to God,</hi> Act 5.4. That which is here ſaid to be God is called the holy Ghoſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou haſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And <hi>the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhall never be forgiven, Matth.</hi> 12.31.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, There is attributed <hi>underſtanding and will to him; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, the Spirit of God ſearcheth the deep things of God, and the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11. And <hi>Will,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. where he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth up ſeveral operations, <hi>Even as the ſame Spirit giveth to whom he pleaſeth.</hi> So that you ſee the Texts are ſo clear, that were not men ſadly forſaken by God, they could not deny theſe things.<note place="margin">That he is <hi>God.</hi>
                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>Let us prove, that it's not a chief ſpirit among Angels, but in deed, and in truth, of the ſame Nature with God.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:101245:116"/>Now ſome choice Arguments to prove this, may be reduced into theſe heads:</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Arguments.</note> 
                        <hi>The Name of God is directly and properly (not metaphorically) attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to him.</hi> Thus <hi>God</hi> is ſaid <hi>to ſpeak by the holy Prophets, which have been ever ſince the world begun.</hi> And if you ask, What Perſon it is in the God-head? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>The Prophets ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> So that the holy Ghoſt was that God, who enlightened and moved all the Prophets that were from the beginning of the world. Thus <hi>Acts</hi> 5.4. <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy heart? thou haſt not lied to man, but to God. Ananias</hi> he thought he had only to do with men; but mark the oppoſition, not man, but God; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3, 4. <hi>There are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame ſpirit, the ſame Lord, the ſame God; Spirit, Lord</hi> and <hi>God.</hi> So that by what Texts we can prove God the Father to be God, the ſame we can prove the holy Ghoſt to be God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The holy Ghoſt hath thoſe works attributed to him, which do onely belong unto a God.</hi> Such as God only can do, as <hi>Creation, Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> and <hi>miraculous operations.</hi> Theſe things do demonſtrate and prove a God; <hi>Creation,</hi> Pſal. 33 6. <hi>By the word of the Lord the Heavens were made, and by the Spirit (or breath) of his mouth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t moved on the waters,</hi> as the <hi>Hen</hi> on the <hi>eggs,</hi> giving vivifical influence. For <hi>Redemption,</hi> the holy Ghoſt concurreth to that, in preparing and fitting the body of Chriſt, and ſanctifying it to be an oblation. Hence <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid, <hi>To be conceived of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> which could not be an <hi>Angel,</hi> for then an <hi>Angel</hi> would have been greater than Chriſt. And ſecondly, In the application of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefus,</hi> of the <hi>Redemption</hi> to the godly. The holy Ghoſt both applieth them, and aſſureth thereof, <hi>The Spirit of God that heareth witneſſe with our ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8.16. And <hi>we are ſealed by the holy Spirit of God,</hi> Epheſ. 4.30.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In the works of <hi>miraculous operations.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and miraculous gifts are attributed to the holy Ghoſt. Hence he is called, <hi>The finger of God,</hi> Luke 11.12. by which Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>to caſt out Devils:</hi> And on the <hi>Feaſt of Pentecoſt, He deſcended in a mighty ruſhing wind, and cloven tongues of fire,</hi> filling all the Apoſtles with miraculous gifts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The works of <hi>Sanctification, Faith, Repentance, and all other graces are wrought by him:</hi> Yea he is called, <hi>The holy Spirit,</hi> becauſe that is his peculiar Office, to work holineſſe, and to ſanctifie men by the Miniſtry. Now Divines ſay, It is a farre greater work, and argueth more power to ſanctifie the natures of men, then to make a new world; yet this is conſtantly applied to the holy Ghoſt, though not ſo as to exclude the other Perſons in their order. Hence likewiſe all the means of Sanctification, <hi>viz.</hi> the Miniſtry and the gifts thereof, are alſo given to the ſame Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. <hi>Over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The attributes and properties of a God, as well as the works of a God, are alſo in Scripture given to the holy Ghoſt; omnipreſence, filling the whole world. Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? None can flie from it,</hi> Pſal. 139.7. His <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience,</hi> in that <hi>he ſearcheth the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11. His <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> as you heard: His <hi>Eternity,</hi> called the <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> Heb. 9 14. Though ſome underſtand that of Chriſts Divine Nature, and being before the world, in that he made it.

                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:101245:117"/>Laſtly, <hi>The religious worſhip that is given to the Holy Ghoſt, doth not onely argue he is a Perſon, but a Divine Perſon equal with God.</hi> And</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We have the <hi>Angels</hi> giving worſhip unto him; whereas <hi>John,</hi> when he would have worſhipped the <hi>Angel,</hi> he is forbidden, <hi>Worſhip thou God,</hi> Revel. 19.10. So that religious worſhip is only to be given to God. And thus the <hi>Angels</hi> in that glorious viſion ſang, <hi>Holy, holy, holy—unto God.</hi> Now it's worth your obſerving, that this viſion is attributed both to the <hi>Father,</hi> to the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and to the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> To the <hi>Father</hi> that is without doubt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. for there he is deſcribed as a glorious Judge in all Majeſty.

                     <p>Two Propoſitions (you heard) were contained in theſe words:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Spirit of God, is God</hi>; which hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Spirit of God dwels in his Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We therefore proceed to this ſecond Doctrine. And now to open this, let us conſider,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>What the phraſe, to dwell in the Church implieth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>How he dwels there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the Spirit of God is ſaid to <hi>dwell</hi> in us, ſo in other places,<note place="margin">Of the Spirits dwelling in us.</note> God promiſeth <hi>to dwell in his people,</hi> 2 Cor. 6 16. And Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>To dwell in our hearts by faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. All which are not to be underſtood of any <hi>viſible</hi> or <hi>local</hi> habitation, much leſſe <hi>comprehenſive,</hi> that we cold comprehend God, for he is (as he ſaid) one whoſe circumference is every where, and center no where: <hi>The Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him</hi>; but it is meant in a <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual manner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this phraſe, <hi>To have the Spirit dwell in us,</hi> denoteth,<note place="margin">What to have the Spirit dwell in us implieth.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The propriety that it hath to us,</hi> that we are his poſſeſſion, as an houſe is a mans own, where he is Lord and Maſter. And this is worthy of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That we who once were the Devils, he dwelt in us, <hi>He ruleth in the hearts of the diſobedient,</hi> Epheſ. 2. have now him expelled from us, and the Spirit of God taking us for his poſſeſſion. We pity perſons bodily poſſeſſed, that they foame and rore, and are throwne ſometimes into the fire, and ſometimes in the water; but he who is a wicked man, the Devil poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his ſoul more dreadfully: he puts him upon <hi>anger, malice,</hi> upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean <hi>luſts,</hi> and noiſome filthy wayes; and though many be of the Church viſibly, yet in regard of their own particular, they are thus poſſeſſed by the Devil, who hath their heart, their eyes, their tongues, their whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſo that they ſeem to be a walking Hell: So that herein is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full change, when the Spirit of God comes and takes poſſeſſion of a people, who before were captives to Satan, and led aſide according to his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When it's ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of God dwels in a people,</hi> it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>That he doth faſhion and prepare them for himſelf:</hi> For every lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not fit for ſo noble a gueſt; but as great men carry their rich fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture with them, to have convenient lodgings; ſo alſo doth the Spirit of God, raiſe up a people by illumination, and ſanctification to be a fit habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for him: As they ſay, <hi>Anima fabricat ſibi domicilium</hi>; The ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> makes the body ſo curiouſly organized and diverſified for it's ſelf to be in:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101245:118"/>
So much more doth the Spirit of God put ſpiritual life, and quicken up our dead hearts, that we may be prepared for the enjoyment of him. It's ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of God moved upon thoſe waters,</hi> Geneſ. 1. <hi>that covered the deep, when the earth was without forme, or void.</hi> Thus the Spirit of God doth take us out of our natural confuſion, and horrible darkneſſe, and makes us comely with thoſe ornaments he puts upon us: So that as it is impoſſible to have the Sunne, but withall we muſt enjoy glorious light: So we cannot have the Spirit of God, but withall many precious and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifts will be beſtowed upon us. Oh then, how few perſons, how few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations can endure the luſtre of this Doctrine? What heavenly or precious jewels have they of Gods Spirit?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When it's ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of God dwels in us,</hi> it denoteth, <hi>The familiarity and condeſcending Communion that God vouchſafeth unto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> To dwell with one, is an act of communion. Hence 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.17. Husbands are commanded <hi>to dwell with their wives.</hi> Our Savior expreſſeth this familiarity by <hi>John, I will come in, and ſup with him, and he with me, Revel.</hi> 3.20 So that what was ſpoken of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as ſo rare a priviledge, <hi>He ſpake to God face to face, as one friend ſpeaketh to another,</hi> in ſome kinde of ſenſe, though not after the ſame manner, is true of every godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Hence the Spirit of God is ſaid to enable us to cry <hi>Abba Father, Galat.</hi> 4 6. which though it ſuppoſe a filial reverential frame in us, yet alſo godly boldneſſe and confidence: Hence he is alſo ſaid, <hi>To witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God,</hi> Rom. 8. So that children being admitted to ſit at their Fathers Table, have that bread, which dogs may not eat of. They have that Pearle, which muſt not be caſt to ſwine: But who are the people that God doth thus honour? How few are ſuch favourites? How many are amongſt us, that are not admitted with <hi>Moſes</hi> to come to the top of this Mount? They know not what Communion with God meaneth, what thoſe filial cryes of <hi>Abba Father</hi> are. Certainly, a rational man doth not more differ from a beaſt, than a ſpiritual man doth from the beſt rational man that is: That as a worme knoweth not what reaſon and arguments are the beſt; ſo learned and able men without grace, do not know what this enjoying of Gods Spirit and communion with God is; we ſpeak, though not in an unknown tongue, yet unknown matter to ſuch men.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In that the Spirit of God is ſaid to <hi>dwell,</hi> it denoteth, <hi>A permanent and conſtant abode in his people.</hi> For this you muſt know, The Spirit of God is many times working, where yet he doth not dwell. There is a great difference between tranſient motions, and conſtant manſions of Gods Spirit. Hypocrites and reprobates have the former, but not the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They that wrought miracles had the Spirit of God moving in them, but not dwelling in them: Even <hi>Balaam</hi> in that prophetical paſſage about <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had a tranſient motion, or a blaſt of this Spirit; but the Spirit of God did not abide in him: Yea hereby <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> being high Prieſt that year, was moved to ſay what he did, <hi>It's expedient for one to die for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> but yet he knew not what he ſaid. So that there is a great difference between the tranſient motion of Gods Spirit, and his conſtant inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus many, not truly ſanctified, have the common gifts of Gods Spirit; they have abilities in prayer, enlargements, ſome joyes, all which are of Gods Spirit moving in them, not dwelling in them. And truly this is a dangerous Rock, upon which many ſplit themſelves, taking tranſient gifts of Gods Spirit for permanent graces; ſometimes they are hardly diſcerned, as the Rockes that are under water. But of this necceſſary point more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:101245:118"/>Fifthly, The <hi>Spirit dwelling in us,</hi> doth denote, <hi>The intimateneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward efficacy it hath.</hi> It doth not onely dwell with us, but in us, which denoteth great intimateneſſe. Thus the Apoſtle often complaineth of the <hi>Law of ſinne that dwelt in him,</hi> Romans 7. becauſe of the inward natural power of it, that whenſoever he would doe good, evil was preſent with him: It was alwayes at hand to infect and pollute. So that by this is declared, how powerfull and inwardly efficacious the Spirit of God is in his people. Hence he is ſaid <hi>To make interceſſion with groanes unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Romans 8.26. which could not be without a wonderfull ſecret, and hidden deep working of the Spirit, even in the depths and bottome of our ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have heard, what the phraſe doth imply. Now let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew, <hi>How the Spirit of God dwels in his Church,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Wherein his dwelling doth manifeſt it ſelf.</hi> For, as original corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is alwayes breaking out; it's not a dull, idle ſinne; it's <hi>Peccatum actuoſum,</hi> though not <hi>actuale:</hi> So the Spirit of God is compared to <hi>fire,</hi> becauſe of the powerfull and active nature it hath in the people of God: <hi>Fire</hi> doth aſſimulate every thing to it ſelf: Thus men filled with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, are made exceeding ſpiritual, endeavouring to make all like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Now ſeveral wayes we may conſider of the <hi>Spirits dwelling in the people of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, There is an <hi>eſſential dwelling,</hi> or a <hi>gracious dwelling,</hi> by a ſpecial manifeſtation of more peculiar favours; we doe not ſpeak here of an <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> dwelling, for ſo the Spirit of God is every where, <hi>Whither can I flie from thy preſence?</hi> Pſal. 139.7. Thus he hath the ſame divine Attribute, as God the Father and the Sonne have. Thus he filleth the whole world; But we ſpeak of his <hi>gracious preſence.</hi> Now how to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his eſſential preſence, and his gracious preſence, is impoſſible for men to expreſſe, becauſe our knowledge of God is onely apprehenſive, not comprehensive. We ſee all the Schoolmen, labouring to this very day, to ſhew how an Angel is preſent, and yet they have not waded out of thoſe deeps. Onely thus much we may in ſobriety ſay, That though the Spirit of God be every where, yet he is ſaid to be in his Church, becauſe of thoſe peculiar and gracious operations, which he produceth in them, and no where elſe. Even as God is ſaid to be in Heaven, though he be in Earth, and no where elſe, becauſe there is a peculiar manifeſtation of more glory and power from him. Thus then we are firſt to conceive of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When the Spirit of God is ſaid to dwell in his Church, it may not onely be underſtood of the <hi>gracious effects thereof, but alſo of his Perſon likewiſe.</hi> And this indeed I finde a very ſublime and myſterious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute both among Papiſts and Proteſtants, <hi>Whether believers are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Perſon of the holy Spirit, or onely of his graces?</hi> According to many, all thoſe places, where we are ſaid to receive the Spirit, or to be full of the holy Ghoſt, they are extended no further than the gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt: But certainly, many places, as this in my Text, are to be underſtood of the Perſon of the holy Ghoſt. For it's the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (as we ſhewed) that is the ſame with God. Now the gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit are not the ſame with God: So we are ſaid to be a Temple of this Spirit; and a Temple doth relate to a God, and to a Perſon, not to graces meerly. So that we conclude, that opinion to be farre more true, and conſonant to Scripture, which makes us partakers even
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101245:119"/>
of the Spirit it ſelf, as we alſo are of Chriſt himſelfe, and not of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits onely that come by him: But the Scripture layeth downe this in a tranſcendent and myſtical manner, and it's by faith onely. So that thoſe who have fancied a tranſubſtantiation into the God-head; To be Chriſted with Chriſt, and Godded with God, or to be made the Spirit with the Spirit, have thought of a phyſical and natural union; as if a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were poured into the ſea, where as it is onely a moral union; even as the wife is made partaker not only of the husbands wealth, but the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band himſelf, yet not turned into his nature; and this compariſon the Scripture doth often uſe.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Spirit of God dwels</hi> two wayes in his Church:
<list>
                           <item>1. In reſpect of <hi>wonderfull and miraculous operations.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. In reſpect of <hi>ſaving and ſanctifying graces.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The former way the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was admirable, you may reade 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 14. <hi>&amp; alibi,</hi> of the plenty of gifts, and divers operations amongſt them; ſo that they ſeemed herein to excell all other Churches, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſanctifying graces, they ſeemed to be very defective; for the Apoſtle cals them babes, and complaineth he could not ſpeak unto them, as unto ſpiritual, ſo that this later way of Gods Spirit (as formerly you heard) dwelling in us, is moſt comfortable, and moſt to be regarded, though the other be more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The former did eſpecially belong to the Church in its firſt plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hence <hi>Acts</hi> 2. we reade of the accompliſhment of that glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. <hi>To pour out his Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. but now theſe miraculous operations are ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction.</hi> What Congregations, and what manner of perſons we ought to be. To be meer men cometh farre ſhort of being ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual men; we ought to be above ſenſe, and all humane principles. Take the moſt refined men for morality and civility, the choiſeſt for all humane abilities, yet without the Spirit of God, they are no more than <hi>Adams</hi> body, till life was brethed into him, no more than thoſe bones in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> till the Spirit of God gathered them together. Oh that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations conſiſted of ſpiritual men! <hi>Paul</hi> complained, <hi>He could not preach to them, but as carnal.</hi> The Spirit of God would lift thee up to other affections, other deſires. As the Spirit took ſome mens bodies, and lifted them up into the air; ſo would it doe to the ſoules of men; they had the Spirit of God, who ſaid, <hi>Our converſation is in Heaven.</hi> They had the Spirit of God, that did look for the coming of Chriſt: They had the Spirit of God, who had prayed with groanes unutterable, and who had joy unſpeakable: But oh we poor worms, and not ſpiritual men, cold clods of earth, deſtitute of Gods Spirit!</p>

                        <hi>And that the Spirit of God dwels in you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have heard, what this inhabitation of Gods Spirit in his Church doth <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> and how he may be ſaid to <hi>dwell in us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place, let us conſider the <hi>ſpecial Workes</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of Gods Spirit in his Church. For therefore partly hath he the name <hi>Spirit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that power and efficacy he hath in the Church. Hence he came downe in a mighty <hi>ruſhing winde, and cloven tongues of fire.</hi> So that he is called the <hi>Spirit internally,</hi> and <hi>externally; internally,</hi> for his perſonall character, whereby he proceeds from the Father, and the Sonne; <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> becauſe of thoſe admirable effects, and demonſtrations of his preſence in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſhall not ſpeak of theſe operations, which he hath <hi>as God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The ſpecial works and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in his Church.</note> in creating and conſervating of the world, but what are more <hi>peculiar to the Church</hi>; in which ſenſe he is called, <hi>The Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> Romans 8.9. becauſe Chriſt by his death did purchaſe ſuch gifts and graces for his people, the efficient whereof in an appropriated manner is the Spirit of God. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The very miniſterial functions and abilities to diſcharge them, are of the Holy Ghoſt in the Church.</hi> For although, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4.11. it's ſaid, That Chriſt after his Aſcenſion and triumph over Death and Hell, <hi>Gave gifts unto men:</hi> Even as great Emperours, when they ride in glorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, after a final Conqueſt over their enemies, uſe to diſtribute large favours and many bountifull ſignes of honour, yet becauſe upon his Aſcenſion, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the Spirit of God in his abſence, as the divine Vicar of Chriſt; therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. we find all operations and diverſities of them attributed to the holy Ghoſt: And <hi>Acts</hi> 25. the holy Ghoſt is ſaid, <hi>To make thoſe overſeers in the Church of Epheſus:</hi> So that what Church-officers, or what Church-ordinances, or order we have, and what Gifts and Abilities likewiſe there are to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them. Theſe are all of the holy Ghoſt, and of the holy Ghoſt three wayes:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In reſpect of their <hi>Inſtitution</hi> and being. For although it's by man, that ſuch and ſuch perſons are elected and ordained to this or that Office, yet the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of it ſelf is of the holy Ghoſt. They are not the Inſtitutions of men; nor may men appoint ſome Church-officers, which God hath not, becauſe their end is wholly ſupernatural: As it's ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. God hath ſet in his Church ſuch Officers, even as he hath ſet the Sunne and ſtarres in the firmament: ſo that all Officers lawfully called are of the holy Ghoſt, either immediately as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; or elſe mediately, by the order and deſignation of the Church. And as for their <hi>gifts,</hi> it's plain the extraordinary and miraculous gifts in the primitive times were from Gods Spirit. The Scripture often attributeth them to it:<note place="margin">Doubt.</note> Only now it may be doubted, Whether we can ſay, that the gifts and the abilities that Miniſters have now, are from the holy Ghoſt, becauſe they are got by humane ſtudy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry: And is there any more required to underſtand the Scripture, than any other humane Authour, <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>? Thoſe curſed wretches <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> who wrote againſt the Scripture, they underſtood what they were ſo invective againſt, yet it cannot be thought they were inabled by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Now to anſwer this,<note place="margin">Reſolution.</note> even thoſe natural abilities and humane indowments that men obtain by ſtudy, are a gift of God; they are a bleſſing which we ſee God giveth to ſome, and not to other: It's Gods mercy thou art not a natural fool,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101245:120"/>
a mad man; but when thou haſt more underſtanding, and better intellectual abilities than other, thou haſt a greater gift from God than others. Hence in our very ordinary phraſe, we ſay, ſuch an one hath an <hi>excellent gift</hi> in his memory, in his elocution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Scripture is clear, <hi>James</hi> 1.17. <hi>Every good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift cometh from the Father of lights,</hi> which is to be underſtood univerſally both of naturals and ſupernaturals; <hi>And what haſt thou, thou haſt not received?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. Hence in the Parable, all abilities, whether gracious or natural are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Talents,</hi> and are given by one Maſter. That is the firſt thing; even thoſe excellent abilities which the greateſt Heretiques and enemies to the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion had, were of God, though the ſinfull uſe of them came from the Devil, and their own corrupt hearts; They were talents of gold, and they made Idols of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>As the gifts and abilities Church-officers have, are from God, ſo the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scripture, and believing the ſenſe contained therein, is in a more particular manner a gift of Gods Spirit.</hi> For although the Spirit of God doth not give us the ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture in an extraordinary manner, <hi>viz.</hi> without the knowledge of the tongues, the comparing of places together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in and by theſe means the Spirit of God doth help us to underſtand the Scripture. I do not here ſpeak of a ſaving knowledge of the ſenſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>but a meer literal knowledge of the meaning thereof.</hi> This is plain by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>No man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12 3 The very hiſtorical believing of Scripture truths is from the Spirit of God. So that here is required a more peculiar and particular aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial abilities, for the opening of the Scripture, then for any humane Authour; becauſe the matter for the moſt part is ſpiritual and ſupernatural; and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as the Prophets and Pen-men ſpake or wrote, as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt, even to every ſyllable and word; ſo the ſame Spirit of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, though not in ſuch a meaſure to the underſtanding of it. Hence the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is promiſed, <hi>To lead us into all truth,</hi> John 16.13. Alas the greateſt men of parts and learning have many times been the greateſt Heretiques, and moſt ignorant of the Scripture, becauſe deſtitute of the Spirit: Yet on the other ſide, you muſt not runne into another extremity, as if the Spirit alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe helps God hath required, would lead us into truth: for that were to tempt God, and to expect a miracle. For give a Bible in Hebrew or Greek to a man, though enjoying Gods Spirit, yet he is not able to underſtand this or that Text, without the interpretation of the language. I have been more large on this, becauſe it's neceſſary to ſhew, with how much prayer and earneſt applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the throne of grace the Miniſters of God ſhould addreſſe themſelves to their work: without the Spirit of God guiding and leading of them, they are the ſhip that wants a winde; yea, though they have many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts, and much humane learning: They are but as a ſwift horſe without a rider, while they want Gods Spirit; and the faſter they runne, the more they are out of the way. So then, put the Spirit of God, and other helpes appointed by him together, and then you will never ſplit at any Rock.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As the gifts of the Miniſtry are thus efficiently from God, <hi>So dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively alſo they are from his Spirit.</hi> The guidance and ordering of the whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is from the Spirit of God. When <hi>Paul</hi> was reſolved to go to ſome place to preach the Goſpel, he was ſometimes forbidden by the Spirit, and directed to go to others, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.6, 9. Thus in the word of God, preached by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the Spirit of God did demonſtrate it ſelf, becauſe the Jews are ſaid to reſiſt it, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. therefore though it was firſt diſpenſed to the Jews, yet upon their neglect it was tranſplanted to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And thus truly every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101245:120"/>
every particular perſon, may wonderfully obſerve the divine guidance of the Miniſtry, that it ſhould come to ſuch a people, and not to ſuch; that thoſe who are unworthy, and trample upon it, as ſwine do the pearl, ſhould have it, and many a poor hungring and thirſting people, can never enjoy have or ſuch a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, eſpecially every godly hearer may obſerve a divine guidance of the Word in the matter preached, how near and ſeaſonably it comes to him. The unbeliever that came to the Church ordinances, ſaw his heart and thoughts ſo judged and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that he cried out, <hi>Verily God is among you,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.25. Thou ſitteſt and wondereſt, how the Miniſter ſhould fall on ſuch a point, how he ſhould be directed to ſuch a particular that doth ſo nearly concern thee; this makes thee ſay, <hi>Verily God is here.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Which is the laſt and greateſt, <hi>The efficacy and ſpiritual benefit of the Ordinances and gifts of Officers is wholly from the Spirit of God.</hi> Hence it is called the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> not only eſſentially, as the other Perſons are, or by way of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the unclean ſpirit, the Devil; but <hi>effectively,</hi> becauſe by way of title and Office (as it were) it belongs to him, to ſanctifie the gifts of the Miniſter, and to make them powerfull in the hearts of the hearers. So that although parts and abilities ſhould be in the Officers choice and power, yet the ſucceſſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is not: When <hi>Paul hath planted, Apollo watered, it's God that giveth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. And certainly, if the Phyſician cannot give health; the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener cannot make any fruit, only diſpoſeth and prepareth in theſe things; much leſſe can ſpiritual Officers in the Church cauſe the Word to open the eyes of the blinde, or ſoften the heart of thoſe that are hardened.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have ſeen how the Spirit of God dwels in the Church by reaſon of gifts only, and to be more affected with this, (though that of Graces be more excellent,) conſider,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the end of all theſe gifts thus vouchſafed by the Spirit, is only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withall, as the Apoſtle argueth,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.7. They are not for vain oftenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither are we to ſeek our ſelves by them, but they are to be improved for edification. Now that cannot be called profit, which is onely to pleaſe the ear, to tickle the fancy, but what is to convince the conſcience and change the heart and lives of men. Oh that this were conſidered both by Miniſter, and all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! It's ſpiritual profit, that is to be looked at. Hence the Word is compared to <hi>food,</hi> which is not for the eye, but the ſtomack. The more uſefull and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table the gifts of any are, either for inſtruction or reformation, the nearer they come to their due end.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider the plenty of theſe gifts under the New Teſtament.</hi> The Spirit of God inabled to all thoſe gifts and graces in the Old Teſtament; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were in a little pittance or meaſure, therefore the Goſpel is ſaid to be <hi>The time of the manifeſtation of the Spirit.</hi> So that it's a great ſhame and ſinne, if both Miniſters and people partake not more of the gifts of Gods Spirit, than in the Old Teſtament, and that ſo much groſſe ignorance and beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophaneneſſe doth overflow, is a great reproach unto the times of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The variety of them is alſo very admirable.</hi> The Apoſtle reckons up the diverſity of them. So that as it was an argument of <hi>Jacob's</hi> love to give <hi>Joſeph</hi> a party-coloured coat: Thus it is of Gods favour to beſtow ſuch diverſity of gifts. This makes the Church indeed to be in imbroidered garments.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The wiſdome of the Spirit is ſeen in that no one man hath all.</hi> As all men have not the ſame face, but ſome difference there is, which makes Gods providence admirable in this particular: So all have not the ſame gifts, ſome are for the word of Doctrine, ſome for the word of Exhortation; and all this is,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101245:121"/>
that there being a mutual excelling of one another, there might be no envy or ſchiſme in the body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction, What cauſe we Miniſters, and you people have, to pray for this Spirit of God, without which we preach in vain, and you hear in vain.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to God, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe thou go along with us, we will not go up.</hi> O Lord, if the preſence of thy Spirit be not with us, we cannot diſcharge thoſe duties, who is ſufficient to preach? Who is ſufficient to hear? Oh it ſhould be like a ſword in our bowels, to think we feel no more of him in our Aſſemblies! <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, O North winde, and blow, O South</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>that the ſpices may ſend forth their ſmell,</hi> Cantic. 4.16. Oh that the Spirit of God would thus ariſe in our hearts, that our gifts may be ſucceſſefull, that our graces may flouriſh!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And that the Spirit of God dwels in you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt ſort of the Spirits inhabitation in us, <hi>viz.</hi> by Gifts hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched.</p>
                     <p>We now come to the more noble and excellent way, which doth inſeparably accompany ſalvation, and that is the <hi>ſanctifying graces of Gods Spirit.</hi> By which indeed we may gather, That God dwels in us. For as when <hi>Daniel</hi> could ſo wonderfully open and interpret the Kings dreames, they ſaid, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the moſt high God was in him.</hi> So if you ſee a people heavenly, mortifying ſinne, walking in cloſe communion with God; you muſt needs conclude the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the moſt high God is in that man. It's not nature or moral virtues could raiſe him up to ſuch an high Pinacle as this is. And before we come to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular effects of Gods in-dwelling after this manner, it's good to obſerve the <hi>Emphatical expreſſions that the Scripture uſeth equivalent to this of dwelling in us.</hi> As <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. there it's called, <hi>Being in the Spirit,</hi> as here, <hi>The Spirit is in us:</hi> So there, we are in the Spirit. Now that phraſe is very emphatical, and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note, that all our luſts and ſinnes, yea our very ſelves are (as it were) ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and nothing but the Spirit of God works and moveth in us. To be in the Spirit, denoteth the great efficacy and powerfull dominion in us; as men are ſaid to be in ſinne, becauſe they no longer live, but ſinne, nothing but ſinne doth appear: ſo it ſhould be with the godly. The Spirit of God, not fleſh, not corruption, not carnal or worldly principles ſhould appear in them. As the Prophets in the time of their Propheſie, were ſaid to be <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> in an extaſie, minding no earthly or worldly thing. Thus ought we to be emptied of our ſelves, and filled with the Spirit of God. Therefore <hi>John</hi> 3. it's ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever is born of the Spirit, is Spirit,</hi> in the very abſtract. We have alſo (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4) pregnant expreſſions, <hi>To live in the Spirit, to walk in the Spirit, to be led by the Spirit.</hi> Oh let ſuch expreſſions as theſe make you aſhamed to ſee ſo much of a man, or carnal affections ſtirring in you! What believer hath theſe things in the full power thereof?</p>
                     <p>But to the Particulars:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Spirit of God dwels in us after a ſaving manner, in the general, <hi>By way of ſanctification of the Spirit, ſoul and body, even the whole man,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. This is the general. Every man is all over unclean, filthy, pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, full of enmity to what is holy. Now the Spirit of God that makes an univerſal ſanctification of all theſe. Hence by way of Office it's called, <hi>The Spirit of ſanctification,</hi> and the <hi>holy Spirit</hi>; as <hi>Creation</hi> is appropriated to the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> to the <hi>Sonne,</hi> ſo <hi>Sanctification</hi> to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So then, as Chriſt in reſpect of his body, is ſaid to be <hi>conceived
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:101245:121"/>
by the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; there was a preparing and ſanctifying of it for the Perſonal Union, and the work of Redemption: So the Spirit of God ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the ſoul of every godly man; it makes every part and faculty, prepared for holy Duties in an holy man: for as the ſoul is the life of the body, that can doe no vital action without it; So the Spirit is the life of the ſoul, and that can doe no ſpiritual action without it. Oh then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, all ye that heare, and ponder it in your hearts! Have you thus been conceived, and borne of the Spirit of God? Thy other birth will availe nothing, though borne rich or noble: Yea, Couldſt thou be borne a thouſand times, in a naturall way, thou wouldſt ſtill be a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wretched man. What is a good or ingenuous nature? What are excellent and choice abilities, if thou art not ſanctified by the Spirit of God? Doe not thinke theſe things are fancies and notions. The Spirit of God may as well be called a fancy, as his operations, fancies.</p>
                     <p>But more particularly, The Spirit of God dwels in a ſaving man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>By Illumination, and opening of the darke minde of every man.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is darkneſſe it ſelfe, he cannot diſcerne of ſpiritual things reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word, till the Spirit of God enlighten him. Therefore the worke of Gods Spirit is great upon the minde and underſtanding of a man, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth the ſoul of a man of thoſe things it never believed before, <hi>John</hi> 16.9. of <hi>ſinne,</hi> it makes a man ſee the woefull and damnable eſtate he is in. It's ſo plaine, that he cannot deny it; he believed and judged no ſuch thing once in him; but now ſuch light ſhineth in his breaſt, that he is a very dung-hill, a very hell to himſelf, and then he convinceth of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, (viz.)</hi> a Goſpel-righteouſneſſe by Chriſt. Now all his workes, all his good duties are <hi>dung and droſſe</hi>; all that Religion, he put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in, is abandoned by him, the Spirit of God convinceth him of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious righteouſneſſe <hi>without him,</hi> which onely is able to cover his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>Againe, Another ſpecial worke on the underſtanding is, <hi>To teach, to guide, and leade into all truth. We cannot ſay, Jeſus is the Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit,</hi> as you heard, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.3. Spiritual things muſt have a ſpirituall ability to diſcerne them. It's true, he leadeth in and by the uſe of meanes appointed; but yet he onely doth efficiently diſpell the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and worke faith to holy Truths. So then we ſee, it's the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall worke of Gods Spirit, not humane ability, to be directed into truth: And we muſt not onely ſtudy Books, but pray to God, and take heed of ſuch ſinnes, which may drive Gods Spirit from us; for then we are as a wilde horſe without a rider; like a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, without a Pilot.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Spirit of God quickens and reviveth thoſe graces, that by Regeneration were infuſed to us</hi>; compared therefore to the <hi>winde,</hi> as the blowing of that, makes the flowers of the Gardens to ſend forth their ſweet ſmels: So it's here. It's not enough to have the habit and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of grace within us; but we need a fervent and vigorous actuating of them. And therefore is the Holy Ghoſt compared to <hi>fire</hi>; and hence that phraſe, <hi>To be filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which is applied to the godly ſometimes, doth (as learned men obſerve) denote ſome actual and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous impreſſion upon their hearts: Their graces were now put forth in a lively vigorous way. Oh this is a bleſſed life, when a Chriſtian is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly filled with the Holy Ghoſt, that doth actually make his heart fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,

and burning in all its duties towards God! <hi>If this were the life of the godly man, there would not be ſuch complaints, ſuch feares, ſuch doubts: Oh they cannot tell what to ſay to themſelves!</hi> They are dull, heavy, earthly. Alas! all this is, becauſe the Spirit of God filleth not thy heart; if this were working, thou wouldſt be like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wheeles, that moved ſo ſwiftly, becauſe the Spirit was in them.

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Spirit of God doth enable us to kill and mortifie ſinne.</hi> Rom 8. <hi>If ye through the Spirit mortifie the deeds of the fleſh. Through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>] There is no ſinne ſo deare and beloved to thee, ſo ſtrong and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in thee, that is as thy owne ſoule to thee; but by the Spirit of God thou mayeſt mortifie it. Never then be afraid of thoſe great <hi>Anakims.</hi> Oh thou cryeſt out, I cannot believe, I cannot be heavenly minded! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thou canſt not; but the Spirit of God doth lift up his people to theſe things. Men by natural conſcience may leave many outward ſinnes, but they doe not, or cannot mortifie them; this is done by Gods Spirit onely. As onely by him they could caſt out Devils from the poſſeſſed; thus onely by him can they ſubdue ſuch ſinnes. We ſee then, why it is that ſo many reſolve never to ſinne again, to be ſuch beaſts any more, and and yet are overcome: Alas, they goe out in their owne ſtrength againſt theſe <hi>Goliahs.</hi> Oh therefore pray, and againe pray for the Spirit of God! O Lord! here is a luſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a ſinne dwels in me, as the <hi>Jebuſite</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> I know not how to be freed from it, gladly would I be heavenly, I cannot; I would be believing, I cannot; give that holy Spirit of thine unto me. Pray thus for the Spirit of God, more than for health, life, or any worldly advantage whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Spirit of God doth beſtow a filial and ingenuous ſpirit upon believers, whereby they are carried out upon Evangelical and Gospel grounds in their obedience to God.</hi> And this is a moſt precious worke, to be deſired more than all the world. An heart with ſlaviſh feares is an hell, where a man is a tormenting Devil to himſelf, and the guilt of ſinne is a gnawing worme that never dieth; but <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.6. <hi>He hath ſent his Spirit in our hearts, whereby we cry Abba Father</hi>; There is earneſtneſſe, and a Goſpel holy boldneſſe: Hence it is called, <hi>The Spirit of Adoption</hi>: Now how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and deſirable is this, when we through feare were ſubject to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, to have this Evangelical freedome of Spirit? The people of God ſhould pray and ſeek for this Spirit of Adoption, as well as of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. This would be <hi>oyle</hi> to the wheel; this would be <hi>wings</hi> and <hi>legs</hi> to thee.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Spirit of God workes comfort and joy in the hearts of the godly.</hi> Hence he is called, <hi>The Comforter,</hi> John 15.26. As the Devil delights to keepe us in darkneſſe and feares, therefore he had almoſt ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up the inceſtuous perſon with immoderate grief, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. So the Spirit of God delighteth to turne water into wine. <hi>Joy</hi> is a <hi>fruit</hi> of the Spirit of God, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.22. Yea, it's called, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſpeakable joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Doe not therefore thinke, that the Kingdome of Grace and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe lieth in a dejected ſpirit, in a troubled ſoule: No, it's in joy as well as in righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. Thoſe doubts and ſad thoughts that do lie like a burden and load upon thee, came not from the Spirit dwelling in thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="215" facs="tcp:101245:123"/>Sixthly, That we may have this boldneſſe and joy, the Spirit of God hath another effect, which is, <hi>To witneſſe and ſeale unto our ſpirits, that we are the children of God. Grieve not the Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed,</hi> Epheſ. 4.30. <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the ſonnes of God,</hi> Rom. 8.16. Oh what a bleſſed life is this, when all theſe works of Gods Spirit go along together, teaching, ſanctifying and comforting! This is the Mount of Transfiguration, <hi>It's good to be here.</hi> Doe not think theſe things are too great, and too good to be had in this life: For, if we be not wanting to our ſelves, if we bring our cruiſes, he is ready to pour in his oyl.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>The Spirit of God worketh wonderfull ſupport, and even glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious rejoycing in all afflictions and tribulations.</hi> Then, if ever, it's admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to ſee, what the Spirit of God doth in believers, <hi>The Spirit of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall reſt upon you,</hi> 1 Peter 4.14. If you reade of the Martyrs burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſtake; if of the perſecutions and torments they did with ſuch invincible joy and patience endure, it was from the Spirit of glory reſting on them. Alas, we think, if God ſhould exerciſe us with ſuch ſtraits, bring us into ſuch troubles, we could never bear them. Oh conſider, there is Gods Spirit, as well as thy ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Spirit of God doth worke the prayers of Gods people.</hi> Rom. 8. It's a Spirit of prayer and mourning; he teacheth <hi>what to pray,</hi> and <hi>how to pray</hi> for ſpiritual and heavenly things, with zeal, faith and importunity; It helps our infirmities, many ſins and corruptions are apt to ſpoil our prayers, he helpeth againſt them; yea he worketh groans unutterable; he moveth the very foundations of the ſoul; and thoſe prayers cannot but ſpeed, becauſe the Spirit knoweth the mind of God. All prayers are dead carkaſſes without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit moving upon them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Examination.</hi> Try whether thou art one, who haſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God thus dwelling in thee. Oh where is the man or woman that heareth us, that knoweth the meaning of theſe things! When Chriſt ſpake about eating his <hi>body,</hi> the <hi>Capernaites</hi> had a groſſe underſtanding therein; but ſaith our Saviour, <hi>The fleſh profiteth little, the Spirit giveth life,</hi> John 6.63. If Chriſt ſaid thus of his own body, than how much rather may we ſay, parts, duties, an outward Religion profiteth little? The <hi>Spirit giveth life,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Thou ſpeakeſt of Chriſt, and thou hopeſt he died for thee; ſee what the Scripture ſaith, <hi>If thou haſt not his Spirit, thou art none of his.</hi>

                     <p>For the ſinne ſuppoſed, <hi>If any man defile the temple.</hi> This is an alluſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to the cuſtom among the <hi>Jews</hi>; If any man defiled their Temple, the crime was capital; what accuſations were brought againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he brought in <hi>Greeks uncircumciſed</hi> into the Temple.

                        </gap>, an elegant alluſion. The ſinne and the puniſhment ſhall be both alike; ſome have rendered it <hi>corrupt,</hi> ſome <hi>vitiate,</hi> others <hi>deſtroy.</hi> This of our Tranſlators is very good: For ſeeing the truths of God and his Ordinances are pure, then it followeth all errours and falſe Doctrines are a pollution; as if you ſhould put droſſe to gold, or caſt mud into a pleaſant ſpring. Some Interpreters think the Apoſtle doth intend to an higher ſinne, then he named before: For (ſay they) <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. he ſpeaks of ſuch falſe Doctrines that did not overthrow the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, now ſuch a man may be ſaved, though difficultly, but <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. he nameth ſuch as ſtrike at the very <hi>root,</hi> and deſtroy the very Temple it ſelf.

There is no fire to cleanſe him, but to conſume him. Thus ſome. But it's more conſonant to take the words more general, and ſo they do better cohere.

                        <hi>That thoſe men who defile the Church of God with corrupt Doctrines, do highly provoke God to puniſh them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Text is an Argument <hi>à minori ad majus:</hi> If the defilers of the material Temple did not eſcape Gods puniſhments, as <hi>Athaliah</hi> for prophaning the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> the holy veſſels of the Temple; then much leſſe ſhall they eſcape, who pollute the Church of God by any ſuch falſhoods: And we reade that our Saviour did in this ſhew his anger, and wrought a miracle by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; and another particular, namely curſing the fig-tree. In theſe two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did Chriſts miracles tend to deſtruction or puniſhment; all the other were full of mercy and healing. For when they had defiled the Temple, <hi>and made it a den of thieves</hi>; twice our Saviour made a whip, and ſcourged them out, which <hi>Hierom</hi> doth admire, as a greater miracle than any other our Saviour did, that a man unarmed and contemptible, ſhould chaſe away ſuch a multitude of men, and in that matter of their profit, making no reſiſtance, but barely asking, <hi>By what power he did theſe things?</hi> No doubt the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was then guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:101245:124"/>
horrible and grievous crimes of injuſtice, adulteries; but Chriſt takes no notice of that, but goeth preſently to the Temple, to reforme there; and this is attributed to the godly zeal that was in him, which did <hi>even eat him up, John</hi> 2.17.</p>
                     <p>For the opening of the Doctrine, let us conſider,<note place="margin">Why errors are ſaid to defile Gods Church.</note> 
                        <hi>Why falſe Doctrines are a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, why they are called corruptions</hi>; For ſo in the Old Teſtament Idolatry is often called; men are ſaid to have <hi>corrupted their wayes by falſe worſhip</hi>; and this will be good, to take off that lovely painting and alluring dreſſe, which ſome would put upon their errors and ſuperſtitions. Now they are called <hi>defilings</hi> and <hi>corruptions,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>From the pure nature of Gods truth, and his worſhip, which falſhoods do ſtaine, and take away the glory of.</hi> You ſee the Apoſtle compareth them to gold and precious ſtone. Now to take theſe, and to throw them into the dirt, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing of them; Gods word is ſaid to be <hi>more pure than gold ſeven times refined; yea more to be deſired than fine gold,</hi> Pſal. 19.10. Chriſt commends his Doctrine under the notion of <hi>living water,</hi> John 4.10 the pure running ſtreams of the brook. Now all falſe Teachers they throw in <hi>mud</hi> and <hi>dirt</hi> to theſe; as the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> did earth into thoſe Wells that <hi>Iſaac</hi> digged for his cattel. Every pure thing is made impure, when mingled with any thing of a more ſordid and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our nature, as gold with leade, wine with water, water with mud So then, though men give glorious Titles and Names to their falſhoods, as excellent Truths, glorious Lights; yet indeed they are no more than defilements and pollutions. Oh then, how humble tender and carefull ought men to be? Are the Truths and Ordinances of God by inſtitution, and in their original ſo pure? Come not then with thy ſoul hands, to handle ſuch precious things.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>They are called defilements and pollutions, Becauſe the truths and Church of God are not only pure, but dedicated and appropriated to him, as the only object.</hi> So that they are holy as well as pure; and in this notion the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders them. So that it's a ſacrilegious defilement, to take the Truths and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or worſhip of God, and by thy carnal and ſinfull imaginations to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them. And here we may ſay in another ſenſe, <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doeſt thou commit ſacriledge?</hi> Thou that art againſt Popery, againſt the Idolatry of the Maſſe, and other abominable things: Doeſt thou ſacrilegiouſly pervert the holy Truths and Ordinances of God by ſinfull and corrupt opinions? Certainly, if this were believed, men would not ſo prophanely diſpute and dally in the holy things of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Errours and hereſies may well be called defilements, Becauſe they are a diſeaſe, and ſo ſpread over the Church.</hi> The Scripture compareth them not to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of diſeaſe, but that which is moſt mortal and dangerous, even a Cancer. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus, Whoſe word eateth like a canker,</hi> 3 Tim. 2.17. The Leproſie in the Old Teſtament, of which <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. there is ſo much ſpoken, is acknowledged by Divines to typifie hereſie and errours; and as that did infect and make the very garments unclean, that they were to be waſhed or burnt: ſo the Apoſtle alludes to this, <hi>Jude verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>Hating even the garment that is spotted by the fleſh.</hi> See what thoughts we are to have of all errours and hereſies; we are no to touch the garment of the fleſh, that is, we are not to come near ſuch, as it's ſaid, <hi>Come out of Babylon,</hi> becauſe of her Church-corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, <hi>and touch no unclean thing,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.17. Thus you ſee, that you are not only to take heed of def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ng your ſelves with errours, but becauſe they are a Leproſie, a ſpreading filthineſſe; you are not to come near the temptations; be as much afraid of ſuch an one, as of one with a plague ſore running upon him. That very phraſe, <hi>Whoſe word eats like a canker,</hi> ſhould much terrifie women, who by ſeeming pretences are apt to be miſ-led: What a dangerous thing is a canker in thy breſt? But as ſoon as thou haſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any errour, thou haſt got a canker in thy heart. So that if it were onely a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101245:125"/>
pollution it was not ſo terrible; but here is a killing diſeaſe with this pollution: If therefore thou loveſt thy ſoul, flee from errours; and the more difficult it is to know, when it is an errour, the more art thou to be afraid: In <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. you ſee it was a very hard matter to diſcern between the <hi>Leproſie,</hi> and any other diſtemper; ſome had not the <hi>Leproſie,</hi> it was only a <hi>ſcab</hi>; ſo ſome do not runne into groſſe and damnable hereſies, but yet they have a ſcab, a loathſome diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per upon them. Theſe things being the truths of Scripture, and not the words of men pleading for their own intereſt and reputation, ſhould much prevail with you.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>They are defilements, Becauſe they pollute the conſcience, minde, heart, and whole life of a man.</hi> Hence you have that phraſe, <hi>Men of corrupt minds,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 Tim. 3.8. <hi>Deſtitute of the truth.</hi> Thus <hi>mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> alſo are ſaid to be <hi>defiled,</hi> Tit. 1.15. So that the corruption of a man by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours is a Metaphore from the body, which through ſickneſſe or death is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> Act 2.17. That as from the dead body worms and putrid vermine grow and live: So from minds corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted and deſtitute of truth, do flow theſe erroneous Doctrines. Thus not only wickedneſſe may denominate men to be dead, <hi>Let the dead bury the dead,</hi> Mat. 8.22. And the <hi>wanton widow is dead while ſhe liveth,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.6 but even the <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>heretical</hi> minde is dead, while it ſeemeth to have much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> And truly bodily corruptions in ſome ſenſe are not ſo great as the corruptions of minde and conſcience. The Apoſtle in the ſecond Epiſtle, makes <hi>luſtfull and libidinous waies</hi> to <hi>defile the body of a man,</hi> which is <hi>Gods Temple</hi>; but here, you ſee er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and corrupt opinions <hi>defile the ſoul,</hi> that is the more noble Temple of the Holy Ghoſt. So that theſe mind-defilements, make thy diſeaſe the more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. This putteth out the eye; this kils the ſpy and monitor of all thy actions.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Corrupt Doctrines are called defilements, to ſhew how loathſome and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable they ſhould be to us.</hi> To hear the Scripture ſay, That by falſe Doctrines the Church is polluted and defiled, ſhould make a man preſently abhorre ſuch waies. Thou canſt not abide dirt or vomit upon thy garments, and canſt thou endure theſe deformities upon thy ſoul? Thou canſt not endure to ſee a drunkard wallowing like a ſwine in the mire, but to ſee men ſtagger and reel, and even be drunk with giddy and vile opinions, this ſhould be a more loathſome ſight. Labour then for a Scripture judgment in theſe things, and do not thou have more indulging thoughts towards errours, then the Scripture alloweth. I do not forbid thy charity to ſome perſons erring, but to errours. If a godly man ſhould be overtaken with drunkenneſſe or uncleanneſſe, thou wouldſt ſay, the ſinnes were abhominable, though thou wouldſt pitty the man, and pray for him; ſo it is here.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction,</hi> Wherein lyeth the purity of Churches? Even in pure and ſound Doctrine, as well as in pure lives. Some, they cry out againſt purity in lives, they love not ſuch <hi>Puritans</hi>; they cannot endure ſuch ſtrictneſſe: Others, they love not this purity of Doctrine. The Remonſtrants deride the word Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, as if it were a ſpell uſed by ſome Writers. Now in both waies we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the purity of Churches. To have pure Doctrine, pure Ordinances, and yet men to be impure in lives, is a very dolefull ſight. Again, to have men appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with pure lives, yet impure Doctrines, is alſo very grievous to him who is endowed with a ſound Faith.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Her fore-tels, that as in the Old Teſtament there were <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> ſo in the New Teſtament, notwithſtanding all the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Truths of God revealed in his Word,</hi> there ſhould be <hi>falſe Teachers</hi>; here you ſee, it's expreſſely fore-told, that it ſhould be no ſtumbling block to us: we ſhould not be offended at the truth, nor at reformation out of Popery and ſuperſtitions, becauſe of ſuch events.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe are deſcribed by their <hi>Actions, They ſhall bring in damnable hereſies</hi>: Connder that expreſſion. All hereſie is not innocent: It's not excuſable, as the Remonſtrants plead; for here are <hi>damnable hereſies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Manner how,</hi> they ſhall <hi>privily bring in.</hi> There is great craft and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty; there is underworking, as Moles do under-ground.</p>
                     <p>Then you have the <hi>conſequent evil</hi> of this, <hi>They bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</hi> Here is more then in my text, not only <hi>deſtruction,</hi> but <hi>ſwift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> That is two waies <hi>ſwift</hi>:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe God will not delay</hi>: He is ſo provoked, that he cannot bear them long. And then</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Swift in regard of their thoughts</hi>: It comes before they thought of, or expected any ſuch thing. And whereas it may be ſaid, <hi>They proſper,</hi> they meet with no ſuch viſible wrath of God, ſee verſe 4. <hi>Whoſe judgment lingereth not, and whoſe damnation ſleepeth not.</hi> All the while they are ſecure, their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth but watch the time, the fitteſt time to make their deſtruction more dreadfull.</p>
                     <p>Now that ſtill people may be afraid of errours and hereſies, he inſtanceth in three the moſt horride Examples of Gods vengeance; and argueth thus, <hi>that if God were ſo ſevere againſt them, let not ſuch as bring in damnable hereſies expect better.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt from the <hi>Angels, God ſpared not them,</hi> but did <hi>caſt them down into Hell, and bound them in chaines of darkneſſe.</hi> The Angels ſinnes, were ſinnes
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:101245:126"/>
of the mind, they were intellectual ſubſtances; and ſo hereſies and their ſinnes are much alike. Do not then ſay, Hereſie is no drunkenneſſe, no whoredome, no bodily prophaneneſſe, no more was the Angels ſinne; it was an intellectual ſinne, and yet for that they are perpetually condemned.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond inſtance of <hi>Gods Judgment,</hi> is, <hi>The Old World,</hi> which God <hi>drowned</hi> with <hi>water.</hi> All mankind had perverted its waies, and even defiled the world, and God waſheth it with the waters of his Judgments. So that the overflowing of hereſies, is like the corruption of the Old World.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, He compareth them to the <hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> whoſe ſinnes were ſo great, that God did <hi>rain Hell</hi> out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to be avenged on them. Who then can excuſe or plead for ſuch defilements, the ſinners wherein are compared to thoſe three, who received the greateſt expreſſions of Gods wrath moſt ſignally upon themſelves? Thus this Chapter is a Comment upon my Text.</p>
                     <p>To open this Truth, <hi>viz. God will deſtroy ſuch a defiler.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, This is to be underſtood <hi>Conditionally; unleſſe that man ſee and bewail his errours, and forſake them.</hi> No doubt but <hi>Luther</hi> and many of the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, who came out of Popery, were great defilers of the Temple of God; but when God did open their eyes, and diſcover the truth, then none were more zealous then they, to make the Church, that was a den of thieves, an Houſe of Prayer. How often did <hi>Luther</hi> bewail that blindneſſe, and that damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour which was upon him in the time of his Popery, and <hi>Melan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that this threatning is to be interpreted as all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt any wicked man. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. <hi>If the unrighteous or wicked man leave his ſinnes, he ſhall live.</hi> God will not remember his former i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the Reſurrection of Chriſt is a main Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Religion, take this away, and our reſurrection and all our comforts fall to the ground; yet many of the Apoſtles did not for a while believe it: and generally they erred in this fundamental, they took Chriſts Kingdom for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral one, and looked for a temporal Reſtauration: but yet the godly, though at any time thus plunged into a damnable way, have this difference from wicked men who are turned aſide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How a godly man erring, differeth from a wicked man.</note>Firſt. <hi>There is a ſeed of grace within them,</hi> which though for a while it lieth aſleep, yet at laſt will put forth it ſelf. <hi>He cannot ſinne, becauſe the ſeed abideth in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. As the ſpirits of Wine will at laſt work out all poiſon. So that as a man, who hath reaſon in him, may be taught what he knew not, when a bruit beaſt cannot, becauſe there is the ſeed of Reaſon upon which the teacher doth work. So it's here; in a godly man there is the principle of grace, and this ſpark will at laſt take fire, though for the preſent it be much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The godly, though plunged into ſome damnable errour, yet are under a Promiſe to recover them, which will certainly take effect.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> expoſed to the water, had his Mothers eye upon him to ſee he ſhould not be drowned; ſo though a godly man be plunged deep in evil waies, yet there is Gods eye and Gods hand ready to deliver him. <hi>If it were poſſible, they ſhould deceive the very
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101245:126"/>
Elect,</hi> Mat. 24. <hi>If it were poſſible,</hi> now what makes it impoſſible, not the godly man himſelf: Alas, he hath ſo much ignorance, pride, and corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that by what reaſon they are plunged into any foul errour, by the ſame they would alwaies continue therein, and be for ever ſuffocated. It's only Gods gracious Promiſe, <hi>He will leade them into the truth; he will give them the ſpiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The godly mans heart is not commonly ſo obſtinate and ſeared, as the wicked mans is.</hi> Thoſe that brought in the doctrines of Devils into the Church, are ſaid to have <hi>a ſeared conſcience,</hi> 1 Tim 4.2. They felt nothing, they did not doubt or ſuſpect, [What if this be a damnable errour that thou maintaineſt? What if thou art a means, not only to damn thy ſelf, but many others?] No; they are commonly men of a <hi>reprobate mind.</hi> But the godly, though grievouſly ſeduced, yet ſometimes they have ſtruglings, they have an holy jealouſie over themſelves; they bewail their proneneſſe to erre. Even as it is in groſſe ſinnes, the godly man ſinneth not with that hearty and full conſent that others doe.</p>
                     <p>A third thing to open this point,<note place="margin">Errour and erroneous perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</note> is to conſider a <hi>difference between the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Temple by falſe Doctrines.</hi> Some are only in acceſſory and <hi>leſſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall</hi> things, and ſuch were thoſe who built <hi>bay and ſtubble</hi>; their errours were conſiſtent with ſalvation: <hi>He ſhall be ſaved, but ſo as by fire.</hi> But others are <hi>Fundamental, deſtroying the very ſoul and eſſence of true Faith and true Piety.</hi> Now the latter are ſuch whom God will certainly deſtroy. I know it is that Queſtion, which hath kept ſo many learned men, like <hi>Abrahams</hi> Ramme, in the thickets, what are <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> what points are <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> and what <hi>not</hi>: but though it be hard to parcell out the number, yet that there are ſuch, the Scripture is plain, in that it cals them <hi>firſt Principles,</hi> and tels us of a <hi>Foundation</hi> which <hi>muſt be laid</hi>: Of which formerly.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>In defiling the Temple of God, here is great difference to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe that are the Seducers and the Seduced.</hi> There was a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the rebellion of <hi>Abſolom</hi> the head of it, and ſuch as followed him in the ſimplicity of their hearts. <hi>Lyrinenſis</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the Authours of many Hereſies were damned, whoſe Diſciples or followers might be ſaved.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> doth evidently make a diſtinction of perſons that erre: <hi>Of ſome have compaſſion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a difference,</hi> Jude verſ. 22.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Church defilements make men further off, or nearer to perdition, as they enjoy the meanes, and as they have opportunity to know better.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſins were ſo inexcuſable, becauſe they had light; inſomuch that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If he had not come, they had not had ſinne,</hi> Joh. 15.24. Therefore an Heretique, <hi>after the firſt or ſecond Admonition, is to be rejected,</hi> Tit. 3.10. Thoſe then are neareſt to perdition, who after Admonition and Information, do ſtill continue refractory.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Of all thoſe who defile the Temple, and are marked out for perdition, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> it is, and his party that are the great defilers of Gods Temple: He is alled <hi>The man of Perdition,</hi> (2 Theſ. 2.3.) both <hi>actively</hi> and <hi>paſſively: Actively,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a means to deſtroy ſo many thouſand ſouls; and <hi>paſſively,</hi> becauſe he is appointed by God to remarkable deſtruction. Take heed therefore thou art not found in the number of that Antichriſtian ſociety, which is marked out by God for deſtruction. <hi>Come out of Babylon, leaſt you be partakers of her plague,</hi> Rev. 18.4.</p>
                     <p>If you ask <hi>why God ſhould be thus provoked by corruptions in truth or worſhip,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Why God is ſo provoked with corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worſhip.</note> the <hi>Reaſon</hi> is plain; <hi>Becauſe his Glory is more immediately interreſted in theſe things.</hi> Practical godlineſſe and obedience are acceptable, but his truth and his worſhip, are that which immediately relate to him. Herein his <hi>jealouſie</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>drawn out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Admonition.</hi> Pray and take heed you fall not from your ſtedfaſtneſſe, and be led aſide with the errours of the wicked: You ſee here is no dallyance, no wantonneſſe allowed in this matter; God <hi>will deſtroy.</hi> Art thou not afraid of Gods wrath, of Gods vengeance? If it were but the anger of a man, or the perſecution of a man, it might be endured; but God, who is a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> he will never bear this: He will not endure this. This Text would be like a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſword to keep men from falſe and erroneous waies, if duly conſidered. This is that which undoeth us, people are either very ſottiſh and ſtupid, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding any thing of Religion at all; or if they do, they do not with that ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, that humility, that fear and trembling, addreſſe themſelves to know Gods truths as they ought to do. There is a prophane, proud, unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied frame of heart upon us, and then then no wonder we defile his Temple.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Him ſhall God deſtroy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the puniſhment threatned to the Temple-defilers, and though but two words, <hi>God deſtroy,</hi> yet both have their weight. There are many evils and calamities that yet are not a deſtruction, that is the utmoſt of all paenall evils; and then, it's a deſtruction from God, whoſe wrath is like himſelf, Incomprehenſible: It's not man, but <hi>God ſhall deſtroy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now what this <hi>deſtruction</hi> is, we have told you; <hi>not</hi> an annihilation of ſoul and body, as <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it; <hi>not</hi> a Phyſical deſtruction, but <hi>moral,</hi> viz. <hi>depriving the wicked man of all happineſſe and comfort.</hi> We have handled this <hi>relatively</hi> already, as it is the Portion of the Temple-defilers, I ſhall now conſider it <hi>abſolutely: Eternal wrath and damnation</hi> is deſcribed here under the name of <hi>deſtruction,</hi> which is the reward of every wicked impenitent man, whether his ſinnes be intellectual or bodily. And the Doctrine I ſhall raiſe, is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Of Eternal Damnation.</note>
                        <hi>That Eeternal Damnation is the Deſtruction of a man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's the undoing of a man for ever. This Doctrine or Truth, hath a ſting in it; and becauſe men are generally ſo bruitiſh and feared in their evil waies, I do the rather pitch upon it, becauſe truths that are of a more ſublime nature, do not ſo eaſily penetrate.</p>
                     <p>Let us then <hi>improve</hi> this, <hi>Eternal Damnation is the Deſtruction of a man.</hi> It's the eternal undoing of a man.</p>
                     <p>To clear this, conſider,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is the Scriptures way to repreſent Hell and Damnation under all thoſe evils that are most terrible to ſenſe, as on the contrary, Heaven is deſcribed by ſuch nams as do uſually delight moſt men.</hi> Hence it's called a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and a <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> and a <hi>City paved with precious ſtones.</hi> Theſe are condeſcending expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to us, who are apt to apprehend nothing great and admirable, but what is ſo to ſenſe; and were not our natural corruption ſo greatly prevailing over us, ſuch Scripture baites would ſoon take us. As it is thus for Heaven, ſo for the contrary, <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>eternal damnation</hi> is deſcribed by all ſuch terrible Objects, that the very naming of them, ſhould fill us with great horrour; and do not think theſe are vain ſcare-crows, no; theſe expreſſions do no more repreſent to the full, the torment and pain of the damned indeed, then a painted fire doth a reall burning fire. Whatſoever the Scripture ſaith of this deſtruction of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, doth not ariſe up in the leaſt manner, to the torment indeed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the meditation and preaching of this ſubject may be profitable, ſet

                        <hi>Faith</hi> on work; believe there is ſuch a ſtate of deſtruction coming upon impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men, that all the undoing we can have in this life, is nothing to that eternal undoing. Let <hi>Faith</hi> warm and heat thy heart with this, and it will work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully to thy reformation. If <hi>to die be a thing of terrour,</hi> what is <hi>eternal death?</hi> What is <hi>eternal deſtruction? If skin for skin, and all that a man hath, he will give for his life,</hi> how much rather for this <hi>eternal life?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, This deſtruction conſiſts in two things,
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>The good it's privative of.</hi> And</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>The evil it's poſitive of.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Schoolmen call it the <hi>puniſhment of loſſe,</hi> and the <hi>puniſhment of ſenſe.</hi> The Scripture brings in God inflicting both, in that terrible ſentence at the Day of Judgment, <hi>Depart from me, into eternal fire,</hi> Mat. 25.41. <hi>Depart from me,</hi> there is the <hi>privation</hi> of all good; <hi>Into eternal fire,</hi> there is the <hi>poſition</hi> of all evil and miſery. Divines have diſputed which is the greateſt evil of theſe two; but <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> anſwers, <hi>The privation of Gods face, is farre worſe then all the torments in Hell</hi>: That <hi>Depart from me,</hi> is more terrible then <hi>eternal fire.</hi> Certainly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a deſtruction is coming, how much doth it concern all to <hi>watch and pray</hi> about it? <hi>Deſcendamus in infernum viventes, ne deſcendamus morientes,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Bernard</hi>) <hi>Let us deſcend into Hell while alive by meditation, leſt we really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend thither when we die.</hi> But <hi>ſingularia ſunt quae pungunt.</hi> Let us therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>What loſſe it is.</hi> Firſt, that this deſtruction doth conſiſt in: And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>It's the loſſe of God,</hi> in whom only is all happineſſe. <hi>Depart from me.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>loſſe.</hi>

                        <hi>At his right hand are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. To be with God, and to enjoy him, is that happineſſe which <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor can the heart of a man conceive</hi>: For ſuch as God himſelf is, ſuch is the enjoying of him. He is the <hi>bonum in quae omnia bona, bonum quo nihil melius cogitari poteſt</hi>: The <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</hi> The beings of all created comforts that are ſcattered up and down, and parcelled in creatures, with their ſeveral imperfections, are united and conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him in tranſcendent perfection only. To repreſent what God is, and the enjoyment of him, would be to empty the Ocean with a ſhell. Then do we beſt eſteem of him, when we judge him ineſtimable. Now our deſtruction lyeth, in being deprived of all that good which God would have been to us. Oh, with what indignation and anger ſhould a wicked man look upon his ſins! You have deprived me of God, and do you ask what I aile? My luſts, my wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, have taken God from me, how can I then but rore out? Would theſe be as good as a God to me? This ſhould make thee caſt off all ſinne, as <hi>Paul</hi> did the <hi>Viper,</hi> ſaying, Wilt thou be as good, as great, as all-ſufficient to me as God would be if I do ſerve him?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>This privative deſtruction, lyeth in the want of all comfort and peace, and joy that might be in the ſoul.</hi> Take away the Sunne, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth nothing but horrible darkneſſe; take God away, and the ſoul is full of all darkneſſe and horrour. Hence in Hell are ſaid to be <hi>gnawing wormes, and weeping and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth. Dives</hi> deſired but a <hi>drop of water to coole his tongue,</hi> and but the <hi>top</hi> of his <hi>tongue,</hi> yet could not obtain it; not a <hi>drop,</hi> and for the <hi>top</hi> of the <hi>tongue.</hi> This was to ſhew that there could not be the leaſt comfort, the leaſt eaſe, the leaſt quietneſſe of conſcience; and indeed this is the great part of Hell. Some have thought Hell to be nothing but the torments and horrour of conſcience, but the Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo be put off Yet certainly, this is the Hell of Hell, the greateſt part of deſtruction, that the guilt of a mans ſinnes ſhall perpetually gnaw and teare his conſcience, which will then be awakened, and will fall like ſo much ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lead into the eye of a man. And if a <hi>good conſcience be a continual Feaſt,</hi> that tormenting diſquieted conſcience in Hell, will be a continual unſpeakable

Oh, we ſee but what the very drops of this torment hath wrought upon men! <hi>Cain</hi> went up and down <hi>trembling,</hi> all the pleaſures, all the delights, and travils he took, could not drive out that <hi>trembling. Judas,</hi> with what horrour doth he cry out? He cannot <hi>beare</hi> his <hi>burden.</hi> And therefore the damned brought in, <hi>crying to the mountains to cover them, and the hils to hide them,</hi> Rev. 6.16. Oh, is this nothing to you, or a light matter, who ſit and hear theſe things! Thoſe groſſe and foul ſinnes, which now make no torment nor gripings in thy conſcience; thou canſt runne into all beaſtly exceſſe, and thou findeſt no gnawing worms upon thee: Oh, conſider, and believe it, the time is coming when conſcience will be awakened, and not the leaſt corner of thy ſoul will be freed from tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and howlings! Go on then, and <hi>eat and drink,</hi> and care for none of theſe things; but remember this, deſtruction will fall upon thee whether thou wilt or no. Oh, that men would pitty themſelves! Or rather; Oh, that God would pitty your ſouls, and make you to conſider the latter end of your ſinnes! At laſt they will bite like an Adder, and ſting like a Serpent.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is a loſſe of all outward help and comfort from others.</hi> Here in this world, though we many times are in grievous loſſes, yet ſome comfort from a friend, is like the pleaſant ſhowers to the parched ground; and though they cannot deliver out of trouble, yet a word of comfort doth much refreſh. But here the deſtroyed ſinner is excluded from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and friends, and all. When <hi>Abſolom</hi> was ſhut out of <hi>Davids</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, then there was a <hi>Joab</hi> to mediate for favour again, but when this deſtruction is, then no Saint or Angel can either comfort or help us: Yea, which is ſaddeſt of all, then that Mediatory Office of Chriſt doth ceaſe. Then there is no Advocate to make Interceſſion; then the Blood of Chriſt will do no good. In the midſt of all that guilt and trouble for ſinne we have in this life, there is ſtill this hope, That Chriſt is a Mediatour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God and the ſinner; but when this eternal deſtruction ſhall come upon thee, then there is no more hope, or help by Chriſt, then Chriſt is of no more uſe, or advantage to thee: So that the loſſe of all help, and all hope through Chriſt, muſt needs make this deſtruction more terrible.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The pain of ſenſe.</note>And as for the ſecond part of this Deſtruction, which is <hi>Poſitive, That lieth in the accumulation and heaping up of all miſery imaginable and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, even for a God to inflict, or the ſoule and body of man to receive.</hi> It's (I ſay) in the heaping up of all miſery: For the ſtate of bleſſedneſſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in any one, or many comforts, but in the aggregation of all deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mercies. So this ſtate of deſtruction lyeth not in the ſuſtaining of one, or many miſeries, but the aggregation and conflux of all. Therefore the Scripture expreſſeth it under many names of terrour: ſometimes <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, utter darkneſſe</hi>; ſometimes a <hi>priſon,</hi> and <hi>chaines of darkneſſe</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; ſometimes <hi>fire and brimſtone, eternal fire</hi>; ſometimes a <hi>place</hi> of <hi>weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wailing,</hi> and <hi>gnaſhing of teeth</hi>; ſometimes <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting death</hi>; ſometimes <hi>judgement and condemnation.</hi> Now the Scripture uſeth not theſe words in vaine, but would hereby awaken and terrifie us, that we might at laſt caſt away our ſinnes, which are the onely fuell for this fire.</p>

Devils at laſt, after thouſands of yeares torments could prove true, here was ſome hope; but it's a living death, and a dying life, it's everlaſting fire, it's the worme that never dieth. In all earthly calamities, on this ſide Hell, this is a mitigation, that they are not everlaſting, they are but evil for a moment, there will be an end. But here thou art kept alive to be tormented for ever. Oh what a thunder bolt is that word <hi>for ever!</hi> Torment for ever! Horrour for ever! Fire for ever! yet ſo it is.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Univerſal.</note> There is not the leaſt mixture of any joy, of any hope. For as Heaven is a ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed happineſſe, there cannot a drop of gall fall into that ocean of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe: So here, there cannot a drop of honey fall into that ocean of gall; we told you not a drop of water for the top of the tongue only could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, much leſſe for the whole body.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It's an Inevitable Deſtruction.</hi> God will deſtroy,<note place="margin">Inevitable.</note> Who can ſtop Gods hand? Who can hinder his blow?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Of Inſtruction.</hi> Here is a plain and evident diſcovery of the madneſſe and folly of wicked men, that will drink, ſwear, and walk in all their bruitiſh luſts. What haſt thou not heard of this deſtruction from God? What doſt thou not believe that after all theſe pleaſures of ſinne, God will deſtroy thee? We would wonder what a ſenſleſſe, bruitiſh and irrational a creature a wicked man is, that ſhould be no more afraid of this deſtruction. Tell him of a temporal undoing, he ſhall be undone in his eſtate, in his life, and you make his heart as cold as a ſtone within him; but tell him ſoul and body ſhall be undone in fire and brimſtone, and that for ever, he makes no matter of it; And why is all this?

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>If men do believe it, yet becauſe it's apprehended as a farre off, it's not preſent and imminent upon us, as many times temporal deſtruction is</hi>; and therefore like bruit beaſts they regard only the preſent: Give me to day (ſay they) though to morrow I be damned for ever.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Men are either plunged in beſotting luſts, or in the ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing temptations of the world.</hi> Many men are become like beaſts through ſinne.

                     <p>We now come to the Reaſon, Why God is ſo exceedingly provoked againſt Temple defilers. The ground is, <hi>Becauſe Gods temple is holy.</hi> Holy things are not to be violated, they are to be handled in an holy manner, <hi>Sancta ſanctè ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis.</hi> Holy things belong to holy men, and are to be uſed in an holy manner by ſuch.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This Doctrine hath its great uſe. For once in Gods Church, while Popery and her principles reigned, all the holineſſe ſpoken of, preached for, pleaded for principally, was holineſſe of things, not perſons; holy Temples, holy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, holy Images; but reall, perſonal holineſſe, which God commands, was deſpiſed and oppoſed. <hi>The Kingdome of God doth not come by obſervation,</hi> that is, we are not to look for external ſenſible pomp and glory, <hi>but it is within you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10.

                        <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tabernacle and Temple.</note>Firſt, <hi>That God, while the people of Iſrael were unſettled, and their enemies were not fully conquered, appointed an ambulatory Tabernacle for his worſhip.</hi> This was the place to worſhip him in, and the Ark in it, was carried up and down likewiſe, and none might carry it, but men, even the Levites. So that when it was put on a Cart, and ſo carried, God was greatly diſpleaſed. The reaſon (ſay ſome) why men onely were enjoyned to carry it, was, that it might not at any time fall. For being a token of Gods preſence and power, if that had fallen, it would have been a reproach to the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But when God came to ſettle the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they had fully ſubdued their enemies, and the Government of the Land was eſtabliſhed; then God would have a <hi>Temple</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And though <hi>David</hi> had a deſire to build it, yet becauſe he had ſhed much bloud, not innocent bloud (though he did <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi>) but becauſe he had fought many battels, God would not have him do it, but <hi>Salomon,</hi> whoſe name ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Peace.</hi> No hammer, nor any noiſe might be heard in making the Temple: Thus Chriſt was born in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his time, when <hi>Janus</hi> his Temple was ſhut, and the world at peace; though indeed in the ſecond Temple, there they did build with their tools in one hand, and their ſwords in the other, becauſe of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition they had.</p>

                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:101245:129"/>Secondly, <hi>This Temple that was built, it was very magnificent and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and was accounted equal to the ſeven great wonderous buildings of the world.</hi> It was a great building, and yet <hi>Solomon</hi> at the dedication of it removeth all carnal and low conceits from God, as if he were circumſcribed within that place: For, ſaith he, <hi>The Heaven of Heavens do not contain thee, much leſſe this place,</hi> 1 King. 8 20.

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Temple had a proper and peculiar holineſſe, a relative holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being dedicated by Gods command unto his worſhip, and a typical holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> It was typically holy, becauſe a <hi>type of Chriſts body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deſtroy this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> ſaid our Saviour, <hi>and I will raiſe it up in thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e dayes,</hi> John 2 19. Now when Chriſt the fulneſſe came, this Temple was to be deſtroyed, as the Altars and Sacrifices with the Levitical Prieſthood; even as the flower fals to the ground, when the fruit comes in ſtead thereof. It was <hi>relatively holy</hi> from two grounds:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Gods Inſtitution:</hi> He commanded the building of it for his worſhip; and every thing, though never ſo little, yet had it Gods command for it, as alſo the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> had: They were to do nothing of their own heads, but according to the patern in the Mount. And then</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It was <hi>relatively holy, Becauſe of Gods ſpecial promiſe to be preſent there.</hi> Hence becauſe it was a prayer in that very place, there was more acceptance of it with God; therefore they did uſe to pray, even their private prayers in this place; as the Propheteſſe <hi>Anna, that departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God with faſtings and prayers, day and night,</hi> Luke 2.37. Yea, when they could not be bodily preſent, they did direct themſelves towards the Temple; as we reade <hi>Daniel</hi> did, and though it was in danger of his life, yet he would open his window, when he prayed, and look that way, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. though in the Text it be ſaid onely towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore it we called an <hi>houſe of prayer.</hi> In <hi>Solomons</hi> prayer, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.48. the captives of <hi>Iſrael</hi> carried into another Land, are ſuppoſed in their captivity to pray unto God with their face towards the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and alſo towards the Temple.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>But from this Temple, to argue for ſuch holineſſe in our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: Yea, and with</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>and others to plead for private praying in the Church, more than in other places, as if there were more holineſſe therein, and for the places ſake, to have more acceptance, is unjuſtifiable by Scripture,</hi> John 4.21, 24. <hi>The time is coming, when they ſhall not worſhip in this mountaine, or in Jeruſalem, but they ſhall worſhip him in Spirit and truth.</hi> There is no <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> now, nor any place like <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and now <hi>God would have us in every place lift up holy hands in prayer,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. It's therefore unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable by Scripture to pray in a Church for the places ſake, to have the prayer the more acceptable, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pleadeth. And indeed becauſe there is no ſuch peculiar inſtitution, nor no ſuch peculiar promiſe, therefore there cannot be ſuch a relative holineſſe. Private prayers in the Church, though pretended not to be done for the places ſake, while we are at the publick Ordinances, are alſo incongruous and unwarrantable, partly, becauſe they are againſt the nature of private prayer preſcribed by our Saviour, <hi>When thou prayeſt ſhut thy door after thee,</hi> Mat. 6.6. Private prayer muſt be done in a private manner: and partly, becauſe the Church is for publick Ordinances. We meet together in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual communion, and while the ſociety is ſinging, for thee to be privately praying, is unſuitable to the duty in hand, where there ought to be one heart, one mouth and conſent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:101245:130"/>Fifthly, <hi>Becauſe the Temple was ſo glorious, and Gods promiſe was in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner made to it, therefore the Jews put all their truſt and confidence in this, though their lives were full of wickedneſſe and groſſe impieties, yet becauſe they had the Temple, that made them think themſelves happy.</hi> Hence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſeverely reproveth them for it, ſaying, <hi>Truſt no more in lying words, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are theſe,</hi> Jer. 7.4. Hence at laſt God was ſo provoked, that he gave it up to idolatrous Heathens to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that a ſtone ſhould not be left upon a ſtone. For <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperor quite demoliſhed it; and in ſtead thereof built a place with a new name, calling it <hi>Aelia,</hi> and upon the gate ſet the Image of a <hi>Swine</hi> by way of ſcorn and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom that beaſt was unclean. And thus truly God hath done with many glorious ſpiritual Temples under the Goſpel: Where are the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches of Aſia?</hi> And where is the pure Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now? The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Governours of that Church glory of their ſucceſſion to their former Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, <hi>Whoſe faith was ſpread over the whole world,</hi> but they ſucceed them as <hi>veſpae apibus,</hi> Waſps many times do Bees, or as night doth the day.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Our Churches therefore do not reſemble the Temple, an holy place dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to God, but their publick Synagogues where they met together to pray and reade the Word, and have it expounded.</hi> Some find fault, that we call this mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial building a Church; but uſe of ſpeech doth fully juſtifie this. It's an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>figure</hi> to put the <hi>place containing</hi> for the thing <hi>contained.</hi> Thus it's ſaid, <hi>All Jeruſalem went out:</hi> And, <hi>Oh Jeruſalem that killeſt the Prophets,</hi> Mat. 23.77. which is meant of the Inhabitants thereof. Thus we call a City, or a Town, the people of the Town. But of this we have ſpoken formerly. But though there is no ſuch relative holineſſe in theſe places, as was in the Temple; neither are the duties regarded for the places ſake, but the place for the duties; yet there is a moral and civil decency, or reſpect to be had to them, as we do unto places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſolemn meeting; and therefore are unfitly compared to barns or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or to be polluted like them, not becauſe of any holineſſe in them, more than in other places, but from a civil reſpect. But theſe things only occaſionally by the way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Believers joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Church way according to Scripture, are Gods tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note>The next main thing is, <hi>That believers joyned in a Church way according to Scripture, are Gods temple,</hi> and that requireth theſe things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Purity and an undefiled life from the wicked wayes of the world.</hi> Though they be in the world, yet not of the world. This is called <hi>pure Religion, to keep a man defiled from the world,</hi> Jam. 1.27. And we muſt not be <hi>conformed to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of this world,</hi> Rom. 12.2. We are to be as <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodome,</hi> ſo farre from having fellowſhip with it, that we are to grieve in ſeeing and hearing the evil deeds of others. We are to be like the three Worthies in the midſt of the fire, and yet our hair not ſinged thereby. Do not thou then judge of thy ſelf, as the Temple of God, when thou art like a dung-hill; thy heart is not a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Temple, but an open Inne or Market-place; all ſtrange luſts may lodge in thee; thou art to take Chriſt for an example, not the world.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Dedication, and giving up our ſelves wholly unto God.</hi> Thy ſoul and body are to be one Temple, onely thy ſoul is the <hi>Saxctum ſanctorum</hi>; there ſhould only be admitted choice and ſanctified thoughts and intentions, <hi>Shall I take</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the member of Chriſt, and make it the member of an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.15. Shall I take the Temple of God, and make it a publick ſtew for all luſts? As they ſaid of their Temples, <hi>Procul ô procul eſte prophani:</hi> So do thou of all noiſome and filthy ſinnes. As there were conſtant Porters to watch the Temple: ſo do thou continually ſet a watch before thy heart and ſoul, that no unclean thing enter in.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Here is implied. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the members of the Church together.</hi> The Temple was not one ſtone, or a few ſtones ſcattered up and down, but exactly

                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Communion</hi>; Not onely internal by faith and love, which we have with Chriſt the Head, and ſo with all the members. For this communion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, but external in a viſible ſociety and fellowſhip one with another in the publique worſhip. Hence they are greatly reproved, <hi>That forſook the aſſembling of themſelves together,</hi> Heb. 10.15. Viſible communion in Church-Ordinances brings much glory to God, and great edification to our ſelves.</p>

                        <hi>Verſe 18.</hi> Let no man deceive himſelf, if any man ſeemeth to be wiſe in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wiſe.</head>
                     <p>THe Apoſtle having ſufficiently declared the ſinfulneſſe and puniſhment at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of thoſe, who defile the Church of God by corrupt Doctrines, he doth begin in this verſe to remove thoſe obſtructions in the way, that may hinder the good uſe of what he had ſaid. For though the food be never ſo good, yet if the ſtomack be ſick and undiſpoſed, we cannot look for good nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Now the firſt ſtone, that was to be rolled out of the way (there could be no ſowing of this divine ſeed with hopefull ſucceſſe, till that was removed) was the <hi>ſelf-conceit of their own wiſdome, and the admiring of the worldly humane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies that they ſaw in their falſe teachers.</hi> Till this <hi>Goliah</hi> be killed, the Apoſtle doth not expect their obedience to what he had ſaid. Hence in this eighteenth <hi>verſe,</hi> he beginneth to dehort from all <hi>ſelf-conceit,</hi> and <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdome</hi>; and in the Text he declareth a two-fold pernicious and dangerous effect thereof.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That it is a meer <hi>deceiving</hi> of a mans ſelf, <hi>Let no man deceive himſelf.</hi> That which the proud wiſe men of the world applaud for gold, will prove but droſſe; he will ſee it was a meer empty ſwelling, not a man-child they travelled with.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The neceſſity of relinquiſhing and abdicating this wiſdome, as the great enemy to true and heavenly wiſdome,</hi> which is the other <hi>dangerous effect, Let him become a fool, that he may be wiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that this Text is an hammer to beat down all thoſe high and lofty things that are in our carnal underſtandings, and to lead all our thoughts and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions captive into the obedience of faith.</p>
                     <p>Now this Dehortation doth belong both to the Teachers he had reproved, and to the Auditors. For if ye ask, <hi>What made the Doctors defile the Temple with errours and hereſies?</hi> It was only <hi>humane wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>proud underſtandings.</hi>
                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:101245:131"/>
And, <hi>What made the Diſciples ſo factiouſly preferre one above the other?</hi> But ſtill that doting upon <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>earthly wiſdome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the Text is an excellent Antidote againſt the proud fleſh; or rather proud ſpirit, that may be either in teacher or hearer.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt <hi>Effect, A mans ſelf-deceiving,</hi> that is coincident with the other ſubject I am inſiſting upon; therefore I wave it, and come to the duty of <hi>Abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and renouncing of this humane wiſdome, <hi>If any man ſeem to be wiſe, let him become a fool.</hi> This bunch upon the Camels back muſt be levelled, ere it can go thorow the eye of a needle.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Doctrine, which is implyed only, ſhall be,</p>

                        <hi>That humane and earthly wiſdome is a great enemy to all the heavenly things of Chriſt.</hi>

                        </gap> There is no actual or potential ſubjection; it cannot be. Therefore our Saviour to demonſtrate how farre ſuch wiſe men of the world, were from being his Diſciples, he takes a <hi>little child, and ſetting him in the midſt of them,</hi> ſaith, <hi>

<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>The ſupernatural Matter and Doctrine to be believed.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. <hi>The Manner of promulgation of this in the holy Scriptures.</hi>

                           <item>3. <hi>The holy and ſpiritual Duties that are required of us.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all theſe, you ſhall ſee, a man with no more than natural humane wiſdom to be the greateſt adverſary therunto: yea, and the more parts, and the more wiſdom he hath, the more indiſpoſed ſubject he is to receive or believe ſupernatural truths. Inſomuch that wiſe men thought no man that had wiſdome, could ever acknowledge the Chriſtian faith. So <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid, the <hi>Heathens</hi> would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſuch a man, a good, and a wiſe man would ever turn Chriſtian. Thus what <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid excellently concerning Chriſts Incarnation, in regard of the humane wiſdome of the world, <hi>That a God ſhould be made man, be crucified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prorſus credibile, quia impoſſibile; &amp; non pudet, quia pudendum.</hi> It's true of many others doctrinals and practicals in Chriſts kingdome; yet truly, Divinity doth require of us no more than all humane Arts, <hi>Diſcentem credere oportet.</hi> If a man doth not believe before he underſtands, he can never attain to knowledge: and ſo ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in Religion, <hi>Non intelligendum, ut credatis, ſed cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum, ut intelligatis</hi>; We muſt not underſtand to believe, but believe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider, Firſt, <hi>What an enemy to the Doctrine believed, the fleſhly, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome of a man is.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>This humane wiſdome puffeth a man up with pride, that he will not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch divine myſteries.</hi> And this ſwelling or puffing up is immediately contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to an act of faith: For faith hath an obediential aſſent, namely, becauſe God ſaith it; let my underſtanding cavil and argue never ſo plauſibly, yet faith makes it obedientially yeeld unto the teſtimony and authority of God. Wonder not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:101245:131"/>
therefore, if humane wiſdome be ſuch an enemy to Chriſtianity, becauſe faith and that are at immediate contrariety; faith bids the mind ſtoop and yeeld; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome bids it lift it ſelf up. Hence the Scripture cals it, <hi>The obedience of</hi> (or to) <hi>faith,</hi> and it's <hi>the captivating of the underſtanding, the beating down the</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>every high thing that exalteth it ſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 10 5. So that faith is a kind of mental martyrdom, it puts to death thoſe high and lofty thoughts men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have. Seeing then humane knowledge puffeth up, and filleth a man with pride, this putteth a man into an immediate contrariety unto <hi>believing,</hi> which is the Chriſtians knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Humane wiſdome, as it doth immediately oppoſe faith in its obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial aſſent; ſo alſo humility, which is the inſtrumental grace to receive all the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſt.</hi> Humility is not only a grace it ſelf, but a veſſel to receive other graces. <hi>The humble and meek he will teach his way,</hi> Pſal. 25.9. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, that thou haſt revealed theſe things to babes, and hid them from the wiſe men of the world,</hi> ſaid our Saviour with much hearty affection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. The valleys they receive the drops of heaven, and are more fruitfull, than the mountains, though high, but barren. So that humane wiſdome is as great an hinderance, as humility is a furtherance. Lay down then all high and conceited thoughts, when thou comeſt into Chriſts ſchool; yea unteach thy ſelf all thy former opinions and arguments, and be like an <hi>raſa tabula,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid the ſoul was, for the Spirit of God to write divine truths upon thy heart. Doth not the Wiſeman tell us, <hi>That he who is wiſe in his own eyes, there is more hopes of a fool than him?</hi> Prov. 26.12. Therefore ſaith he, <hi>Leane not unto thy own underſtanding,</hi> Prov. 3.5. Oh this humility would preſerve againſt all hereſies, all dangerous opinions! An humble man is like the Tree planted by the waters ſide. God hath two places (as it were) to dwell in; <hi>Heaven</hi> is one, and the <hi>humble heart</hi> is another, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. God by the Prophet in that place, accounts of ſuch an heart, like as unto his glorious Throne in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Humane conceited wiſdome muſt needs hinder the entertainment of Chriſts truth, Becauſe it ſets it ſelf on the Throne to be Judge, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine truth or falſhood according to her own principles.</hi> It makes weights, and a ſtandard of its own, and will weigh even what God and the Scripture ſaith by its own ſelf: yea humane wiſdome doth not only thus intrude into the throne, but hath her inſtruments, the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who plead to have her the Judge, and the Determiner of all religious controverſies. What from Scripture hath by the Orthodox been aſſerted to be, that theſe will put upon reaſon, making it the rule of faith. Hence there is no <hi>Trinity</hi> with them, not <hi>three Perſons</hi> and <hi>one God,</hi> becauſe it's againſt their reaſon. <hi>Chriſt is not truly and eſſentially God, becauſe againſt reaſon</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Chriſt was not a Mediatour by his bloud as a Sacrifice to expiate our ſinnes, becauſe againſt their reaſon.</hi> Thus you ſee what a direct adverſary the reaſon of man, as of it ſelf, is againſt divine truths; whereas what the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the woman, <hi>He did not permit her to uſurp Authority over her husband, or to ſpeake in the Church,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.12. The ſame ought to be applied to humane wiſdome, not to uſurp over faith, or to ſpeak authoritatively in the Church. It's true, a mans reaſon or wiſdome may be conſidered two wayes:
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>As corrupt and darkened through original ſinne</hi>; And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect onely we ſpeake of it, as ſuch an adverſary to the myſteries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</item>
                           <item>2. <hi>As enlightned and ſanctified by the Word, and the Spirit of God.</hi> Now in this later reſpect, though it be not a Judge, but is to be judged, yet it's an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent inſtrument to faith. When faith hath firſt laid its foundation, then
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:101245:132"/>
reaſon and learning ſucceeding and building upon it, is wonderfull ſerviceable for the explication and confirmation of divine truths. <hi>I ſpeake as unto wiſe men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>Judge ye what I ſay,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.15. Thus civil pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and all humane literature, while it's a ſervant, not a Miſtreſſe, is of wonderfull uſe; but when with <hi>Hagar</hi> it will pride over <hi>Sarah,</hi> then caſt it out of doores. That which ſome adverſaries to learning object, That learning is never ſanctified, is contrary to the inſtance of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was skilfull in the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> learning, which was the fountain and ſeminary of all learning to the world. And thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as he ſanctified ſome verſes out of Heathen Poets, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> expreſſeth it: So God had alſo ſanctified all his humane abilities. But herein earthly wiſdome is ſo repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, becauſe it's apt to make it ſelf judge. And although nothing in Religion be againſt ſound reaſon, yet many things are above it, ſuch as it cannot reach unto.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Humane wiſdome is ſuch an oppoſite to heavenly truths, Becauſe of its ſubtilty to finde out cavils, and excogitate Arguments againſt the Truth.</hi> Inſomuch that the more learned and knowing men are, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er difficulty it is to believe; men who have leſſe parts and learning, know not all thoſe ſubtil and ſpecious Arguments, which Heretiques, eſpecially if learned and ſubtil, do bring forth: They know not what the <hi>Socinians</hi> have to ſay againſt the Trinity, againſt the Deity of Chriſt. What <hi>Arminians</hi> for Free-will. What the Papiſts for many of their ſuperſtitious wayes; and it's well they doe not, not but that the truth is evident againſt them, onely it might ſhake and ſtagger their faith, who are weak; whereas men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, exerciſing themſelves in their Bookes, that they may be able to confute them, meet ſometimes with ſpecious colours, yea even ſome ſeeming Anakims in the way. Mans wiſdome is farre more able, <hi>Deſtruere falſa,</hi> then <hi>probare vera</hi>; we can better object againſt truth, then by faith aſſent to it; and then no wonder it be ſo apt to miſcarry.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>The more wiſdome and knowledge men have, the more buſie the Devil is to make them on his ſide.</hi> Becauſe the Serpent was more ſubtil than other beaſts of the field, therefore the Devil uſed him, <hi>Ornari à te Diabolus quaerit,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin</hi> to a great Scholar, whom he would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have converted. Moſt Heretiques have been men of great parts, of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eloquence to perſwade and winne men: Good Elocution and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique is ſo apt to beare all downe before it, that <hi>Hercules</hi> was made the God of Eloquence by ſome Heathens, as if it had as much ſtrength as he.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Then how much are men of parts and underſtanding to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile themſelves? God chooſeth babes and ſimple ones rather than ſuch. Study humility, renounce thy underſtanding, become a little childe. Oh it may be, that which thou art ſo proud of, ſo confident of, will be the means to damn thee, as <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s hair was his death!</p>

                     <p>The Doctrine obſerved is, <hi>That humane and earthly wiſdome is a great enemy to the things of God.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The next thing in order is, <hi>The manner of Declaration and Publication of it in the Scripture.</hi> And here we ſhall find worldly wiſdome to be a great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: But I ſhall inſtance in one thing only about that, and that is, <hi>The ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and plainneſſe of the ſtyle.</hi> That whereas there are two things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding apt to take with the world; The one with <hi>Rational men</hi>; The other with <hi>Affectionate men.</hi> The Scripture ſeemeth to be furniſhed with neither. For with <hi>rational men,</hi> ſtrong demonſtrations and ſcientifical probations prevail ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; they lay, they are ſlaves to reaſon; bring a rational argument, and this is ſuch a cord, that the ſtrongeſt <hi>Samſon</hi> cannot break. Now many times men of ſtrong reaſon are no wayes Rhetorical: As the earth, where mines of gold are, is barren of graſſe and flowers. <hi>It's as abſurd</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) <hi>to expect moral diſcourſes from a Mathematician, as mathematical demonſtrations from a Moraliſt.</hi> So then, ſome men are preſently conquered by acute, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical argumentations. This the Scripture hath not; for that <hi>dictateth,</hi> not <hi>argueth,</hi> which is indeed moſt ſutable to the divine Scripture. <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> who is called, <hi>The profound Doctor,</hi> profeſſed of himſelf, while he was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, yet not throughly ſanctified by grace, that he was weary of hearing <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles read in the Church: And why? Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> had not <hi>metaphyſicum ix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genium.</hi> Some then look for learned demonſtrations; Others are raviſhed with the ſweet muſick of humane Rheto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>For learned men, who expect demonſtrations, conſider, That it being the Word of the moſt High God, it is moſt decent and gracefull, that there ſhould no other Argument be uſed but Authority.</hi> And therefore if you doe rightly conſider, <hi>Moſes</hi> his relation of the Creation of all things, is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er force than all rational demonſtrations. Kings uſe to ſay, <hi>Teſte meipſo</hi>; and thus it is moſt becoming the Majeſty of God, to have his Pen-men ſay no more; but <hi>God ſaid it, God did it.</hi> Therefore howſoever one Heathen ſaid of <hi>Moſes, Bexè dicit, ſed nihil probat,</hi> He ſpeaketh well, but proveth nothing; yet another Heathen, when he heard the relation of the Creation by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaid, <hi>I like this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he ſpeaketh like a God.</hi> All ſcientifical demonſtrations are farre inferiour to divine Authority. Therefore you ſee the greateſt men of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have been wonderfully perplexed about the Creation. It's ſaid, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought the world was from eternity. Beſides, that ſeemeth reaſon to one man, which is not to another. And this ſeemeth to be a good reaſon, till a man of ſtrong parts cometh to ſhew the weakneſſe of it. In that the Scripture then is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101245:133"/>
only <hi>aſſertory,</hi> and that in the main principles of our Religion, it therefore is <hi>moſt conſonant to Gods Majeſty</hi>; and that holy confident relation by <hi>Moſes</hi> without ſo much as any attendance to go about to prove it, doth evince the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, While learned men ſeek for ſuch rational demonſtrations, <hi>Let them take heed, leſt while they ſeek for Reaſon, they loſe Faith. Chriſtians are believers, not Artiſts.</hi> Now, what is faith? <hi>A captivating of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to Gods teſtimony,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. <hi>It's the evidence, or conviction of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. <hi>By faith we underſtand the world was made, by faith we believe there is a God, and that he is a rewarder of thoſe that come to him.</hi> Faith is not an argumentative Diſcourſe but an obediential Aſſent. Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that judgeſt Arguments from Authority, though Divine, to be farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to demonſtrations; thou forgetteſt thy profeſſion is to be a believer; yea, it's the greateſt reaſon in the world to believe Gods teſtimony: So that we may ſay, <hi>Religio eſt ſumma ratio:</hi> There is greater reaſon to believe the Scripture, then to aſſent to any demonſtration. So that though Faith be not Reaſon, yet there is the greateſt Reaſon for Faith. And for thoſe, who look for <hi>Rhetorical flouriſhes,</hi> and <hi>fanciefull expreſſions,</hi> let them conſider,</p>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The whole Doctrine of ſelf-denial is a very fooliſh thing to carnal wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Our Saviour requireth this, as the foundation in all thoſe who are to come to him. Now a mans ſelf is to be denied two wayes:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is his <hi>ſinfull and unlawfull ſelf in the pleaſures and profits of ſinne.</hi> This muſt be totally renounced: But how abſurd this is, appeareth, in that it is <hi>Pulling out our right eye, and cutting off our right hand.</hi> But then</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a lawfull ſelf, which is ſeen in our affections even to lawfull things.</hi> Now here alſo a man muſt-moderate himſelf; yea hate all, when it cometh in competition with Chriſt. <hi>If a man hate not father or mother for my ſake, he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> Luke 14.26, <hi>Thoſe that marry muſt be as if they married not,</hi> 2 Corin. 7.

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The duty of faith in relying upon Chriſt onely, and renouncing our own righteouſneſſe, is the great Gospel-command, yet nothing is more fooliſh and abſurd to humane Reaſon than this.</hi> All the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> thought of no other righteouſneſſe, but that of workes. The Phariſees, yea all the Jews, they looked onely for juſtification by the workes of the Law. <hi>Paul</hi> till wholly new moulded by the Goſpel, could not judge all things dung and droſſe for the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The duties of Humility and Meekneſſe, eſpecially forbearing of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and loving our enemies, is eſteemed high folly in worldly mens eſteem.</hi> The Heathens thought it a very juſtifiable thing to hate their enemies: Yea, the Phariſees traditional Doctrine, was to hate their enemies. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſt came with his, <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies, doe good to thoſe that hate you, pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you,</hi> Mat. 5.44.

                     <p>Let the Uſe be to remove every thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt Chriſt, and his wayes. Thy carnal wiſdome is the firſt enemy that muſt be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Do not think thy ſelf wiſer than the Scriptures; ſubmit to the dictates thereof: What that ſaith is to be believed; without further diſpute, believe: What that faith is to be done; without further cavils immediately obey, though it be thy right eye, that it muſt be pulled out.

                     <p>The ſecond diminiſhing limitation, is from the nature of it, If any man ſeem to be wiſe <hi>in this world,</hi> it doth not denote the <hi>place,</hi> where this wiſdome is; for ſo the Apoſtles wiſdome was in this world, becauſe they were men in the world; but the <hi>Object</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of tendency to it, is <hi>worldly.</hi> It's about the world, and rather a worldly manner; therefore in the next verſe, he ſaith, <hi>The wiſdome of the world,</hi> not in the world: So that this is a very debaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction; it's the wiſdome of the world; it doth not at all further to Heaven, or to eternal happineſſe, or to eternity, it's only about theſe fading things, which live and die together almoſt.

                     <p>Firſt, Their <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>contemplative wiſdome,</hi> which conſiſted in the <hi>Liberal Arts,</hi> as they called them. In this they had great renown, and for this they were admired, having many monuments and ſtatues dedicated to them; as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101245:134"/>
                        <hi>Rome</hi> did to one great Rhetorician with this Inſcription, <hi>Regina urbs, regi elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiae.</hi> The Queen of Cities to the King of eloquence. This they called <hi>Scientia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Their <hi>Political and Civil Prudence, or Moral,</hi> whereby as men and ſocieties they labour to make themſelves happy, and to lead a pleaſant life. <hi>Socrates</hi> is commended for this, that he brought in moral Philoſophy, reducing all ſpeculations to practice. Now anſwerable to both theſe, the Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A way of believing,</hi> which farre exceedeth their <hi>contemplative ſcience.</hi> And</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>A right motive of doing,</hi> whereby we may indeed be partakers of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting joy, and this farre ſurpaſſeth all their morality.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, let us ſhew, <hi>Wherein the faith of a Chriſtian, commanded by the Scripture, doth farre ſurpaſſe all humane knowledge and ſcience, which men by nature do glory in.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Faith doth ſurpaſſe all humane ſciences in the dignity of the ſubject.</hi> The matter about which a Chriſtians faith is exerciſed doth farre tranſcend all that about which humane knowledge doth exerciſe it ſelf: For the <hi>higheſt</hi> that they could reach unto, is only to the knowledge of <hi>natural effects, produced by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes.</hi> And if any could prove theſe by the former; this they called a <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration:</hi> Though ſome men ſay, No man ever yet gave a demonſtration, <hi>à prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri quoad ſe,</hi> but <hi>quoad nos.</hi> So then, all the excellent wiſdom of the world, hath been only to conſider the nature of ſublunary things, or to diſcourſe about the <hi>nature of the heavenly bodies, and their motions</hi>; and if they did ariſe to conſider of a <hi>God,</hi> the Maker of theſe, it was in a very <hi>uncertain,</hi> doubtfull way. Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaks of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27. that they were as men in the dark, feeling after a thing to find it, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> ſmote with blindneſſe felt for the door. This is all our humane wiſdome can help us to, but now by faith we have the ſupernatural myſteries of ſalvation revealed unto us. The Scripture tels us, <hi>Of a God in Chriſt, reconciling man to himſelf; of mans original miſery; of Chriſt the Mediator.</hi> Alas, how poor and contemptible are the higheſt notions even of <hi>Plato,</hi> though called Divine, when you come and read <hi>Paul?</hi> There are ſuch admirable and heavenly truths revealed in Gods word, that all humane wiſdome was no more able to find, or apprehend ſuch things, then a dwarf could reach to the Heavens. If we then conſider the dignity and worth of that ſubject which the Scripture revealeth, and faith is exerciſed about, dirt is not more infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to precious pearls, than humane knowledge to faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith differs from all their humane ſcience, in reſpect of the excellency of the end.</hi> For the <hi>end</hi> of all Scripture wiſdom is to bring us <hi>to eternal life.</hi> The Scriptures <hi>are able to make us wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. The things of Chriſt are ſaid to be <hi>written, That believing we might have eternal life,</hi> John 20 31. There was never any humane knowledge could teach a man to be eternally happy. <hi>Platoes</hi> Divinity, and <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Morality, though they have the words of happineſſe, and have large diſcourſes about it, yet <hi>wanted the thing it ſelf.</hi> Oh then let us bleſſe God for Scripture-wiſdome, for the treaſures of knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed there! Learn of <hi>David,</hi> How wonderfully was he affected with Gods word? What light and wiſdome did he attain unto thereby? The Scriptures will teach thee ſuch a bleſſedneſſe, and ſuch a way to bleſſedneſſe, that could not enter into thy heart to conceive, before the light thereof came into thee.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith doth ſurpaſſe all humane knowledge in its certainty and infallibility.</hi> A man that believeth the truths of God revealed in the Scripture, hath more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge then all the more wiſe and learned men of the world. For the object of faith being Gods teſtimony, and his Divine Authority, it's as impoſſible for faith to be deceived, as it is for God to lie. Hence it's called, <hi>The full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:101245:135"/>
of hope,</hi> Heb. 10.22. <hi>And we believe, therefore we ſpeake,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. How could the holy Martyrs witneſſe thoſe divine truths even to death, had they not been poſſeſſed with full and ſure knowledge of thoſe things they died for? whereas if we look into all humane knowledge, there is very little certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: inſomuch that ſome have expreſly affirmed, <hi>Nihil ſcitur:</hi> yea that that alſo was not known; and what little certainty they have, appeareth by the contrary and different opinions in all their main points.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith doth more eſtabliſh, ſettle and quiet the heart of men, then all humane wiſdome. Solomon</hi> obſerveth a <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>vexation of ſpirit,</hi> even in all humane knowledge: but now faith doth eſtabliſh, ſettle and ſatisfie the ſoul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>It is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Thoſe that want faith, are ſaid, <hi>to be double-minded men,</hi> Jam. 1. inconſtant as the waves of the Sea. Oh the anxiety and perplexities that meer humane knowledge hath caſt men into! And ſo thoſe who have no other bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome than the Authority of Church, or the power of men to believe, <hi>Theſe are reeds ſhaken up and down with every wind.</hi> Their faith is upon ambulatory and moveable conſiderations; wheras faith makes a man like Chriſt, <hi>The ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Chriſtian faith is above all philoſophical knowledge, Becauſe of the ſtrong and mighty effects it hath to convert the heart, and reform the life. Acts</hi> 15 9. <hi>Purifying their hearts by faith. How can ye believe, when ye ſeek glory one of another?</hi> ſaid our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 5.44. Yet theſe humane <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> did only aim at glory; though <hi>Philoſophers</hi> call them the Liberal Arts, yet they could not ſet them free from their luſts, whereas Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8.32. ſaid, <hi>If my Word abide in you, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Never did humane knowledge make ſuch wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full converts, and work ſo great a reformation, as the Chriſtian ſaith hath done. And although we have now too many, who ſay, they do believe, and yet do ſuch things, as many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would be aſhamed of; yet theſe men have not faith indeed, but the name and title of it; for as much as <hi>faith,</hi> though but like a <hi>grain of muſtard-ſeed,</hi> would bid ſuch <hi>mountains</hi> of luſts be removed into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Scripture wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome excels the moral or practical wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world.</note>In the next place, <hi>The moral or practical wiſdome of the world cometh farre ſhort of Scripture-wiſdome,</hi> For</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The moſt knowing men were ignorant of original ſinne, which yet is the fountain of our calamity.</hi> The Heathens indeed bewailed the mortality and miſery of man; but they know not our natural pollution, the ground of all. Yea, we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, though a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> was not acquainted with that Law of ſinne within him, till inlightned by the Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Now if men know not their diſeaſe, or the cauſe of it, they can never be cured. So that whatſoever precepts about living well they delivered, yet they built on a <hi>ſandy foundation,</hi> they did not dig deep enough.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>All humane wiſdome and prudence knoweth not how to mortifie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſinne upon true grounds, becauſe they were ignorant of Gods Spirit.</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie ſinne.</hi> They did not crucifie the body of ſinne, nor bewail it, becauſe it was ſinne, but for humane reſpects, as it did <hi>hinder</hi> the publique, or as it was <hi>prejudicial</hi> to their glory and fame, but they overcame one luſt by another.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>All earthly prudence cometh ſhort of this wiſdome, becauſe it's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed within the bounds of this world, and this life.</hi> It looketh out no further, whereas the Scripture giveth directions for the world to come, and for eternity. So that as a mans ſenſe comes farre ſhort of reaſon, becauſe ſenſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth onely to the preſent objects, but reaſon can compare paſt and future things together. So the beſt worldly reaſon cometh ſhort of Scripture-wiſdome, for that is limited only to the pleaſures and profits of this world.</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:101245:136"/>
There cannot be any greater wiſdome than to believe God ſpeaking concerning himſelf. For who can know any thing of God, but by God himſelf? As we cannot ſee the Sunne, but by the light of the Sunne. Howſoever therefore the great Heathen Philoſopher called Chriſtians, <hi>Credentes,</hi> by ſcorn; yet indeed this is the moſt ſure and infallible way. <hi>Julian</hi> that wretched Apoſtate, but a great admirer of humane learning; <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith of him, he would brag, and ſay, The Heathens had all the learning; but you Chriſtians, <hi>Veſtrûm eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantia &amp; barbaries, nec quicquam aliud quam crede veſtra eſt ſapientia.</hi> See what a fit inſtance this is; they ſaid Chriſtianity was infancy, childiſhneſs, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme, and they had no other wiſdome, but only believe. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> firſt tels him, That the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> would abhorre that argument; for they ſaid of their Maſter, <hi>Ipſe dixit, ulterius non eſt quaerend<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>m,</hi> but our belief is not in men, but in the word of God, which truth was confirmed by ſigns and wonders. So then, take heed of this ſinfull diſtemper; curioſity and pride in knowledge, to be wiſe above what is written: It was <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne at firſt, to affect a knowledge not vouchſafed him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Matter believed,</hi> that hath appeared a great folly to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world, is, <hi>That God ſhould be made man, that he ſhould die, be crucified, and by this means work ſalvation for the poor ſinner.</hi> This whole Syſteme of Gods diſpenſation, ſeemed but an heap of fooliſh imaginations. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> that prophane dog, who (they ſay) was torne in pieces by dogs, by deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, called Chriſt, <hi>The crucified God.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> hath that expreſſion, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 1.15. He was not aſhamed of it, though the Heathens, the wiſe men of the world deſpiſed it; and herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the unreaſonableneſſe of the Heathens, that could and did believe ſuch <hi>monſtrous things about their gods, even as thoſe that committed all wickedneſſe.</hi> Hence <hi>Auſtin</hi> well ſpeaking of <hi>Seneca's</hi> advice, to ſet ſome wiſe grave man, as <hi>Cato</hi> before us, that we may not ſin, ſaid, He muſt propound a man, not any of their gods, for <hi>every one of them was noted for ſome filthineſſe, or other.</hi> Hence he in <hi>Terence</hi> encouraged himſelf to luſts, becauſe their gods did ſo. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens (I ſay) that could believe ſuch monſtrous and filthy things about their gods, and worſhip them, yet would deride at Chriſt crucified, though ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen with power, working many miracles, and teaching nothing but admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble holy duties: But now in all this diſpenſation about Chriſt, God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his manifold wiſdome, even farre above that, which was in making the world.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Manner of propagating and ſpreading this faith through the whole world, was very contemptible and fooliſh in the worlds account, though mighty powerfull and confounding the wiſe things of the world.</hi> At firſt Chriſt doth not raiſe an army of men, or legions of Angels, but only twelve men, and thoſe of a mean contemptible way, and theſe ſerved to leaven the whole world. Theſe were the <hi>light</hi> and the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the earth. Here the muſtard-ſeed, leſſe than other ſeeds, grew bigger than any other. What <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſword, or the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers knowledge could not do, that this plain preaching did effect. All the power of men, and the gates of hell have been no more able to ſtop this preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the powerfull effects of it, than to binde the Sunne in chaines, that it might not runne its race. Now, though this is mighty and powerfull, yet it's very fooliſh and deſpicable in the worlds account. And thus you have the firſt part.</p>

But</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and that chiefly, <hi>The Duties required by Chriſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The duties of Chriſtians fooliſh in the judgement of the world.</note> 
                        <hi>and all that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical way of godlineſſe, which he enjoyneth, carrieth with it a great ſhew of folly.</hi> We ſhall inſtance in ſome things, that ſo we may not be aſhamed to be godly, though accounted the worlds fools and mad men. Many men have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; they are convinced that it's their duty to live a more ſtrict, preciſe life; but they are aſhamed, they cannot abide mocks and deriſions, which the power of godlineſſe will expoſe us unto. As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt requireth of all his Diſciples, to live contrary to the wicked wayes of the world.</hi> Chriſts Diſciples muſt live in a ſingular way to the world. <hi>Pure religion is to keep a man unſpotted from the world,</hi> Jam 1.27. eſpecially <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Be not transformed to the faſhion of the world.</hi> See then, whether theſe duties will not make a man the worlds fool: He muſt not ſwear, or curſe, as they do; be unclean, and runne in exceſſe of riot, as they do; be proud, and earthly, and unjuſt in their dealings, as they are. Now there is no man, if he be thus carefull to avoid all the defilements of the world, but he ſhall be like the Owl among other birds; they are ſo ſtrict, ſo ſingular, and this they deride, when it's no more than Chriſt hath commanded. Who would put himſelf upon the ſcorns and contumelies of others, were it not Chriſts command? Take up this principle, I muſt not live as moſt do, moſt men are damned, moſt men walk in the broad way to Hell; there is therefore a narrow and ſtrait way, that I muſt ſtrive to enter in at: The world lieth in wickedneſſe, hath many wicked, bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, ſuperſtitious euſtoms; it's the place, where the Devil reigneth: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever wicked men ſay, do thou and thy family ſerve the Lord: Let them make ſongs of thee, raiſe lies, and ſpeak diſdainfully, do thou ſtill perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to be Chriſts fool. <hi>Beza</hi>'s name was <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and <hi>Genebrard</hi> the Papiſt, he by ſcorne calleth him <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It is a folly in the world to be ſo fervent, zealous and active in matters of Religion.</hi> They like well enough a general profeſſion of Chriſtianity a lukewarm obedience unto all the duties thereof; but this zeal is forwardneſſe, they cannot abide, that is raſhneſſe, indiſcretion, that's madneſſe and wilde fire. Now it's true, there may be an ignorant and a raſh zeal; but men are apt to judge ſo of any more powerfull and forwarder practices of holineſſe, than they themſelves uſe. Whereas the Scripture is plain, That no man can be ſaved, that doth not make it his buſineſſe, his work, his one thing neceſſary, to do the work of God. <hi>The kingdom of heaven ſuffers violence, and the violent take it by force,</hi> Mat. 11.12. Doeſt thou think then by thy formality, coldneſſe and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm moderation ever to attain Heaven? Is not Chriſtianity compared to ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a maſtery, to running in a race? Do ye not read of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtriving for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>and forgetting all things that are behinde?</hi> Phil 3 Did not the holy Ghoſt deſcend in the form of fire, with a mighty ruſhing wind, to ſignifie how active it is in thoſe that are godly? Doeſt thou therefore cry out of this forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and this zeal? What is this, but to open thy mouth againſt Heaven? On thy death-bed, it may be nothing will trouble thee ſo much as thy ſlothfulneſſe
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101245:137"/>
and barrenneſſe, that thou waſt not as active for God, as for the world, thou wouldſt then wiſh thy ſoul might fare as theirs ſhall, who made it their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſerve God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That part of Chriſtianity ſeemeth a fooliſh thing, <hi>which preſſeth the life of faith, and not of ſenſe.</hi> Thus the world knoweth not what to make of it. That as the Heathens thought the Chriſtians worſhipped the clouds, becauſe they had no Idols or ſenſible Images, but looked up directly to Heaven: So worldly men think the godly pleaſe themſelves with fancies and imaginations, becauſe they talk of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and <hi>living by faith,</hi> and not walking according to the ſenſible principles of the world; yet <hi>the juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> Rom. 1.17. A godly man like the earth is faſtned upon nothing viſible. When <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſaid, <hi>Habak.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Though the fig-tree did not bloſſome,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God his ſalvation.</hi> Would not worldly men think this was his folly, rather than faith? So when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He was poor, yet making many rich, and as having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.10. Doth not the world count this folly? When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the believers, <hi>That all things were theirs,</hi> would they not ſay like <hi>Feſtus,</hi> not much learning, but much ignorance had made him mad?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>To acknowledge Chriſt and his way, though to our outward undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> This ſeemeth great folly: our Saviour therefore doth ſo fortifie his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, <hi>That they ſhould not be offended at troubles, that they ſhould be hated of all men, that they ſhould account it an happy thing to be perſecuted for his ſake.</hi> And we ſee the Apoſtles and Martyrs chuſing the greateſt torments, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to deny any of Chriſts Truths. Now what a fooliſh thing doth the world account this, not to be any thing, to do any thing, to ſay, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, to believe and disbelieve, to ſave a mans eſtate, and his life? As the perſecutour told <hi>Baſil</hi> the great, in this thing indeed great,
<q>Why would he loſe his life for meer neceties and words; it was but ſaying ſo and ſo, a little matter, and all ſhould be well?</q>
Thus the matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and godlineſſe, is counted ſuch a nicety, or nothing, to a mans wealth, and outward accommodations, that he will, as was ſaid of one Biſhop, ſing <hi>Canticum novum,</hi> and yet never be out of tune, becauſe alwayes ſerving the times.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Admonition.</hi> If thou wilt be Chriſts Diſciple indeed, know the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and reputation of the world, and his commands practiſed, are not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent together. Thou canſt not be judged a wiſe man, a diſcreet man, and yet a violent man for the kingdome of Heaven; if you goe faſter, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the common formality of moſt men, you have loſt your repute pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. As was ſaid of <hi>Naaman, He was a great man, a mighty man, but he was a Leper.</hi> Thus doe thou expect; a rich man, a good natured man, an honeſt man, but too forward, too much for purity and preciſeneſſe. Oh that ever this ſhould be among Chriſtians! The Jew loveth the moſt zealous Jew; The Papiſt, the moſt devout Papiſt; but we reformed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, love not thoſe whoſe tongues and lives doe moſt proteſt, both againſt Idolatry and all wickedneſſe. Well, doe not thou give over for all that; for though they judge it folly, yet thou aweſt their conſcience ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly.</p>

But I ſhall take it as largely, as the Scripture, which under <hi>wiſdom</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends <hi>the whole way of faith and godlineſſe.</hi> That therefore only true wiſdom is in the Church of God, appeareth ſeveral wayes:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Here we have the <hi>only Rule of wiſdome,</hi> which is, <hi>the Scriptures; ſo that all people without this ſit in darkneſſe, and want the ſtarre to bring them to Chriſt or happineſſe David</hi> doth in many places acknowledge this excellent property of Gods Word, <hi>That it giveth wiſdome to the ſimple.</hi> Jer. 8 9. <hi>They have refuſed the word of God, and what wiſdome can be in them?</hi> Thus you ſee, that only Chriſtians have the true Rule of wiſdome, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Word. But oh the ingratitude and rebellion of many, who love their folly and their darkneſſe, when yet they may be thus ſpiritually wiſe! Who is there that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Book, to believe accordingly, to inflame his affections, and order his life accordingly? Who looketh into this Glaſſe, to dreſſe himſelf, and compoſe himſelf according to thoſe commands? No folly, no cauſe of repentance would be in us, could we keep exactly to this Rule. <hi>O me nunquam ſapientem,</hi> cryed <hi>Tully,</hi> when deprived of all his hopes: But <hi>O me ſemper ſapientem,</hi> may the godly ſay, while keeping cloſe to Gods Word. Though thou art no Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, no learned man; though poor and contemptible, yet from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:101245:138"/>
thou mayeſt learne great and admirable wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Only in the Church is true wiſdome, becauſe this cometh from God above, and is by divine infuſion into us.</hi> Men may be moral wiſe men, and have great political prudence, as <hi>Cato</hi> was called the Wiſe; but we Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are to expect a <hi>wiſdome from above,</hi> or an heavenly wiſdome, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture cals it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3, 17. Alas, every man naturally, though of never ſo much raiſed intellectual abilities in humane things, is a very fool and mad man in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and ſpiritual things. Therefore this wiſdome is a gift of God, and is the eye or chief part of our godlineſſe. <hi>If any man want wiſdom, let him ask it of God,</hi> Jam. 1. God indeed gave <hi>Solomon</hi> political prudence, and civil wiſdom; but that which is <hi>neceſſary for all,</hi> is <hi>wiſdom for their ſouls,</hi> and <hi>to walk in ſuch wayes that bring to happineſſe.</hi> This wiſdom a poor deſpiſed Chriſtian may have, when a great learned Scholar may be without it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>In Chriſtianity there is only true wiſdome, becauſe there is only true godlineſſe.</hi> Now in the Scripture phraſe, <hi>To fear God, to live holily, to mortifie ſinne</hi>; this is wiſdome, <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom,</hi> Pro. 1.7. <hi>and to depart from evil is a good underſtanding.</hi> Hence all along in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Proverbs, we ſee <hi>godlineſſe</hi> called <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and the <hi>godly man a wiſe man:</hi> As on the other ſide, <hi>a wicked man is the fool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and he that ſinneth is ſaid to do <hi>fooliſhly.</hi> There is no <hi>Jewiſh piety,</hi> no <hi>Heatheniſh piety,</hi> only <hi>Chriſtian piety,</hi> There cannot be any godlineſſe, but where the Spirit of God ſanctifieth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generateth. So then, if thou wouldſt attain to true wiſdome; know that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the fear of God, and departing from all ſinne. Thou art never more fooliſh and unwiſe, than when thou giveſt way to any luſt; ſuch things will coſt thee a dear and bitter repentance: Do not ſay, this wiſdom is too high for thee, for by praying and ſeeking to God, thou mayeſt enjoy it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Chriſtianity teacheth the true wiſdom, becauſe that only enſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth about the true and proper end of all our actions, which is happineſſe.</hi> How did the wiſe men of the world ſtagger up and down like giddy men in this point? Or like the blinde <hi>Sodomites,</hi> went groping up and down for the door, and could not find it; they knew not where, or what bleſſedneſſe was? but the Scripture doth plentifully teach us, wherein all true happineſſe doth conſiſt, and that is, <hi>in the injoying God himſelf,</hi> his favour and love. It's not riches, honours, pleaſures, no nor virtue it ſelf, but only God, and a propriety in him, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth happy; He is the ocean, other things are but a drop; He is the Sunne, all creatures are but ſtarres, deriving all light from him. Seeing then a great part of wiſdome lieth in the propounding of the true and right end, then only by godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe do we come to have true wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>In Chriſtianity, we have not only the true end propounded, but the right means alſo, whereby we may attain it.</hi> For prudence lieth in the chuſing of fit and conducible means to ſuch an end: So that as in any art, no man can by his art produce artificial operations without fit tools: So neither can we in our actions as rational men, arrive to the true end. <hi>viz.</hi> happineſſe; without thoſe fit means appointed thereunto; and this is <hi>only by Chriſt, as the meritorious cauſe,</hi> and <hi>by faith, as the inſtrumental</hi>; by Chriſt we have peace with God, and by faith we are partakers of Chriſt. Now this whole order and diſpenſation the world is altogether ignorant of; all the wiſdom of man would not pitch upon ſuch a way as this, by Chriſt, and through faith in Chriſt. But when <hi>Paul</hi> is made wiſe in an heavenly manner, <hi>He deſireth to know nothing, but Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>; and, <hi>He accounts all things dung and droſſe for the righteouſneſſe which is by faith,</hi> Phil. 3.9.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>By Chriſtianity we are onely taught to avoid that which cauſeth repentance and grief of mind after it's done. David</hi> ſaid, by the <hi>Word</hi> of God he was <hi>forewarned</hi> from ſinne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. And, <hi>Then ſhall I not be confounded,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:101245:138"/>
when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.6. Well doth the Scripture ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.10. <hi>They have a good underſtanding, who do Gods Commandments</hi>; becauſe all wickedneſſe, though ſweet in the mouth, yet will prove wormwood in the belly. We have done fooliſhly, ſay they, who repent of their ſins, <hi>Inſipientis eſt dicere non putâram,</hi> fools uſe to ſay, I did not think ſuch a thing; Oh I did not believe the guilt of ſinne was ſo terrible! I did not think the fury of God had been ſo overwhelming, I did not believe the ſting of ſinne had been ſo grievous! Thus all wicked men, they buy repentance and eternal torments it may be in Hell at a dear rate, for the pleaſures of ſinne, which laſt for a moment. Oh then, what happy wiſdome is it, ſo to live, and ſo to do, that a man afterwards ſhall have no cauſe to roar out for the guilt upon him! that in the time of ſickneſſe, and hour of death thou mayeſt not cry out, Oh fooliſh and wretched man that I am! Oh that I had been wiſer! but now I fear it is too late.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Chriſtianity teacheth this wiſdome, not ſo much to regard the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as to provide for the future, to remember our later end, to provide for eternity. Prudens</hi> (they ſay) is <hi>quaſi porro videns,</hi> ſeeing afarre off, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as wicked men are ſaid to be like bruit beaſts, that are carried away with ſenſible objects, ſuch as they, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die:</hi> Such as <hi>Dives,</hi> as <hi>would have his goods in the life,</hi> and therefore he is called a <hi>fool,</hi> becauſe he did not conſider, what would be after, <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be taken from thee',</hi> Luke 12.20. But our Religion teacheth us better wiſdome; <hi>Oh that they were wiſe</hi> (ſaid God) <hi>that they would conſider their later end!</hi> Deut. 32.29 And certainly, this wiſdome is of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequence: For what worlds of gold would the damned give that they had had ſuch wiſdome, while they lived in this world? <hi>David</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for this, <hi>Teach me to number my dayes, that I may apply my heart to wiſdome,</hi> Pſal. 90.12.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>Herein doth Chriſtianity teach us true wiſdome, becauſe thereby we are inabled to improve the ſeaſons and opportunities of grace.</hi> It's account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great peece of worldly wiſdome, to know the fit ſeaſons of buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Now <hi>Paul</hi> directs us in heavenly things, <hi>Walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time,</hi> Epheſ. 5.15, 16. What is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect wiſe thing? Even to redeem the time; we have ſpent much of our ſtrength, of our time in the ſervice of ſinne, we have loſt many an happy hour and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; Oh then this is wiſdome, to redeem it, for the future to be more active, and that, <hi>becauſe the dayes are evil!</hi> There are many hinderances and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to what is good. The Ant, though a little creature, is commended for natural wiſdome, <hi>That it layeth up in Summer</hi>; it knoweth the ſeaſons to hoord up its corn: And this will be our heavenly wiſdome, to take the day of grace before the night come, wherein none can work, <hi>John</hi> 9.4. Our Saviour himſelf uſed this Argument, to ſhew, why he would not let ſlip that occaſion of doing good on the Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, <hi>Chriſtian wiſdome is ſeen in caution and circumſpection, to refuſe all the ſnares and temptations of ſinne, and to find out all the Devils methods and ſubtilties.</hi> For there are the depths of Satan, and the devices of Satan; and ſinne hath its pleaſant baits and charms: So that unleſſe a man have wiſdome given him from above, he cannot but give up all his ſtrength into ſome <hi>Dalilahs</hi> hands; then there is alſo the enmity of the world; we muſt be <hi>wiſe as Serpents</hi> againſt that.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, <hi>Herein Chriſtianity giveth wiſdome, becauſe it helps to conquer and overcome all unruly paſſions, which while they rage, bereave us of all wiſdom.</hi> Anger is a ſhort madneſſe, <hi>Difficile eſt amare &amp; ſapere</hi>; Any affection prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throweth duſt into the eye of the ſoul. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:101245:139"/>
ruleth his own heart is greater than he that conquereth a City,</hi> Prov. 16.32. It teacheth alſo a moderate uſe of all earthly comforts, to marry, to buy, as if we did it not.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>It is excellent to inſtruct us to bear afflictions, and how to abound.</hi> Only by that we can tell, how to be rich, and how to be poor, as <hi>Paul; I know how to abound, and how to want</hi>; I am inſtructed (ſaith he) as in a great myſtery: he uſeth that word, which the Heathens did of their religious ſecrets, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>Of Exhortation</hi>; Think you hear wiſdome in the Scripture, and by the Miniſters, crying aloud to you, as in the <hi>Proverbs, Oh ye ſimple love under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding! O ye fooliſh, why will ye paſſe by, and go on in ſinne!</hi> Though thou hadſt the knowledge and parts of an Angel; though thou hadſt as much political wiſdom as <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet if thou haſt not this heavenly wiſdome, thou art ſtill a fool. What though thou art wiſer for the things of this world, yet if fooliſh in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, that earthly wiſdome cannot help thee? Say then to thy ſelf, Oh fooliſh and unwiſe ſinner! Why do I take this moment of pleaſure, for an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of torment? Oh fooliſh and blind man! Why do I let the day of grace, and the precious time of ſalvation paſſe away? Will not this be bitterneſſe in the later end?</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Subject</hi> is, <hi>The wiſdome of this world</hi>; by that you heard was meant all the <hi>knowledge, learning,</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> which is attained in this world, by meer humane induſtry. This is the choice and moſt excellent pearl that the world hath: if their wiſdome be thus folly, what then is their folly?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>Attribute, It's fooliſhneſſe with God.</hi> Though the wiſe men of this world have written ſeveral Books, as the <hi>Encomium hujus moriae,</hi> the praiſe of this folly; yet God abhorreth and rejecteth it: <hi>It is fooliſhneſſe with God,</hi> who is the only wiſe God, who is only able to judge and diſcern what things are. There are many wiſe, learned men in the world, whoſe naked propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we do more regard than other mens demonſtrations But how much more ſhould we acquieſce in Gods aſſertions?

                     <p>Now when the <hi>wiſdome of the world</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>fooliſhneſſe with God,</hi> that is to be underſtood two wayes,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Actively,</hi> it is onely contriving, plotting and accompliſhing fooliſh things.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Paſſively,</hi> God turneth it all to fooliſhneſſe, as <hi>David</hi> prayed,

God would <hi>turn Achitophels counſel into folly,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.31.

Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That all the admired wiſdome of a meer worldly man is nothing but contemptible folly before God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Obſerv.</hi> All worldly wiſdom is folly before God. And that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered <hi>actively</hi> or <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.</hi> I. <hi>Active fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The worlds wiſe man is Gods fool; he whoſe words and counſels in worldly matters, are as <hi>Achitophels</hi> in his dayes, like the oracles of God; they are by God turned into meer fooliſhneſſe.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall firſt begin with that <hi>active fooliſhneſſe,</hi> demonſtrating by ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <hi>That all worldly wiſdome is meer folly.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>This is abundantly ſeen in all that Idolatry and ſuperſtition which the wiſeſt of men are prone unto, and wherein they do greatly applaud themſelves.</hi> What more fooliſh, ridiculous and abſurd inſtances have we of folly, then of the Idolatry and ſuperſtitious worſhip, that the Oracles of their dayes have decreed? The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. ſpeaketh excellently to this purpoſe, <hi>Profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſe, they became fools</hi>; for their fooliſh heart was darkned: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was this ſeen? <hi>In turning the glory of the inviſible God, into an image of an Ox that eateth hay.</hi> This doth eſpecially relate to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who boaſted of their great wiſdome; and indeed they were the ſeminary of learning, it's ſaid to all the world; yet who more fooliſh in their Idolatry than they, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping an <hi>Ox,</hi> yea <hi>Mice,</hi> and <hi>Cats,</hi> and <hi>Crocodiles?</hi> This alſo might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> while applauded for the wiſe men of the world. How abſurd and fooliſh were they in their worſhip? Inſomuch that <hi>Socrates</hi> was called an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> meerly becauſe he derided their many gods; and <hi>Auſtin</hi> relateth a great deal of excellent diſcourſe, which <hi>Seneca</hi> hath againſt the Idolatry and Superſtition than in uſe, though that Tractate be not now among his Works. But theſe are Heathens; and ſo no wonder if we ſhall find even in the Church of God, when men have followed their humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in preſcribing the worſhip of God by that, they become vain and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: witneſſe all that heap of fooliſh and ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery brought into the Church by degrees. That as the ridiculous deformity of an Ape lieth in imitating, or being like a man, and yet not a man: So the abſurd folly of all that ſuperſtitious worſhip did appear in the affectation of Religion and Devotion, when indeed it was not ſo. Now this great folly of Idolatry, the Scripture doth often aggravate, <hi>They have eyes, and ſee not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they that make them are like unto them.</hi> They are even ſuch ſtupid Idols, as their Idols are. And what holy deriſion doth the Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> put upon <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, launcing and cutting themſelves, crying, <hi>O Baal hear us,</hi> 1 King. 18.26. Eſpecially the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> deſcribeth this bruitiſh folly, when he telleth us of the workmen, that with one peece of wood, he makes a fire, and with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a god, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.19. If you ask then, <hi>Wherein the great wiſdome of the world is fooliſhneſſe?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>in their Worſhip, in their Religion.</hi> All the golden Images, all the curious ornaments and veſtments in worſhip, are but <hi>beggarly things,</hi> if compared with the pure ſpiritual worſhip of God. Thus, when the <hi>Galatians</hi> apoſtatized from the pure Goſpel-worſhip of Chriſt, and turned to <hi>antiquated Ceremonies,</hi> he cals them, <hi>Fooliſh Galatians,</hi> Chap. 3.1. We doe not breake Chriſts command, when we call ſuch fooles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:101245:140"/>
it's not from a cauſleſſe anger, but a judicious zeal.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Worldly wiſdome is meer fooliſhneſſe, becauſe ſuch men contrive and plot, and think to accompliſh all their counſels by their own ſtrength and way.</hi> Now this is a very fooliſh and abſurd thing: for the thoughts of a man are in ſome reſpect from man, but the ordering and diſpoſing of all things is from God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23. <hi>I know Lord, it is not in man to order his own way.</hi> Thus you ſee <hi>Achitophel</hi> was a meer fool in the iſſue. And thus the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cryeth out, <hi>The princes of Zoan are fools,</hi> Iſa. 19.11. even they that boaſted in their wiſdome. We reade of ſome <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours, and others, that did moſt fooliſhly affect a Deity, eſpecially <hi>Caius Caeſar,</hi> for which ſome thought him the <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Yea ſome of the Chriſtian Emperours, did affect the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of God, as <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> that denied Eternity to the Sonne of God, yet would have men ſalute him with <hi>Aeternitas veſtra.</hi> What blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous folly was this for a man, who was to be worms meat preſently? Now in ſome reſpects, all the great wiſe men of the world do the like; they take upon them a kind of Deity; they think to work and contrive all things by their own fortitude and wiſdome, as he in the Poet,
<q>
                           <l>Virtus mihi numen &amp; enſis,</l>
                           <l>Quem te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>eo. <hi>And another,</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>Ignavis eſt opus auxilio divino.</l>
                        </q>
But (alas) in all theſe things, men are meer fools: for their very thoughts and purpoſes are not in their own power, God faſhioneth the hearts of men. <hi>Laban</hi> had other thoughts; <hi>Eſau</hi> other thoughts than they intended. And as their thoughts are not in their own power, ſo much leſſe are the accompliſhments, or performances of them. But as the ſtone, when once flung away, is no more in the mans power; ſo neither is the performance of any thing under the command of humane wiſdome. Thus they are fooliſh in all their counſels, <hi>The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the thoughts of the wiſe are vain,</hi> as it followeth,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>All worldly wiſdome is folly, becauſe it's onely attentive to get the good things of this world, and never looketh to the world to come.</hi> Oh that the worms of this world would ſee how fooliſh and bruitiſh they are in this particular! <hi>Luke</hi> 12.21. The Parable of the <hi>fooliſh rich man,</hi> who trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up all the good things of this life, ſee what a concluſion the Parable hath from him, <hi>So is every one that is rich in this world, and layeth not up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure towards God.</hi> So is every one, that is, ſuch a fool is every one: Yet how is this folly praiſed for wiſdome in this world? Give them the pleaſures, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, the contents of this world, and they never regard the world to come. Oh fooliſh men and unwiſe! Will thy wealth avail thee in the day of Gods wrath? Will thy pleaſures of ſinne continue with thee, when the pangs and throbs of death ſhall once ſurprize thee? Well, go on and applaud thy ſelf in thy pleaſures, in thy greatneſſe, in thy abundance, but know, that if abiding thus, thou wilt die a fool, and be damned a fool.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>They are actively fooliſh, becauſe they are conceited of this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and boaſt of it.</hi> This is a ſure ſign of a fool, to conceit himſelf wiſe, and to put confidence in it; yea, he is more fooliſh than a fool; for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is more hope of a fool than ſuch a man,</hi> Prov. 26.12. Now herein is manifeſted the folly of all earthly wiſdome, that it doth reject ſound counſel: It counts its own wayes, and its own courſes better, than what Chriſt or his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do adviſe unto. Therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Mat. 11.19. None but the children of God are able to approve and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the true Scripture-wiſdome. You ſee Chriſt himſelf, the wiſdome of the Father, in whom were the treaſures of wiſdome, yet had all his counſel rejected with ſcorn by the Phariſees. What flocking would there be to hear one ſpeak
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:101245:140"/>
that was raiſed out of the grave? But Chriſt came from Heaven, from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Father; who would not readily aſſent to what he ſhould direct un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? Yet they would not hearken to his words; And why? Becauſe they were not of God, <hi>John</hi> 8.47. as Chriſt told them. Herein then the lamentable folly of all earthly wiſdome is diſcovered, that it regards her own corrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, and the reaſonings thereof more than Gods wiſdome, or the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of Chriſt perſwading them to the contrary. Thou art therefore to unteach thy ſelf, all thy former principles, all thy former concluſions before thou canſt be taught by God.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>It muſt needs be folly, becauſe it's directly contrary unto God, and his wayes, which are only wiſe.</hi> Rom. 8.7. <hi>The wiſdome of the fleſh is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God.</hi> This is enough to proclaim the folly and madneſſe of it to all the world. For can any man <hi>proſper that hardens himſelf againſt God?</hi> To oppoſe God, to ſet againſt the wayes of God, is called, <hi>Kicking againſt the pricks,</hi> Act 9.5. Is it not a mad and fooliſh thing to do ſo? Yet thus all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdome doth. It cannot agree nor comply with the holy Law, and holy will of God: and therefore the Goſpel, and the wayes of Chriſt never had greater enemies and adverſaries than theſe, that were moſt famous for earthly wiſdome. If you conſider the Heretiques, they were moſt of them men of great earthly wiſdome, too wiſe to yeeld to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel of Chriſt; if you conſider the great Stateſmen and Pilots of Commonwealths; how difficultly do they become fools that they might be wiſe, though indeed none ever proved greater fools than ſuch; for through oppoſing God and Chriſt, they have been forced to cry out with <hi>Julian</hi> at laſt, <hi>Viciſti Galilaee.</hi> Take heed then of truſting in that admired wiſdome of thine, which God accounts fooliſhneſſe, and will prove ſo in the later end.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>All humane and earthly wiſdome is fooliſhneſſe, becauſe it makes a man a ſad loſer in the later end.</hi> He that to enjoy his luſts, and his carnal pleaſures for a ſeaſon, doth loſe his ſoul, and the favour of God; What a fool will he be, when God ſhall condemn him, when he ſhall lie eternally tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in thoſe everlaſting flames? Then they roar out, We fools deſpiſed wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and hated inſtruction; That is wiſdome then, which provideth for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which looketh to the future, and no earthly wiſdome doth this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's meer fooliſhneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction,</hi> To pull off that mask or painting which is put upon the wiſdome of the world. Who is accounted wiſe, but that man, whom God judgeth a fool? And who is ſcorned as a fool, but that man whom God pronounceth wiſe? And truly we may take up that, All are become fooliſh and vain by nature. Thou that by craft, diſſimulation and injuſtice think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to enrich thy ſelf; thou applaudeſt thy ſelf for being ſo wiſe, when God will ſay, <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be taken away.</hi> Is he not a fool that leaveth a treaſure of gold for coals? Is not he a fool that forſaketh a fountain to go to a broken ciſtern? Is not he a fool that would be in great pomp and honour for one day, to be a perpetual tormented ſlave for ever after? Yet thus fooliſh and unwiſe are all wicked men. Pray then for wiſdome from above; intreat God to deliver thee from thy own earthly wiſdom: There is no greater enemy to thy ſoul then that; Chriſt revealed not himſelf to ſuch; Gods election is not of ſuch: Oh then be afraid of thy ſelf!</p>

                        <hi>For the wiſdome of this world is fooliſhneſſe with God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>You have heard, that this worldly wiſdome is fooliſhneſſe <hi>actively,</hi> I ſhall now proceed to ſhew its <hi>fooliſhneſs Paſſively</hi>; ſuch which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooleth or turneth to folly. So that there are no men whom God doth more reſiſt and ſet himſelf againſt, then ſuch proud, worldly wiſe men. He delights, wherein they deal proudly, to be above them; and wherein they reſolve to deal wiſely, to outwit them, as we ſay. So that as you ſee little Children, who have got a Bird tyed to a ſtring, they make themſelves ſport with her, and when ſhe thinketh to fly here and there, they pull her back again. Thus God hath an over-ruling wiſdome, and an over-ruling power over all men, their counſels, and their actions. Which made an Heathen call man <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>The Tennis-ball that the Providence of God playeth withall, and handeth hither and thither.</hi> Thus the Scripture excellently expreſſeth it, by putting an <hi>hook into mens noſtrils, and a bridle in their lips,</hi> Iſa. 37.29. The Providence of God is the Rider or Seſſor upon all the wiſe mens counſels and actions, and they are over-ruled by God, as we do our Horſes, to turn them this way and that way, backwards and forwards. And this is the chief ſcope of the Apoſtle in the words following, as will then more particularly appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How worldly wiſdome is fooliſhneſſe in a <hi>paſſive</hi> ſenſe. God turning all their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into folly.</note>Firſt therefore, <hi>God makes this wiſdome fooliſhneſſe, in a paſſive ſenſe, in that he did not vouchſafe to uſe it as an inſtrument to propagate the Goſpel.</hi> He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to take the wiſe and learned Oratours or Philoſophers of the world. Now wherein could a greater ſcorn be put upon the wiſdome of the world, then in this particular, that God would not ſo much as own it, or take notice of it, in the plantation of the Goſpel? <hi>Paul</hi> doth often mention this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>It pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of Preaching to ſave men,</hi> when the wiſe men of the world would not acknowledge God by the creatures. And at another time, <hi>Paul</hi> renounced the cunning and deceitfull waies of humane wiſdome; <hi>They did not come in ſuch words</hi>: And why? <hi>That their faith might be in the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.5. So then, if you regard what Inſtruments God did at firſt chooſe to diffuſe his Goſpel truths, you will find he ſlighted and paſſed over the great wiſe men of the world, and choſe the poor, fooliſh, and contemptible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. Herein God did demonſtrate his wiſdome, that ſo all power and greatneſſe might be acknowledged to be <hi>in</hi> and <hi>from</hi> him <hi>only.</hi> What a reproach did <hi>Haman</hi> account it, that all the Royal robes and honour ſhould be put upon <hi>Mordecai</hi> his great enemy, and he laid aſide? No leſſe did this inrage the wiſe men of the world, to ſee, that by ſuch contemptible Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo great and mighty changes ſhould be wrought upon the hearts and lives of men. This is the firſt inſtance. Yet this is not ſo to be underſtood, as if God did not ſometimes uſe the wiſe men of the world; for he choſe <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Nazianzen, Baſil</hi>; to the latter whereof, <hi>Libanius,</hi> the great Scholar in thoſe daies, but an Heathen, wrote, that he <hi>did ſo admire his judgment, that he did all over ſwete and tremble to think on that time when he ſhould read his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, and paſſe his cenſure of it.</hi> But though God did uſe ſuch wiſe men, yet this was not the chief and principall thing whereby they propagated Faith, but rather the Goſpel ſimplicity. They did it not <hi>quà ſapientes, quà Oratores,</hi> but <hi>quâ credentes</hi>: As <hi>Sampſon</hi> wrought thoſe great and wonderfull things, not by the ſtrength of his armes, but by his hair, that ſo the effect might be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God, and not to <hi>Sampſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Herein God make it fooliſhneſſe, that as he doth not uſe it for the enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Goſpel, ſo he taketh very few of ſuch men to beſtow on them ſpiritual and ſoul ſaving graces.</hi> Few of ſuch doth he <hi>call,</hi> doth he <hi>juſtifie,</hi> doth he <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,</hi> doth he <hi>reveal the myſteries of grace unto.</hi> Oh, what a wonderfull inſtance
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:101245:141"/>
is this, of the fooliſhneſſe of this worldly wiſdome! There are few of that ranck to whom God will communicate grace and ſalvation. That whereas of many prophane and grievous ſinners, he hath choſen many to ſalvation, of worldly wiſe men very few. The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. doth induſtriouſly take notice of this, <hi>Not many wiſe men after the fleſh hath God choſen.</hi> Yea, Chriſt ſolemnly gave thanks to God, that he had <hi>not revealed heavenly myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the wiſe, but to babes,</hi> Mat. 11.25. So that there is little cauſe for men to boaſt of their worldly wiſdome and prudence, that they are crafty and ſubtile in their generation; for this is both a cauſe and a ſign alſo, that thou art not one to whom God will reveal himſelf. Not that God calleth none of ſuch, but not many, <hi>viz.</hi> comparatively to thoſe of a more contemptible way, whom he doth ſet apart for himſelf. Take heed thou be not too wiſe, too proud of thy parts, and therefore God will paſſe thee by.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Herein alſo God will make it appear to be folly, in that he takes the fooliſh things of the world, and makes them confound the wiſe things.</hi> When <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let us deal wiſely to ſuppreſſe the Iſraelites,</hi> the fooliſh Midwifes did confound him; ſo that he brought up one by his own bread, and at his own charge, who ſhould be his ruine, and deliver the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> If we read in the Scripture, you ſhall find nothing more ordinary, then God by fooliſh things to confound wiſe, and by weak things to overcome ſtrong. And well may it be called <hi>the confounding of the wiſe:</hi> for certainly, there cannot be a greater aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and confounding of men worldly wiſe, then by ſuch fooliſh inſtruments. As <hi>Abimelech</hi> was enraged at the heart, that it ſhould be ſaid, <hi>A woman had killed him.</hi> Thus by Frogs, and Lice, and ſuch contemptible vermine, did God plague the great <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Herein doth God make the wiſdome of the world fooliſhneſſe, becauſe all that wiſe men do, is a vain work</hi> They are not able to acompliſh their ends, to bring about their deſignes; eſpecially thoſe which are to overthrow the Kingdom of Chriſt, and rooting out his Church and People. This hath been often attempted by the wiſe men of the world, but it hath been a vain thing. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. you ſee it was of old propheſied: <hi>Why do the Heathens rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</hi> It's applyed to the chief Prieſts, and other Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees among the Jews, but it was a vain thing: It could not be effected. And truly, for many hundred years the Devil hath been attempting this by all kind of Inſtruments, and by all manner of waies, to root out the faithfull ones of Chriſt, his Truth and Goſpel; but it hath been to them, as God ſaid to <hi>Paul</hi> in the heat of his perſecution, <hi>Thou kickeſt againſt the pricks.</hi> What wiſe man would with his bare heels kick againſt the ſharp points of iron? and yet all the wiſe men of the world, that have ſet againſt Chriſt and Godlineſſe, have been ſuch fools.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>God makes the wiſdome of the world fooliſhneſſe, becauſe what they work is not only a vain work, but a deceitfull work.</hi> They are wholly fruſtrated in their expectation: They find the clean contrary to what they intended. Such fooliſhneſſe doth God make the wiſdome of the world. <hi>The wicked worketh a deceitfull work,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.18. Compared therefore to the <hi>spiders web,</hi> that is of no defence or uſe, when a boiſtrous wind ariſeth. Read over the Hiſtory of the Bible, and there you ſhall ſee, to that which the wiſe men of the world intended, God brought about the clear contrary. <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) <hi>let us deal wiſely, and oppreſſe the Iſraelites,</hi> (Exo. 1.10) <hi>leſt they grow to numerous</hi>: Now by that very means the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did more mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> thought, when they had crucified Chriſt, they had laid all Chriſtianity in the Grave with him, but by his Aſcenſion, his power was the more ſeen. <hi>When I am lifted up,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>viz.</hi> upon the Croſſe, <hi>I will draw all men to me,</hi> Joh. 12.32. That, which in probability, would have driven
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:101245:142"/>
all men from him, by that he did efficaciouſly bring all unto him. Hence he compareth his death to the <hi>grain of Corn thrown into the ground, which untill it die, doth not bring forth a great crop.</hi> So that the wiſdome of man muſt needs be made great folly, when it ſhall be forced to bring about thoſe things which it hates ſo much.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Herein the wiſdome of the world is made fooliſhneſſe, becauſe it doth not only work a vain deceitfull work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo a deſtructive one to its ſelf; ſo that all the wiſdome they have, is only to deſtroy themſelves.</hi> Thus like fools they runne their ſwords in their own bowels. How often doth <hi>David</hi> ſpeak this of his wiſe and potent enemies? <hi>Their feet were taken in their own ſnares, and they were fallen into the pit they digged for others.</hi> Was not all <hi>Pharaohs</hi> wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome but to ruine himſelf and his Kingdome? The Jews that thought to be ſo wiſe in crucifying Chriſt, thereby to prevent the Romane <hi>Caeſar,</hi> yet for a reward, had the Romane enemy come and utterly deſtroy them. Thus as they <hi>work a ſpiders web</hi> in regard of the unprofitableneſſe of them, ſo they are ſaid to <hi>hatch cockatrice egges,</hi> becauſe of the hurtfull poiſonous nature of them, even to the owners.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>The wiſdome of the world becometh fooliſhneſſe, becauſe God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times infatuateth and blaſteth the parts and abilities of the wiſe men of the world.</hi> He takes away their underſtanding from them. That as we read of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> God bereaved him of his wiſdome and judgment, ſo that he became like a beaſt, and lived with beaſts; ſo he doth either in whole or in part pervert and darken the thoughts and counſels of wiſe men. Hence he is ſaid by the Prophet, to <hi>pour a Spirit of giddineſſe upon them, and to make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner</hi>'s <hi>mad,</hi> Iſa. 44.25. as alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Et quos Deus vult perdere, prius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentat</hi>; as we ſee in <hi>Haman,</hi> and in <hi>Belſhazer,</hi> and in <hi>Herod,</hi> all theſe died as fools, and were deſtroyed by their own fooliſh thoughts. Thus we read of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Sons and others, they would not hearken to the good counſel of the Lord, becauſe it was of the Lord to deſtroy them.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, <hi>Herein God doth alſo make their wiſdome folly, becauſe by their pride and haughtineſſe they undoe themſelves</hi> God lets them proſper, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world ſeemeth to flouriſh a great while, but it is that their deſtruction may be the greater. Thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.11. its ſaid of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> after all that great ſucceſſe which he attributed to himſelf, <hi>His mind ſhould change, and he ſhould paſſe over and offend. Proſperity ſlayeth the fooliſh one,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. <hi>With the froward,</hi> that is, the crafty worldly wiſe man, oppoſite to the pure and upright in heart, <hi>thou wilt wreſtle</hi> (as it were) <hi>and give a fall unto,</hi> according to the Hebrew. As the wreſtler lifts a man up from the ground, that he may throw him down with the more violence; ſo doth God give a man of the world his hearts deſire, that he ſhall attribute all to his wiſdome and prudence, and this is to be his overthrow. Thus we have the Prophet inſulting over <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the wiſe men thereof, as alſo over <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zidon,</hi> that ſet their heart as God, and thought ſhe had the wiſdome of <hi>Daniel, Ezek.</hi> 28.2.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A two-fold humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>viz.</hi> good, evil.</note>Now to adde one <hi>Caution, we muſt diſtinguiſh of a two-fold humane wiſdome</hi>: One that is the ſame with true <hi>prudence,</hi> whereby men are able to mannage pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique places of truſt, they do <hi>prae eſſe, ut proſint,</hi> for the publique good; they have <hi>the art of ruling well.</hi> And this the Text meaneth not: For though it be not a virtue, yet it is the eye to all a mans actions. It's as neceſſary to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique affairs, as the Sunne to the world; therefore God gave it <hi>Solomon</hi> as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial mercy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Their humane wiſdome, which originally cometh from the corrupt reaſon of man; and for the manner of it, is only according to worldly and fleſhly conſiderations, and tends only to worldly advantages.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>For its nature,

None have had ſuch tragical and diſmall ends as they. Therefore uprightneſſe and an holy fear of God, that is the beſt wiſdome. And although Chriſt himſelf, and the Martyrs, who abounded in this wiſdome, did not eſcape the miſeries of the world; yet that cometh from the wiſe and high diſpenſations of God, who hath ordered, that <hi>through many tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

                     <p>Now when he ſaith, <hi>God takes them in their craft,</hi> that may be taken, either as the matter in which God overpowereth them, and deſtroyeth them: Or it may be taken inſtrumentally, as ſometimes the word is; by their very craft and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome God layeth hold upon them, and overwhelmeth them. Thus you have the words explained. Obſerve,</p>

                        <hi>That God delights to take the earthly wiſe men of the world in their own craft.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Spiders are hung in their own webs. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.13. a notable inſtance of the wiſe men of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now many waies doth God take the wiſe ones of the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How God takes the wiſe men of the world in their own craft.</note>Firſt, <hi>In diſſipating their counſels that they cannot attain their ends.</hi> They attempt again and again, and are alwaies repulſed. As 2 <hi>King.</hi> 46.11. the King of <hi>Syria</hi> had many times intended to intrap the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in ſuch a place, and he was alwaies diſappointed, <hi>which made the heart of the King troubled,</hi> ſaith the text. It's not as mens counſels or purpoſes are, but the <hi>counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand.</hi> The <hi>hearts of Kings,</hi> of the greateſt of powers in the world, <hi>are as the rivers of water, which the Husbandman doth eaſily turn into this channell or that channell. Julian</hi>'s great purpoſe, was to root out the Chriſtian Religion; he would not have them named Chriſtians but <hi>Galileans</hi>; he would not have them brought up in humane learning; he put all the diſcouragements upon them; would let them enjoy no benefits of the Law, or the Courts of Juſtice: and yet he was taken in his own craft. He was ſo ſtrangely killed, that to this very day, Hiſtorians cannot tell the true manner of it. Thus God ſcatters all their counſels and their plots, whereby they are confounded.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>God when he doth ruine them, he doth it no other way but by their own wiſdome, by their own craft.</hi> And this is the greateſt conqueſt that can be, when God overcometh them by their own weapon, as it was ſaid of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s ſword. None like that, becauſe by that he cut off <hi>Goliah</hi>'s head, whoſe ſword it was. So there are no Providences of God ſo remarkeable and glorious as thoſe, which make the very craft and wiſdome wicked men have, to bring about their confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We ſee this fulfilled firſt in the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is called the <hi>old Dragon</hi> or <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> Rev. 12.9. becauſe of his great ſubtilty, as well as poiſonous enmity. Now wherein was he overcome? by his own craft, even in this reſpect. He uſed all the Inſtruments he had to bring Chriſt to be crucified: He enters into <hi>Judas</hi> his heart, and he had filled the hearts of the Jews and Prieſts before, and ſo at laſt obtaineth his plot; Chriſt is crucified, but then he riſeth again, and is aſcended, and thereby he <hi>conquers the Devil and all his power.</hi> So that by that very death which the Devil ſo much laboured for, the <hi>works of the Devil were deſtroyed.</hi> We ſee this alſo in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s <hi>Brethren,</hi> how politique and crafty were they in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious deſignes againſt <hi>Joſeph</hi>? and all was, That he might not reign over them: And all thoſe means they took to hinder it, were ordained by God to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>He takes the wiſe men of the world ſo, that they are entangled in their own counſels, and are brought to ſuch ſnares, that they cannot go forward or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Nullum magnum ingenium ſine aliquâ mixturâ dementiae,</hi> There is no great wit without ſome mixture of madneſſe. Thus you heard the original did
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:101245:143"/>
imply; That they were taken in their counſels, as ſo many fetters and chains; They were as a wild Bull in a net. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks admirably to this, <hi>Job.</hi> 5.14. <hi>They meet with darkneſſe in the day time, and grope at noon day as at midnight.</hi> See here, into what a wilderneſſe and perplexity they are brought. And ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.14. They are ſaid to <hi>be drunk and reel up and down.</hi> Are drunken men fit for to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, to counſel, to carry on any work of conſequence? and yet ſuch are the wiſe men of the world delivered up unto.</p>
                     <p>I might inſtance in more Particulars, but the next words will have the ſame occaſion; I come to anſwer an Objection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>How is this true, you will ſay, that God taketh the wiſe in their craft?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                        <hi>Doth not</hi> David <hi>often make mention of his bloody and deceilfull enemies? How often doth he complain of their</hi> lying in wait to ſhoot at the upright in heart? <hi>And doth not the experience of all Ages, both in prophane and ſacred Hiſtories, ſhew that earthly, crafty, and wicked policy hath accompliſhed many deſtructive things, and that to Gods own Church and people? Hath not Antichriſt, by ſubtile deceiveable waies, prevailed over the Church of God? Do not the crafty Foxes and ſubtile Wolves, many times worry and devoure the poor innocent Sheep?</hi> All this muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet the obſervation is true. For</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This is many times done, and <hi>we</hi> through <hi>our ignorance,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                        <hi>take no notice thereof. The works of the Lord are great, and ſought out of thoſe that have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therein,</hi> Pſal. 111.2. We many times take not ſuch delight in obſerving the works of God in the world; and ſo for want of conſideration, we come not to admiration. The Apoſtle, upon a ſerious conſideration of Gods power and wiſdome, in the matter of <hi>electing</hi> ſome, and <hi>leaving</hi> others, he cryeth; <hi>Oh the depths of the wiſdome of God, how unſpeakable are his waies, and paſt finding out! Rom.</hi> 11 33. Thus it is alſo in Gods governing and ordering of the whole world. <hi>His waies are above our waies.</hi> He taketh wiſe men, beſotteth crafty men, and we not being affected, or ſtudious to obſerve the motions of his Providence, take no notice of it. So that the fault may be in us. But</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>We limit God to time, and places, and perſons</hi>; and ſo becauſe he doth not at ſuch a time, in ſuch a way, as we think, therefore we are apt to think God hath forſaken the earth, and regards not what is done below. Now by judging in ſuch a narrow limited manner, we are prone to miſ-judge of God. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſaid to <hi>limit the holy One of Iſrael. Can he provide bread in the wilderneſſe?</hi> Pſal. 78.41. Thus we think, that if in ſuch and ſuch times God doth not confound the thoughts of the wiſe enemies to Gods Church, all is undone But the wiſdome of the Lord knoweth the beſt ſeaſons, the moſt fit opportunities. As he cannot do any thing but what is moſt perfect, ſo alſo what is moſt wiſe. We ſhould, both for particular and publique things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all into Gods wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>If God let worldly wiſdome prevail and proſper a while, it is that the overthrow and confuſion of it may be greater.</hi> As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was ſuffered to go into the Sea, and the waters did not immediately overflow; it was dry land to them as well as the <hi>Iſraelies</hi> for a while, but they were ſuffered to go ſo farre, that their deſtruction might be the ſurer. <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> did for a while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> but at laſt their folly was made manifeſt. God therefore to make their ſhipwrack the more remakeable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuffers them to go to the very Haven almoſt, and there to be undone. Thus they are thrown from a Pinacle, that their down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall may be the more terrible. In the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> God ſuffered them to go on a great way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they built very high, but God came down before they had finiſhed it; and this made to their greater reproach and ſcorn: As we ſee by that <hi>Parable</hi> of our Saviour, men would by way of ſcorn ſay, <hi>This builder began, and was not able to make an end,</hi> Luk. 14.30. As <hi>Joſhua</hi> did to the men
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101245:144"/>
of <hi>Ai,</hi> gave them hopes, and made as if <hi>Iſrael</hi> did flee away; and all was, that their overthrow might be the more univerſal. But not only the Scripture, even Heathens gave ſome probable Anſwers to this Objection.</p>
                     <p>Come we then to ſhew the <hi>ground, why</hi> God doth thus delight to infatuate and blaſt all earthly wiſdome. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>It is that hereby his Soveraignty and ruling Power may be the more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</hi> When we ſee that wiſdome and power, and earthly greatneſſe doth not carry it, hereby we gather that God is therefore only to be truſted in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon. That the Starres and Moon have no light of their own, at leaſt not conſpicuous, makes more to the glory of the Sunne that filleth them all. God will have theſe tall Cedars and high Oaks fall to the ground, that we may look up to Heaven the better. Theſe earthly great things, make that God is not ſo great and excellent, and dreadfull to us as he ought to be.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>God doth it hereby to vindicate his own Glory, and Cauſe, and Name.</hi> For all the worldly wiſdome that ever was, hath either mediately or immediately ſet againſt God. As there was at firſt an enmity between the feed of the Woman and the Serpent, ſo that hath deſcended to all Generations; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that all the policy, wiſdome, and craft of all men, hath been one way or other againſt God: therefore it is time for God to oppoſe ſuch. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>He reſiſteth the proud,</hi> James 4.6. Such ſinners more then others, becauſe they immediately oppoſe God, and God is, to ſpeak with reverence, to defend his Name, his Glory, his Church, his People, againſt them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> How ſecure the People and Church of God may be. Though they be weak, poor, and contemptible, yet they have the wiſdome and power of God on their ſide: and all earthly craft and power, that they are ſo apt to fear and dread, is but ſo much folly and weakneſſe to God. Our God will ariſe like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and tare theſe green cords. Oh, it's ſweeter then the Honey and Honey-comb, in the midſt of all confuſions, troubles, and perplexities, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how wiſe God is, and by Faith to comfort and inflame our hearts! It muſt not be a tranſient thought, or a barren ſpeculation; but let thy heart dwell upon Gods wiſdome; and this will be like <hi>David</hi>'s Harp to drive out every evil ſpirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It's of Direction,</hi> Not to fear any thing but God: for he is the only wiſe God. How fearfull was <hi>David</hi> to have <hi>Achitophel</hi> againſt him, becauſe he was a wiſe man? but it is more terrible to have Gods wiſdome againſt us. And who hath that? even every wicked man, whoſoever goeth on in any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent way: He provoketh this wiſe God to be againſt him. He knoweth waies to torment thee: He knoweth the times to make it more terrible: He knoweth all the ſecret and hidden ſhifts and excuſes of thy heart, therefore fear him.</p>

                     <p>THis Verſe containeth a <hi>ſecond Teſtimony,</hi> which the Apoſtle alleadgeth, to prove the fooliſhneſſe of all earthly wiſdome before God; It's taken out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.11. where the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> proving the Providence and Omniſcience of God, argueth from his <hi>Efficiency</hi> of all things, <hi>He that made the eye to ſee, ſhall not he ſee?</hi> Shall not the cauſe have more in it than the effect? God fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our hearts, and therefore he muſt needs underſtand them. As he that makes a Clock or Watch, muſt needs underſtand all the ſecret motions of them. Now ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> he doth not only know the <hi>thoughts of men,</hi> but alſo, <hi>how vain, fooliſh and unprofitable they are.</hi> So that the Apoſtle doth pertinently alledge this place, to prove how vain and fooliſh all mens thoughts are, eſpecially in matters of Religion, though never ſo wiſe otherwiſe. Only here is one thing to be taken notice of, The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks in the general, <hi>The thoughts of men,</hi> but the Apoſtle mentioneth a particular, <hi>The thoughts of the wiſe</hi>; Doth not the Apoſtle here wreſt the words to his own purpoſe? No, for if the Pſalmiſts uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal be true, the thoughts of man, <hi>quâ</hi> man, be vain, then of a wiſe man as well as a fool: Yea, to ſpeak properly, there is no real wiſe man, but the godly man, whoſe mind is enlightned by grace, Or,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth there more eſpecially intend the wiſe men of the world; and therefore the Apoſtle expreſſeth it. Now mark the aggravations, <hi>The Lord knoweth,</hi> he that is the only wiſe God, he ſees their thoughts to be vain: He ſeeth that <hi>Ahitophels,</hi> that <hi>Tullies,</hi> that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> thoughts, even when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deale wiſely, are vaine. Let men applaud them, yet God derideth them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts,</hi>

                           </item>

                              </note> which ſound and rectified nature doth guide a man in, and thus he is <hi>vain.</hi>

                           <item>3. <hi>Theologicè,</hi> as he is to look up to Heaven, to obey God, and to aim at ſupernatural happineſſe. And in this ſenſe eſpecially he is a moſt vain empty man, and to this the Apoſtle relateth.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:101245:145"/>To open the Doctrine, let us conſider, <hi>In what ſenſe the Scripture uſeth the word vain,</hi> and you ſhall ſee them fitly applicable to the wiſeſt mens thoughts, that what is ſaid of mans body may alſo be true of his ſoul, <hi>Every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity,</hi> Pſal. 39.5. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That is ſaid to be vain, which is empty and void of that worth and excellency which ought to be within.</hi> Thus a fool is called often a vain perſon, becauſe he is empty of that ſolid judgement and reaſon, which ought to be in a man. Hence fooliſh perſons are compared to empty ſtraws that are blown up and down with every wind, becauſe they have no weight in them. <hi>Nabals</hi> name and his nature agreed, he was a <hi>fool.</hi> The word comes of a root that ſignifieth <hi>to wither.</hi> As the withered branch hath loſt all its ſap and juice: ſo a fool hath. And thus the thoughts of all men naturally are empty, void, and deſtitute of true wiſdome: They knew not wherein true happineſſe doth conſiſt, or what is the way that looketh to it; they do not provide for eternity; they conſider not that upon this moment depends eternity; they look not out to the beſt and choiſeſt things in the firſt place; all that inward juyce and ſap of ſpiritual wiſdom is taken from them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That is ſaid to be vanity, which ſeemeth to have great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and content in it, but indeed it's the clean contrary.</hi> A vain thing is, that which hath a goodly appearance, but inwardly hath no profit. As thoſe <hi>apples of Sodome,</hi> ſo much ſpoken of. Thus <hi>Eve</hi> called her ſon <hi>Abel, vanity,</hi> becauſe ſhe thought that before ſhe had brought forth the man, the feed that ſhould break the Serpents head; but finding him to be without the Image of God, and devoid of all holineſſe, ſubject to mortality, ſhe called him <hi>Abel,</hi> as deceived in her expectations. And thus it is with all the thoughts of the wiſeſt in the world; they think at firſt they have poſſeſſed a man, brought forth that which will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh all their deſires; but upon experience they ſee it is an <hi>Abel,</hi> it's <hi>vanity.</hi> So that as <hi>Solomon</hi> tels us of a vanity in all earthly comforts, in riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, becauſe though they have a goodly appearance, yet there is indeed no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, no ſolidity; like the thorns which have white flowers, but thorns: Thus it is with the beſt and choiſeſt thoughts, and projects of the wiſeſt men; they have a goodly luſtre; you would think ſuch wiſe men could not but be happy; their expectations are raiſed, but the iſſue doth deceive them: Call us not <hi>Naomi,</hi> but <hi>Marah,</hi> may they ſay.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Vanity in the Scripture is often applied to a lie. Every man ſpeaks vanity to his neighbour, that is a lie,</hi> Pſal. 12.2. And thus the thoughts of the moſt wiſe are a lie, <hi>Let God be true, and every man a liar,</hi> Rom. 3.4. All thy thoughts are ſo many lies. Now a man is a liar two wayes:
<list>
                           <item>1. To <hi>himſelf.</hi> And then,</item>
                           <item>2. To <hi>others.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>To <hi>himſelf all his thoughts are a meer lie.</hi> They promiſe ſuch happineſſe, glory and felicity to themſelves; and in the mean while, they are very lies; they prove as the Land-flood, as a reed a man leaneth on. The <hi>rich man</hi> that ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt many goods laid up,</hi> his thoughts were ſo many lies. Thoſe proud thoughts of <hi>Tyre and Sidon,</hi> that ſet her heart as God, and ſaid, <hi>No evil ſhould come near them,</hi> were nothing but lies And if this were only in temporal and fading things, the deceit would not be ſo dangerous, but it's in ſpiritual things alſo. All mens thoughts naturally are concerning the goodneſſe of their heart, the purity of their wayes, the happineſſe of their condition, but in all things they lie moſt damnably. What a dangerous lie was that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>She was rich, and cloathed, and wanted nothing, when indeed ſhe was naked, miſerable, and wanted all things?</hi> Revel. 3.17. All the <hi>Phariſees</hi> thoughts, whereby they truſted in their own righteouſneſſe, and juſtified themſelves, were nothing but lies. And thus <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt reproved the <hi>Jews</hi> for their <hi>vain
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:101245:145"/>
thoughts, Thinke not to ſay within your ſelves, we have Abraham to our father,</hi> Mat. 3.9. The thoughts of men are never more dangerouſly vaine, than when they pleaſe themſelves about their good condition, as to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, that all is well with them, that God loveth them; theſe are lying <hi>vain thoughts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>The thoughts of all men naturally are lies actively, in respect of others.</hi> They are full of falſhood and diſſimulation: there is no truth or ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in men, as <hi>David</hi> complaineth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, <hi>Every one is an hypocrite, the beſt is a liar,</hi> Iſa. 9.17. That as the ſheep runneth to the briars to ſhelter her ſelf in a ſtorm, but they prove a lie, becauſe they tare her in ſtead of defending her. Thus it is with all men; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid to be <hi>curſed that puts his truſt in men,</hi> Jer. 17. For unleſſe men have godlineſſe, and ſo are made ſincere and unfeigned, there cannot be any truſt in them. Hence are thoſe Rules of wiſe men, <hi>Nemini fidas, in teipſo ſpes tuas pone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Vanity is often in Scripture uſed for that which is unprofitable, without any benefit or ſucceſſe.</hi> Hence is that phraſe, <hi>To labour in vain.</hi> And thus the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> alſo define vanity, <hi>A fruſtration of our intended end.</hi> Now in every thing that a man doth, till made wiſe in an heavenly manner, there is nothing but vanity, there is no true profit or good ſucceſſe, but in all things he labours with <hi>wind,</hi> and brings forth <hi>wind.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> expreſſeth it well, <hi>They ſow the wind, and reap the whirlwind,</hi> Hoſ. 8.7. If an husbandman in ſtead of committing ſeed to the ground, ſhould only cauſe a wind, thinking to have a crop thereby, would it not be folly? but it's not folly or loſſe only, it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, he reaps the whirlwind, that is tempeſtuous and violent things ariſe on a ſudden. Oh this is a ſad thing to conſider, when thou art dying, I have lived in vain, laboured in vain, thought in vain, ſpoke in vain; I have no true good abiding by me of all that ever I did!</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Vanity is often uſed for that which is unſtable, uncertain and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> And thus the thoughts of wiſe men are vain, ſubject to changes, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and at laſt vaniſh into nothing: So that as our bodies are vain bodies, and all the whole Creation is ſubject to vanity: Thus are all the thoughts, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and purpoſes of the wiſeſt men ſubject to uncertainty, only the creatures they groan under this vanity, but ſo doth not man. Do but obſerve your own thoughts, Are they not as vain as the very dreams of feavouriſh men? Mayeſt thou not ſay, as the Prophet to the Church, <hi>How long ſhall vain thoughts lodge in thee?</hi> Jerem. 4.14. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith of ſome, <hi>That they and their thoughts periſh together.</hi> Goe to the Graves and Tombes of the great men in the world, who have been upon the earth, like <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and are not all their purpoſes and projects laid in the duſt, as well as their bodies?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>They are vain, becauſe they worke nothing but vain and abſurd things.</hi> What do vain thoughts produce but <hi>vain words, vain geſtures, vain attire and faſhions, vain diſcourſe</hi> in communication, <hi>vain opinions,</hi> and a <hi>vain worſhip. Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,</hi> Mat. 15.19. They are the firſt ſparks that flie out of this forge, and from theſe vain thoughts cometh all the vanity that is in mens words, geſtures, apparel, yea and their Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>For in vain do they worſhip me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. And <hi>Idolatry</hi> is in a particular manner called <hi>vanity.</hi> So that you ſee, theſe <hi>vain thoughts</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he cauſe of all the outward vanity in the world: Though they be ſubtil and inſenſible, yet they produce and end in groſſe actions. As the vapours of the earth, they are very ſubtil, and hardly diſcerned, yet turn into groſſe and gloomy clouds.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>They are vain, becauſe they are wholly wicked. The imaginations
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:101245:146"/>
of the thoughts of the heart are onely evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5. And thus indeed God knoweth all the thoughts and imaginations of every man is only evil. That as from the Spider and the Serpent come forth nothing but venome and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo from every man floweth nothing but filthineſſe; and the more wiſe he is, the greater enemy to God. So that thoſe thoughts of theirs are the irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemy and adverſary unto God; they lift up themſelves on high againſt him.</p>
                     <p>

Thus Chriſt reproved the Phariſees for their <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>reaſonings in their hearts.</hi> Oh think not then, that all wickedneſſe lieth in actions, in external, groſſe ſins! No, the thoughts of the heart are the womb to breed all thy wicked actions. Do dot ſay, they are free, and none knoweth them, for God knoweth them, and will judge thee for them.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How many wayes we may be ſaid to glory in men in the general.</note> This is to glory in men, even blaſphemouſly.

What glorying in St. <hi>Francis</hi> by the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> making the way to Heaven by him, eaſier than by Chriſt? What glorying in <hi>Dominicus</hi> by the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> a man of a proud, ſuperſtitious bloudy diſpoſition? So well did his mother propheſie, when ſhe was big with him, that ſhe brought forth a Wolf, if I forget not the ſtory. What boaſting do the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> make in their <hi>Ignatius Loiola,</hi> the founder of their Society? It would be infinite to tell you of the horrible and even blaſphemous boaſting, which in Popery is made, not of Saints, but of ſome corrupt and ſinfull men deceaſed; as if God had altered his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>My glory I will not give to another,</hi> let every one take his glory from him.

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>We glory in men, when we make our own, or other good workes meritorious, and our ſufferings ſatisfactory unto God.</hi> This is alſo to glory in men, and <hi>Popery</hi> is big with this; for moſt of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r Doctrines are the exalting of man, and debaſing of Chriſt, clean contrary to the Scripture, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, whoſe endeavours were to annihilate man, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ie Chriſt. And this is not in Popery only, but in every man, till humbled throughly by the Spirit of God, he glorieth in his own works, he boaſts of his almes, prayers, faſtings, as we ſee the Phariſees did. But the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. argueth, <hi>That not Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham himſelf had wherewith to boaſt before God.</hi> Oh then, not only prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and groſſe wickedneſſe is to be abhorred, but this ſecret boaſting and glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the good works they do, and having confidence in them! This Phariſee is a greater enemy to Chriſt, and further off from the Kingdome of Heaven, than many Publicans.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>We glory in men, when we rejoyce in their favour, and are more glad of that, then we are of Gods favour.</hi> This is a frequent wickedneſſe in the world; if we can have the favour and good will of thoſe, who are great in this world, then we inſult, then we thinke our ſelves made, not conſidering how happy and bleſſed it is for to have Gods favour. We ſee <hi>David,</hi> when through ſinne, he made God diſpleaſed with him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. matters not his Kingdome, his Victories, and all his earthly Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but onely applieth himſelf to the favour of God, and deſireth that, more than any earthly greatneſſe. And at another time, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? but Lord lift thou up the light of thy

countenance upon us.</hi> Many ſeemed to deſire the Devils offer, If the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world were profered to them, they would fall downe and worſhip the Devil to obtain them, but <hi>Davids</hi> choice was for the better part.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>We glory in men, when we deſire to pleaſe them, and to acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate our ſelves to their humours, more than to pleaſe God, and to walke according to his will.</hi> This ſinfull pleaſing of men, is not conſiſtent with a ſervant of Chriſts: <hi>If I ſhould pleaſe men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Galat. 1.10.) <hi>I were not the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi> Hence we are exhorted, <hi>Not to be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.13. Take heed then to thy ſelf; thou glorieſt in men, when all thy ſtudy is, how to pleaſe and comply with men, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their frowns more than Gods diſpleaſure. This ungodly fear Chriſt forbad, with an excellent reaſon, <hi>Becauſe God was able to deſtroy both ſoule and body in hell,</hi> Luke 12.5.

                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>We then glory in men, when we put our truſt and confidence in them, reſting and hoping in them, and not depending on God o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ely.</hi> As the ground of divine Faith muſt be ſome divine Teſtimony and Authority: So the motive of a divine hope muſt be onely the promiſe and power of God. We may hope onely in him, in whom we may onely believe. Hence we ſee the Scripture very frequent in forbidding all our truſt and confidence in men, yea not in <hi>Princes,</hi> and the great ones of the world, <hi>Becauſe they are lighter than vanity,</hi> Pſalm 62.9. Yea, <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 17.5. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth a ſolemne curſe upon all thoſe, <hi>Who truſt in men,</hi> comparing them to the barren heath: As on the contrary, <hi>The man, who truſteth in God, ſhall be like unto a Tree planted by the waters ſide.</hi> We ſee the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when truly repenting, then caſting off all her carnal confidence, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon our horſes, Hoſea</hi> 14.3. It is a ſinne, that all are very prone unto, to truſt in earthly power and greatneſſe, and not to eye God above all.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>We glory in men, when we boaſt in any thing that is humane or earthly, any thing that belongs to man.</hi> Thus to boaſt of Beauty, Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, Riches, Nobility, Parts and Learning; all this is a vaine and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full boaſting. <hi>Charge the rich men of this world, that they be not high-minded, but feare,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.15. Yet how hardly have we any of theſe humane excellencies or comforts, and not boaſt of them? But the Prophet giveth good counſel, <hi>Let not the rich man boaſt in his riches, nor the great man in his greatneſſe; but he that glorieth, let him glory in this, that he knoweth God,</hi> Jeremy 9 23, 24. <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and the glory thereof fadeth away.</hi> Yea, <hi>The rich man is to rejoyce that he is made low,</hi> James 1.10 Theſe things are like too much bloud, apt to put us into a feaver, and therefore we are to rejoyce, when God (as a wiſe Phyſician) taketh ſome away.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, <hi>We are not to glory in the Doctors and Teachers we have,</hi> which we do,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How many wayes we may be ſaid to glory in Doctors and Teachers.</note>Firſt, <hi>When we are affected more with their parts, and gifts, and learning, then with the powerfull demonſtration of Gods Spirit in them, and by them.</hi> When we do not deſire to hear them ſpeak, as the Oracles of God, but as boaſters of their own learning. Thus <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was unto his hearers, as a <hi>love Song,</hi> but they would doe nothing, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.32. We deny not, but that humane Learning, and the Arts, are neceſſary in a Miniſter of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:101245:147"/>
God, ſeeing all extraordinary gifts now fail, yet that which the hearer ſhould moſt of all be moved with, is the powerfull conviction and application of the Scripture, either for ſinne or duty to the heart. This made <hi>Paul</hi> purpoſely avoid humane eloquence, that ſo their faith might not be in the wiſdome of men, but power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Then we glory in men, when we reſt on the Miniſtry, and their labours, thinking it enough to enjoy them, but never look up to God for ſucceſſe, and a bleſſing. What is Paul, or Apollo? but Miniſters by whom ye believe?</hi> at the fifth verſe. Therefore the principal work is from God; They <hi>plant</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> but God giveth the <hi>increaſe.</hi> Doe not thou glory in the beſt Miniſtery, and the moſt able Gifts in the world, ſo as not to depend on God, and pray to him. For the beſt Miniſtery in the world, worketh no otherwiſe, than God bleſſeth it; and ſhouldſt thou every day hear Angels from Heaven preach unto thee, yet if thy heart be not opened, and God give thee not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, they are but like muſick to a deaf man. It's not this Sermon, or the other, though never ſo powerfull that can raiſe thee from the dead, till Chriſt give thee life.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then we glory in men, when we have the perſons of ſome Teachers in ſuch admiration, that whatſoever they ſay or maintain, without any ſearch, or diſpute we believe.</hi> The Diſciples of <hi>Berea</hi> are commended for their noble di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, <hi>That they would ſearch the Scriptures, whether the things were ſo, or no,</hi> Act. 17.11. Whereas to be addicted unto a man ſo, as <hi>ex perſonâ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare fidem,</hi> and not <hi>ex fide perſonam</hi> is blind obedience, and to offer a ſacrifice without eyes. <hi>Prove all things,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.21. And, <hi>Try the Spirits,</hi> 1 John 4, 1. are rules given to all Chriſtians. The Apoſtle reproveth ſome erroneous perſons, for having their <hi>Teachers perſons in admiration,</hi> Jude verſ. 16. This ſlavery hath been alwayes. Among the Jews there were the Diſciples of <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Sammai.</hi> The Heathens have their <hi>Pythagoreans, Epicureans, Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> to whom their Diſciples were wholly captivated. And it's a very difficult thing to ſet judgement on work, ſo as to be <hi>able to diſcern of things that differ.</hi> Though there are many that abuſe this priviledge allowed them by Chriſt under the pretence of trying. They therefore grow <hi>Scepticks,</hi> and becauſe the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are not infallible, they believe themſelves to be infallible.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Then we glory in men, when we preferre one before the other, ſo as to make differences and ſchiſms in the Church.</hi> And this was that eſpecially which <hi>Paul</hi> aimeth at in this place; ſome were for one Teacher, and ſome for another; and by this means there were ſeveral factions, and rents made in the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Admonition,</hi> To take heed of all humane boaſting any kind of theſe wayes, <hi>He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi> Yea, ſaith <hi>Paul, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid I ſhould glory in any thing, ſave in the croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.14. Oh how vain a thing and wicked is it to boaſt in riches, beauty, outward greatneſſe, and any of theſe fading things? <hi>David</hi> takes a better way, <hi>My ſoul maketh her boaſt of God alwayes,</hi> Pſal. 34.2. Thou art high minded, and beareſt up thy ſelf from ſuch and ſuch earthly objects; Is not all this to glory in men? Did men create thee? Can men ſave thee? Can men pardon thy ſinne?

                     <p>In this Verſe (you heard) was the <hi>Duty inferred</hi> from the doctrinal matter preſcribed. The Apoſtle ſqueezeth the honey from the honey-comb.

                     <p>Take the words as an Argument, and they are very ſtrong:
<list type="syllogism">
                           <item>None are to glory in theſe things, that are inferiour to them, that are ſervants to them, or below them:</item>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus as they are an Argument. But we ſhall conſider them as an abſolute <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</hi> Wherein take notice of,
<list>
                           <item>1. The <hi>Subject.</hi> And</item>

                     <p>The <hi>Subject</hi> is <hi>yours,</hi> that is, the Church, the godly, for thoſe he meaneth. The place is like that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 28. <hi>All things work to the good of thoſe that love God, and are called after his purpoſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Attribute,</hi> in the Univerſality, <hi>All things are yours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> did horribly abuſe this place: for hence they proved,
<q>That no Magiſtrate, if a wicked man, was a true Magiſtrate, and to be obeyed; no rich man, no noble man, if he were not godly, had not any right to their goods and eſtates.</q>
And they taking themſelves to be the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones, and to judge who were wicked, killed many, diſpoſſeſſed of their goods and dominions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> charge <hi>Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Wickliff</hi> with this opinion. But we have juſt cauſe to think, that they were but meer ſlanders and calumnies caſt upon them. There is a two-fold Dominion:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Civil,</hi> which comes by the Laws of a Land, where a man liveth; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jure humano, haec villa eſt mea.</hi> And thus every man that doth not by theft or injuſtice obtain his eſtate, is a lawfull and juſt poſſeſſor. And that which he hath thus by a Civil Right, he hath alſo by conſequence with a Divine Right, becauſe God by that Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> doth approve all that Political and Civil diſtribution of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> which is by the Laws of a Land. But</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Sanctified Right,</hi> whereby a man doth acknowledge God thankfully in all that he hath, and improveth all things graciouſly to the honour of God, and his own ſalvation. And thus only a godly man hath a ſanctified right, or rather uſe to all things. To ſhew how a wicked man comes to have a lawfull civil right; when <hi>Adam</hi> by ſinne forfeited all; and wicked men not being in Chriſt, have not their title again to the world reſtored to them, is a noble point: But being not to my purpoſe, I muſt paſſe it by. And to ſpeak the truth, though ſome learned men bring in this Text, when they handle the point of <hi>Dominion,</hi> whether it be founded upon <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Grace,</hi> yet indeed it's nothing to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth the Apoſtle aim at any ſuch thing. For all things may be ſaid to be the godly mans two wayes: Either</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>In reſpect of Dominion, Title and Poſſeſſion.</hi> And now to this ſenſe the Apoſtle aimeth not, neither would it be to his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A thing may be ſaid to be theirs, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>In regard of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and End for which they are.</hi> And thus all things are the godly mans; all things in kind, not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:101245:148"/>
in the individuals; all things worke to the good of a godly man; which the Apoſtle doth admirably enumerate; all <hi>Perſons,</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi> in the Church; all <hi>creatures</hi> in the world; all <hi>Conditions,</hi> and all <hi>Events.</hi> But we ſhall take the ſweetneſſe of every particular, after we have handled the general. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That all things are for the ſpiritual good and advantage of the godly man.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Obſerv.</hi> All things are the Saints.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is nothing in the whole world, nothing in the Church of God, nothing that falleth out, but one way or other the godly man may ſay, This is mine, this belongs to me; this is for my good.</p>
                     <p>Now let us conſider:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In how many reſpect, all things may be ſaid to be the godly mans,<note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects all things may be ſaid to be the godly mans.</note> both in the Church, and the world. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt thus, <hi>In that there is nothing, which would be for their good, that God denieth them.</hi> Whatſoever is in all the world, if it be good for the godly man, he ſhall have it. <hi>No good thing will he with-hold from them that fear him, Pſal.</hi> 84.11. Now the godly mans <hi>good</hi> is two-fold; either that which is <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi> and <hi>Neceſſarily good,</hi> ſo that it cannot be evil, nor it cannot do a godly man any hurt to have them, ſuch as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, <hi>Pardon of ſinne</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi>; and theſe are beſtowed on all godly men. There is no man that feareth God, though he may ſay, I want riches, I want health, I am without this or that; that can ſay, he is without Chriſt, and juſtification, and the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>limited Good,</hi> that which in its ſelf is good, but doth not make good thoſe that have it, yea it may be turned to evil. As wine is good, but give it to the feavouriſh man, you hurt him. And thus it is with all the temporal good things of the world; they do not make the poſſeſſours good, yea they may be turned to ſinne, and increaſe thy corruption. And then, it's no wonder if God out of his love to thee, with hold theſe things from thee. If they were as neceſſary and as good, as Chriſt is, and Heaven is, thou wert ſure to have them, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.32. <hi>If he hath given us Chriſt, How ſhall he with him, but give us all things elſe?</hi> Now this very particular ſhould rebuke all the winds and waves of fears and diſcontent within thee. Art thou repining and carnally muttering, thou haſt not this, thou haſt not that? Oh look! Haſt thou godlineſſe? Haſt thou the fear of God in thy heart, than thou haſt all things, becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good for thee that God keeps from thee? Do not thou blame God, but thy own corruptions; if thou wanteſt ſuch temporal mercies; ſay rather, God ſeeth I ſhould make them a poiſon to my ſoul, I ſhould grow drunk with this ſweet wine.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>A godly man may be ſaid to have all things, Becauſe he hath a right and a claim to the Covenant of Grace, wherein is a deed of Gift of all things both ſpiritual and temporal.</hi> The Covenant of Grace lieth in this, <hi>That God will be our God, giving remiſſion of ſinne, healing of our corruption, and bleſſing us with all temporal bleſſings.</hi> This God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo with all believers, Therefore <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to have the promiſe of this life, and the life to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. All heavenly and earthly things are by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to the godly, only heavenly things abſolutely, earthly things conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and with ſubordination and exception. So then, it is with thee, as ſome man, who hath all his eſtate lying in Bonds and Covenants, though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he cannot command ſuch a ſumme of money, yet he is <hi>rich in Bonds.</hi> Thus the godly man hath ſure Bonds and Promiſes, even of Gods own making, who cannot lie or deceive; and therefore he may be as much ſupported, as if he had the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101245:149"/>
things themſelves. Hence ariſeth that life of faith <hi>Habakkuk</hi> and godly men have in their great extremities and neceſſities.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>All things are the godly mans, Becauſe he hath God for his God, who hath all things. Qui habet habentem omnia, habet omnia</hi>; He that hath the Sunne hath the light of all the ſtarres: He that hath the Ocean, hath all the ſtreams: <hi>Deus meus &amp; omnia,</hi> as he ſaid. Hence our happineſſe is ſaid to be in this, if we have the Lord for our God. <hi>David</hi> in all his exigencies, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with this, That God was his <hi>portion</hi> and his <hi>inheritance.</hi> Now he is ſuch a portion, that there is nothing elſe good beſide; have him, and ye have all. Though a child hath not money and raiment at his command, yet becauſe he hath a rich father, who can procure all theſe things, therefore he may be well ſaid to have them all. Thou ſhalt not want, as long as God hath it: If God have it, thou ſhalt have it; and what can be more deſired?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>A godly man may be ſaid to have all things, Becauſe godlineſſe worketh ſuch an holy contentation and ſatisfaction of ſpirit, that in what eſtate he is, he is as well pleaſed as if he had all things, as if he had the whole world.</hi> Therefore it's called <hi>Godlineſſe with content,</hi> 1 Tim. 6 6 <hi>viz.</hi> which worketh and cauſeth contentment, it is the proper effect and fruit of it. Thus <hi>Paul, I have learned to be content in all conditions: I have all things, I want nothing,</hi> Phil. 4 11, 12 That which pride and preſumption putteth ſome upon to ſay, they wanted nothing, for which God ſeverely reproveth them; here true grace puts the godly upon: Here is a godly <hi>Dives,</hi> that may ſay, Soul, take thy ſpiritual eaſe, for thou haſt not many, but all good things laid up for thee. Thus all things are theirs, becauſe through contentation they have all things.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>All things are the godly mans, Becauſe they were made</hi> finaliter <hi>for him.</hi> They are all for his ſpiritual uſe. If you regard the <hi>Offices and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in the Church,</hi> they are all for the Church, either to begin, increaſe or conſummate grace, If you look upon <hi>the whole Creation,</hi> there is no creature therein, but the godly thereby do, or ought to glorifie God, and to draw near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereby unto him. If every thing thou lookeſt upon, thou heareſt, thou treadeſt upon, doth not make thee more godly; thou loſeſt the good uſe for which they were made: Every gift is given <hi>to profit withall,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.7. And every creature was alſo made to profit withall. At the firſt we ſee the whole world, with all things therein, were made for man, which made the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpend an whole <hi>Pſalm,</hi> in the admiration of Gods goodneſſe and bounty, <hi>What is man, that thou art thus mindfull of him?</hi> Pſal. 8.4. yet that was chiefly, becauſe the ſtarres in Heaven, and the creatures on earth were made for him. But with what praiſes may the mouths and hearts of Gods people be filled with, in that not only the things of the world; but that all the Offices and Ordinances of the Church are made for them. But this excellent point will be more improved in the particular enumeration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why God made all things for the godly.</note>Let us now conſider, <hi>Why God ſhould make all heavenly and earthly things for the godly.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, We need not wonder at it, if we conſider, <hi>That Chriſt himſelf took our nature upon him, and did undergo that ſhamefull death, and thoſe terrible conflicts with Gods wrath for his Church, he gave himſelf for his Church.</hi> So that Chriſt being theirs, no wonder if all things elſe be theirs. If ever God would have denied any thing, would have with-held any thing, it would have been his only Son, in whom he was ſo well-pleaſed: But this he parts with for his Church: Yet we cannot ſay, Chriſt is <hi>ours,</hi> as <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> and other things; therefore he addeth, <hi>We are Ghriſts,</hi> and not Chriſt ours, becauſe though Chriſt was given for us, yet it was as a Mediatour to work our peace, that ſo thereby he might be exalted, and might have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101245:149"/>
in all things. So <hi>that the Church is for Chriſt, not Chriſt for the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe all things in the world are ordered by his providence onely; but the whole worke of God about his children, is the effect of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination.</hi> Now Predeſtination is an act of his more immediate love, than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is; and the Providence of God is ſubſervient to his Predeſtination. Therefore is Gods care and government over all things, that he may attain the ends of his Predeſtination. Inſomuch that there had been no Creation at firſt, no world at all, nor would there ſtill be any ſuſtentation, or conſervation of it, were it not for the Churches ſake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>Of Exhortation to the godly, to live by faith on ſuch principles.</hi> What generous noble and heavenly diſpoſitions would theſe thoughts breed. <hi>Scito te Deum eſſe,</hi> ſaid one, thinking the ſoul to be a beam of that Divine Eſſence; but thou mayeſt truly ſay, God hath made thee heir of all things. It's not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but God that doth now ſhew thee the glory of the world, and the Church, and ſaith, All theſe things are thine. Conſider then, whether they be thine, by that ſpiritual end they are intended for. Do all creatures, all conditions, all events make thee more godly? Do they work ſuch divine effects upon thy ſoul? Oh do not thou be thy own adverſary herein!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. <hi>Of Terrour to wicked men</hi>; for it followeth by way of contraries, Nothing is yours, <hi>viz.</hi> for your ſpiritual good: The Miniſtry God gives, is not for you: The mercies you have, they are not for your ſouls health. Oh the depth of thy unſpeakable miſery! whether life, or death, all things help thee forward to hell.</p>
                     <p>Having aſſerted a comfortable and rich Doctrine out of theſe words for the godly: we proceed to make ſome <hi>Objections</hi> or doubts about it, which will be as file to the iron; or like the Wine-preſſe to the Grapes, to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſſe out the ſweet Wine therein. And indeed, this truth ſeemeth Obnoxious to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Exceptions; as in Religion there are many Doctrinal points which do amaze humane reaſon, ſuch as that of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body,</hi> ſo there are alſo many Practical Poſitions which ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all reaſon and experince; of which this in my Text is one, <hi>All things are the godly mans.</hi> It ſeemeth to be an <hi>Idea,</hi> or meer fiction and expreſſion, if we conſult with what befals the godly.</p>
                     <p>Come we therefore to <hi>Anſwer</hi> ſome of the <hi>Objections.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The doubt may be,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                        <hi>How are all things the godly mans for his uſe and ſpiritual edification, when many times we ſee the godly man gets no go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d by theſe? The</hi> Corinthians, <hi>who had</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Apollo, <hi>and all thoſe eminent Teachers for their uſe, yet by their Diviſions, and carnal Emulations, they made no spiritual improvement of them. How many Sermons and Sabboths do even the godly let go, that there never appeareth any footſtep of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if they had never been? And then as for their mercies and their afflictions, how many times do theſe draw out their corruptions; and they ſeem to be the worſe for them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To Anſwer this,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh between Gods intention in giving theſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                        <hi>and the godly mans actual improvement of them to that end.</hi> When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All things are yours,</hi> his meaning is, <hi>on Gods part</hi>: His love is ſo great, that for the godly only, all things in Heaven and Earth were created. If ſo be therefore, at any time theſe things turn to thy hurt, blame thy ſelf. The Phyſician will tell the Patient ſometimes, All theſe Potions, and all theſe Cordials, they are yours; you are to take them; you may expect much good and eaſe by them: But if the Patient be wilfull, and diſorder himſelf, it is his fault, not the Phyſicians, that they do hurt. So that the meaning is, all things in their creation and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution were for the godly mans good. Therefore</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:101245:150"/>Secondly, <hi>The godly man, through his weakneſſe and ſinfulneſſe, not walking up to Gods order, may make that an hinderance which God intended a further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> A godly man may receive the Word and Ordinances ſometimes in vain. Sometimes afflictions may, for the preſent, make him more froward and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and mercies more preſumptions and confident; as the Examples of <hi>David</hi> and others ſhew. So that our folly and corruptions, mingle bitter things with Gods ſweet, and then we complain this Text is not true. <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of a man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord,</hi> Prov. 19.3. When we do not our duty, we think God doth not fulfill his Promiſe: Our waies are unequall, and then we think Gods are not equall. So that you muſt underſtand this Promiſe, <hi>All things are yours,</hi> in a well ordered uſe of the means, as all other Promiſes are. It's ſaid, <hi>The Spirit will lead you in all truth,</hi> Joh. 16.13. Gods Word is promiſed to <hi>be accompanied with the fulneſſe of the Lords bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to thoſe that are his</hi>; But how? If we order and prepare our ſelves: If we do not put in ſome barre and obſtructions. For ſinne, that withholdeth good things from us, that ſeparates between God and us, as alſo between theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Though the godly may for a <hi>while</hi> make theſe things <hi>againſt their end,</hi> and not <hi>for it,</hi> yet this will <hi>not be alwaies.</hi> Nay, God will ſo order it, that this decay of theirs, or this diſorder, ſhall likewiſe be turned to their good. As thoſe, who through miſtake, may ſwallow down ſome ſtrong Phyſick, though for the preſent, they may be deadly ſick; and worſe then ever they were, yet afterwards, it may be, they are the better for ſuch violent helps.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>When we ſay all things are the godly mans, you muſt take them in their Collective cooperation</hi>; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>All things work together.</hi> This particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or that particular, may throw thee down, may make thee worſe; but then God bringeth about ſome other things that help altogether for thy good. As they ſay of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> All the venemous Herbs grow there, and alſo all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes are to be had there. Where there is a Malady, there is alſo a Remedy. And truly, thus Gods diſpenſations are with his Children. This or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular may hinder thee, this or that may prejudice thee, but God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other things to correct theſe. There is a benigne influence with the malignant, (as it were,) and both tempered together, advance ſpeedily towards Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Object.</note>The ſecond doubt is this: <hi>If all things are for the godly, and only theirs exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to the wicked, then this may ſeem to juſtifie all the wickedneſſe and impiety of ungodly men? Why ſhould they be blamed, if they get no good by the Ordinances, if they profit not under the Miniſtry, for God did not intend them for their good? and ſo if they abuſe the creatures to all manner of wickedneſſe, they can do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: They had them for this end, to accompliſh ſinne thereby. If every thing works to their damnation, this may make them ſin the more deſparately?</hi> But</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>Firſt, <hi>Divines have a good diſtinction about Gods Will.</hi> There is a <hi>will of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency or Approbation</hi>; and there is his <hi>will of Efficiency,</hi> what he will bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and none ſhall hinder.</p>
                     <p>Now it's the <hi>will</hi> of Gods <hi>approbation,</hi> that all things ſhould be improved by the wicked for their good. It's his approving and commanding will, that every Sermon ſhould be received by Faith; that every mercy be improved fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The goodneſſe of God doth invite ſuch to Repentance. The afflictions and ſcourges God brings on them, are to humble them, and make them to repent of their ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>But if we regard the <hi>will of Efficiency,</hi> ſo theſe things are the ſavour of death to them that periſh. The Apoſtle ſaith this plainly, <hi>The Word was the ſavour of life to ſuch as are ſaved, and the ſavour of death to ſuch as periſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.15.</p>

For this end, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> are ſent to exhort him to this duty. Yet if we reſpect Gods <hi>will of Efficiency,</hi> we ſee he told <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>heart was hardened, and he would not let them go</hi>; and <hi>his heart grew harder by theſe wonders.</hi> So then, Gods will of Approbation and Command, is, That even the wicked, ſhould make all things theirs, though Gods will of Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency doth not bring it about.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true, it ſhould be ſo, but we are weak in faith,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> we do not live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scripture-principles and priviledges, but ſenſible; and then we ſtagger and reel up and down. While we are cloathed with the Sunne, and have the Moon under our feet, we walk in light and comfort. <hi>David,</hi> when his faith is lively, then <hi>God is his ſhepherd, he ſhall want nothing; and he will lay him down and ſleep, becauſe God taketh care for him.</hi> But let him come from this Mountain of faith, and look on the waters of afflictions below, his head goeth round, and he knoweth not where he is. Now a two-fold faith is neceſſary to bear up the head and heart, the one, <hi>Firmly aſſenting to the truth of the things:</hi> The other, <hi>Fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially applying them to our ſelves.</hi> If we have not the firſt faith, we look upon ſuch things as meer good words, as bare expreſſions: Even as if a man ſhould think he had ſuch a Country, becauſe he had the Map of it. Oh this divine hiſtorical faith, ſtrongly perſwading our ſelves theſe things are Gods truth; they cannot be a lie, they cannot deceive us, would greatly eſtabliſh us. And then, Fiducial application is the hand that takes theſe things, making them to be ours.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Churches edification is the end of their Inſtitution. When God made the world, he made it for himſelf. The world is for God, not God for the world. But when Chriſt aſcended on high, and ſet Officers in the Church, he made them for believers, not believers for them. Thus before <hi>verſ</hi> 5. <hi>What is Paul and Apollo? but Miniſters by whom ye believe.</hi> And ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>We preach not our ſelves, but Jeſus Chriſt, and our ſelves your ſervants for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſake.</hi> So that all the offices, all the miniſterial power and abilities that are, be wholly for the Churches ſpiritual advantage. Even as the nurſe of ſome great Emperours child, all the dainty fare, and good proviſion ſhe hath, is onely to cauſe milk, that may be good nouriſhment for the child. Hence are they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>light</hi> and <hi>ſalt,</hi> which have their property for other things, and not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Now let us conſider,<note place="margin">In what ſenſe the Miniſters are not ſervants to the Church, againſt <hi>Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists.</hi>
                        </note>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>And firſt, When we ſay, Officers, and all their abilities, are for the Church, <hi>The meaning is not, as if they had their power and office from the Church, or from believers, ſo as that they ſhould preach, and baptize, and diſpenſe all Ordinances in the Churches name</hi>; as the <hi>Browniſts</hi> do earneſtly contend, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all power and dominion to be in the number of the Church. This is not ſo; for the Officers and their power is of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 2.28. <hi>God hath ſet in his Church.</hi> Epheſ. 4.11. <hi>Chriſt gave ſome Paſtors, ſome Teachers.</hi> Acts 20.28. <hi>Over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers.</hi> Hence they are called, <hi>The Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>the ſtewards of God.</hi> By all which places it's clear, That the Officers of the Church have their power and authority <hi>from God and Chriſt,</hi> that they do all not in the Churches name, but Chriſts name. <hi>They are not the Churches ſtewards, nor the Churches Embaſſadors, but Chriſts.</hi> Indeed by the Churches election or deſignation, ſuch a man is received to be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor or Shepherd, but the Church <hi>doth not</hi> give him his Office; but <hi>Chriſt or ſuch Officers, that Chriſt hath appointed to do it.</hi> So that they are both the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſervants, and Chriſts ſervants. The Churches ſervants, becauſe the end of their office is to benefit the Church. Chriſts ſervants, becauſe they come in his Name, and have their Commiſſion and Authority from him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>In that they are wholly the Churches, the Apoſtle doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found or make void that order appointed in the Church between Officers, and thoſe they have a care over.</hi> He doth not nullifie the relation they are in of <hi>Shepherds, Guides, Overſeers,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>rule</hi> over them, and <hi>watch</hi> for their ſouls good. <hi>Nor doth he take away that command of honour, reverence, love and reſpect; yea that ſubmiſſion and obedience unto them, as other places do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi> There are thoſe that would bring an Anarchy and confuſion in the Church, making no difference between <hi>Shepherd</hi> and <hi>Sheep, Guides</hi> and <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,</hi> and thoſe who are to ſubmit to them: but the Scripture is very clear for this diſtinction, and <hi>God is not the God of confuſion, but of order: Is the whole body an eye, or the whole body an head</hi>? ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.17. This would make the body of Chriſt a deformed monſter,<note place="margin">In what ſenſe they are the Churches</note> and worſe than any humane ſociety.</p>
                     <p>But when he ſaith, <hi>All theſe Officers are yours,</hi> it implieth theſe things:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="272" facs="tcp:101245:152"/>Firſt, <hi>That the aim of all thoſe who enter in any Church office, and all the while they are in, ſhould not be principally their own advantage, or earthly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodations, but the edification of the Church, the glory of Chriſt, and the good of peoples ſouls.</hi> This is very difficult, when he ſaith, <hi>Paul and Apollo are yours</hi>; he thereby teacheth all us Miniſters, what ſhould be the chiefeſt aim of our ſouls, to <hi>feed,</hi> not to <hi>ſhear</hi> the ſheep. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> is inſtructed, <hi>Loveſt thou me? Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thou me? then feed my ſheep, feed my lambes,</hi> John 21.16. Not but that Chriſt taketh care for their maintenance, and they are lawfully to look to that, but it ought not to be the principal, <hi>He that deſireth</hi> (1 Tim. 3.1.) <hi>the office of a Biſhoprick, deſireth a good work.</hi> It's a work and labour for the good of others. So that this teacheth us, what ſincere and publique intentions ought to be in us? What tender and compaſſionate bowels we ought to have to the flock committed to our charge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It implieth, <hi>That all our preaching, and the whole labour of our Miniſtry muſt not be for oſtentation, or ſelf-advancement, but in the moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and advantagious way we can, to better mens ſouls.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.7. <hi>Every one hath his gift to profit with all.</hi> The Apoſtle rejects all ſuch Queſtions as do not profit, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. So that all our care ſhould be in our preaching, in our ſtudy, ſo to handle the Word, that we may <hi>moſt benefit our people</hi>; that our words may fall like the rain or dew upon the tender herb, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. that the meaneſt may be edified. The Apoſtles arguments againſt ſpeaking in unknown tongues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. do fully reach to this, <hi>Miniſters may affect ſuch obſcure, unprofitable, and impertinent matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that the people may no more be bettered, then if all things were done in Latine.</hi> The Apoſtle had rather <hi>ſpeak five words to edification, then five hundred other wayes.</hi> Inſomuch that a powerfull, profitable way of preaching is a great gift of God, a ſpecial bleſſing unto a people: And though ſome Miniſters partake of it, more than others, yet all are to bend themſelves for the peoples profit. <hi>Si non vis intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi, cur vis legi,</hi> ſaid he, we may adde, <hi>cur vis audiri</hi>; we ſee the nurſes care is to make the childs meat moſt conveniently eatable, and fit for nouriſhment; and Miniſters that do otherwiſe, are ſuch unkind fathers, that our Saviour ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, as not poſſible, when the <hi>children aske bread, they give them a ſtone</hi>; when they <hi>aske fiſh, they give them a ſerpent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In that all things are the Churches, is implied, <hi>That no Officers have an abſolute dominion over their peoples faith, neither may lord it over them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their luſts and ambitions, but to doe all things for their ſouls good. Paul,</hi> though an Apoſtle, would not aſſume ſuch dominion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Not that we have dominion over your faith.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. forbids all <hi>lordſhip over Gods inheritance.</hi> They are Gods inheritance, they are his field that they are to dreſſe and till, not for themſelves, but their Maſters uſe. The Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> with his Abettors, do infinitely tranſgreſſe in this particular, who, though he ſtyle himſelf <hi>Servus ſervorum,</hi> the ſervant of ſervants, is yet the Lord of Lords; whatſoever they give us to eat, we muſt ſwallow without chuſing. All our Sacrifices muſt be <hi>without eyes</hi>; the more ignorance in our faith, the more devotion. No, all the power and authority of Church-officers, is <hi>not Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial, but Miniſterial</hi>; we muſt come with, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, As it is written; That which we have received, that we are to deliver</hi>; and when they keep to this, then, <hi>He that heareth them, heareth Chriſt</hi>; and, <hi>He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth Chriſt.</hi> No man may adde to, or detract from the laſt will of a man, much leſſe Gods Teſtament, which is to be the rule to the Church, while ſhe is in this world.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In that all Officers are the Churches, there is implied, <hi>That not onely</hi> finis operantis, <hi>but</hi> operis <hi>alſo, not onely the end of all Miniſters, but the end of the offices and gifts themſelves, are for the Churches good.</hi> God
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:101245:152"/>
when he ſet Paſtours and Teachers, he gave them for the <hi>perfecting of the Saints,</hi> and compleating their graces, and bringing them to a <hi>full ſtature in Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.11, 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>Now it's good to conſider, the manifold ends,<note place="margin">The end for which they are the Churches.</note> why God hath given ſuch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and gifts to his Church. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>It's to multiply and gather in more to the Church, even the whole number of the elect.</hi> Thus they are called <hi>fiſhers of men,</hi> Mat. 4.19. they caſt in the ſpiritual net of the Goſpel, and out of the bitter waters of the world, they take up many for Gods Kingdom. Many thouſands were taken at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Goſpel. Thus they are alſo called <hi>Fathers,</hi> becauſe by the Word they <hi>beget</hi> many to eternal life. So then, the Officers of the Church are yours, to bring you home to God, of Wolfs to make you Lambs, of Beaſts to make you Saints. Oh conſider, whether the Miniſtry hath ever been yours in this ſenſe, or no! Hath it removed thoſe mountains, thoſe high Towers of ſinne that exalt themſelves againſt Chriſt? Hath it reformed thee of thy luſts, of thy beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: Oh may you not ſay in a contrary ſenſe to <hi>Paul,</hi> You have ten thouſand Inſtructers, yet no Fathers; you have had many preachers, but no father; none hath begot thee anew to a ſpiritual and heavenly life.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It's to convince and reprove, to trouble and diſquiet the ſoul for ſinne, and thus they are yours,</hi> though wretched man had rather be without them. <hi>Paul</hi> was very ſharp and ſevere againſt the errours and vices of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. All Miniſters are commanded, <hi>To reprove and rebuke with all authority, Tit.</hi> 2.15. <hi>To lift up their voices like a trumpet, and to tell Iſrael of their tranſgreſſions.</hi> This is for your advantage more than all falſe and daubing delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. You ſee God himſelf would not ſpare <hi>Aaron</hi> or <hi>Moſes,</hi> though never any talked to God face to face, as he did, yet God reproved him for his raſhneſſe, <hi>Becauſe he did not ſanctifie him before the people,</hi> and therefore would not let him enter into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Oh it's a good ſign, when you can receive a ſharp reproof, and rebuking Sermons as yours, as profitable to you, deſiring not to be ſpared!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are yours for quickning and increaſing of grace. To bring us to a full ſtature,</hi> as you heard the Apoſtle calleth it. <hi>Deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. There is watering as well as plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Paul</hi> reproveth theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> as carnal, that he could not ſpeak to them as ſpiritual. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. he ſpeaketh terribly to thoſe that are ſtill in their firſt principles, and are not carried on to further perfection. Conſider then, here is the Miniſtry, and all the gifts and Sermons you have enjoyed for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and profit: Is your underſtanding more enlightned, your hearts more tender, your lives more reformed? Is your knowledge bettered, your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more quickened, and your whole converſation more fervent and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>They are for conſolation and comfort unto the tender and broken hearted for ſinnes.</hi> Hence they are the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel,</hi> and they <hi>bring the glad tidings of peace.</hi> We are ſent to comfort and give reſt to thoſe that are loaden with ſinne. Oh that we could meet with a people that need this balm of the Goſpel, that want this oil of Gods grace in their wounds!

of the Goſpel runne through <hi>good report, or bad report, life or death,</hi> it's for the Churches good. And therefore <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> underſtands that life and death after mentioned of the Miniſters: ſo that you are not only to learn by their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but by all their mercies, or by all their ſufferings; not only their tongues, but all things elſe ſhould teach you.</p>

You would think it an heavy curſe, to have your bread not yours to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh you; your cloaths not yours to warm you; but this is more terrible, the Word preached is not thine to convert thee, or reform thee. What? Shall God out of his great love provide theſe mercies for thee, and thou go away with no advantage at all?

                        <hi>Or the world, all is yours.</hi>

                     <p>We proceed to the ſecond enumeration of thoſe Goods the Apoſtle giveth an Inventory of, and that is a very large and comprehenſive one, the <hi>world,</hi> with all things therein. The Devil once thought to tempt Chriſt, by promiſing him, <hi>All the glory of the world</hi>; but here we ſee a gift made indeed of the whole world to every believer.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>All the things of the Church are given.</hi> Then, <hi>All the things of the world.</hi> This is to have the fatneſſe of heaven and earth together.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>world,</hi> as for the nature of it is wide, ſo for the ſignifications there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is alſo very large. Sometimes we reade it in the plural number, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. Chriſt is ſaid to make the <hi>worlds,</hi> not as if that fancy of ſome were true, That there are many worlds, but it ſuppoſeth the world in all the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive generations of it. Now the world is ſometimes uſed for the meer <hi>Fabrick</hi> of this univerſe, with all things therein, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Since the foundation of the world</hi>; ſometimes it's uſed only for the <hi>Elect</hi> and godly; as when it's ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 12.47. <hi>I come not to judge the world, but ſave it.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 6.33. he is ſaid <hi>To give life to the world</hi>; but this ſenſe is very much queſtioned, yet the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox propugn it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The <hi>world</hi> is uſed for the <hi>wicked inhabitants</hi> thereof. Thus <hi>John</hi> 15. the <hi>world</hi> is ſaid to <hi>hate the Diſciples of Chriſt.</hi> And 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19. the <hi>whole world</hi> is ſaid <hi>to lie in darkneſſe:</hi> And well may the world be put for wicked men, becauſe they are farre the greater part; and therefore the world is uſed in oppoſition to the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. becauſe believers are <hi>called out of the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you ask, <hi>In what ſenſe world is taken here?</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That the whole world with all things therein is for the ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a Godly man.</hi>

                     <p>He may ſay of the whole Univerſe, All this is mine, for the advantage of my ſoul, one way or other. We have a pregnant place for this, <hi>Rom</hi> 4.13. where you have a promiſe of <hi>being heir of the world</hi>; and to whom is this made? <hi>To Abraham and his ſeed</hi>; What ſeed? <hi>verſ.</hi> 12 <hi>Thoſe that walk in the ſteps of the faith of Abraham.</hi> So that you ſee, the inheritance of the world i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to all believers; which is not true of the civil poſſeſſion of it, but of the ſanctified uſe of it. It's true, Interpreters do much diſpute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in what ſenſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo all believers can be ſaid to be heirs of the world? But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Text is a good expoſition of it.</p>
                     <p>Come we therefore to ſhew in how many particulars we may ſay,<note place="margin">In what ſenſe the <hi>world</hi> is ſaid to be a godly mans.</note> the whole world is a godly mans, it's for his uſe. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>It's the godly mans School or Academy, it is his ſtudy or library.</hi> The Heavens and all things therein are ſo many books, whereby he admireth the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. If the very Heathens might make this uſe of the world, How much rather the godly, who from Gods making of the world, do gather many excellent and ſolid ſupports? As you may obſerve, <hi>David</hi> never encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf more about Gods ſupport of the Church, than from this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That he made Heaven and Earth:</hi> He that did ſo great a thing, what may he not do? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> viz ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively, as an excellent book declareth the glory of the Author; but as he who would underſtand the excellent ſenſe of a book, muſt peruſe it, and underſtand it: So he that would make a true uſe of the world, for the exalting of Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power, muſt diligently meditate on it. This is that, which one man ſaith, the world is a godly mans <hi>mentaliter</hi> in his mind, becauſe by that he takes the occaſion to admire God, and to be affected in all love and fear. This is the right conſideration of the Heavens, not to prognoſtick future contingencies, which God reſerveth as a property to himſelf, but thereby to advance the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power of God: Thus every herb, every creature is a tongue; yea the whole world is but one great tongue, proclaiming aloud, that there is a God. Let then the world be thy ſtudy, all the creatures ſo many books: Do ye look on a watch, or ſome curious needle work, and admire the workmanſhip; and ſhall ye not much more the world, as Gods work? <hi>Arianus Epictetus</hi> ſpeaketh well to this, though an Heathen, condemning the negligence of men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<q>How many goe farre (ſaith he) to ſee the workmanſhip of <hi>Phidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> and judge themſelves unhappy, if they die before they have ſeen that ſight; and ſhall not we much rather admire this world, that is made by God?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The world is a godly mans, Becauſe every thing therein is given him for his neceſſary uſe.</hi> Though he hath not every thing, yet he hath as much as is needfull to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>If he hath given us Chriſt, how ſhall he not with him give us all things elſe?</hi> If you take a man into your houſe, and bid him call for what he will, he may command every thing in the houſe, though he doth not call for all things, but what is for his uſe, that is, as if he had all. And thus the whole world is for a godly man: What wealth, what honours, what health
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:101245:154"/>
is neceſſary and needfull, he is ſure to have. He that dwelleth by the Ocean, he hath all the water in the Sea for his uſe, though it's not neceſſary he ſhould make uſe of it all. He that hath the uſe of any thing, hath the thing. Again, if a man have never ſo many things, and do not uſe them, he hath them not. As the great rich men of the world, <hi>Habent ne fruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non ut fruantur,</hi> The having of them keeps them from enjoying of them, as he ſaid, <hi>In opem me copia fecit,</hi> and they are not theirs for uſe, becauſe they are theirs in poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The world is a godly mans, as his ſhop, and place of ſervice.</hi> It's that wherein he works and labours for God. It's the great ſhop for mankind to do that work God hath appointed them. It's the great vineyard, in which God hath ſet every man to work. This is the <hi>via,</hi> the other is <hi>patria.</hi> This world is for doing, the world to come for receiving. And our Saviour ſpake many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables to this purpoſe, that he giveth all talents, he be ru<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>eth every man with ſeveral oportunities, and they muſt improve them; they muſt be merchants in making the beſt for God. And we are the more to attend to this, becauſe we have but a day, the night cometh, and none can work, Oh that this were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by us! The world is a working place for Heaven; all that is to be done muſt be done here; when thou art taken out of this world, all thy work is done for Heaven: Then thou art to receive a reward. Take heed either of ſpe<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ing thy talent upon ſinne, and in the ſervice of Satan, or hiding it in a napkin, to do nothing with it. We ſee what toil and labour men take for the things of this world, But <hi>labour for the meat</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>which periſheth not,</hi> John 6.27. There are eternal riches and treaſures. Oh that our hearts were more upon theſe things! One thing is neceſſary; they chuſe the better part, who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all things to enjoy God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The world is a godly mans Inne or lodging place.</hi> It's a proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God makes for a ſeaſon, till they are ripe for Heaven. Thus the godly are often compared to <hi>pilgrims and ſtrangers</hi>; and <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 11. with the Patriarchs, though they had the promiſe of the world, yet they were as pilgrims, and declared it by all they did, <hi>That they ſought for a City of Gods own making, which abideth for ever.</hi> So that the whole world is but a with-drawing room for the godly. They are as travellers in an Inne, who are not inordinately affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the good things there, neither will they ſpend all they have there, but ſtill look to their homes. And truly this ſheweth the excellent frame of godly men, though they are in the world, yet <hi>not of the world,</hi> John 17. As we ſee the vapours, though they ariſe out of the earth, yet they aſcend and follow the motions of the Heavens. Thus it is here, though the godly are in the world, yet their affections, deſires and motions of heart are according to heavenly directions. The wicked are in the world, as their proper place, their center; they would never goe out of it; but the godly ſeek for another Countrey.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>The godly have the world as the Stage or Artillary-yard, a place of Exerciſe, wherein all their graces are to be drawn out, by the oppoſition therein.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. ſaid, <hi>There was given him a thorn in the fleſh</hi>; and it's given to the godly to ſuffer, How is that? Becauſe theſe exerciſes and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they are to diſcover and draw out the godlineſſe and power of believers. As ſome among the <hi>Romans</hi> were put to many fights and exerciſes to prove their valour. Thus the godly is in the world, as a ſouldier in the camp, or in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. Our Saviour <hi>John</hi> 15.18. tels his Diſciples of the hatred and oppoſition, they ſhall meet with in the world, if they were ſuch as the world would have, the world would love them; but becauſe they do not conform to their wayes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are perſecuted and driven up and down. Look upon the world, as a place of Exerciſe, do not think to find it otherwiſe than an <hi>Aegypt</hi> to thee. It
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:101245:154"/>
will therefore be thy wiſdome, to get the rich ſpoils of it, as from an enemy. To be quickned to the height of all thy graces, by how much more the comba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e and conflict thou haſt, is exceeding great. The greatneſſe of the tempeſt will diſcover the great art of the Pilot.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>The world is a godly mans, Becauſe all things therein are ſanctified, and made clean to his uſe.</hi> When <hi>Adam</hi> tell, we loſt our dominion; and being our ſelves unclean, every thing becometh unclean to us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the pure all things are pure, but to the unbelieving all things are defiled</hi> You ſee then, that to wicked men nothing is pure, though they have great eſtates, great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, yet nothing is clean to them: Though they have a civil right to ſuch things, yet wanting the ſanctified uſe of them, every thing becomes defiled to them. So that every thing they touch is pitch, every thing they eat is poiſon; there is a ſpiritual leproſie upon them, <hi>Becauſe without faith it's impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Oh, if there were no other ſenſe then this, that all things to the godly are ſanctified and clean in their uſe, this were admirable! Having faith, thou art reconciled to God, and ſo thy eating, thy drinking, thy buying, thy ſelling, all thy actions are accepted of. Thus you ſee, how the world is a godly mans.</p>
                     <p>The Objection then is, <hi>Why have the godly the leaſt poſſeſſion of it,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                        <hi>if they have the ſanctified uſe of it? Doth not</hi> David <hi>complain,</hi> That wicked men have the fatneſſe of the earth? <hi>Did not Chriſt tell thoſe who profered their ſervice,</hi> That the Foxes had holes, and the Birds neſts, but the Sonne of man hath not where to lay his head? <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.20 And can the Diſciple be above his Maſter? <hi>Doth not</hi> Paul <hi>tell us of his</hi> hunger, nakedneſſe, <hi>and all kind of</hi> ſtraits? <hi>How are theſe promiſes any thing but golden deluſions?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To anſwer this, you muſt know, That even thoſe wicked men,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> who are ſaid to have the world at their will, yet they have not the world indeed, they have it not as the godly men, <hi>The little that the righteous hath, is better than great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the wicked,</hi> Pſal. 37.16. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Whatſoever the wicked man hath, he hath it in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wrath; it cometh from Gods anger. God is angry with the wicked all the day long.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it's impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Thoſe that are heirs of the world, have it by walking in the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Think you, <hi>Dives</hi> that fared ſo deliciouſly every day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had all his wealth in a mercy? No, it was for his puniſhment, it was for his eternal torment. They call ſuch things the bleſſing of God, and ſo indeed in themſelves they are; but to wicked men they are curſes. For, as the godly mans afflictions come from Gods love, <hi>Whom he loveth, he chaſteneth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Heb. 12. ſo wicked mens mercies come from Gods anger. Had God loved thee, thou hadſt had (it may be) more afflictions, more wants and exerciſes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Wicked men have not the world, <hi>Becauſe they are overcome by it; the world hath them rather.</hi> Therefore they are called (as you heard) the world, as if their very ſouls, as well as bodies, were made of the duſt of the earth; whereas the godly have the world, as if they had it not; they have God, and the world too; they have Heaven and Earth too; they do not pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> the worſe; their duties are not the more thinne and diſtracted. As <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> theſe were rich and great men in the world, yet if you reade <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, you will finde his heart ſet on God above all theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Wicked men have not the world, <hi>Becauſe they do not own and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God as the giver of all; neither do they live to him, but the things of the world are inſtruments to draw out their luſts, to make them the more wicked.</hi> They take the good creatures of God, and abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e them to wickedneſſe: Therefore <hi>Rom</hi> 8. <hi>The whole creation</hi> is ſaid <hi>to groan under them,</hi> as being weary of them: The very Air, the very Earth is weary of them; yea, the timber in the houſe,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:101245:155"/>
and the ſtones of the wall do witneſſe againſt them; they are by the things of the world made more wicked.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, They have not the world, <hi>Becauſe they have not an holy contentation of mind.</hi> They are not quiet, or ſatisfied in their condition; they have no true peace, notwithſtanding all their abundance; and the reaſon is, becauſe they have not pardon of ſinne, and enjoyment of Gods favour with theſe; and they are only bleſſed who are ſo, <hi>Matth</hi> 5. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth.</hi> You ſee the whole earth is promiſed to a meek, humble, contented ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereas a wicked man is compared to the Sea, that is alwayes foaming, and never lieth ſtill.</p>

This is the hand to receive thoſe treaſures; This faith is not a fancy, it's not a fooliſh imagination, but a real inveſting of thee with all things. But it's of Exhortation alſo, to have the world for thy ſpiritual uſe. Take heed of the wickedneſſe of it, <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of the world,</hi> 2 Corin. 4. Oh it's an excellent thing, not to have the ſpirit of the world, but of God!</p>

                        <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> after him, limit this to the life and death of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Church: If they <hi>live</hi> enjoying their liberties, and outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, it's for you: If they <hi>die,</hi> if they loſe their liberties and lives, it's for the Churches ſake. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He was willing to be a Sacrifice offered up for the Philippians faith,</hi> Phil. 2.17.</p>
                     <p>This is indeed a truth; but as the <hi>world</hi> is a <hi>general,</hi> ſo there is no reaſon, but that we ſhould take <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> in as <hi>General</hi> a ſenſe.

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The godly man only liveth, Becauſe he is united to God and Chriſt the fountain of life. David</hi> doth often ſtyle God, <hi>The fountain of life,</hi> Pſal. 36.9. <hi>And in his favour there is life.</hi> And in the New Teſtament, eſpecially by <hi>John,</hi> Chriſt is made the Author of all life. He is therefore compared to the <hi>Head,</hi> and to the <hi>Vine.</hi> If the members or branches be ſeparated from theſe, they die and wither preſently, as <hi>John</hi> 15. This is ſo frequent an aſſertion, that we need not dilate on it. If not a member of Chriſt, there is no life in thee. <hi>Aut es in mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris, aut in humoribus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Thou art either among the members or the humours of the body of the Church. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He no longer lived, but Chriſt in him; and the life he lived was by faith in the Sonne of God.</hi> What did not <hi>Paul</hi> eat and drinke, and enjoy the common Aire, as we doe? Yes, this he doth not call his life; Oh they live, who no longer live, but Chriſt in them! Thy ſenſe, thy carnal reaſon, thy corrupt affections, thy worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, theſe no longer live, but Chriſt in thee, and his graces.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Onely the godly man liveth, Becauſe he hath a ſpiritual and a new life added to his animal life.</hi> For as the ſoul is the life of the body; ſo grace is the life of the ſoul. Hence our Saviour cals all wicked men <hi>dead men. Let the dead bury the dead,</hi> Matth. 8.22. That is a ſtrange expreſſion, but very true. No dead corpſe is more deſtitute of life and apprehenſion, than their ſouls are of any heavenly motions, any ſpiritual hungrings or thirſtings. All the merry and jolly men in the world, they are dead men, if living in their ſinnes. Therefore among the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> who kept ſtrict Diſcipline amongſt themſelves; if any of their company did commit any groſſe ſinne, they did caſt him out of their company, and provided a coffin for him; intimating hereby, they looked upon him as a dead man. This heavenly, ſpiritual life, whereby a man doth all things by ſupernatural and holy principles, to holy and godly ends, deſerveth the name of life. Hence <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. it's called, <hi>The life of God</hi>; either becauſe of the conformity and likeneſſe of it to Gods life; or becauſe God is the Authour and worker of this life in his children. Tell us not then, that ſuch a man liveth rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and happily, having a great Eſtate, a glorious Seat, large Revenues; he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that liveth this ſpiritual life; and without it, as the Apoſtle ſaith of thoſe wanton widows, <hi>They are dead while alive,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.6. Oh now, thou wouldſt weep over thy husband, thy child, if they were corporally dead, why doeſt thou not much more for their ſpiritual death? We reade of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> what an outcry they made for the death of one in every family? But how many families are there, that have none but dead perſons in them? Alas, thou muſt needs be dead, for thou <hi>ſeeſt</hi> not with thy eyes the beauty of ſpiritual things: Thou <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> not with thy ears the lively word of God, neither canſt thou <hi>walk</hi> with thy feet in the way to Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The godly man onely liveth, Becauſe he only hath the true bleſſedneſſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:101245:156"/>
and comfort of this life.</hi> He onely hath true joy and peace of conſcience; and this not onely the Scripture cals life, <hi>viz.</hi> a proſperous, happy eſtate, as when they ſaid, <hi>Live, ô King,</hi> but the Heathens alſo, <hi>Vivamus mî amica; vixit, dum vixit bene; &amp; vita non eſt vivere, ſed valere.</hi> There are ſome men who live this life; and yet <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, they long for death: Their life is a burden and a torment to them; when it's day, they wiſh it were night; and when it's night, they wiſh it were day. This God threatens as a curſe to every one, that ſhall not keep the Law. Now the godly man, he onely liveth, ſo as to have true joy, real happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe his ſinnes are pardoned; God is only his portion and delight, <hi>At thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> ſaid <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>vid,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the godly may ſometimes through their own ſinne, or for their exerciſe be deprived of this joyfull and bleſſed life, yet that is for their good; as <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus's</hi> death was, that his Siſters faith, and Gods glory may be the more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And beſides, as Chriſts body, ſo their ſouls ſhall not alwayes be kept under the cords of this death. This is therefore by accident. The promiſe to godlineſſe is joy and gladneſſe of heart; They are called upon to doe it, they are commanded to it. Lay this then downe for a ſure Rule, That thou doeſt not live, thou haſt not a proſperous, joyfull and happy heart, till thus ſanctified.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The godly only live, or life is theirs, Becauſe they only know how to improve the dayes of their life for God</hi> They make the right u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of their life and time here, which is to provide for eternity, to glorifie God, and ſave their ſouls. When <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 7. This was an argument he lived Our Saviour ſpake many Parables, to ſhew, how we ſhould improve our Talents, and be alwayes gaining, till our Maſter come; whereas if thou ſpendeſt thy time on thy loſts and pleaſures of ſinne; if thou art idle and negligent, thou haſt not lived. Idleneſſe is the burial of a man alive. We do not account our time of ſleep ſo properly part of our life, becauſe we do nothing then. And this is a full proof, that only godly men live, becauſe they only make honey, while the Summer ſhines; they onely huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band their time, while it's day, calling upon God; They onely accompliſh that work and errand for which God ſent them into the world. Remember this, he liveth that is active for God in his generation, that moveth continually for the good of his ſoul. Let it not be ſaid of thee, as <hi>Seneca</hi> of one, who kept cloſe in his houſe, <hi>Hic ſitus eſt Baſcia,</hi> as if he were buried there.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Life is onely the godly mans, Becauſe he hath an intereſt, in eternal life.</hi> John 5.24. <hi>He hath paſſed from death unto life.</hi> He ſhall never die that liveth this life. Now (alas) this temporary, natural life, doth not deſerve the name of a life. The very Heathens thought ſo; and the Scripture cals it but a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> not a <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> What are a few evil dayes here, and full of miſery? Shall we judge it a life? No ſurely, eternal life deſerveth only that name, where there is no fear of a change, where no power or violence can overcome, where mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſwallowed up in immortality. This is the life that the Scripture inviteth all unto. Did <hi>Dives</hi> live, though he boaſted good things were ſtored up for him? No, <hi>This night, thou fool, thy ſoul ſhall be taken away.</hi> Wilt thou call this a life, to have a few pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon, and then to go into eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Do not the damned in hell wiſh, they had never been born, that this natural life had never been beſtowed upon them? Do not thou then matter this moment, but ſet thy heart upon eternity. Is not this life a vapour, a bubble, but the life to come that muſt make me happy? When God promiſed ſeveral outward mercies to <hi>Abraham, O</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>that Iſhmael might live before thee!</hi> All theſe outward things are nothing, if he live not this ſpiritual and eternal life.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>The godly man only liveth, Becauſe he taketh his life from God, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:101245:156"/>
referreth it to his glory. Whether we live, we live to the Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 14.8. They receive their life thankfully from God, and they live to his glory. Now we ſay, he hath a thing, that knoweth how to make the right uſe of it; and thus, becauſe the godly know how to receive their life from God, and to return it again to him. Therefore it is that they have life; yea they have it, becauſe they can readily part with it, at Gods Command, <hi>I die daily,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.31. And this is our Saviours ſure Rule, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.23. <hi>He that will loſe his life ſhall ſave it, and he that will ſave it ſhall loſe it.</hi> You ſee the way to have life, is to part from it; he hath it, that hath it not; as the Martyrs, who as willingly laid down their lives, as we our garments.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>The righteous only live, Becauſe they mortifie and ſubdue thoſe ſinnes that kill our bodies, that take away our lives.</hi> Wrath and quarrelling that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth a man of the peace of his life; now he refraineth his tongue, he is of a meek ſpirit; whereas anger is like a fire burning in the bowels; and ſo <hi>grief</hi> is a waſter of the very bones; <hi>Worldly ſorrow worketh death,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. the godly therefore take heed of it, as that which murders the body. So <hi>inordinate and worldly cares</hi>; we ſee how ſuch do even devour men; they have ſo many thorns in their fleſh; and what life do ſuch live? <hi>Impatience</hi> is a ſudden Devil poſſeſſing a mans ſoul, <hi>In patience poſſeſſe your ſouls,</hi> Luke 21.19. A man doth not poſſeſſe himſelf, he is not maſter over his own ſpirit that is paſſionate and furious: So that men in ſuch ſins, they live but as thoſe that have been thrown to wilde beaſts or ſerpents to be devoured by them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>The godly man only liveth, Becauſe even in the laſt breathings of this life, his hopes and comforts do moſt remain. The righteous hath hope in his death,</hi> Prov. 14.32. And this hope is called, <hi>A lively hope</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea the godly die not at all, becauſe all live to God; their very <hi>dead bodies,</hi> if you regard the Covenant of Grace, and Gods power are <hi>alive,</hi> Luke 20 38. At that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when all a wicked mans hope periſheth, his life faileth him, his comforts, his friends, all forſake him; then are the godly <hi>to lift up their heads, for their redemption draweth nigh. Though they were dead they ſhall live. Dives</hi> had the good things of this life, but doth he not loſe all with his ſoul at his death? <hi>Lazarus</hi> may ſay, Soul, take thy eaſe, when dying; which <hi>Dives</hi> could not. But</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>How can it be ſaid, that the wicked do not live,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it is true, that the wicked do not live.</note> 
                        <hi>when they are ſaid to have their</hi> portion <hi>chiefly in this life?</hi> And <hi>David</hi> by many <hi>Pſalmes</hi> informeth us, they do not onely <hi>vivere,</hi> but <hi>valere,</hi> not onely live, but flouriſh, <hi>Their eyes ſtick out with fatneſſe,</hi> yet they doe not live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</p>

For how <hi>Death,</hi> which was inflicted at firſt as a curſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſinne, and is the period of all outward comforts in this life, ſhould be for our advantage, is hard to imagine; and then, that <hi>two contraries</hi> ſhould meet in the ſame iſſue, both <hi>life and death</hi> produce the like effects, makes it ſtill the greater paradox.

                        </gap>r it is to a divine faith.</p>
                     <p>In the Scripture, <hi>Death</hi> admits of ſeveral ſenſes,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Sometimes it's taken for the <hi>ſpiritual death of the ſoul in ſinne.</hi> Thus men are often ſaid to be <hi>dead</hi>; and well may this want of grace be called <hi>Death,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a man is like <hi>Lazarus</hi> buried, and even putrified in the grave of ſinne. There is no ſenſe, no motion; there is nothing but loathſomneſſe; they are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying carkaſſes, and not living men, though never ſo externally glorious in the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>eternal Death</hi> often mentioned in the Scripture, as the reward of every ſinne, who though they live, yet it is a dying life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is the <hi>natural Death,</hi> viz. the diſſolution of thoſe two dear friends the ſoul and the body.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Death is put for any great extremity and miſery</hi>; in which ſenſe God is ſaid <hi>to raiſe the dead,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. And the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> captivity is expreſſed under the ſimilitude pf dead men, dead bones, and their reſtauration is a reſurrection, or living again, <hi>Ezek</hi> 37.1.</p>
                     <p>In theſe two later conſiderations we may take it, as death comprehends all outward afflictions and miſeries, as alſo the ſeparation of ſoul from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Obſerve,</p>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101245:157"/>
as the Angels, who are immortal from their intrinſecal conſtitution, having no corruptible principles, only God can annihilate them; but he was made immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal conditionally; had he continued in that ſtate of integrity, he had not been capable of death, as appeareth by the commination, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die,</hi> Gen. 2.16. And the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. concludeth, <hi>That by ſinne death reigned over the world</hi>; where by death is not only meant <hi>actual</hi> death, but <hi>potential</hi> alſo, or a <hi>ſtate of mortality.</hi> Now the original of death, or how it came into the world, was not known by the Heathens; They called it a tribute, that all muſt pay to nature; but why men ſhould die, and how it came about at firſt, that they were ignorant of.</p>

It's no more the execution of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſentence, <hi>Thou ſhalt die,</hi> but the <hi>chaſtiſement</hi> of a loving Father; becauſe God loveth his children, therefore they die; death is made like <hi>Jacob's</hi> Chariot, as the old man rejoyced when he ſaw that, becauſe it would carry him to ſee <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> whom he ſo much longed for.

It's true, the godly man dieth as well as the wicked, he hath the ſame diſeaſes, the ſame paines; but the <hi>Nature</hi> of them is farre different; one is a <hi>curſe</hi> to the wicked, a beginning of hell and torments. The other is, a <hi>mercy</hi> to the godly, and a paſſage to eternal glory. Even as the afflictions which befall the godly, they come from Gods love, <hi>Whom I love I chaſten,</hi> Heb. 12. Thus it is alſo with death it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>The ground why death is thus altered to the godly man, why he ſhould thus differ from the wicked men, is wholly from Chriſt and his death,</hi> as appeareth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting! Death is ſwallowed up.</hi> You would think the grave ſwalloweth up the godly man, but his body ſwalloweth up the grave. <hi>The ſting of death is ſinne</hi>; if that be taken away, the Snake cannot hurt, now the guilt of ſinne is removed by Chriſt. Do not then think it impoſſible that ever ſuch a terrible thing as death ſhould be made lovely, and the thoughts of it ſweet and comfortable: Yes, by Chriſt, all the terrour is done away. As death had no power over him, ſo neither ſhall it have over the godly.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things premiſed,<note place="margin">In how many particulars <hi>death</hi> is a godly mans.</note> Let us conſider in how many particulars death is a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mans; it's for his benefit and comfort. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In this reſpect, <hi>Becauſe by death he gaineth, he is inveſted with greater glory, joy and happineſſe than this world can afford.</hi> All the while a godly man liveth in this world, he is a loſer, he is kept from his beſt treaſures, he is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying his beſt bleſſings, which will be vouchſafed to him. This the Apoſtle you
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:101245:158"/>
have admirably expreſſing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Paul</hi> is there in a <hi>great ſtrait,</hi> he knoweth not how to be content to live, he can hardly ſatisfie himſelf to be kept from Chriſt ſo long; <hi>To die is gain</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and to depart and to be with Chriſt is farre better. Paul</hi> is willing to live for the Churches good, but yet that is not ſo good to him, as to die. Oh, if a godly man could raiſe up his heart to ſuch faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> had, he would even think this world an <hi>Aegypt,</hi> this life a priſon, it's to my loſſe to be here, I might have better company, better glory, better joy, every thing tranſcendently better! Indeed we reade of <hi>Eliſha</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> deſiring death from impatiency, becauſe of the vexations upon them, but that was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But to long for, and haſten the coming of Chriſt, to be above the love of life, and all outward comforts above the fear of death, becauſe of the heavenly affections the ſoul is tranſported with to Chriſt, this is admirable Oh then, that we were not ſuch worms, but like Larks could riſe out of the earth, and ſoar up into Heaven with holy joy, and delight of ſpirit, then death would be as a gain to us, and life as a loſſe! Yet this is not ſo to be underſtood, as if death in it ſelf were to be deſired, or to be prayed for, for in it ſelf it is a natural evil, and ſo is only to be ſubmitted to patiently, not deſired; but the conſequent of it, <hi>viz.</hi> eternal glory, this is to be prayed for, as the Apoſtle doth fully expreſſe it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>We would gladly be cloathed with immortality,</hi> yet to put off this mortal body is grievous; as little children cry for their new garments, and yet cry while they are putting them on.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Death is a godly mans, Becauſe it putteth a period to all thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and troubles he was here exerciſed with.</hi> It's the haven, after all the toſſings he had in this world. <hi>If we had hope only in this life</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.) <hi>we were of all men moſt miſerable</hi>; therefore death is that which makes them happy. Alas, were it not for death, their reproaches would be eternal, their perſecutions would be everlaſting: Inſomuch that death muſt be as welcome to them, as the diviſions of the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> were to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to come out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Mat. 24. <hi>Lift up your he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now in this world, for the moſt part, the godly have the bitter things thereof. <hi>Dives</hi> had the good things of this life, when <hi>Lazarus</hi> had the bitter. Beſides, the hatred and oppoſition in the world, <hi>They groan under the guilt of ſinne, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of ſinne.</hi> Now death puts a ſtop, not onely to worldly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but all ſpiritual diſeaſes. This flux of blood will run no more; they ſhall have no more pride, no more unbelief, no more doubting about the pardon of ſin; in a moment their ſouls will be made like a paradiſe, like the upper region, no clouds, no fears at all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Death is theirs, Becauſe it's the finiſhing of all their worke and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ce, and by that they come for their wages.</hi> How doth the labouring man long for the end of the day, or the week, that he may come to receive his wages? Thus is death, God putteth all his children on work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he giveth them all talents, and he takes them not away, till they have done their work, for which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them. Thus <hi>Moſes Gods ſervant dieth.</hi> Thus <hi>David ſerved in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul finiſhed his courſe.</hi> When they have done all their work, then they die to receive their wages. And this certainly is very comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all the children of God, eſpecially Miniſters, that God will give them their liberties and lives, till they have done their work. No man can ſtop Gods way and power, no more than they can hinder the Sunne in running its race. Why ſhould death then be grievous to thee, when God hath no more for thee to do here, when thou canſt be no more uſefull to promote his glory?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="285" facs="tcp:101245:158"/>Fourthly, <hi>Death is the godly mans, Becauſe the meditation and thoughts of it are ſanctified to him.</hi> He liveth as one that expecteth it daily. And although every one knoweth he muſt die, yet we cannot have the ſanctified knowledge of it without Gods grace. <hi>Teach me to number my dayes</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.) <hi>that we may apply our hearts to wiſdome.</hi> And <hi>Paul, I die daily.</hi> Thus the Scripture bids us not put confidence in future things, what we will do, or whither we will go, becauſe our <hi>life is a vapour,</hi> Jam 4 13. Oh it's great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in Chriſtianity to live as a mortal dying man! Alas, ſuch an one will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for eternity, not account any thing in this world can make him truly happy, his heart is weaned from all worldly comforts and delights. Thus that there is ſuch a thing as death, it is a great argument to the godly man, to live with all heavenly and holy affections.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Death is the godly mans, Becauſe he only knoweth how to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> 2.29. <hi>Now Lord let thy ſervant depart in peace,</hi> when he had taken Chriſt in his arms, and ſeen his ſalvation. Thus they only by faith lay hold on Chriſt; they only have oil to their lamps; they only are prepared to give up their accounts. Oh it's an art of arts to die well! Few are ſo prepared and diſpoſed, that at what hour ſoever the Maſter ſhall come, he ſhall find them doing his will. It's true, many wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are not afraid to die, they flatter themſelves, and can bid death welcome; but it is their ignorance, their boldneſſe makes them thus: they know not what it is do die, upon what terms to appear before God, and therefore do ſuddenly drop into hell.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>The godly man hath death as an advantage, if you reſpect the time and ſeaſon of his death.</hi> His death is not only mercy, but the <hi>time</hi> of his death is <hi>mercy.</hi> The term of every mans life is appointed by God, <hi>To him belong the iſſues of death,</hi> Pſal. 68.20. Now God in great wiſdom and mercy hath determined the time of thy death. And although we cannot alwayes ſee how it is a mercy to die at ſuch and ſuch a time, yet it is ſo. <hi>The righteous is gathered from the evil to come,</hi> Iſa. 57.1. as jewels, when the houſe is on fire, as cattel are driven into a refuge before the ſtorm beginneth. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> muſt not live to ſee all that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ruine, which was coming on <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Thus though they die in their younger years, it's a mercy. Hence the death of righteous men is accounted a ſad progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique of future calamities.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Even the violent death of Martyrdome, which cometh by the cruel and bloudy oppreſſion of implacable enemies, that is theirs.</hi> It's a <hi>mercy,</hi> a <hi>gain, and honour.</hi> The Apoſtles <hi>rejoyced, that they were accounted worthy to loſe what they had for Chriſts ſake. To you it's given not only to believe, but to ſuffer,</hi> Phil. 1, 19. <hi>If any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, bleſſed is he, for the ſpirit of glory ſhall reſt upon him,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.14 It's the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that can be put upon thee: Though it be matter of ſcorn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with the world, yet God and the holy Angels approve ſuch. As Chriſt is ſaid to be exalted, and glorified by dying; ſo it is with his children.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>We are now come to the laſt Enumeration of thoſe ſeveral things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Churches treaſure; and that is, all kind of events, diſtributed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their time, either <hi>things preſent, or future.</hi>

                     <p>We rather take the largeſt ſenſe, and by <hi>preſent things</hi> underſtand all thoſe events which for the preſent do befall us: And by <hi>future,</hi> whatſoever may in time come upon us.</p>
                     <p>So that this Text is a ſoveraign cordial to the godly; whatſoever fals out, they are ſure to be gainers by. Nothing comes amiſſe; they are in a ſure Ark, while others float on the waters. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>
                        <hi>That whatſoever fals out for the preſent to a godly man, it is for his good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every day is in travel, and brings forth ſome new thing or other. Now as often as there is any new event, ſo often is there a new mercy. Our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.34. ſaith, <hi>Sufficient to the day, is the evil thereof</hi>; implying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that every day hath a womb (as it were) and it brings forth ſome affliction, ſome evil or other; and it is ſufficient to the day, we need not trouble our ſelves afore-hand, <hi>Qui dolet antequam neceſſe eſt, dolet pluſquam neceſſe eſt,</hi> yet the evil of the day, is the good of the day to the believer. A godly man may ſay, he never had an ill day ſince his regeneration. As we reade of a devout man, who being wiſhed a good day, he ſaid, <hi>He never had an ill one in all his life:</hi> And being asked, How that could be? He anſwered, <hi>Every morning he laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his will to Gods will, that what pleaſed God, ſhould pleaſe him; and by this means every day was a good day to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>things which fall out</hi> may be divided into two contrary heads; and you ſhall find both of them meeting in this, they bring good to the godly man. And
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>There are happy and proſperous events.</hi> Or,</item>
                           <item>2. <hi>Adverſe and afflicting ones.</hi> And</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt, <hi>What ever mercies, or good things come about, they are the godly-mans,</hi> in theſe reſpects:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>They are for his neceſſary uſe and ſupply.</hi> They come as ſo many gifts immediately given by God for thy neceſſities. And when I ſay uſe; I mean a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified uſe. All the food, raiment and wealth he hath, are ſanctified in their uſe to him; and this the Scripture ſpeaks of, as a property to the godly only. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men may abound in wealth, honours, greatneſſe; but they are a curſe to them, they have them not from God, as intending good to them thereby: But as the Rule is, <hi>Corpora impura, quantò plus nutrias<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> impuriora reddis.</hi> The more you nouriſh unwholſome bodies, the better food they have, the more doth

their diſeaſe increaſe. So theſe worldly mercies draw out the luſts of wicked men the more. Take notice of theſe two Texts, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. There we may ſee a curſe is upon every creature; It's unclean to a wicked man; though he hath a civil right to his eſtate and comforts, yet he can make no ſanctified uſe of them, for their own perſons are not pure and ſanctified, and ſo nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them is pure.

                        </gap>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification by the Word and prayer: Therefore the godly only have the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uſe of them, becauſe they are humble in prayer for the cleanſing of them. But how atheiſtical are the men of the world? They labour to have this ſtate, and that ſtate, ſtill more and more, not at all enquiring, whether this come ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to them, or not. Doth not health, wealth, and all outward mercies come with the curſe upon them they had at firſt? The Devils, Have not they a life? Are not they preſerved in their being? Yet this is no mercy to them And thus it is with all wicked men. We ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Let their table be made a ſnare and a trap, and a ſtumbling block.</hi> It's a terrible place. A mans table, his dainties, his greateſt pleaſure, may be made a ſnare to thee. Wouldſt thou receive the richeſt goods that are brought into thy houſe, if the plague or infection were on them? Couldſt thou endure to have one at thy table to lay a ſnare to catch thee in thy words, to bring thee in temporal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? And art not thou afraid thy houſe, thy eſtate, thy wealth, may be made by God a ſnare to thee? But how happy are the godly, that how great ſoever the outward mercies are, yet they are pure and ſanctified to them? The danger is taken off by Chriſts death.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſe proſperous things are not only in a ſanctified way to the godly, but God al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ve with a cheerfull, joyfull ſpirit. I ſpeak not of carnal and ſinfull joy, which quickly ends in terrour and trembling, and is like the crackling of thorns, that make a blaze, but immediately go out. No, but of a well-ordered glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and joy in the good things God beſtoweth on them. For God doth not call his people to a worldly dejected ſorrow, which worketh death, but to a godly ſorrow, which cauſeth great joy, and ſerenity of ſpirit. Inſomuch that Scripture ſpeaks of it, as a provoking ſinne, if we do not ſerve the Lord with joy and and gladneſſe of ſpirit, when he beſtoweth theſe outward mercies upon us. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28 47. Many terrible curſes are there threatned to <hi>Iſrael, Becauſe they did not ſerve God with joyfulneſſe and gladneſſe of heart for the abundance of all things.</hi> If therefore God giveth thee plenty of outward things, and thou doeſt not ſerve him with joyfulneſſe and thankfulneſſe of heart, it is a provoking ſinne. God doth not only love a cheerfull giver, but a cheerfull receiver alſo of his mercies. So then, when proſperous things befall thee, thou mayeſt with great joy of heart make uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Theſe proſperous things are not only ſanctified to them, but they are alſo made ſanctifying of them.</hi> God giveth them thoſe good things of the body, to make their ſouls better. <hi>Abraham</hi> had many outward mercies, but theſe alſo were helpfull to his graces: he was rich in faith, as well as in cattel and great ſubſtance. Thus, <hi>Godlineſſe hath the promiſe of this life, and the life to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. To have the good things of the world, and not the gracious things of the Goſpel, and the glorious things of Heaven, is to have a ciſtern, but to be without the fountain; to have a ſtarre, but to want the Sunne. Art thou drawn near to God, more improved in holineſſe, by all the mercifull things thou haſt? Then art thou beloved of God. <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith,</hi> Jam. 5. And, <hi>The poor receive the Goſpel.</hi> Be afraid leſt wealth and greatneſſe make thee reject the Goſpel. When thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:101245:160"/>
mercies are ſanctified, then art thou happy.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Theſe proſperous preſent things are theirs, Becauſe they know how to make the preſent uſe of them for Gods glory.</hi> As life was theirs, and death theirs, becauſe they only could live well and die well; ſo preſent riches, preſent death, preſent comforts are theirs, becauſe they know how to make the preſent improvement of them. The Scripture ſtill preſſeth, <hi>While we have opportunity to do good, to lay hold on it, and while it is called to day,</hi> 2 Heb. 3.15. Do good with thy preſent wealth, improve thy preſent ſtrength, thy preſent health; for who knoweth how long thou mayeſt enjoy it? eſpecially of all preſent things, the preſent time is a godly mans. <hi>Redeem the time,</hi> Epheſ. 5.16. And <hi>now is the acceptable time,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. This is a great part of wiſdome, to make the preſent time ours, even now to turn to God, now to reform and amend. One Heathen complained, that his friends were <hi>fures temporis,</hi> the thieves of his time; they ſtole that precious jewel away from him by their viſits. Oh take heed, that no luſts, no pleaſures, no enticements and worldly delights ſteal away thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time; it is all thou haſt, and it's but a moment, yet on this moment depends eternity. Well therefore is it for the godly, who knoweth how to make the beſt improvement of all prices put into his hand. A Chriſtian is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to eaſe, but labour, to a ſpiritual merchandize, to make profit of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing. And thus it ſhould be with every godly man; there is nothing befals thee, no good comes to thee, but thou ſhouldſt bethink thy ſelf, how can this be improved for God? How may I make heavenly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of theſe things? Thus be like the Bee ſucking honey out of every herb.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Preſent good things are a godly mans, Becauſe they are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the love and favour of God, which is infinitely more than the good things themſelves. Non tam donis quam à Deo datis.</hi> That all theſe good things are the effects of Gods favour and gracious reconciliation through Chriſt, this makes them ours in an eminent manner. When God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> ſuch large worldly revenues, and withall ſaid, <hi>He himſelf would be his great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Gen. 15.1. This was the fulneſſe of happineſſe. And ſo you may ſee <hi>David</hi> accounting it, when he eſteemeth more of Gods favour, the light of his countenance, and juſtification of his perſon, more than all his victory and ſucceſſe which he had. To have theſe good things and Chriſt alſo; to have theſe mercies, and the light of Gods countenance, is to have the fulneſſe of earth and Heaven alſo. And this is the reaſon, <hi>why a little that a righteous man hath, is better than great treaſures of the wicked,</hi> becauſe he hath Gods favour, and his love with it. <hi>A good conſcience is a continual feaſt.</hi> Now no man hath a good conſcience, but he who is reconciled with God through Chriſt, and doth enjoy the pardon of his ſinnes, which is evidenced by his repentance, and forſaking of them; but no wicked man is thus; he may have a ſtupified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not a good conſcience, he may be at eaſe, not be tormented and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within, but yet have no ſolid joy.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Theſe proſperous events are theirs, Becauſe God giveth contentation of ſpirit. The bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich, and he addeth no ſorrow with it,</hi> Prov. 10.22. Many men have theſe outward mercies, but then many thorns grow up with them. There is ſo much gall in their honey, that all the ſweetneſſe is gone. This contentation is alſo accompanied with a faithfull depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſtedfaſt truſting in God for preſent proviſion. Hence we are directed to pray for <hi>our daily bread,</hi> which implieth a preſent proviſion fit for us in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtate.</p>
                     <p>We come now to the ſecond ſort of preſent events, and thoſe are tribulations and afflictions. There are none of theſe preſent troubles upon thee, though grievous and burdenſome, but it is for thy good. Though the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>No
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:101245:160"/>
affliction for the preſent ſeemeth joyous but grievous,</hi> Heb. 12.11. Yet truly for the very preſent, though not to thy ſenſe, yet to thy judgment it ought to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Hence <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. we are commanded <hi>To count it all joy, when we fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers temptations.</hi> Now they may well be called ours:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe they come from Gods gracious love to us.</hi> That ſame love which is the fountain of all thy earthly comforts, is alſo the cauſe of all thy earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. It's the ſame hand that doth ſtroke thee and ſtrike thee. What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable paſſage is that <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom I love I chaſten? and if ye were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chaſtiſement, ye were baſtards, and no children? David</hi> alſo affirmeth, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.15. <hi>Out of very faithfulneſſe thou haſt afflicted me.</hi> So that in this dead Lion thou mayeſt find honey: Even out of this Rock may come refreſhing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. What a ſtay ſhould this be to thee? Why art thou dejected? Why doeſt thou cry out, that none is like thee? Thy trouble, thy blackneſſe, thy tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are for thy advantage, as much as all the mercies thou ever enjoyedſt. Go to the fountain from whence they came, and that is nothing but preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous love.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>They are thine for the bleſſed and heavenly effects they work on the godly, ſo that they could not be ſo well without them.</hi> Now of many excellent effects, Conſider,
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>They are to humble us for ſinne, to make us feel how bitter it is to go out of Gods way.</hi> And is not this leſſon of great conſequence? <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.9. <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him. And I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou Lord didſt it,</hi> Pſal 39.9. So that the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne makes it terrible and grievous to them. Now they cry out, What have I to do with ſinne any more? What profit have I of ſuch ſins that now do ſo wound me?</item>
                           <item>2. Another end is, <hi>To make us more vigilant for the future, to preſerve us againſt future temptations.</hi> We have been burnt already, the rod of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath been already on our backs, and can we entertain ſuch ſtinging vipers again? Oh they remember the wounds, the deſolation and darkneſſe of ſoul they were plunged in!</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Theſe afflictions are ours, Becauſe they are exerciſes to draw out our graces, our faith, our patience, our heavenly mindedneſſe, and thereby our crown of glory is greater.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Theſe light and momentany afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons work an eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. And afflictions are called <hi>The precious trial of our faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. As gold to the fire, as winnowing to the corn, as waſhing and rinſing to the foul cloaths, the ſame are tribulations to a godly man. Theſe are the file to get off all their ruſt. Theſe are the waters of <hi>Noah</hi> to raiſe the Ark up higher to Heaven. Thus you ſee the bittereſt event every day is thy good and happineſſe, thou art bleſſed full, and bleſſed empty, bleſſed laughing, and bleſſed mourning, bleſſed having all things, and bleſſed having nothing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Terrour to wicked men.</hi> They are in ſuch a ſtate, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever befals them, makes them more ſinfull, and ſo more miſerable. Thy good things, thy evil things, they all tend to make thee more evil. It's like drink to the Dropſie. It's like oyl to the flames, if God give thee plenty and abundance of theſe things. Oh then, judge not your ſelves happy by having theſe things, but by the ſanctified uſe of them! Every night thou mayeſt make up thy accounts, and ſay, my ſoul is the worſe for this, and that to day. Wicked men will not believe that all things are thus a ſnare to them, but the event will ſhew it.</p>

                        <hi>Or things to come, all are yours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We now come to the laſt particular in the laſt Enumeration, <hi>[Or things to come.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By things to come</hi>] Some we told you underſtood, the Revelations and Propheſies that were about things to happen in after ages. But we are to take it as largely as the words beare. Now the things to come are of two ſorts:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>What is to come in this life.</hi> For no man knoweth what may befall him ere he dieth, or at death: which made the Heathen ſay, that knew not this Text, <hi>Ante obitum nemo foelix,</hi> &amp;c. Or elſe they may be future things in the world to come. For God doth keep the beſt wine till the laſt. The godly have but cluſters of grapes here, they come into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> it ſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>Now of both theſe <hi>future things</hi> we are to ſpeak; and for the <hi>things that are to come</hi> in this life, they are of two ſorts: Either
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>Mercifull and good things.</hi> Or,</item>
                           <item>2. <hi>Grievous and ſad things.</hi> For God can quickly turn a fair day into thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and tempeſt. <hi>Job</hi> felt a ſuddain alteration upon himſelf, which was from the richeſt in the Eaſt, to become the pooreſt in a moment.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now both theſe kinds are the godly mans mercy. No evil that is truly ſo, can befall him.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall not purſue theſe particulars, for that will coincide with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer matter. I ſhall therefore treat of it in a more general way. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>
                        <hi>That all things which are to come, or may fall out hereafter, are a godly mans mercy and advantage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Doctrine ſpeaketh the height of happineſſe and comfort to the godly; for there is no greater temptation we are ſubject unto, then to be tormented about what may fall out hereafter. Though for the preſent it be never ſo well, yet we forethink our poſſible miſeries, as <hi>David, One day I ſhall fall by the hand of Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 27.1. So that many times needleſſe troubles about what is to come, takes away the enjoyment of the preſent mercies we have. But here we ſee the Text giving ſuch a cordial to the godly, that he may go and take his reſt, wholly relying upon the Lord; for come what can come, or will come, nothing can come amiſſe, it will be a mercy, an advantage to him.</p>
                     <p>Now that this Doctrine is true, I may prove <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> from ſuch ſignes and effects, that do evidently demonſtrate, the people of God are quietly to ſit down with this concluſion. Though the Lord only knoweth, what will come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, yet I know it will be only for my good. For</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It appeareth by this, <hi>The Scripture commands the godly to avoid all diſtruſtfull and diſtracting cares about what will be; that he ſhould quietly compoſe himſelf, committing all to his heavenly Father, who knoweth all he hath need of.</hi> So that as little children are cheerfull and play, never troubling themſelves, how they ſhall ſubſiſt, and what if ſuch miſeries ariſe? Thus ought the godly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.34. <hi>Take no thought for to morrow, for the morrow ſhall take thought for the things of it ſelf, (q.d.)</hi> God will then provide, when
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:101245:161"/>
other conditions, other exerciſes come. Do not thou diſtract thy ſelf, God will then upon any new trial, or exerciſe, come in upon thee to help and deliver. See here then the bleſſed eſtate of a godly man, he is commanded to ſhut out all diſtruſtfull cares for the future; he is to caſt his burden upon the Lord, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall befall, it will be well with him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>They are to perſwade themſelves, that nothing ſhall fall out, that can ſeparate from Gods love.</hi> And what a ſupport is this? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Paul</hi> there is triumphing, and that not for himſelf, but for all the people of God, who are juſtified; <hi>What ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt? Shall things preſent, ſhall things to come?</hi> verſ. 38. Is not this to bring the people of God up into the Mount of transfiguration? Whatſoever ſhall befall thee before thou dieſt, yet nothing ſhall ſeparate between Gods love and thee. Though it ſhould come about, that no friend love thee, none in the world will own thee, yet God will own thee. Certainly, this may rejoyce the heart of the godly, if any thing hereafter might divide between God and thee, might deprive thee of God, and part thee from him; then thou mighteſt tremble and quake, fearing the worſt is not paſt; but when all is thus provided afore-hand; that thou art ſure to be in Gods love, be thy eſtate never ſo diſconſolate, this may keep up thy heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The godly concerning all <hi>future things,</hi> may thus alſo conclude, <hi>That there is no evil, no temptation that ſhall fall upon them, but he will give ſtrength to bear, and give a way to eſcape.</hi> You have a Text more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than the gold of <hi>Ophir</hi> to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but with the temptation will make a way to eſcape.</hi> Doth not this Text ſpeak to the heart of ſome godly people? Oh they lie under ſad temptations, heavy exerciſes are upon them, ſuch as the world knoweth not, and they are afraid; theſe will overwhelm them, they ſhall never get out, it will undo them! But what ſaith the Text? God will not ſuffer you to be tempted above meaſure, and he will make a way to eſcape. See then thy fears, thy unbelief makes thee go contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Text. Thou ſayeſt, thou ſhalt never be able to bear it, God ſaith, <hi>I will lay no more upon thee, then thou art able.</hi> Fear ſaith, I ſhall never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape this, never overcome this; Faith ſaith, he will make a way to eſcape. Now whether wilt thou believe God, or thy own fearfull heart? Oh then, let the godly that are tempted, and lie in deep waters, that are like <hi>Jonas</hi> ſwallowed up in the whales belly, take this Text, and hide it in their heart, ſo they will not fear what will be to come!</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, For <hi>things to come,</hi> they have this promiſe, <hi>That in all outward things, God will never leave them, nor forſake them.</hi> Thus things to come are theirs, for they have this promiſe. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. the Apoſtle urgeth this againſt covetouſneſſe, and to be content with what they have, <hi>God will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Now this temptation many times troubleth (at leaſt) ſome godly perſons; they are afraid, they, or their poſterity may be brought to wants; they fear poverty may come upon them as an armed man; eſpecially they know not, what they ſhall do in old age, if God ſhould let them live, till they ſhould loſe their ſight, or their limbs, or their parts, what ſhould become of them? To live a burden to themſelves or others. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath a wicked Poſition,
<q>That all decrepit old men ſhould be thrown down a ſteep hill headlong, and be killed, as being a burden to a Commonwealth.</q>
Old people are many times a burden to wicked young people. Therefore God commands us, <hi>Not to deſpiſe our mother when ſhe is old,</hi> Prov. 23.22. Now we ſhall ſee <hi>David</hi> himſelf tempted about his old age, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.19. <hi>When I am old and gray headed, forſake me not.</hi> Thus you ſee what wants or ſtraits, eſpecially
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:101245:162"/>
what decayes of grace the godly may fear; they ſhall not have the ſame vigour and ſtrength, not the ſame memory and judgement. But the Scripture gives a good promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.14. <hi>They ſhall bring forth fruit in old age.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.4. <hi>To your old age, I am he, and even to hoary hairs I will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thee.</hi> He will have as much care of thee, as a mother of a child in her arms. Well then you ſee, in that God hath ſaid, he will never leave or forſake us, we need not fear poverty, want, the diſeaſes, and miſeries of old age, for theſe things are ours.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>The people of God may be perſwaded of their perſeverance in the ſtate of grace, that they ſhall never totally and finally fall off from the favour of God.</hi> For this is the greateſt thing that might be feared; not the loſſe of riches, honours, or our eſtates, but the loſſe of grace is to be feared. Oh, if left to my ſelf, I may prove a Prodigal, become deſtitute of all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe! There is nothing ſhould more make the godly afraid than this. Hence they are commanded to have a godly trembling about it. <hi>He that ſtandeth, let him, take heed, that he doe not fall,</hi> 1 Corinth. 10.12. <hi>Works out your ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> Philip. 2.12. <hi>Bleſſed is he that feareth alwayes,</hi> Prov. 28.14. Now, though there be ſuch a godly fear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, yet the godly at the ſame time are to be perſwaded, that what grace God hath begunne, he will perfect; and therefore this fear is promiſed as a means to preſerve them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> So that we have many glorious promiſes for our continuance and ſtedfaſtneſſe in the way of God, that neither the ſubtil devices of falſe prophets ſhall be able to deceive them, nor open and violent perſecutions ſhall take them out of Chriſts arms, for they muſt be ſtronger than Chriſt that can do this.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Death, which is ſurely to come upon every one, even about that the godly need not be troubled.</hi> You heard, it was their <hi>gain,</hi> it was the time of their <hi>redemption,</hi> it was <hi>Jacobs</hi> Chariot. Now although it be ſo, yet the moſt godly have trembling thoughts about it. Chriſt himſelf as he was a man, had a natural fear of death; and many of Gods children are tempted about it, leſt they ſhould have no comfort, be filled with deſpair, or not able with readineſſe and willingneſſe to reſigne themſelves into Gods hands. But the Scripture doth excellently fortifie againſt this, <hi>The righteous hath hope in his death,</hi> Prov. 14.32. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting?</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.15. ſee what an expreſſion there is, <hi>The Lord will ſtrengthen him on the bed of languiſhing, and the Lord will make all his bed in his ſickneſſe. All his bed</hi>] Do not then fear to be left comfortleſſe at that hour. This muſt come, and it will come bleſſed unto thee. And as for the things to come in the world to come, they are ſo theirs, that they are prepared onely for them. Here riches and honours, the good have them, and the bad have them, but there onely the godly do poſſeſſe the good things of that life. Now, what tongue of men or Angels is able to ſpeak of them? The Scripture cals it, <hi>Life, eternal life, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and immortality, The Kingdome of Heaven, A Crown that never wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>; nay, whatſoever may be ſaid of it, comes ſhort, becauſe it may be ſaid, Then we rightly eſteem of it, when we account it ineſtimable. Now this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory is ſo ſure, though to come, that they are ſaid to have it already, <hi>He hath already paſſed from death to life,</hi> 1 John 3.14. <hi>He is already ſet down with Chriſt in heavenly places,</hi> Epheſ. 2.6. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>They have faith, which is the ſubſtance and evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> So that were the godly for the preſent to lie under all imaginable miſery, yet that which is to come, would make amends for all. Thus <hi>Paul, We account theſe light affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions not comparable to that eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. It's no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:101245:162"/>
what is for the preſent, ſo that what is to come be ſo glorious.</p>
                     <p>Now let us paſſe from the Mount of Bleſſing to that of Curſing. Let us ſee how it is with the wicked man in reſpect of what is to come. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>How rich, and pleaſant, and full their condition is for the preſent, yet they may expect fulneſſe of wrath to come upon them every day.</hi> Jam. 5.1. <hi>Go to now ye rich men, howl and weep for the miſeries that are to come upon you.</hi> God ſtoreth up vengeance, he hath a treaſure of it; and the ungodly may trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble every hour, leſt it fall upon them. Therefore thou that art now jolly and confident, fear what is to come, what the next day may bring upon thee. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> had a fair morning, but fire and brimſtone quickly fell upon them. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. we have the curſes of a wicked man deſcribed, <hi>That in the morning he ſhould wiſh for evening, and he ſhould be in continual fear of what may come upon them.</hi> Even as <hi>Cain</hi> went up and down fearing every one would kill him. So that all the curſes in the Word, all the wrath of God may juſtly be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thee every day thou ariſeſt or walkeſt abroad.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Although they have the good things of this life, yet they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to tremble, then to be confident thereby.</hi> For the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> inſtructeth us of Gods proceedings herein, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>Abraham</hi> told <hi>Dives, He had received the good things of this life, and therefore was to have the evil things of the life to come.</hi> As <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had part of the earthly poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this world, but nothing of <hi>Canaan</hi> or the promiſe: Thy miſery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion hereafter will be the greater, by how much the rather thou haſt been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to eaſe and pleaſures; and the longer God keeps off his wrath, the more heavy and weighty will it be, when it ſhall come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>Of Inſtruction.</hi> He only is happy, who ſhall be ſo in the world to come. Judge not of a mans bleſſedneſſe by this moment; our lives are ſhadows that paſſe away, what ſhalt thou be to all eternity? Say that to thy ſoul, Oh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Atheiſt, that crieth, Give me the preſent, and let others take the future! Thou doeſt not believe the great things coming, therefore thou thinkeſt and ſpeakeſt ſo. Oh what a vaſt difference will there be between thy laughing here, and thy roaring in hell, thy pleaſures here, and thy torments there! Oh that this eternity coming, that this world to come ſhould not be more in your minds and hearts!</p>
                     <p>

They have a promiſe for the future, and therefore it's their weakneſſe and unbelief; if they torment them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying, what if this be, and that be? How ſhall I do, if ſuch things come upon me? What ſhall not ſuch promiſes as I have named quiet thee? Mayeſt thou not truſt God upon his Word?</p>

                     <p>VVE ſhall now come down from this Text, this Mount of Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, concerning which every believer might ſay, <hi>It is good to be here</hi>; and purſue the other matter that is behind. Where we may obſerve the Apoſtle in a Climax riſing higher, <hi>All things are yours, you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> So that the higheſt round in this ladder reacheth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> did, and the loweſt one is in the earth. So that you may obſerve the Apoſtle now changing his ſpeech; before <hi>all things are yours</hi>; all in the <hi>Church,</hi> and in the <hi>world,</hi> is yours. Now he doth not alſo ſay, Chriſt is yours, <hi>but you are Chriſts</hi>; whereby we ſee, that as the former things ſpoken of were not for themſelves, but the godly; ſo neither are the godly for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have the Apoſtle mixing water with wine, leſt it ſhould be too much drunk off, and ſo make giddy, <hi>All things are yours,</hi> there is your <hi>Priviledge</hi>; but <hi>you are Chriſts,</hi> there is your <hi>Duty</hi>; even to ſee that what ever you are, or can doe, it be in reference to him. Even as at the firſt God created all the world, with the creatures therein for man, but man for himſelf, ſo all things are for the godly, and the godly is for Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>We may then obſerve the difference in this expreſſion and ſenſe between the former and the later:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When he ſaid, <hi>All theſe things were the godly mans,</hi> he meant it <hi>of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual uſe only, not of dominion and power</hi>; but when he ſaith, <hi>We are Chriſts,</hi> the meaning is, <hi>We are wholly his creatures, he hath abſolute dominion and ſovereignty over us.</hi> And then,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>All the things are a godly mans,</hi> he is the <hi>end</hi> of them; but he is <hi>finis indigentiae,</hi> he needs them, and wants them, he could not tell what to do without them, but Chriſt is <hi>Finis aſſimilationis,</hi> they are for him, not that he needs them, but that he might make them more perfect in communicating his grace and holineſſe unto them. Obſerve then,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>
                        <hi>That a godly man in all that he is, or can doe, is wholly Chriſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ye are Chriſts.</hi>] The Apoſtle driveth it to this, that therefore they ſhould glory onely in him. They are not <hi>Pauls</hi> or <hi>Apolloes,</hi> but Chriſts; and therefore in him onely muſt they glory and judge themſelves compleat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects a godly man is Chriſts</note>To underſtand this, Let us conſider in what reſpects the godly man is Chriſts. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>He is bought and purchaſed by his bloud,</hi> ſo that he oweth <hi>all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, comforts and priviledges onely to Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. <hi>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price.</hi> So then, well may the godly man be ſaid to be Chriſts, for he cometh to be his at a dear rate. <hi>Never did King yet ſubject, or maſter a ſervant at ſo dear a prize, as Chriſt obtained thee.</hi> He did undergoe all that agony and ſhamefull death, to free thee from the bondage thou wert in, and to make thee his: For you muſt know, the clean contrary was true of the godly; before made Chriſts, they were the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:101245:163"/>
Devils; they were wholly his, Of him, and through him, and to him, they lived from him; all their thoughts, affections and actions were from him, who ruled in their hearts, and they were to him, becauſe they wholly did his work, and advanced his kingdome. But now, Oh wonderfull and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py change, they are brought out of the dark priſon they were in; all the chains and fetters upon them, are taken off, and now they have the robes of Chriſt put upon them, and are made free indeed! Conſider then, how the godly become Chriſts, it is by ſhedding his bloud: we were Satans captives before, and now made Chriſts. Oh then, why ſhould the godly live to ſinne or Satan, or the world any more? Were they crucified for thee? Have they obtained thee at ſo dear a price, as Chriſt hath?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The godly they are Chriſts, Becauſe by his Spirit they are made new Creatures.</hi> They have a new being. For it cannot be, that any ſhould be Chriſts, who live in the fleſh, and are carnally minded. Therefore the Spirit of Chriſt communicateth unto them a new being, gives them an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature, enables them to mortifie ſinne in all the luſts thereof. For this is a true Rule, <hi>Chriſts merit, and Chriſts Spirit goe together; Where his death is effectual, his Spirit is efficacious. None can ſay, they are Chriſts by his death for them, that may not ſay, they are Chriſts by his Spirit form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and faſhioning of them.</hi> Hence they are ſaid, <hi>To have his Spirit, to be in the Spirit, to walke in the Spirit, to be led by the Spirit.</hi> Oh then, let carnal and earthly men ſtand aloof off! This matter, as it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, ſo they underſtand it not. If thou art Chriſts, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dwels in thee, leades thee, guides thee, enables thee, quickens thee: So that there are very few who can challenge an intereſt in Chriſt after this manner. Are not moſt men deſtitute of Chriſts Spirit? For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Romans</hi> 18. ſaith, <hi>That if the Spirit of Chriſt be in us, then as that raiſed up Chriſt from the grave, ſo it would raiſe us from ſinne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are Chriſts, Becauſe he is the Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and the end.</hi> He is the <hi>Alpha,</hi> he is the <hi>A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> and <hi>FO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTAIN</hi> of all the ſpiritual good we have; compared theerefore to the <hi>Head,</hi> that gives of its fulneſſe to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Member</hi>; and to the <hi>Vine</hi> from which every <hi>Branch</hi> deriveth its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. And the Apoſtle cals him, <hi>The Authour and finiſher of our faith, Heb.</hi> 12.2. It's he that giveth life and motion, and all ſpiritual ſtrength to us. Now every effect is more the cauſes, then it is its owne. Seeing therefore thou haſt no good, but what thou haſt received from Chriſt, thou art wholly to depend on him, as the ſtreame is on the fountain, as the light is on the Sunne; for take them away, and theſe immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. Thus he is the <hi>Alpha,</hi> and he is alſo the <hi>Omega</hi> and end. We are not to live to our ſelves, but to him. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. <hi>He doth not live, but Chriſt in him.</hi> All our graces are to carry us out of our ſelves to Chriſt, our <hi>faith</hi> in Chriſt, our <hi>love</hi> and affections to be pitched on Chriſt: If we <hi>preach,</hi> it is to ſet up Chriſt; if we <hi>eat,</hi> or <hi>drinke,</hi> it is thereby to ſtrengthen us, that we may the better ſerve him; if what ever we <hi>doe,</hi> or what ever we <hi>ſuffer,</hi> it is to promote the glory and honour of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>We are Chriſts, in that all our Chriſtian compleatneſſe is in him.</hi> Coloſ. 1.19. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell.</hi> And again, <hi>Ye are compleat in him,</hi> Coloſ. 2.10. So Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>To be made unto us wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. Seeing therefore that in Chriſt is all fulneſſe, and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:101245:164"/>
in us nothing but ſinne and emptineſſe; no marvael if we be his more than our own. Now this is of admirable comfort to the godly, as well as it inferreth duty. For ſeeing thou art Chriſts, the Queſtion is not in matter of Juſtification, What thou art? but, what Chriſt is? Not what ſinne thou haſt; but what righteouſneſſe Chriſt hath? Therefore if the Law come and demand perfect obedience, ſay, I am Chriſts: If thy conſcience accuſe thee, ſay, I am Chriſts: If the Devil tempt thee, and arraign thee, ſtill ſay, I am Chriſts. To be Chriſts muſt needs anſwer all Objections. Who ſhall impeach Chriſt? Who ſhall accuſe Chriſt? So that it is an excellent evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical life, when we can by faith fill our ſouls with this aſſurance, We are Chriſts. Then, as farre as the fulneſſe and ſufficiency of Chriſt will bear us out, and bear down all oppoſitions, ſo long may we be confident. This is a great Goſpel ſinne, that we live in our ſelves, and upon our ſelves in our works, in our righteouſneſſe; or are ſlaviſhly dejected, becauſe of ſinnes, when humbled for them, whereas we ſhould live by faith in Chriſt, as Chriſt dwels in our hearts by faith, ſo we ſhould dwell in him. How is the Apoſtle ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed alwayes with the grace that comes by Chriſt. The priviledges of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Adoption, and Sanctification, that we have by him, are to be more than meat or drink unto us.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>We are Chriſts, Becauſe we are wholly to be diſpoſed by him in all conditions, in all exerciſes and temptations</hi> For Chriſt being made a Lord and King over us, he orders us in all things, he ruleth and governeth us according to his will. Sometimes he cals us to <hi>labour,</hi> and <hi>worke</hi> for him; ſometimes to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for him. Now in what ever condition or exerciſe we are in, this ſhould teach us patience and ſubmiſſion, we ſhould not think much of ſuffering for his Name, Truth and Glory. Our Saviour doth not think ſuch a Diſciple worthy of him, that doth not love his father, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and life it ſelf leſſe than him. Thus we ſee the Apoſtles, and all the Martyrs, becauſe they were Chriſts, their bodies, their eſtates, all they had they did not grudge to give all to him, when he called for them. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are Chriſts, he is our Lord, all is in reference to him, we ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at any labour or ſuffering for him. <hi>Thou art worth ten thouſand of us,</hi> (ſaid the people to <hi>David</hi>) <hi>thou ſhalt not any more endanger thy ſelfe in battel.</hi> Thus ſhouldeſt thou ſay, Chriſts Name, his Truth, his Glory is ten thouſand times better than all my wealth, or life it ſelf. But as we ſee God hath made all things for men, the beaſts of the field and the birds of the air are killed for man, and there is no pity therein, becauſe they were created for this end; and this is their perfection: So are we made for Chriſt, our wealth, our health, our eſtates, our parts, they are all to be ſacrificed for Chriſt; and this is the proper perfection of them; this is the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; They doe then attaine that glorious end for which they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us. Oh how would this make us deny our ſelves, and preferre Chriſt more, that as God hath given him the preheminence in all things, ſo we ſhould!</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Characters of ſuch as are Chriſts.</note>Now in the next place, let us conſider, <hi>Some Characters or Properties of ſuch as are Chriſts.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>They deſire more knowledge of him, more acquaintance with him; they prize him above all worldly things. Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.8. <hi>accounts all things dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> The Church in the <hi>Canticles</hi> is ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with his beauty; all which Song is to be underſtood ſpiritually of that ſpiritual fulneſſe and excellency which is in him. Hence the godly are ſaid, <hi>To have their converſation in Heaven,</hi> becauſe there is Chriſt, whom they look for, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.31. Thus faith repreſents the Lord Chriſt in all lovelineſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency:
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:101245:164"/>
So that the voluptuous man is not more taken up with the love of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, than the Chriſtian is with Chriſt. There are the treaſures of wiſdom and grace in him, all which the godly ſoul is ſearching into.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Thoſe that are Chriſts, they abhorre and have no communion with any ſinne or wickedneſſe, becauſe that only Chriſt hateth.</hi> Though we be poor and miſerable, Chriſt may love us, but if ſinfull then Chriſt abhorreth us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>What concord between Chriſt and Belial? What agreement between light and darkneſſe?</hi> Chriſt indeed converſed with ſinners, but it was as the Phyſician with diſeaſed perſons, to make them better, even to heal them; and thus may we, <hi>But no fellowſhip of approbation are we to have with the works of darkneſſe, but rather to reprove them.</hi> You may reade then in the very fore-head and life of many, whether they belong to Chriſt or no. For would Chriſt defile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſuch ungodly wayes? Oh blaſphemy to think ſo! Now he that is Chriſts, he labours to be like him, he hath his Image upon him. They are ſaid, <hi>to put on Chriſt,</hi> as men do a garment, nothing but Chriſt appeareth in them, and on them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Thoſe that are Chriſts, they live not to themſelves, but to him.</hi> They <hi>pleaſe</hi> not themſelves or others in a ſinfull way. <hi>If I ſhould pleaſe men, I were not the ſervant of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1.10. Thou canſt not give content to the world, pleaſe them, and pleaſe Chriſt too. And therefore as Chriſt, ſo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are alwayes hated, oppoſed by the world. It doth not look upon them <hi>as their own, for then they would love them. The Diſciple muſt not thinke to be above his Maſter.</hi> And truly no wonder at this, for if Chriſt ſought not his own glory and greatneſſe, but humbled himſelf in that deſpicable way of a ſervant, how much more ought we not to exalt our ſelves, but to be debaſed, that he may be magnified?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Exhortation to thoſe who are Chriſt's, to be ſelf-denying, to take up Chriſts croſſe, to love him more than all they have: for Chriſt is not for thee, but thou for Chriſt</hi>; as man was not for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man; and therefore the duties of that day were to yeeld to mans neceſſity: ſo Chriſt and his Truth, and his Goſpel, they are not for thy life, or thy credit, but theſe are for them. Let then the leſſe give place to the greater. It's not ſo neceſſary that thou ſhouldſt be rich, great and honoured in the world, as that Chriſt and all things of Chriſt ſhould be preſerved. How ungodly then is it to pretend Chriſt, or make uſe of the Name of Chriſt for thy carnal advantages? This is to make the head be under the feet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. <hi>Of Terrour to all thoſe who live in the conſtant practice of wickedneſs: they are none of Chriſts, and ſo they have no portion in his blood, no ſhare in his mediation.</hi> How miſerably did <hi>Eſau</hi> cry out, becauſe he was ſhut out of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bleſſing? But this is farre greater to be ſhut out of Chriſts prayers Chriſts interceſſion, and Chriſts expiation. Thou canſt not retain ſinne, and Chriſt too: Thou canſt not love the world, and Chriſt too. What hope then and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge remains for thee? If Chriſt caſt thee off, Is there any other remedy left? Can any Angels help thee? Are there any more Chriſts? No, thy caſe is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſperate, who art caſt off by him; yet men ſit and hear theſe things without fear or trembling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="298" facs="tcp:101245:165"/>
                        <hi>And Chriſt is Gods.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are now come to the laſt round in the Ladder, <hi>à primo ad ultimum</hi>; we are now at the laſt ſtep, we cannot go further, to ſay, God is any thing elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide himſelf, for he is of himſelf, and to himſelf. All the other particulars may well be received without any difficulty; but this ſeemeth to be a pill hardly taken down.<note place="margin">In what ſenſe Chriſt can be ſaid to be Gods</note> The expreſſion ſeemeth hard, <hi>Chriſt is Gods</hi>; as if Chriſt were not God, but made for God, as the world is for the godly. But <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith well,
<q>Though the words be the ſame, yet the ſenſe is much different. The world is ours, as being made for us; we are Chriſts, as being his creatures purchaſed; but Chriſt is Gods, as his moſt beloved Sonne.</q>
This is true; but yet this is not fully the Apoſtles meaning. Therefore Chriſt is conſidered two wayes: Either,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>As an abſolute God,</hi> in which ſenſe, he is ſaid, <hi>To think it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> Phil. 3.6. And thus, though he be the Sonne of God, yet he is equal with God. Or,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>As a Mediatour,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>two Natures, Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane.</hi> Now if we conſider Chriſt in reſpect of his <hi>Humane</hi>; ſo that is a creature, and wholly to be referred to God. Or if we conſider him as a <hi>Mediatour,</hi> thus he is in reference to God the Father. For a Mediatour is to bring us to him, who is at diſtance from us. <hi>Thus Chriſt both as a man, and as a Mediatour in his whole Mediatory Office, is not for himſelf, but for God the Father,</hi> as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. <hi>When the Sonne ſhall give up the Kingdome, that God may be all in all.</hi> We have two places like this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>The head of the woman is man, and the head of Chriſt is God</hi>; that is not in reſpect of his Divine Nature; for the firſt Perſon cannot be ſaid to be the Head, or cauſe of the ſecond, but the beginning, but in reſpect of his <hi>Mediatory Office.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 14.28. <hi>My Father is greater than I,</hi> in reſpect of his Manhood, and his Mediatory Office.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not enter into theſe ſublime Diſputes about Chriſt as a Mediatour, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be Divine Worſhip that belongs to him, as ſo? And if Divine, How there can be a primary Object of Religious Worſhip, as God the Father, and a ſecondary Object, as Chriſt the Mediatour?</hi> This, though a noble Queſtion, yet becauſe not ſo practical, I wave; onely ſome poſitive things I ſhall deliver in the point. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>
                        <hi>That Chriſt as man, and as a Mediatour, is wholly Gods.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Office and work, as a Mediatour, is to reconcile us to God the Father. He is called, <hi>The Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Mediatour.</hi> The <hi>Saviour,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>end,</hi> which is ſalvation, that he obtaineth for believers; and <hi>Mediatour,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>means</hi> and way by which this is accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>To open this take notice,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, and of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical Union.</note>Firſt, <hi>That Chriſt is a Perſon conſiſting of a Divine and Humane Nature, not by mixtion, or confuſion, or by meer inhabitation, but by a Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is commonly called Hypoſtatical.</hi> I ſhall not tell you how much that word <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> troubled the Church. The <hi>Latine Church</hi> having a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thought about the word to the <hi>Greek Church.</hi> So that when they both agreed in the ſame thing, yet the words and phraſes they condemned in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as heretical. But the Scripture is very clear, both that Chriſt was God,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:101245:165"/>
and alſo man, yet but one perſon, not making two Chriſts; and this is one main fundamental Article of Religion. The Devil in former ages alwayes endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rob him of one of theſe Natures, and ſome have raiſed theſe monſtrous and damnable hereſies again from hell; but this foundation and pillar ſtandeth ſure.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>By reaſon of this Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, though there be not a real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Properties of each Nature, yet there is a verbal one in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, both things are predicated of Chriſt.</hi> As for example, though the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is not <hi>paſſible,</hi> but the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> onely, nor the <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture omnipotent</hi> and <hi>omniſcient,</hi> but the <hi>Divine</hi> only, yet of <hi>Chriſt</hi> we <hi>predicate,</hi> that he <hi>ſuffered,</hi> that he <hi>died,</hi> that he is <hi>omnipotent</hi> and <hi>omniſcient,</hi> though this be true in reſpect of one Nature only.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt being thus a Perſon, that he may be our Redeemer, he is cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe three Offices, which fit him fully for our Redemption.</hi> He is firſt <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> God and man: Then he is <hi>Mediatour,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Office.</hi> His <hi>Office</hi> is three-fold, a <hi>Prophet,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and a <hi>King.</hi> This makes him the <hi>Triſmegiſt,</hi> the <hi>ter maximus.</hi> Now we muſt not judge theſe things metaphyſical curioſities: No, <hi>Theſe are the Articles of our Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; theſe are to be received by a <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>firme faith.</hi> Yea in believing Chriſts Perſon, and his Office, lieth all the comfort and treaſure of a Chriſtian. It's Chriſt, that ſhould be our ſtudy, our meditation day and night, <hi>Quis ſit, &amp; qualis?</hi> Who he is, and what he is?</p>
                     <p>Now the Doctrine ſpeaks of Chriſt, both in reſpect of his Humane Nature,<note place="margin">How Chriſt as a man, and as a Mediatour is Gods.</note> and as he is a Mediatour, not as God. Let us ſee then, <hi>How Chriſt as a man, and as a Mediatour is Gods.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>His Incarnation, and coming into the world, it was not for himſelf, but for God.</hi> He therefore took our Nature upon him, that he might bring to God the Father his Elect people. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he ſent his only begotten Sonne.</hi> John 3.16. And, <hi>To us a Sonne is borne, to us a Sonne is given,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. So that this work of Incarnation, this coming into the world from the boſome of the Father, which is ſo ſtupendious a myſtery, is originally from the Father. It was to <hi>do Gods work,</hi> to obey his will; and therefore Chriſt is called <hi>Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> Iſa. 52.13. Not that Chriſt came into the world againſt his own will; or as if this were againſt his own deſire, but God the Father is the original of all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That Chriſt is Gods appeareth, in that he acknowledgeth his Doctrine and Truth not to be his, but his Fathers, taking all off from himſelf, and making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only a Miniſter, or Embaſſadour coming in his Fathers Name, and revealing his will.</hi> See this notably, <hi>John</hi> 8 26, 28. <hi>I ſpeak thoſe things which I heard of him, I do nothing of my ſelf, but as my Father hath taught me. I speak theſe things.</hi> So <hi>verſ.</hi> 42. <hi>I came not of my ſelf, but he ſent me.</hi> But eſpecially <hi>John</hi> 7.16. <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me; he that ſpeaketh of himſelf ſeeketh his own glory.</hi> Here you ſee Chriſt acknowledging, that the Doctrine he preached as a Miniſter and Mediatour was not his. Yea, if we ſpeak of his humane Nature that invented it not, becauſe that was a finite creature, though united perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to an infinite Perſon. Oh what an admirable inſtance is this of modeſty! Chriſt ſpeaks not, preacheth not of his own, but from the Father. How ſhould we Miniſters then not preach our own fancies, our own imaginations, but the Doctrine delivered in Scripture? <hi>How would this bridle up a deal of bold igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance now in the world? Men would not be ſo forward to teach before they have well learned themſelves</hi>; Chriſt ſpeaketh nor of himſelf. And conſider that connexion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>He that ſpeaketh of himſelf, ſeeketh his own glory.</hi> When we are not contented with Scripture-doctrine, with truths delivered there, but bring of our own, it's only to ſeek vain glory, and applauſe in the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="300" facs="tcp:101245:166"/>Thirdly, That Chriſt is wholly Gods, appeareth, in that, as the Doctrine he preached was the Fathers, <hi>So he ſought not his own glory,</hi> did not exalt himſelf, but the Father. <hi>John</hi> 8 29. <hi>I do alwayes thoſe things that pleaſe him</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 54 <hi>If I honour my ſelf, my honour is nothing.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on earth.</hi> Thus in all that Chriſt did and ſuffered, it was only to glorifie and advance God his Father. For alas, in reſpect of himſelf, he was of no reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Under what reproach, contempt and ſcorn did he live? So that all might eaſily ſee, it was not his own glory he looked at, but the glory of the Father. And this alſo is an excellent Preſident for humility, and modeſty, and ſelf-denial. The Apoſtles alſo when they did work wonders, ſo as the people were ready to make Gods of them, They rend their cloaths, becauſe of ſuch blaſphemy, and ſay, <hi>It is not they, but Chriſt who inabled them to do theſe things,</hi> Act. 14.11. Yes how ready are we to ſay, theſe are our parts, our gifts?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That Chriſt is wholly Gods, appeareth, <hi>In that obediential reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf to do Gods will. Let I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> And he would be <hi>baptized,</hi> becauſe hereby he would <hi>fulfill all righteouſneſſe.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> Inſomuch that Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to become under the Law.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 6.38. <hi>I came down from Heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> Therefore <hi>John</hi> 18.18. Gods will laid upon him to die for his people, he cals it a <hi>Commandment.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 12.49. <hi>He gave me a Commandment.</hi> So that we ſee the duty of a Mediatour to do and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer what was required of us, was laid on Chriſt by <hi>Commandment,</hi> and it was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly <hi>Obedience,</hi> that which he did in fulfilling of it.</p>
                     <p>Now in all this truth, there are theſe things admirable:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The love of God, and the love of Chriſt. God ſo loved the world. So</hi>] The Apoſtle could not give an <hi>How,</hi> it was ſuch a <hi>So,</hi> that could not be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. When <hi>Abraham</hi> offered his only ſonne for a Sacrifice, God ſaid, <hi>Now I know thou loveſt me.</hi> How much rather, when we ſee Chriſt dying and ſuffering all thoſe agonies and miſeries for us may we ſay, now we know God loveth us? Shall the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſo admire Gods love, in giving man the beaſts of the field, that he crieth out, <hi>What is man that thou art ſo mindfull of him?</hi> Pſal. 8.4. How much rather may man ſtand aſtoniſhed at this love of God in giving Chriſt? Well may God be ſaid to be love it ſelf, for he is the fountain of all this honey. Who may, if repenting, though a Blackmoor ſinner, doubt of Gods love in pardoning, when he hath done the greater? Which is greater to give a Chriſt, or to pardon ſinne? And then, <hi>The love of Chriſt</hi> is no leſſe admirable, for him to give his life for us ſinners and enemies: herein he did <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſet forth his love in a moſt exemplary manner. <hi>Jonathans</hi> love to <hi>David</hi> is much commended, but what is that ſpark to this flame? Oh how can the poor doubting and unbelieving ſinner queſtion forgiveneſſe, doubt whether Chriſt will accept of him, or no, when he ſeeth Chriſt do ſo much for him already! Fear not the worſt of death, and hell is over.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>In this admire the ſelf-denial of Chriſt, that he layeth aſide the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and manifeſtation of all that divine glory he had, and became contemptible, of no reputation for us.</hi> The Apoſtle aggravateth this, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>When it was no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> yet he became ſuch a worm, and no man for us. This is ſo great a myſtery, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts condeſcenſion for our good, that the Angels, though he be not their Mediator, though he took not their Nature on him, yet <hi>they deſire to look,</hi> (1 Pet. 1.12.) and ſearch into this truth, as being raviſhed with it. Oh what an example is here for us of ſelf-denial and preparedneſſe to part with all at his command!</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>In this it's admirable, The humble and ready obedience of Chriſt.</hi> Doth Chriſt any way gain-ſay this commandment of God? Doth he murmur at it? Doth he begin to repent of his undertaking? No, but in all things giveth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:101245:166"/>
to be a willing Sacrifice, he bids the Law in its curſes, and the wrath of God in all the effects fall upon him. As <hi>Saul</hi> runne his Spear at <hi>David,</hi> but miſſing him, it ſtuck in the wall. Thus the anger and wrath of God emptying it ſelf vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, miſſeth us, and fals on Chriſt. What a willing expreſſion is that, <hi>Loe, I, come to do thy will, O God!</hi> Heb. 10.9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Is Chriſt thus Gods? Then we ſee, that the Mediatory Kingdome of Chriſt is for a further end, it is that at laſt God may be all in all. Not but that Chriſt ſhall alwayes remain God and man, and all glory ſhall be given to Chriſt, who hath brought us into Heaven; but this actual adminiſtration ſhall then ceaſe. The damned in Hell can no more plead Chriſt; they cannot urge his death any more; for now that gracious diſpenſation is ceaſed; there is no more oil, no more water to refreſh. It's now as deſperate, as if there never had been a Chriſt; thy eſtate and the Devils is now both alike. Oh then, let wicked men that need Chriſt, awaken and look about them, while a Chriſt may be had, while a Chriſt is ready to do good; the time will be when he ſhall not actually as a Prieſt, or Prophet, or King, diſpenſe ſuch mercies any more.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Is Chriſt thus wholly Gods? Then what ſelf-denial, what humility and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty ſhould we learn hence? Shall Chriſt not ſeek his own glory? Shall not he ſeek to pleaſe himſelf? Shall not he exalt his own will? Why then are we ſo apt to magnifie our ſelf-glory, our own will, our own advantage? It ſhould ſhame us to follow ſuch a Chriſt, to be called by the name of this Chriſt; How ill do ſuch an Head, and ſuch members agree together? Think of Chriſt, when pride, vain-glory, ſelf-will, ſtirreth in thee: If Chriſt had been thus, there had been no pardon, no ſalvation for me.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Pſalms are noted to have this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Excellency in them, that they are the experimental breathings of a gracious heart, exerciſed under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious temptations; ſo that what is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally, and in the <hi>Idea</hi> delivered in other places of the Scripture, is here practically, and <hi>in Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> viſibly expreſſed: ſo that none can underſtand them, unleſs he bring the ſame ſpirit with him, that breathed in <hi>David,</hi> while he compoſed them. This is <hi>Davids</hi> ſpiritual Harp, driving away all the evil and malignant affections, that may at any times riſe up in us. That Poetical one of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> though ſaid to tame Beasts, is not comparable to this. Now <hi>as face anſwereth face,</hi> ſo doth the heart of a godly man anſwer <hi>Davids</hi> in his reſpective agonies of his ſoul; when grace worketh, when corruption work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he doth obſerve by the like tranſactions in his own ſoul. Among other particulars, I have ſelected this <hi>4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalm</hi> in the three laſt verſes to diſcourſe upon, becauſe therein is declared, what is the choice of a natural man, what is his <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> and what of a godly man, wherein I am more large; ſo

that an heavenly heart, and the enjoyment of the light of Gods countenance is chiefly the Subject of this Treatiſe; ſublime and high matter comparatively to our dull, lumpiſh and heavy hearts. For this end doth God many times exerciſe his people with ſad temptations, that they may experimentally ſay, <hi>Gods loving kindneſs is better than life.</hi> For <hi>Job</hi> and many others have lived, yet deſired <hi>death.</hi> The damned in Hell live, yet annihilation would be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to them. So that he only liveth, who enjoyeth the favour of God. As for the greatest worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they are but like the fancies of diſtracted men. So that as ſome who have perſwaded themſelves in ſuch pleaſing delights, and apprehending themſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of ſuch great revenews, when cured of this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium</hi> by Phyſicians, have been diſpleaſed thereat, ſaying, they never enjoyed a better time, then under thoſe deluded imaginations. Such a folly and dream doth poſſeſſe all natural men, while deſtitute of the light of Gods countenance, they are unwilling to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened out of this dream, and to be cured of this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But with <hi>David,</hi> we call upon thee, <hi>to taſte and ſee how good God is,</hi> and then thou wilt cry out with <hi>Auſtin, Sero te amavi Domine,</hi> even mourn, becauſe thou waſt not acquainted with him any ſooner.

                     <p>Now the Pſalmiſt, having given this ſpiritual counſell, he informeth us of <hi>two different dispoſitions,</hi> or two ſorts of men: For although there be various Interpretations and conjectures about the place, yet I pitch on that as moſt genuine.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, <hi>The Natural and Carnal diſpoſition which is in the ſpirit of every unregenerate man; Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> They diſpiſe the counſell given; they think that theſe religious duties, are for no good at all; therefore they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt their <hi>deſires</hi> after ſome terrene and worldly happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>There is the Charectar of a gracious and regenerate man; Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</hi> Thus this text, like <hi>Rebecca</hi>'s Womb, hath a prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> who eſteemed a morſell of meat above his Birthright, and a holy <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtriving within it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt, wherein you have repreſented, <hi>What is the heart-wiſh, and ſouls deſire of every man, till ſanctified</hi>; even to go no higher, then to have happineſſe in the enjoyment of ſome creature, and not God himſelf. So that in the former part, you may obſerve,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>number</hi> of thoſe who have this diſtempered palate, <hi>many</hi>; even every man, till by Regeneration, he is enabled to <hi>ſet his affections on things above.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Their ardent affection, They ſay</hi>; that is, both internally, in their affections and deſires, as the fool ſaid, <hi>There is no God</hi>; and alſo with the tongue exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, manifeſting this corrupt heart within.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is the <hi>object</hi> which their whole <hi>heart</hi> is carried out unto, <hi>To ſhew us any good</hi>; that is, any good or content of the creature: For, it's ſpoken op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitely to God, as appeareth by the words following. They do, as it were, deſire the Devils offer, which he made to Chriſt, <hi>That the glory of the world might be ſhewed them</hi>; and they will worſhip the Devil, and commit any ſinne, that they might enjoy it.

As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.3. <hi>Thou haſt ſhewed thy people hard things</hi>: which was the making of them to drink the Wine of aſtoniſhment. Even as to ſee Heaven, to ſee death, is to partake of them.

                        <p>To bring this coal of fire into your boſome, let us conſider ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                        <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The general <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>godly</hi> and the <hi>wicked.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>That herein lyeth the general Character of thoſe two Citizens which</hi> Auſtin <hi>ſpeaks of, one who builds up</hi> Babylon, <hi>and the other who builds up</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. That the one doth <hi>frui utendis,</hi> and <hi>uti fruendis,</hi> but the other is clean contrary. The whole world conſiſts of two ſorts of men, the one who are <hi>of</hi> the world, the other, though in the world, yet not of it. As <hi>John</hi> 17. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ſaid to be <hi>given</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>out</hi> of the world. As a man may be in <hi>England,</hi> who is not yet an Engliſh-man; he cannot ſpeak the language, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conform to the cuſtom and manners of the Nation. Thus it is here; the godly, they are indeed in the world, and are of it alſo in reſpect of natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, but not by divine Regeneration. As the Fowles, though at firſt God created them out of the waters, yet they fly up into the Heavens, and delight to be ſoaring in the air. Thus it is with the Regenerate man; he is now made a new creature, <hi>old things are paſt away,</hi> and his <hi>affections are ſet upon things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi>: This earth is turned into fire. But the wicked man, he like our body of the earth, is earthly; even his very ſoul is in a ſpiritual ſenſe ſo, and their love to the creature, is the predominant quality, and ſo like a ſtone he falls into this center. Now <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old, did fully expreſſe the contrary inclination of theſe two: That the wicked man doth <hi>frui utendis</hi>; that is, he doth enjoy as his utmoſt end, and terminateth his appetite in ſuch things as his utmoſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, which only he is to uſe as meanes to a further end. As if the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſhould have made the Wilderneſſe inſtead of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to him. This is the crooked and perverſe inclination of the ſoul, wholly contrary to that Image of God, which man was made in. So that the very Heathens could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that though God made man with a countenance <hi>caelumque tueri,</hi> yet they cried out, <hi>O curvae in terris animae &amp; caeleſtium inanes</hi>: The body is upright, but the ſoul is bowed down, like the bodies of beaſts, like wormes and Serpents that crawle on the ground. And therefore the wicked are the Serpents ſeed, not only becauſe of enmity to the godly, but becauſe they lick up, and live upon the duſt of the earth, even upon earthly things. Every wicked man, he makes ſome creature or other to be as a God, and ſo the ultimate end to him.</p>
                        <p>To clear the hainouſneſſe of this wretched temper, conſider</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>That all the good things, which the creatures do afford unto us,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">All good the creature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, ſhould lead us to God the univerſal good.</note> 
                           <hi>they are but as meanes to carry us to a further end.</hi> They are but as the rounds of the Ladder, not to ſtand upon, but thereby to aſcend higher, even to Heaven. So that as the world is a Glaſſe, to repreſent the inviſible Attributes of God, his Wiſdome, Goodneſſe, and Power; thus all the comforts we can have by any creature, they are to be as ſo many <hi>mement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>es</hi> that there is a better and more univerſal good, and that we have the creatures to uſe only, not to enjoy. Thus the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>They that buy, as if they bought not; they that uſe the world, as not abuſing it.</hi> Some expound <hi>abuti,</hi> as it is ſometimes taken for <hi>valdo uti</hi>: but howoſoever, he abuſeth it, that doth not uſe it, as if he <hi>uſed it not,</hi> with an holy weaned affection from it. Hence then, to enjoy any creature, ſetting it in Gods room, in the heart, is a direct breach of that firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods beſides me.</hi> And for this reaſon, <hi>covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> is called <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Col. 3 5. Inſomuch, that every natural man, hath one thing or other, on which he commits Idolatry, and therefore doth as highly offend God, as he that worſhips ſtocks and ſtones, giving divine adoration to them. The Scripture cals that, <hi>The abominable thing.</hi> Thus it is, when the heart of a man is faſtned upon any creature, as the ultimate ſcope and end of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101245:171"/>
his deſires; we may ſay to him, Oh do not this <hi>abominable</hi> thing! Yea, this Idolatry is more dangerous, by how much it is the more ſecret and hidden in the heart. And as the Papiſts have invented a world of ſubtile diſtinctions to make their Idolatry lawfull, no leſſe ſubtile is the heart of man in this ſoul I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Take notice that there is an higher and groſſer ſort of unregenerate men, then happily this expreſſion will comprehend, and that is thoſe, who make ſuch things as are formally and expreſsly evil, the good things they would have ſhewed to them.</hi> Such are all groſſe and prophane ſinners, who live in the daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſome loathſome ſinne: Theſe are a degree higher in wickedneſſe then thoſe in my text, (though they may be reduced to them;) for here the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of ſuch things as are lawfull and good in themſelves. Honours, Wealth, humane greatneſſe, comfortable Relations, theſe are good things in themſelves; and to ſay, Who will ſhew us them? in a mortifyed and ſubordinate manner to God, had been no ſin: But when they come in competition with Gods favour, they had rather have them then Gods <hi>light of his countenance,</hi> this demonſtrateth impiety. But as for the prophane man, his appetite is more corrupted, for he cals evil things good; he loveth thoſe things exceſſively, which he is not to love at all. The other loveth Honey, but he eateth too much of it, and that kils him; this eateth Poyſon, and feedeth of that, one drop whereof is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately mortal. But to theſe, I ſhall not enlarge my ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Conſider this, <hi>That the Schoolmen do well place in every ſinne, a a two-fold reſpect</hi>; There is the <hi>Averſion</hi> from God, and the <hi>Converſion</hi> to the creature. For ſeeing the ſoul cannot like the earth, hang upon nothing, but it muſt have ſome Object or other to ſatiate it ſelf with, if it hath not God, it hath the creature: Now, as ſoon as ever it turneth to the creature, it turneth its back upon God. I ſpeak of the ſinfulneſſe of man in this reſpect, that he turneth to the creature too much, leaving God. Now as there is this in our corruption, ſo in our Converſion or Regeneration, there is the clean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; there is averſion from the creature, and converſion to God, It doth not only make a man caſt away his ſinnes, but alſo all creatures, ſo farre as they hinder the love of God; <hi>for now they are riſen with Chriſt.</hi> And as if a worm ſhould be made a man, it would no more crawle and creep on the ground; thus when a divine Nature, or a Nature from above, is beſtowed upon us. Not only love to ſinne, but love to Father, Mother, or life it ſelf, is inconſiſtent with the grace of God in our hearts, when it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">All naturally deſire felicity.</note>Fifthly, <hi>It is acknowledged by all, that there is imbred in a man, an appetite or deſire after felicity and happineſſe.</hi> This <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and others, do abundantly confirm. Man by nature, hath ſuch a capacious heart, and the ſouls appetite is ſo vaſt, that it's more then the <hi>Horſeleech,</hi> or the <hi>Grave,</hi> that ſayeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, <hi>Give.</hi> The ſoul hath a <hi>Sheoll,</hi> that is alwaies asking, and never ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed. Now then, if there were a good regulated deſire after this <hi>ultimate good,</hi> where and in whom it was, this were to be encouraged. If the meaning of theſe in my text, had been, Who will ſhew us that which is indeed the chiefeſt and moſt reall good? they might have been encouraged, like thoſe that asked <hi>what they ſhould do to be ſaved.</hi> But though there be in the generall, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſuch a bleſſedneſſe, yet wofull and dreadfull is the miſapprehenſion and blindneſſe of all men naturally about it; ſo that miſtaking the main end for which they came into the world, it's no wonder if at laſt they fall into the pit irrecoverably. There were above an hundred Opinions amongſt the Heathens, in <hi>what</hi> true <hi>Felicity</hi> did conſiſt; but though ſome were not ſo groſſe as others, yet all come ſhort of the true end: <hi>That knowing of the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, in the knowledg of whom is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101245:171"/>
life.</hi> Neither are many Chriſtians much better then the Heathens in this reſpect: for although they know that God is the <hi>chiefeſt good, in the enjoying of whom, through Chriſt, is only bleſſedneſſe</hi>; yet practically, in reſpect of their hearts and lives, ſome place their happineſſe in <hi>Riches,</hi> ſome in <hi>Honours,</hi> and ſome in <hi>Pleaſures</hi>; and theſe to whom <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks here, that did love <hi>vanity,</hi> that cryed out for <hi>earthly comforts:</hi> they were not Heathens deſtitute of the knowledge of the true God, but ſuch who lived in the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; only they were deſtitute of the <hi>ſanctifying power of God within.</hi> There is then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in all men, ſome innate appetite, whereby they would have a full and chief good, which might compleatly ſatiate and fill the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>The perſwaſion of what is the beſt good,</hi>

                           <hi>and which is chiefly to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is wounderfully diverſifyed, according to the ſeveral inclinations, humours, and conditions of men.</hi> So that ſome place it in one thing, and ſome in another: One ſaith, Give me this good, there is none like that; Another ſaith, Give me that good, there is none like that. So that theſe many in the text, do not all deſire the ſame; yea, one matters not that, which another would go through fire and water to obtain. The <hi>voluptuous</hi> man, he doth not matter wealth or riches, let him enjoy his pleaſures, and he envyeth no rich worldling; the <hi>earthly worldly</hi> man, he matters not honour and credit, let him get riches, and he regards not a good Name. <hi>Populus me ſibilat, at mhi plaudo.</hi> The Apoſtle is thought to bring all that an earthly heart can deſire, into theſe three heads, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15, 16 17. For ſpeaking there terribly againſt the diſpoſition of theſe in my text, that <hi>they ſhould not love the world,</hi> he brings an Argument from the contraries, <hi>The love of the Father cannot be in ſuch an one</hi>; They can be no more together, then <hi>Dagon</hi> and the <hi>Ark</hi>: The hand filled with <hi>dirt</hi> and <hi>ſtones,</hi> cannot at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> be filled with <hi>precious Pearles: He that is joyned to the Lord, is one spirit with him</hi>; and he that is joyned to the <hi>earth,</hi> is made <hi>earth</hi> with it. <hi>Si terram amas terra es,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And hereupon the Apoſtle giveth ſome examples and inſtances of the things of this world, that are like <hi>Jaels</hi> milk to <hi>Siſera,</hi> fairly inticing, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mortally wounding: and although ſome think there is not an exact and full partition, yet others do judge ſo. And by the <hi>luſt of the fleſh,</hi> they underſtand, all pleaſures and delights; by the <hi>lust of the eye,</hi> all earthly and covetous deſires, as <hi>Achan</hi> ſaw the <hi>Babyloniſh garment,</hi> and <hi>wedge</hi> of <hi>gold,</hi> which made him ſinfully covet it; and the <hi>pride of life,</hi> that is, all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all proud and high deſires after the great things of this world.</p>

                        <p>This is the worlds <hi>Trinity,</hi> and there is no man inordinately addicted to any creature comfort, but it may be comprehended under one of theſe three heads. Now when the Apoſtle had given us an Inſtance of theſe things, he giveth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument againſt immoderacy after them; <hi>This world paſſeth away.</hi> They will <hi>rot</hi> in the <hi>grave,</hi> when holineſſe will <hi>abide for ever.</hi>

                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>That the preferring of the creature above God, though it be the ſinne of all man-kind, and as large as Original ſinne it ſelf, yet like that,</hi>

                           <hi>it is hardly diſcerned and diſcovered.</hi> It's almoſt unperceivable, unleſſe we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by Gods Spirit, when we ſet up the creature above him. It's true, there is a groſſe manifeſt and palpable way, which is ſeen in every covetous and ambitious, or luſtfull man: theſe do ſo plainly make either their belly their god, or their gold their god, or their preferment their god, that all men can eaſily condemn them for it; becauſe what is in their heart, empties it ſelf into foul and ſhamefull practiſes. But then there is the <hi>mentall,</hi> and ſoul deifying of the creatures, when the heart is ſecretly ſtolen away, and doth inſenſibly depend on, or exceſſively love ſuch a thing; and this is hardly to be diſcerned.

No doubt, but the <hi>third kind of hearers,</hi> and ſo <hi>Demas,</hi> were farre from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they loved the world more then God. So that as the nature and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ſoul are in their <hi>Phyſical</hi> conſideration little known, much leſſe in their <hi>Theological.</hi> Now although the tendencies of the ſoul may be various and multiforme, ſome to one Object, ſome to another, yet <hi>ſelf</hi> is that great <hi>Diana, ſelf</hi> is the <hi>Belzebub</hi>; all things in Religion, even God himſelf, is referred to <hi>ſelf,</hi> till a man be ſanctified. So that the heart being herein thus deſperately deceitfull, we are often and <hi>often to commune with our own ſelves,</hi> whether <hi>ſelf</hi> be renounced, whether <hi>ſelf</hi> be ſubordinated to God; whether we can ſay as <hi>Mephibaſheth</hi> to <hi>David, Let Ziba take all, ſo that the King be ſafe.</hi> Thus let honours, creatures, ſelf and all periſh, ſo that God and Chriſt be exalted.

God made man after his Image,</hi> which was <hi>righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe</hi>: ſo that as he made a woman like man, for man to delight in, ſo man was made like God, to delight in him. Then <hi>Adam</hi> deſired no other good but God: While he continued, he was above the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in his affection, as well as in dominion. He that had power given him to rule over all creatures, could alſo rule over all his affections. He did not over-love any creature, or delight in it, but ſubordinately to God. Oh glorious and bleſſed eſtate! But now we have loſt all this; this Image is defaced: Now <hi>Sampſon</hi> hath loſt his hair: Now the Bird is deprived of her wings: Now we are not able to lift up our hearts to him. Hence is that expreſſion of <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.6. <hi>His heart was lift up in the waies of the Lord.</hi> You ſee even a regenerate man, hath much adoe to raiſe up his dull, frozen, and earthly heart, to enjoy God in Chriſt. He doth, like the Artificer, that with ſome Engine, and great drawing, gets a peice of timber up to the top of that Houſe he is a building, ſuch heaving, and pulling, and tugging, is a godly man forced to uſe, to get his heart up to God. An unregenerate man then, who hath nothing of this Image of God repaired in him, no wonder if he hath an heart like <hi>Nabal</hi>'s, even a very ſtone, that ſinketh down heavily within him. This loſſe of Gods Image, is that which beateth downward, and makes the earth to ſwallow us up, as it did <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> As the body depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the ſoul, preſently falls flat to the ground, and there it lyeth; thus doth every man deſtitute of Gods Image.</p>

Now this native pollution, that is a depravation of the whole power, and all the faculties of the ſoul, puts the ſoul off its hinges; it takes off the Charriot Wheeles: It makes man love, where he ſhould hate; reſt where he ſhould move: It makes <hi>Princes go on foot, and Servants ride.</hi> In a word, the ſoul is now turned upſide down.

So that who ſo doth duely conſider, what diſorder and confuſſion Original ſinne hath put the heart into, he will ſee it cannot be, that God ſhould be duely honoured and eſteemed by a natural man.

I then, the godly man can ſo hardly ſay, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and in earth, in compariſon of thee?</hi> no wonder if the earthly man fall down to the ground, as the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> like a ſtone into the Sea?

Take <hi>Judas,</hi> a famous Apoſtle, eminent in Gifts and Miracles, often in communion with Chriſt, yet he never got his heart above the bagge; all the Sermons, all the Prayers, all the conference with Chriſt, did not make him aſcend higher. So that a mans duties and expreſſions may be high, even when his heart is as low as the earth; yea, when corrupt ends may put a man upon zeal and fervency: It's a creature that gives fire to all this heat. Thus the <hi>third kind of hearers,</hi> that <hi>received the word with joy,</hi> it was the deceivableneſſe of the creature that undid them. <hi>Demas</hi> cleaveth to the preſent world, and that makes him forſake <hi>Paul,</hi> either totally, or in ſome ſpecial ſervice. If then, an immoderate heart to the creatures, may conſiſt with duties, gifts, and many inlargements, and much aſiſtance in holy duties; if theſe are not able to caſt out theſe <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> no wonder the natural man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The point is proved from the nature of Converſion.</note>Fifthly, <hi>That a natural man cannot ſet his heart higher then upon ſome creature, appeareth in the true nature of Converſion</hi>: For that is not only turning from ſinne but the creature alſo. Exceſſive love to lawfull things; otherwiſe, is no more conſiſtent with grace, then to unlawfull things: For, if any thing have thy heart but God, let it be what it will be, thou art yet a natural man When the Apoſtle (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.) diſcovered that the <hi>godly are riſen with Chriſt</hi>

No man then, is converted, till he goeth out of all ſinnes, yea, and all creatures; and cleaveth to God himſelf. Therefore the Command is, to <hi>turn to God, even to God</hi>; he only is the <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> of our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. If a man leave off his groſſe ſinnes, take upon him a religious Profeſſion; yet if he be not lifted above the world, as well as his former ſinnes, he is not Converted. It's not to God, even to God. So that a man muſt be undone, not only in reſpect of his ſinne, but all worldly hopes; he muſt with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall, begin to account the whole world but an husk; as that which will do him no good, if God be not his Father. Therefore thoſe in the Parable, though invited to the Feaſt, yet refuſed to <hi>come,</hi> it was not any groſſe ſinne hindred them, it was not unlawfull luſts that did outwardly entangle them, but thoſe creatures which might have been lawfully enjoyed, and yet they have gone to the Feaſt alſo. <hi>I have bought a Farm; I have married a Wife:</hi> Theſe were not inconſiſtent with godlineſſe, but in the immoderate deſire after them. Oh, is not this the Millſtone about many a mans neck; I have a Shop, I have a Trade, and I cannot come! Oh then, ſet this home upon thy ſelf! Hath thy Converſion taken thee off from all creatures, as well as thy ſinnes, thou dareſt not love Husband, Wife Houſes, or life it ſelf more then God? Thou doeſt eſteem the <hi>favour</hi> of God, and the <hi>light of his countenance,</hi> above all theſe things: Thou canſt truly ſay with <hi>David,</hi> as it followeth, <hi>Thou haſt put more gladneſſe in my heart, then they have had when their beſt things encreaſed.</hi> Many a man ſteppeth from his ſinnes, but into the world, and ſo falls ſhort of Heaven. The right underſtanding of true Converſion, makes it plain, that no natural man can go beyond the creature.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">And from the reſtleſſe and unquiet heart of every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man.</note>Sixthly, <hi>It may be demonſtrated from the reſtleſſe and unquiet heart of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man,</hi> that doth like the <hi>Bee,</hi> fly from flower to flower to get ſome Honey, but ſtayeth not long on one place. So that theſe in the text, will every day complain, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good</hi>? Should God grant them their deſire, and give them the good they would have, yet that would not ſatifie, ſtill they would be craving; ſtill they deſire ſomething more. As you ſee <hi>Haman,</hi> though he had never ſo much honour, yet the want of ſomething ſtill he deſired, made him tormented within himſelf. <hi>Solomon</hi> writeth an whole Book, to ſhew that all theſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101245:174"/>
things are <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit</hi>; and though he ſet himſelf <hi>on purpoſe</hi> to <hi>find</hi> out <hi>happineſſe</hi> in the <hi>creatures,</hi> yet he grew <hi>weary of all.</hi> Now certainly, if a natural man could center his heart upon God, could put into that Haven, he would never ſuffer himſelf to be toſſed up and down in tempeſts and ſtormes, as he is, never having any reſt. There is no natural man that is contented with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature he enjoyeth. Let him propound to himſelf ſuch and ſuch a condition, if he had ſuch and ſuch advantages; when he hath them, he is as far from ſolid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment as at firſt. <hi>Zacheus</hi> his ſhooe can never fit <hi>Goliah</hi>'s foot. As a man would think that the Heavens ſeem to touch the earth at ſuch a diſtance, and if he ſhould aſcend ſuch high mountains, he could go no further, but when he cometh there, he ſeeth the Heavens as far from him as before. And therefore the godly man, whoſe heart is united, and hath taken God for his <hi>Portion,</hi> for his <hi>Shepherd,</hi> for his <hi>all,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth, he can <hi>lie down and ſleep</hi>; he can <hi>take his reſt, fearing nothing in the world.</hi> So that godlineſſe drawing the heart to God, is the beſt Antidote againſt all diſcontents whatſoever. He that can ſay, God is better then ten Husbands, then ten thouſand creatures, he is not diſquieted, but is the ſame in all conditions; becauſe his <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Father,</hi> his <hi>Portion</hi> is alwaies the ſame. As he in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtiory, when one brought him word, his <hi>Father was dead,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Deſine blaſphemias loqui, Pater enim meus immortalis eſt.</hi> So thy Husband, thy Wealth, thy Friend, thy Portion, is the <hi>immor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He is like a <hi>tree in the wilderneſſe,</hi> and like the <hi>duſt blown with every wind.</hi> So that the troubleſome, reſtleſſe, and diſcontented thoughts of every natural man, argueth that he doth not, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſcend up to God.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>It's demonſtrated thus, that if at any time natural men make their applications to God, thoſe very approaches do declare,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Their very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to God, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that they prefer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before him.</note> 
                           <hi>that they love ſomething more then God.</hi> For it might be an Objection, <hi>Why cannot a natural man be above the creature? Do they not in diſtreſſes, in times of calamity, ſeek unto God? May they not faſt and humble themſelves</hi>? It's granted; but even theſe duties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, they have only a natural carnal heart, making uſe of God only to ſatisfie their earthly deſires. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. God there by the Prophet complaineth, that they did not <hi>cry unto him, when they howled on their beds: They aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their corn and wine.</hi> You ſee, they were as carnal and as earthly in their Faſt-daies, and publique Humiliations, as in their worldly affairs; and therefore he compareth their <hi>cryes</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> to the <hi>howling</hi> of Beaſts, that want food, and are ready to famiſh. Such are like <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Raven,</hi> that came to <hi>Noah</hi> only while ſhe wanted food, but when ſhe had proviſion, never came to him more. Thus natural men, they approach to God, but it's wholly becauſe their hearts are inordinately ſet upon the creature; it's not becauſe they delight in him.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, This is evident, <hi>In that no natural man can truly deſire the coming of Chriſt, and the putting of an end to the faſhion of this world</hi>: Whereas this is made the <hi>Character</hi> of the godly, <hi>to look for, and to haſten the Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> The Church cryeth, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> They have enough of the world. It's to their loſſe to be kept ſo long from Heaven. As the godly Patriarchs count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves Pilgrims, and did look for a better Countrey. This is, or ought to be the frame of every godly man. But now the natural man can no more reach this heavenly frame, and deſire <hi>that Kingdom of Glory might come,</hi> then he can touch the bodily Heavens with his finger. Hence the going out of this world, that they ſhall not enjoy the comforts and creatures they have had, is the greateſt fear they are daily in bondage unto. It's true, a godly man hath a great part of this unwillingneſſe in him alſo; but that ariſeth, partly from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fear of death, or ſpiritual doubts about his condition; or becauſe earthly things are yet ſo much in heart: but he deſireth to have it otherwaies.</p>

As it's with Land-floods in Winter-time, then they come, when there is water enough, and none needeth them; but when in Summer, the greateſt drought is, and there is moſt neceſſity, then they appear not. Thus every creature ſeemeth comfortable and helpfull, when we are in our glad and merry condition; but in thoſe times, when, if ever, they ſhould be a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to us, then they utterly forſake us.</p>
                        <p>Now we may take notice of <hi>three choice times wherein (if ever) the ſoul may be in the greateſt neceſſity.</hi> As</p>
                        <p>Firſt, At ſuch times, <hi>when God ſhall ſet home the guilt of ſinne upon our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and make us to find the ſting of it at our very hearts. In ſuch agonies, and ſoul bitterneſſe, bring him all the glory, profit, and pleaſure, of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſquezed together; bring the quinteſſence of them, and they will do no good. Oh, now the ſenſe of Gods wrath, the ſcorching guilt within, cannot be allayed by ſuch applications! Whereas one ſmile of Gods favour, would preſently command all the waves to be ſtill. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. <hi>When thou with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes doth chaſten man for ſinne; thou makeſt his beauty</hi> (or that which is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in him) <hi>to conſume like a moth.</hi> Oh what a change is then made!

                        <p>Secondly, Another great ſtreight thou wilt be put upon, is <hi>the time and hour of Death.</hi> For then (if ever) as we are in the greateſt want, ſo the creature we have loved, ſhould moſt appear for us; but the Scripture tels us, <hi>We came naked into the world, and we ſhall carry out nothing with us.</hi> There is not any creature thou haſt inordidately deſired, that can accompany thee any longer: All muſt leave thee. Now what a ſad condition is this, to be ſtript naked of all? The good things thou haſt embraced, cannot be enjoyed any longer. Oh what would the ſoul now give for the <hi>light of Gods favour!</hi> Now a world for ſome evidence of his love: Now he cryeth out, as that Cardinall once did, <hi>If he had pleaſed God as the King, or if loved God as the creature, he had not been in that deſolate eſtate.</hi> So that it's not to be mattered, what content and comfort thou findeſt in the creature, while thou art in health and mirth, but when thou art breathing the laſt, when thou ſhalt ſee the face of creatures no more: Oh then, think how much better had it been, if I had ſpent my time and ſtrength for God, which I did for the creature!</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Another great time of exigency is, <hi>When we ſhall be arraigned at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101245:175"/>
the Tribunall of God,</hi> to be judged by him for every evil and wicked way. This is a time of the greateſt terror and horror. Then Chriſt as a Judge is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy eye: Then the Devils thy Accuſers are all ſtanding by: Then the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell are before thee, and that burning Lake of Brimeſtone, in which thou art ready to be caſt. Oh, now which of all the creatures thou truſtedeſt in, can give thee any help! Call now to any of thoſe that were thy props, and ſee wat good they can do to thee. Where is <hi>Dives</hi> his great wealth, that could not help him to a drop of water? Oh, at ſuch a dreadfull time, would not the <hi>loving favour of God,</hi> be more then all the world to thee! Then if God ſhould ſay, <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> would not this be more comfort then ever thou hadſt all thy life? And if on the other ſide, God ſhall ſay, <hi>Depart ye curſed,</hi> can any thing withſtand it? Can any creature ſay, Lord, he ſhall not go, I will ſave him; I'le deliver him? Theſe things then being thus, that there are ſuch times, when all the creatures of the world are not able to quench the fire that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume thee; what folly and wickedneſſe is it to mind that which will then deceive thee, and not to regard the ſavour of God, which will then be moſt precious and ready to help in this day of adverſity, that will moſt be ſeen?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed of immoderacy to the creature,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Immoderate love of the creature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the love of God.</note> 
                           <hi>for the immoderate love of that is not conſiſtent with the love of God.</hi> Thou maieſt ſpeak much, and profeſſe much to the contrary, but the inordinate love of the creature cannot ſtand with the love of God; yea, it's <hi>emnity to God.</hi> Doth not God require, we ſhould <hi>love him with all our might, all our ſtrength</hi>? So that he will not allow any love to any thing elſe but him. Indeed, <hi>when we deſire any creature in ſubordination to him, as a meanes of glorifying him, and thereby brought nearer to God</hi>; this is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt God. The Schoolmen ſay, <hi>That it's the ſame gracious habit of love, that carrieth us out to love God, and our neighbour becauſe of him</hi>; and ſo it is of every creature elſe. As we ſay, ſuch a great Houſe, is ſuch a mans: Now, though he have many ſervants dwelling there, yet we ſay, it's his Houſe, not the Servants, becauſe they are for and under him. Thus if God do chiefly dwell in our hearts, then (though we love other things, yet becauſe this is wholly in reference to God) we may truly ſay, We love none but him. But now, when the love of the creature oppoſeth God, makes us contrary to him, or makes us love him or holy duties the leſſe, then we are to conclude, That this cannot ſtand with godlineſſe. So that not only groſſe ſinnes practiſed, but any creature habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and exceſſively delighted in above God, is alſo incompatible with it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Take heed of this eſtate, becauſe it's a wofull ſnare and temptation to thee.</hi> He that is inordinately affected with any earthly comfort,<note place="margin">Is's a wofull ſnare and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</note> this will upon all occaſions, bring him into the fouleſt ſinnes that can be imagined. He will do any thing; damn his ſoul over and over, to obtain it: As <hi>Judas,</hi> becauſe he was immoderately ſet upon gain, he betrayeth Chriſt; though he was admoniſhed of it, though he was told in particular he was the man: Though heard what a fearfull condition ſuch a man was in, that ſhould betray Chriſt, yet nothing can ſtop him, but he will ſatisfie that corrupt appetite of his. Oh then, take heed again and again, of ſuch an inordinrate appetite! It will be thy poyſon and damnation: It will one time or other put thee upon ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rrible actions, as will make the hearts of others to tremble, when they hear it; yea, ſuch as thou wilt abhor, before they are committed. As it was in <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael, Am I dog</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I ſhould do ſo</hi>? And truly, it is very ſad, when God, by his Providence, ſhall ſuffer ſuch advantages for thy luſt to fall out; us <hi>Judas</hi> had a <hi>bagge, Hazael</hi> a <hi>Kingdom</hi>; all which were like ſpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the heart ſpiritually alſo conſidered, is the chief fountain of all our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and miſery. Therefore it's ſure deſtruction, to let thy heart runne out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creature; that is, to make the chiefeſt of thy ſoul ſubordinate to that which is farre inferiour.

                           <hi>have at laſt, found the vanity and unprofitableneſſe of it.</hi> They have been wearied, and glutted with it. As he ſaid to that Tyrant, <hi>Satia te ſanguine, quem ſitiiſti,</hi> He gave him blood enough at laſt. So commonly, God in anger doth give thee abundance of ſuch things as thou deſireſt, but they are for thy hurt. Thou deſireſt them as the hydropical man water, or as the feavouriſh man Wine; which things, if they obtain, their diſeaſe is the more encreaſed, and they become the more dangerous. The wiſe man obſerveth it of riches, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> Chap. 5.13. he calls it a <hi>ſore evil; That riches are kept for the owners thereof, to their hurt.</hi> Now then, is not this very dangerous to thee, to place thy heart upon that which will be poyſon and bane to thee? This is true of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, preferments; any creature, if exceſſively deſired, will do a man hurt: It's like ſurfetting upon Honey. And this is the reaſon why God keepeth his own children in ſo many ſtreights and difficulties; he doth not give them the things they deſire: Yea, commonly God doth croſſe them in all their earthly affections and undertakings: ſo that they cannot have thoſe mercies they would have. And the Lord is herein very mercifull to them; for that which is inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſired, would be alſo immoderately poſſeſſed; and ſo like too much blood, it would quickly breed mortal diſeaſes in thee. So that that very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which often makes thee grudging and diſcontented, may juſtly put thee upon thankfulneſſe: Thou maieſt bleſſe God that he doth theſe things for thee, which are <hi>ad Sanitatem, non ad voluptatem</hi>: It's Gods goodneſſe, that I have not the mercies I would have; for then I ſhould be undone. And that even the godly are apt to ſeek immoderately after theſe earthly comforts, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in that reproof to <hi>Baruch, Jer.</hi> 45.5. <hi>Seekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf?

                           <hi>God hath mingled gall with the honey of every creature; That therefore it is, every thing is obtained with difficulty, and poſſeſſed with cares, that ſo we might not reſt upon the creature.</hi> As God made <hi>Aegypt</hi> a place of oppreſſiion and miſery to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that ſo they might willingly go out, and ſeek for <hi>Canaan.</hi> Thus the Lord hath made the world a valley of teares: He hath cauſed every relation, every conditon, to have its great exerciſe, that ſo God might be <hi>all in all.</hi> That as you ſee, out of the ſame root groweth both the Roſe and the Prickels about it; ſo likewiſe out of ſame creature, out of the ſame condition, cometh both Honey and a ſting: both that which is comfortable, and that which is moleſting. Now Gods end in this, is to make thee not with <hi>Peter,</hi> to ſay, <hi>It's good to be here</hi>; but to ſeek out for a better good. Thou muſt therefore be very fooliſh, and bruitiſh, if this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth not teach thee.

Oh ſay, This is not my reſt! Here is not all good: There is a better place then this world; and a greater happineſſe, then the enjoying of the creature. Even the wiſeſt, the richeſt, and moſt potent in the world, have not had their content, but thornes have been in their ſides, and their hath been two drops of gall to one of Honey. That Starre called wormwood, hath fallen into our waters, and made them bitter.

to look up unto God as the fountain of all happineſſe? As of him, in whom we ſhall not have any occaſion of wearineſſe. There will never be cauſe to complain, that I find not God ſo full of comfort and bleſſedneſſe to me, as I expected. Yea, God will be unto us above all that we can expect: For, it cannot enter into the heart of a natural man, to conceive the fulneſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of God, And therefore the natural men of the world, are commanded to <hi>taſte, and ſee how good God is.</hi> It's for want of this ſpiritual and heavenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that we are ſo apt to be affected too much with the creature, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all with God.</p>

And the reaſon is, becauſe it's God only that faſhioneth the heart; It's he, that formeth the ſpirit.

Thus it is with all creatures; they do not comfort or originally help of themſelves, but as enabled by God.

Thus then it is, no creature hath any thing of it ſelf to refreſh us with, but as God puts into it; even as the Conduit-Pipe, runs water or Wine, as it is poured into it. And thus do all creatures communicate mercies and comforts, as they are quickned thereunto by God.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>The creature in being but an inſtrument, and having all from God, doth thereby demonſtrate how much bleſſedneſſe is in enjoying God himſelf.</hi> If a drop be ſo ſweet, how much more is an Ocean? If a Star be ſo welcome, how much more is the Sun? Therefore thou ſhouldſt ſay thus to thy ſelf, If ſuch a relation; ſuch a creature be ſo comfortable and good to me, what may God himſelf be, who is ſo full of all good? <hi>Si tanta pulchritudo in creaturâ, quanta in creatore,</hi> as the Antient ſaid?<note place="margin">Heaven and glory cannot be obtained without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ement and tranſcendent affection to all other things.</note> If thy heart were ſpiritual, it would aſcend thus by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to God.</p>

                        <p>Eighthly, <hi>If Chriſt hath reproved thoſe who were godly, for their external cares, when yet notwithſtanding it hath been in the root of it, from all good affection to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; how much rather will he condemn thoſe who are immoderately addicted to theſe things, and that from a principle of averſneſſe to him, and weariſomeneſſe in his ſervice?</hi> Now for this reproof, you have a notable Inſtance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10 40, 41. where <hi>Martha,</hi> out of her abundant affection to entertain Chriſt, did not as her ſiſter, <hi>ſit at Jeſus his feet,</hi> and <hi>hear his Word,</hi> but was <hi>carefull</hi> about the <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> him; but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thou art troubled about many things, one thing is needfull, and Mary hath choſen the better part.</hi> You ſee Chriſt preferring a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent attending to the meanes of grace, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>That a gracious heart doth more eſteem the favour of God, and the light of his countenance, then any earthly thing whatſoever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>light of Gods countenance,</hi> is often ſpoken of by <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 44.3. The original of all the mercies God vouchſafed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Gods power, and the light of his countenance, becauſe he had a favour to them.</hi> So Pſal. 99.15. <hi>Bleſſed are they that know the joyfull ſound, they ſhall walk in the light of thy countenance.</hi> This <hi>favour</hi> of God, is that which makes a <hi>glad</hi> and <hi>joyfull</hi> heart. Hence in Antiquity, it was a proverbial ſpeech to expreſſe an happy man by, <hi>Deus vidit,</hi> God hath looked on ſuch a man.</p>
                     <p>Though the <hi>light of Gods countenance,</hi> doth ſometimes ſignifie only his <hi>bare knowledge</hi> and <hi>omniſcience,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.8. <hi>Thou haſt put our ſecret ſinnes in the light of thy countenance</hi>: as Gods face is ſometimes upon a man for good, and ſometimes it's ſaid to be againſt man, for his hurt: but the ſumme is, That as it is with a man, when he is <hi>pleaſed</hi> with another, he <hi>turneth his face to him, looketh pleaſantly and cheerfully</hi>: as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 29.24. Thus when God is pleaſed with a man, then the Believer apprehends nothing but love and favour from God: He ſeeth not frowns, but ſmiles in his face: And he ſeeth God to be to him, by the <hi>eye of Faith</hi>: As <hi>Eſau</hi>'s face was to <hi>Jacob,</hi> pleaſing; and therefore ſaid to be <hi>like the face of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us conſider <hi>what</hi> this phraſe doth expreſſe. And</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>It ſuppoſeth that all our iniquities and ſinnes, they are pardoned and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out.</hi> For as long as our guilt is upon us, and God ſeeth that,<note place="margin">What this phraſe, <hi>to lift up the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon a man,</hi> implyeth.</note> he turneth his face from us; He is an angry Judge: He is of <hi>purer eyes, then to behold ſuch things. Your iniquities divide between you and me.</hi> Hence, when ſinne is ſaid to be <hi>pardoned,</hi> the expreſſion is, that it is <hi>covered,</hi> Pſal. 32. implying, that ſinne of it ſelf, is loathſome and abominable to his eyes. Not but that he ſeeth ſin in every Believer, only it's <hi>pardoned in Chriſt,</hi> and ſo not imputed to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: And though God ſee it, ſo as to chaſten for it, yet not to adjudge to eternal deſtruction. And this is ſo great a bleſſedneſſe, that <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32. doth only call this ſo: <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> (not whom God makes great, rich, and honoured in this world, but) <hi>to whom he imputeth no ſinne at all.</hi> This the humbled ſoul counteth a mercy, and in its ſad agonies, prayeth for the <hi>light of Gods countenance</hi>: All the world doeth him no good: All the creatures that would comfort him, do but as thoſe that would give Chriſt vinegar and gall to drink. <hi>David</hi> himſelf (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 5 1.) when in his great conflicts, becauſe of his ſinne, minds not his Kingdom, or honours, but prayeth, that God would <hi>have mercy upon him, according to his loving kindneſſe.</hi> Thoſe tender mercies of God, he flyeth unto. Till therefore ſinne be removed, Gods anger and wrath belongs unto us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:101245:181"/>Secondly, <hi>In this is implyed Gods favour and love towards us; that he is pleaſed, and become reconciled with us.</hi> If the wrath of a King be ſo terrible, how much more is the wrath of God? But when the <hi>light of his countenance</hi> is towards us, then he is gracious; then his eye, his face, are all pleaſant and reviving. When <hi>David</hi> is reconciled to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> then it's no longer commanded, that he ſhould <hi>keep from his preſence,</hi> but his Fathers bowels long to ſee him him again. Can there be a greater good in the world deſired, then that Gods face ſhould be pleaſant to us? Then that he ſhould become reconciled with us? For as it is better to undergo all the wrath of all the moſt cruel Tyrants in the world, then to lye under Gods diſpleaſure; ſo it is better to enjoy the favour and love of God, then the advantage of all ſecond Cauſes. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14 <hi>Cain</hi> ſpeaks of this as the height of his miſery, That he ſhould be <hi>hid from the face of the Lord.</hi> To be in Hell, it would not be a torment, but becauſe Gods <hi>face is hid.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God hideth his face, there is the inlet of all woe and miſery. Then on the contrary, when the <hi>face</hi> of God doth <hi>ſhine</hi> upon a Believer, as <hi>David</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for this often, then is that mans eſtate <hi>bleſſed</hi> and <hi>happy</hi>: God is then at peace with him: God is then reconciled. Now as the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>If God be for us, who ſhall be againſt us?</hi> When the Sunne ſhineth, there may ariſe many black and thick clouds, there may be ſad and gloomy daies; but when the face of God doth ſhine on his children, then no darkneſſe, no tempeſts, no ſad temptations whatſoever, can hinder a man from having the beautifull beames of Gods favour. He can make the Sunne ſhine in the dark night. If he giveth peace, none can hinder it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>This phraſe doth imply the original, and cauſe of all Gods gracious mercies in time.</hi> It's becauſe of the light of his countenance, that any good cometh to us. For as the damned in Hell, who are totally caſt out from his face, cannot receive ſo much as a drop of water; ſo on the other ſide, where the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God is towards a man, there is a Treaſure of all the goodneſſe he can deſire. Therefore when <hi>David</hi> prayeth here, he doth (as I may ſo ſay) ask the whole <hi>Kingdom of God</hi>: Have this, and have <hi>all,</hi> if it be neceſſary for us. When <hi>David</hi> prayeth for the <hi>light of Gods countenance,</hi> he doth not ask for a ſingle mercy: It is not for one particular comfort he beggeth, but for the Treaſury: To have this, is to have the Ocean, not ſtreames: To have this, is to have the Mine, not ſome fragments of gold. Oh then, is it any wonder if this light of Gods favour be thus to be preferred, ſeeing it's the Treaſury of all the comforts we have! God then ſaith, <hi>Ask of me, though it be to the whole Kingdom, yet I will not deny thee.</hi> I mean in this ſenſe; That there is not one mercy in all Gods Store-houſe; there is no choice dainty in his Cellars, but thou haſt the Key to open it, when thou pleaſeſt.</p>
                     <p>For in the fourth place, <hi>This phraſe doth imply, That God hath a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto his Children</hi>: That he regardeth them with a more ſpecial favour then all the world. For the face of God, to ſpeak after the manner of men, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole world: There is nothing hid from it. But then this ſhining of his face; this propitious and extraordinary favour, it's only to thoſe that are his: All the people of God, they are his favourites. And as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> regarded <hi>Joſeph</hi> in a farre other manner, then he did his other Subjects, he makes all the Land to be his. Thus doth God to his own Children; He giveth them Heaven and Earth; He makes them Heires of all the glorious Promiſes that are made in the Goſpel. So that Gods face towards them, is in an extraordinary manner: It denoteth a peculiar reſpect to them. Hence it is, that they have liberty to come with boldneſſe unto him: They have the ſecrets of God manifeſted unto them. Theſe are admitted into the <hi>holieſt of holies,</hi> whereas others are commanded to be in the outward Court only.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>This phraſe of the light of Gods countenance upon a man, implyeth the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101245:181"/>
Efficacy and powerfull Effects thereof.</hi> For as the Sunne by its beames doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the whole earth, and gives life and motion to every thing; thus alſo doth God where he favours. Where he is pleaſed, there he doth communicate all thoſe neceſſary and precious comforts, which he vouchſafeth unto his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. <hi>None ever ſeeketh the face of God in vain.</hi> It's <hi>not a vain thing,</hi> to have the <hi>favour of God</hi>: For, his <hi>love</hi> is <hi>active</hi>; and he doth <hi>communicate</hi> himſelf unto ſuch, to the greateſt of their <hi>expectations.</hi> Whence is it, that God in time doth <hi>ſanctify</hi> his people, doth <hi>juſtifie</hi> them, doth <hi>pardon ſinne,</hi> and <hi>heal</hi> their <hi>corruptions?</hi> Is not all <hi>this,</hi> becauſe his <hi>countenance ſhineth upon them?</hi> Well therefore may <hi>David</hi> pray for this above all earthly advantages whatſoever: For, if he doth enjoy the face of God, then there cannot any thing be denyed him. It's from this, that he may preſſe for <hi>forgiveneſſe,</hi> for <hi>holineſſe</hi>: It's from this, that he may importune for any ſpiritual benefit he ſtands in need of. As ſhe ſaid, <hi>If thou loveſt me, how canſt thou deny this, and that to me?</hi> So, if thou loveſt me, if thy face be towards me, why is this or that mercy denyed unto me? If I have the Sunne, how cometh that to withhold its beames from me? And indeed, this is mainly intended in Prayer, that it ſhould be the <hi>light of his countenance acting,</hi> and <hi>operating</hi>: That it ſhould be <hi>putting</hi> it ſelf <hi>forth</hi> upon his <hi>ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>This acting of Gods face in reference to the godly, implyeth it ſelf two waies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, In reſpect of <hi>outward and temporal mercies.</hi> It's from this favour of God, that his people have any outward comfort in mercy towards them. For although wicked and ungodly men, they may have abundance of theſe outward things, yet it doth not come from Gods loving kindneſſe to them: They have them in his anger, and they uſe them to their own perdition. But it's not thus with the godly; Every mercy, though never ſo little, comes from the <hi>light of his face</hi> towards them. So that though they have never ſo little, if they have no more then <hi>Lazarus</hi> crums; yea, they cannot get them; yet they are better then thoſe who have the greateſt portions of the world: for theſe have the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God</hi> with it. Which made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>A little that the righteous hath, is better then great abundance of the wicked.</hi> In this conſideration, as well as in others, that he hath it with the peace and favour of God, he is the child, and the friend of God, in all this. If he ſaid, he did not rejoyce ſo much <hi>in Dono uam ab te dato.</hi> This is much more applicable to the people of God; What they have they do not ſo much rejoyce in it, as that it cometh from the favour of God.</p>
                     <p>Again, The light of Gods countenance, ſheweth it ſelf in <hi>ſpiritual mercies</hi>: And theſe are a certain and ſure effect, demonſtrating of it. Whoſoever can find the leaſt degree of Gods grace in his heart, that hath the experience of any humiliation for ſinne, of any heavenly-mindedneſſe; though theſe things are but ſmoaking, yet he may conclude that the <hi>light of Gods countenance is lifted up upon him.</hi> Oh then, whoſoever thou art, that findeſt grace in thy ſoul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not ſo much in that, as of what it is a ſign of, what it doth ſo palpably demonſtrate! Alas, even our very graces, as they are inherent in us, can afford us little comfort in themſelves; for they are ſubject to many imperfections and weakneſſes: We have many ſighes and diſcouragements becauſe of them. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are Evidences and Demonſtrations of Gods favour, that from them we may certainly conclude, the <hi>face of God ſhineth upon us</hi>: So they afford <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy.</hi> And therefore this is one reaſon, why a man may more rejoyce in the leaſt degree of grace diſcovered in himſelf, then in the greateſt outward mercies whatſoever. For we may have the wealth of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the long life of <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> and yet for all that, have not the leaſt of Gods loving kindneſſe to us. But on the other ſide, though afflicted, though perſecuted, though op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, though ſhut up in dark dungeons; yet the diſcovery of grace within us,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101245:182"/>
doth make us to conclude, that the <hi>gracious eye of God is upon us.</hi> So then, it's the <hi>light of Gods countenance,</hi> that is the <hi>efficacious cauſe</hi> of all the <hi>mercies</hi> we do <hi>enjoy.</hi> As Chriſt, when he <hi>looked</hi> upon <hi>Peter,</hi> that made him <hi>go out, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap> bitterly.</hi> Thus it's Gods gracious eying and looking upon us, that makes us go forth into any expreſſion of grace.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>This phraſe of the light of Gods countenance ſhining upon a man, doth imply, the notice and knowledge of this</hi>: For ſo Gods <hi>light</hi> is often called that <hi>knowledge</hi> which he giveth of him. And indeed, though the <hi>face</hi> of God do <hi>ſhine</hi> upon a man, yet if he be blind, or in ſad darkneſſe of heart, that he is not able to behold it; then it's all one to him, as if did not ſhine at all. So that <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>that he might have the knowledge and ſenſe of this upon the ſoul. Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>ight, and day, are all one to a blind man. And thus now, when a godly man ſits in darkneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and hath no light which he perceiveth, he cannot but be greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cted So it is here; when the favour of God is not apprehended, but we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprehend his frowns and anger againſt us, then, though we be <hi>Children of light,</hi> yet <hi>we walk in darkneſſe. David</hi> doth often pray, that Gods <hi>face might ſhine upon him</hi>; and yet even then it did ſhine upon him, while he prayed for it: otherwiſe he could not have had a praying heart, neither could he be ſenſible of the want of it: But he wanted the <hi>knowledge</hi> and the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of it. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be Gods gracious favour that put<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> us into a ſtare of bleſſedneſſe, yet it is the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of it, that makes us to rejoyce in it. When <hi>David</hi> had more joy and gladneſſe in his heart, then all the voluptuous and earthly men of the world, yet this could not be, without the aſſurance pf Gods favour. So that Gods gracious love, is better then the whole world. It is that which preſerveth from ſinne and hell; It is that which keepeth off all condemnation: But yet all the while, till we know this, our ſouls may conflict with ſad agonies. And this is the caſe of all the people of God, who are in ſad temptations, and lye under heavy defections.

                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Where the light of Gods countenance is, there is implyed the love and delight the Lord takes in ſuch.</hi> The eyes of the Lord, are often ſaid to be on the godly, as being a <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>delightfull</hi> Object: He is never willing to turn his face from them.

                        <p>Having diſcuſſed what is comprehended in that expreſſion of <hi>Gods lifting up his countenance upon a man,</hi> I ſhall now proceed to give ſuch <hi>Qualifications or Characters, that are neceſſeary to ſuch who do earneſtly deſire Gods favour.</hi> And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>They are ſuch who have a deep and true ſenſe of the guilt of their ſinne</hi>; who are wounded in heart, and lye under their iniquities, as their greateſt burden. Such as have this foundation laid, they cannot have any reſt or quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; nothing can ſatisfie their ſouls, till God look graciouſly upon them. We ſee this in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32. &amp; 51. there, when he lay groaning under the weight of his ſinnes, and was ready to <hi>roar out</hi> becauſe of God anger; What is it that he ſo earneſtly begs for, but that <hi>ſinne may be covered, that joy might be reſtored to him?</hi> That God would take away thoſe ſinnes, which make ſuch a ſad diſtance between him and his ſoul. Now <hi>David</hi> had many earthly and worldly refuges to fly unto; he might have ſolaced himſelf with all kind of comforts; but nothing could quiet his heart, if he hath not Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. As all the Starres, though they ſhine together, are not able to diſpell the darkneſſe of the night, it muſt be the light of the Sunne that can do that: Thus, it is not any creature, any comfort, any content from them, that can quiet and compoſe the troubled ſoul; it muſt be the <hi>light of Gods favour</hi> ſhining into their dark hearts. If therefore you a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>k, What is the reaſon why ſo many crave earthly things, but as for this favour of God, they prize it not; they pray not, or wreſtle for it? The anſwer is, Moſt men are ſecure in their ſinnes; they have hardneſſe of heart, and a ſpiritual ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity upon them. Hence it is, that they know not what <hi>ſtings</hi> are in ſinne; they know not what a <hi>wounded ſpir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This full ſtomack needeth not the Honey-combe. On then, till ſinne be more bitter in thy conſcience, the favour of God cannot be eſteemed by thee!</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Such as eſteem the light of Gods countenance, are many times thoſe that are afflicted, perſecuted, and of great exerciſes in this world.</hi> For this is the wretched corruption of our natures, that while we can take any delight in the creature, we runne not out to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> While we can have but the light of a candle, we care not for the Sunne. Therefore it is, that God takes from us all our comforts. He removeth this mercy, and that mercy, that ſo we may ſeek after God.

Thus the Church of God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.3.) being in great extremities, God feeding them with the bread of teares, and giving them teares to drink in great meaſure; yea, angry with their very Prayers: What doth it beſeech for in this great ſtraight?

after ſad, black, and gloomy weather: Thus is the favour of God moſt regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when we find troubles to compaſſe us about on every ſide. Hence it is, that thoſe whom <hi>God loveth, he often chaſtens.</hi> And nothing is more unhappy, then conſtant happineſſe; becauſe abundance and fulneſſe of outward mercies, doth take us from ſeeking the face of God. Let not then the godly mourn away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any chaſtiſements they lye under; for if theſe are ſo ſanctified, that thereby the favour of God is more indeared to thee, thereby thou canſt rejoyce in his preſence more, theſe are the greateſt mercies that can befall thee. And indeed, at ſuch times the light of Gods countenance is more neceſſary then ever. The leſſe of the creature, the more need to be filled with God.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe can only deſire the light of Gods countenance, that do renounce their own righteouſneſſe</hi>: That do not juſtifie themſelves, or put confidence in their own righteouſneſſe. Commonly there are none more ignor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe affections, and that hope, which ſhould be placed on God, they are apt to put upon their own ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſſe. Hence (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3.) our Saviour pronounceth thoſe <hi>bleſſed, that are poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> And the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> magnifieth God in her Song, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.53. <hi>He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath ſent empty away.</hi> Not only the prophane man, who trampleth this Pearl under his feet, but even the formall civil man is a great ſtranger to this petition. This favour is wholly a ſtrange thing to him, and all becauſe he is full of himſelf: He makes his good heart, his good workes, a god, a ſaviour to him; and ſo no wonder if he ſeek not up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and deſire light from thence. Yea, in godly men it is thus, that the more debaſed and ſelf emptyed they are, the more is their fellowſhip with God: The more do they place their happineſſe in beholding of him. As you ſee it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> Who laboured more then he? yet, Who undervaluing all his graces more then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e? And all this was, that Chriſt might be wholly exalted. Oh then know, that there is nothing doth ſo much bolt out this glorious light from ſhining into thee, as ſelf-confidence, as ſelf-righteouſneſſe. And this is the reaſon why God doth ſo many times withdraw his gracious preſence from his own Children, that they are in the dark, and cannot ſee any grace, and the leaſt ſpark of heavenly fire within themſelves; and all becauſe they are apt to be lifted up. They muſt have theſe thornes in the fleſh, elſe they would depend too much upon their own ſtrength, and their own graces. And when they have been thus humbled, then at laſt they come to eſteem Gods favour more then ever; as <hi>Paul</hi>'s paſſengers, after a ſtormy black time, rejoyced to ſee the Sun, more then ever.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Such only can eſteem the light of Gods countenance, who are a spiritual and an heavenly people, who have the holy Image of God repaired in them.</hi> He that is of the <hi>earth, is earthly, and ſpeaks earthly things,</hi> (Joh. 3.) <hi>but he that is of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is heavenly.</hi> Such as we are in reſpect of our ſpiritual conſtitution, ſuch are our operations, and our inclinations. No wonder then, the natural man deſireth not the favour of God; for he is in a corrupt and ſinfull eſtate, and ſo can deſire nothing but what is ſuitable thereunto. Whereas on the otherſide, he that is made heavenly, he that hath an holy frame of heart, the motions of his ſoul aſcend upwards ſtill. As you ſee by <hi>David,</hi> How often doth he profeſſe the breathings, the longings and thirſtings of his ſoul after God? He cryeth aloud, that he hath <hi>nothing in Heaven and Earth, but God</hi>: He makes <hi>God</hi> his <hi>Portion,</hi> his <hi>Shepherd,</hi> his <hi>Refuge,</hi> his <hi>Hope,</hi> his <hi>all</hi> things unto him. Whence is <hi>David</hi> thus carried out to the favour of God, but becauſe of an heavenly heart within? There could not come ſuch ſweet fragrant ſmells, but becauſe his heart was like a ſpiritual Garden. You ſee all like, deſireth and delights in that which is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101245:183"/>
like: And if a godly man love to ſee the face, and have the company of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther godly man, how much more muſt he deſire God himſelf? Oh then, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of that heavy, lumpiſh, earthly heart of thine! that doth not often ſay, <hi>My heart breaketh for the longing after God at all times. As the Hart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth the waters, ſo pants my ſoul after thee, O God.</hi> If thou complaineſt that thou haſt affections for every thing but God, thy heart is taken with every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort but him: Oh, bewail this dull and ſinfull frame! Thou wanteſt heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Thy heart and converſation is not in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Such only pray for the light of Gods countenance, as live by Faith, and are affected with things, as revealed by the Scripture.</hi> It's as impoſſible for a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> living wholly by ſenſe, and upon worldly Principles, to rejoyce in the favour of God, as a worm that crawleth on the ground, to delight in the Sunne. Faith is that noble grace, which is like Wings to the ſoul, to make it fly up to Heaven. We ſee it in <hi>Paul</hi>: What was that which ſo <hi>raiſed up</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> to Chriſt? What is that which made him to <hi>ſit with Chriſt in heavenly places?</hi> What is that which is the <hi>ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi> to every Believer, but <hi>Faith</hi>? We are all lame cripples, till Faith heal us. And this is the reaſon why all worldly men have no more ſenſe of this divine Benefit, then the very bruit beaſts, becauſe they are wholly ſtrangers to the life of Faith. For it's not the bodily eye, that can ſee the face of God; neither hath God any bodily face or eyes, but theſe things are wholly ſpiritual. And therefore, as the deaf ear cannot be affected with melodious muſick; ſo neither can a natural heart diſcern of this light of Gods favour. Oh then, acquaint thy ſelf with Faith! This is a Proſpective-Glaſſe, that will diſcover ſuch Objects to thee, that of thy ſelf thou couldſt not apprehend. Faith makes us to behold the glory of Gods favour: We are ſtarke blind, till Faith open our eyes.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>Such onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> can eſteem the favour of God, who have had the experience of the ſweetneſſe and excellency of it.</hi> A man that hath not taſted Honey, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how ſweet it is. Therefore <hi>David</hi> calls upon the men of the world, to <hi>taſte and ſee how good God is.</hi> If the natural man ever had any experimentall feeling of Gods favour, and his love, then he would quickly have another heart, be of another mind: Then he would ſell all to get this Pearl. But all the while men are unregenerate, they know no other good then that of the creature: It hath never entred into their hearts, to conceive what it is to have the face of God ſhine upon his people. Inſomuch, that all the invitations and allurements are in vain, untill God be pleaſed to come into the ſoul, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his ſweetneſſe, and conſolations to him. The experienced Chriſtian, that hath often drank of this Wine, ſtill remains thirſty, and deſirous after more. For whereas the having of earthly things doth ſatiate, and at laſt nauſeate a mans heart, ſo that he hath enough; in this heavenly enjoyment of God, he never hath enough, but the more he hath taſted of it, the more hungery he is ſtill: Alwaies praying with <hi>David, Oh, when will he come to me!</hi> When thoſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> asked the Church, which was ſo raviſhed with Chriſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring him above ten thouſand, <hi>What is thy beloved more then others</hi>? it was an Argument they had never ſeen him; they had never known him: If they had, they would have been enammoured with him, as well as the Church. And thus, when natural men wonder; ſaying, Why do theſe men thus pray, thus mourn, thus long after God? Why is it that they are never ſatisfied, but in him? It's a demonſtration, that this experimentall work hath never been upon thy heart: If it had, the ſpirit of Propheſie (as I may ſo ſay) would fall on thee alſo: Thou wouldſt admire the favour of God, as well as they.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>Such only can deſire the light of Gods countenance, who have the Spirit of God working in them</hi>: It's that which maketh the ſoul go upwards. We
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101245:184"/>
being like that man, bowed down, that Chriſt healed, till the Spirit of God thus raiſe us up. <hi>The holy Ghoſt came down in fire,</hi> which denoteh the activty of it. When fire aſſimilateth any thing into it ſelf, it makes it aſcend upwards: And thus, when the Spirit of God converts and ſanctifieth a mans ſoul, it giveth it a contrary motion to what it had before. Then it made proviſion for the fleſh, then it minded earthly things; but now the Spirit of God hath raiſed it from the death of ſinne. That as you ſee <hi>it's the mighty power of God,</hi> which will make theſe <hi>bodies,</hi> that are now <hi>corruptible,</hi> heavy, and preſſing <hi>downwards,</hi> to be <hi>immortal, ſpiritual,</hi> and ſo <hi>agile,</hi> that they ſhall <hi>meet the Lord in the aire</hi>: Even theſe bodies will be ſo transformed, that they ſhall move in the air like Birds. No wonder then, if Gods Spirit is able ſo to work upon our hearts, that they ſhall be conſtantly inclining to God. And indeed, none are to reſt, till they find God thus mightily prevailing upon them. This excellent frame, may be <hi>given by the Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit is promiſed to ſuch as ask for it,</hi> Mat 6. Eſpecially, the Spirit of God, as <hi>adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, enab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ling us to call God Father, rebuking legall ſlaviſh feares, and filling us with a filial and evangelical frame of heart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Eighthly, <hi>Therefore another Property of ſuch, who do thus highly eſteem Gods favour, is, That they are diligent in Prayer, and fervent in approaches to God.</hi> Prayer is the aſcending of the heart to God, who is in Heaven. The eyes lifted up, argue what the heart ſhould be. Now Prayer is of this excellent advantage, if ſpiritually and fervently performed, that it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth up the ſoul to God, and thereby God alſo manifeſts his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to his people. Even as <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon his Communion with God, had his face <hi>ſhine</hi> ſo gloriouſly, that the people could <hi>not behold it</hi>; and Chriſt himſelf, upon Prayer, had his <hi>countenance changed,</hi> that his <hi>face did ſhine like the Sunne,</hi> and his <hi>garments were white as ſnow.</hi> So that ſuch who eſteem of Gods favour, they are inſtant in Prayer. They perform that duty with watching and attending thereunto; which if ſo diſcharged, then many conſolations, many irradiations of his favour, are communicated to them. So that a man diligent in Prayer, is like the <hi>tree by the water ſide, whoſe leafe will never fade.</hi> Hence we have that encouragement, <hi>No man ſeeketh Gods face in vain</hi>: And no ſooner did God command this, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>David</hi>'s heart yeelded to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> We cannot have it, without ſeeking for it; as that which is moſt precious, and a very infinite Treaſure. And withall, you ſee the encouragement, God beſpeaks it; he ſaith, <hi>Seek ye my face.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>Such as prize the light of Gods countenance, they walk cloſely with God, and keep up ſtrict Communion with him.</hi> Slothfull and careleſſe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will never be bleſſed, with this glorious advantage. You read, the Church was but once careleſſe and negligent, when Chriſt proffered himſelf, and immediately Chriſt withdraweth: ſo that though ſhe runne up and down much perplexed, to ſee the face of her <hi>Beloved</hi> again, yet it coſt her dear, ere ſhe could obtain it. <hi>David</hi> began to have but ſome proud and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous <hi>thoughts, Pſal.</hi> 301.7. <hi>And God bid his face, and then he was troubled.</hi> You ſee, a little thing, a <hi>word,</hi> a <hi>thought may do it.</hi> Therefore thoſe, who deſire to enjoy it, they walk circumſpectly, leſt they ſhould do any thing, that may make him angry with them.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. In the Scripture, we read, That <hi>chaſtiſements and afflictions, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an argument of Gods love,</hi> and that God is <hi>never more angry,</hi> then when he lets a mans waies be <hi>ſmooth,</hi> and <hi>proſperous</hi>: As it was with <hi>Moab,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not <hi>moved</hi> often, therefore he was <hi>ſetled upon the Lees.</hi> And thus in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> when God is angry in the higheſt manner, then he threatens, <hi>He will not puniſh their ſonnes or daughters any more,</hi> Hoſ. 4.14. They therefore have little cauſe to boaſt in this, That they are not afflicted as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; they are not in ſuch bonds as others are: For <hi>David</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.6.) did of old obſerve this, That whereas the wicked of the world, had all <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,</hi> they had all <hi>temporal increaſe,</hi> yet the godly were <hi>bowed down all the day long</hi>; and that in thoſe times when Promiſes of temporal abundance were in a larger way propoſed to them. If then the godly man had this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Old Teſtamant, no wonder if he meet with it much more in the New Teſtament; where tribulations are made the Red Sea to go through, into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle doth directly argue from Gods <hi>love,</hi> to <hi>chaſtiſements, Heb.</hi> 12.6. which is again mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19.

Thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought the <hi>Romanes</hi> had that great Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given them, becauſe of their juſtice. And ſo the Scripture ſaith, <hi>A di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hand maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10.4. But what is this common love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101245:185"/>
a ſpecial? What is it for God ſo to love thee, as to make thee ſtrong, healthy, wealthy, and not to give Chriſt and Heaven to thee? Oh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſt not in the enjoying of theſe outward mercies, but look to that which is the chiefeſt of all! If thou haſt grace, pardon of ſinne, and Chriſt, thou canſt not be damned; but if thou have the great things of this world, thou maieſt have alſo the great torments of Hell hereafter. As <hi>Iſmael</hi> had of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſome rich gifts, but not the Inheritance: As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, of the great Turkiſh Empire, which God hath given to wicked and ungodly men, it's but <hi>mica canis,</hi> a crum that the dog may have, but not the Childrens Bread.</p>

Let it be given to wicked men thus, from a common love, <hi>yet it is withall from Gods anger and hatred,</hi> if you do regard them in a ſpiritual conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, they are not ſanctified to them; they are not thereby made more holy, or drawn nearer to God. They do become ſnares and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinnes to them: ſo that they will at the Day of Judgment, even curſe the day that ever they had ſuch abundance. They will cry out, Oh that they had been poor, miſerable, deformed! That they had been under any calamity, then that they had ſuch abundance; for that hath made Hell ſeven times hotter: That hath been like oyl poured into the flame, which hath made the fire burn more terribly. That which <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved of wealth, (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.13.) is true of all other outward mercies, Beauty, Strength, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; <hi>How often are they given to the hurt of them that have them?</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi>'s imprecation is fulfilled in them, <hi>Let their Table become a ſnare unto them.</hi> As too much blood indangers the body: eſpecially theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies, are ſure to be a ſnare to them; becauſe they hinder and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all thoſe Chriſtian Qualifications which are abſolutely neceſſary to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Diſciple of Chriſt. Thus it's required, that a man muſt <hi>love Chriſt more then Father or Mother, or life it ſelf</hi>; that he muſt <hi>deny himſelf, and take up his Croſſe.</hi> All which cannot be, becauſe of immoderate love to theſe outward mercies. This is the <hi>Camels bunch</hi>; This is that which <hi>choakes the Word.</hi> The Phariſees, becauſe they were covetous, derided Chriſt. If then, you comfort your ſelves, becauſe God hath given you all outward fulneſſe; examine how theſe are ſanctified to you. What ſpirituall effects do theſe mercies bring upon you? Do you not pray the worſe, hear the worſe? Are not your hearts the more diſtracted and divided? Doth not the earth make you forget Heaven? Oh then, be afraid and tremble at theſe things, rather then confidently rejoyce in them! Did not <hi>Abraham</hi> tell <hi>Dives, He had received good things in this life?</hi> but for eternity, he was not to receive ſo much, as <hi>a drop of water.</hi> Pray unto God, that all thy good things be not given thee here, and thou have nothing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

                           <note place="margin">II. An untroubled Conſcience, is no Argument of Gods countenance.</note>A ſecond ſort of perſons, <hi>who miſtake about the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is, Such who have a quiet, untroubled, and eaſed Conſcience.</hi> They commonly argue thus; God loveth them, for they have no trouble in their hearts; they have no fear or diſquietneſſe in their ſouls, but they put their whole truſt in Chriſt. Such as theſe, that die as a Lamb, (ſo people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it) they make no doubt but this is the favour of God. They thank God, God loveth them, and they love God: They never doubted of Gods love to them: They are fully aſſured of it. Thus they take a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and ſometimes a ſcared conſcience, for that which is quieted, and made peaceable through the blood of Chriſt. And this is the condition of very many; they do even rejoyce in this, That they never doubted. They think, the godly, who have often fears and doubts, who are in ſad temptations, to be the worſt of men; and that it is for their wickedneſſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101245:185"/>
they are ſo. Even as the wicked thought Chriſt to be ſmitten for his own ſinnes; and that God did in ſuch a peculiar manner, bring him to that accurſed death, for his high impiety. Thus do the prophane men of the world, cenſure the generation of the godly, who have many times ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of ſpirit, and walk without any ſenſe of Gods favour at all: yea, ready to cry out, They are damned, and that <hi>God hath forſaken them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to ſearch into the bottom of this Diſeaſe, which is Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Conſider, <hi>There is a great difference between a ſtupid ſenſleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,<note place="margin">1. An untroubled Conſcience, may be a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid ſeared Conſcience.</note> and a ſerene conſcience made ſo by the light of Gods countenance ſhining upon it.</hi> This is not a quieted conſcience by the Promiſe, and through Chriſt, but a ſtupified one; which the Apoſtle calls a <hi>ſeared</hi> one, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>feel</hi>; that cannot apprehend. It is with thee as mad men, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit ſuch and ſuch great things to themſelves, when (alas) it's for want of their wits and ſobriety, that they have ſuch fooliſh imaginations. Thus when thou preſumeſt of Heaven, and ſalvation: Oh thou art ſure thou ſhalt go thither! Whence is all this, but becauſe thou haſt no ſpiritual life or feeling within thee? Oh, if thou wert in thy ſpiritual ſenſes; if thou didſt underſtand aright, thou wouldſt quickly cry out, and tremble at that curſed condition thou art in! Who were more abominable to God then the Phariſees, yet who juſtified themſelves more? Who put more truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the workes they did? Therefore do thou ſearch into thy heart more. Whence comeſt thou to be thus ſecure and confident? Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art delivered up to a <hi>reprobate ſenſe?</hi> Is it not becauſe thou art <hi>dead in ſinne</hi>? And as dead men cannot feel any pain or torment, ſo neither canſt thou. <hi>Therefore if you ſee men that lived wickedly, yet die peaceably and confidently, this is not the light of Gods favour upon them; it is their ſenſleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; It's their ſtupidity.</hi> You cannot ſee a more miſerable object then ſuch are.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This quiet and comfortable conſcience they boaſt of,<note place="margin">2. And may be accompanied with groſſe ſinnes.</note> is not from the light of Gods countenance, <hi>becauſe it's for the moſt part accompanied with many groſſe and wicked ſinnes.</hi> As it was with the Jews, though they committed ſuch abominable practiſes, that even the light of nature did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, yet they will come and cry, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord.</hi> For this the Prophets of old had ſuch great Controverſies with the people, that though they gave themſelves up to all kind of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet they would ſtay themſelves upon God; and like the whoriſh woman, would wipe the lip, and be as confident as if they had done no evil thing. Oh then, let ſuch be awakened out of their ſpiritual madneſſe! What? Thou an enemy to God, by all the prophaneneſſe thou art in all the day long? Doeſt thou come boldly to God? Doeſt thou ſay thou putteſt thy truſt in him? Remember, that <hi>God is a conſuming fire to ſuch as thou art.</hi> It's not for thee to caſt thy eye upon the Promiſe as yet, but upon the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and threatnings of the Law: It's for thee to hearken and hear how the Law curſeth thee: That abroad and at home, thou art under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of it. Conclude therefore this to thy ſelf, that all the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thou haſt in Gods mercy, if accompanied with a prophane and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent life, is but a rotten poſt; which though it ſhine in a dark night, yet when the Sunne ariſeth, it is diſcovered what it is. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes terribly to this, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. <hi>If our hearts condemn us, God is greater then our heart, and he knoweth all things.</hi> If then, thy own natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience accuſe thee for ſuch and ſuch miſcarriages, know that God who is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient, he knoweth more evil by thee, and will much more condemn thee.</p>

And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking Gods way for the obtaining and preſerving of it.</note>Thirdly, This quieted heart is thus lulled aſleep, <hi>becauſe it hath not taken Gods way, either to obtain or preſerve quietneſſe.</hi> For the light of Gods countenance is not like the light of the Sunne, which <hi>ſhineth upon the juſt and unjuſt,</hi> and cometh upon all men; even the Thief and the Adulterer, he, hath this light of the Sunne to accompliſh all his wickedneſſe: but the light of Gods favour is with much difficulty obtained, and with as much difficulty preſerved. For in the obtaining of the light of Gods favour, there muſt be a neceſſary Humiliation for ſinne, and ſenſe of our utter periſhing in our ſelves. <hi>Come unto me, ye that are heavy laden,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and you ſhall find reſt for your ſouls.</hi> And thus the <hi>poor in ſpirit, (Mat.</hi> 5.) they are called <hi>bleſſed.</hi> How did <hi>Paul</hi> come to triumph ſo confidently in the <hi>love of God through Chriſt?</hi> Was not this foundation firſt laid, that (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) he perceived the <hi>Law to be a killing Meſſenger to him?</hi> He <hi>ſaw; that made ſinne out of meaſure ſinfull.</hi> And thus being <hi>undone in himſelf,</hi> he is directed to eſteem highly of the <hi>grace of Chriſt.</hi> So that there is a vaſt difference between <hi>Paul</hi>'s confidence and good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, while a Phariſee, and when converted: For while a Phariſee, he was very zealous, and ſaith, <hi>He had a good conſcience</hi>; he did <hi>not walk againſt the checks of that</hi>; he had much <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>conſolation,</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing theſe dictates: But when converted, he cryeth out of all theſe; he was a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> a <hi>Perſecuter</hi> the <hi>greateſt of all ſinners.</hi> And thus it will be with thee; Thou goeſt on in thy way with all preſumption; thou pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueſt thy ſuperſtitions, thy will-worſhip, and haſt unſpeakable content in thy conſcience for doing thus. But oh, when God ſhall ſhake the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of thy ſoul! when he ſhall diſcover thy very originals, then thy ſoul will be in wofull agonies; then the very rottenneſſe of all will begin to appear within thee. The light of Gods countenance: comes after trouble for ſinne. God is known by this property, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.) <hi>That he bringeth light out of darkneſſe, even as at firſt, out of a Chaos he made light.</hi> Thus it is here; From the confuſions and diſorders of the ſoul, becauſe of ſinne, there ariſeth afterwards the greateſt tranquility of ſpirit. It's true, this trouble about ſinne, is in ſome more, in ſome leſſe; but yet there is an abſolute neceſſity of feeling ſinne ſo farre a burden, that it findeth it ſelf eternally periſhing without this. Again, for the Introduction of this light into the ſoul, there muſt not only be a deep ſenſe of ſinne as a burden, but earneſt hungerings and longings after the righteouſneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the Goſpel. <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> felt the burden of their ſinnes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; they had weight more then they could bear, but they deſpair under this; they have no breathings and deſires after the grace of God. Now Chriſt will not vouchſafe this precious Pearl to ſwine that trample it under their feet; That they ſhall have it, who care not for it. But the ſoul is prepared by many inlargements and ſtrong deſires; Oh, that I might have but a glimpſe of this light! Oh, that I had but a drop to coole, not the tongue, but the whole ſoul, that is ſcorched with the guilt of ſinne! Go then, and conſider thy ſelf; Thou ſpeakeſt much of Gods favour, but hath thy ſoul been in agonies; in breaking of heart for it? Never did a man, weary of the night, more deſire to ſee the day, then thou doeſt the gracious light of his countenance to thee? If upon theſe termes ſalvation hath come to thy Houſe, then there is ſome hope. As the light of God is thus obtained at firſt, ſo it's with no leſſe difficulty preſerved. For</p>

                        <p>If a wicked man did but know what the comfort and conſolation is, that doth accompany an holy life, he would judge all his earthly pleaſures, to be like the Prodigals husk.

                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, It is from the <hi>Original.</hi> As there is a <hi>wiſdome which comes from above,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The nature of this joy.</note> that is heavenly; and a <hi>wiſdome fleſhly and deviliſh</hi>: ſo alſo, there is a <hi>joy</hi> which comes from <hi>above,</hi> that is pure and excellent; and there is a <hi>joy,</hi> that is of the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and this is indeed deviliſh. But the <hi>joy,</hi> which a godly man receiveth, it's from Heaven, from God himſelf; and ſo hath a pure and choice excellency in it. It differs from worldly joy, as the elementary fire from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linary. The elementary fire, needs no <hi>pabulum,</hi> no wood to maintain it, it will not periſh; but the kitchen fire, that muſt have wood or coales, it will not laſt any longer then this fewel. Thus all worldly joy, that muſt have daily ſticks and coales put to it. If Friends die, if Wealth be loſt, Pleaſures denyed, this joy is gone: but this joy from above, abides, the ſame. As long as God abides in Heaven, ſo long that continues; unleſſe we by our ſinnes, provoke God to take it away. All the world cannot give ſuch a joy as this is. Therefore <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. it's called <hi>the fruit of Gods Spirit</hi>; and often, <hi>Joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is called the <hi>Comforter</hi>: And God is ſtiled (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3.) the <hi>God of all conſolations,</hi> becauſe it is he alone that workes it. Men may create the world as well, as of themſelves get ſuch a joy as this. Hence the people of God walk many times mournfully for the want of it; And there is no <hi>Samaritan</hi> can put this Oyl into their wounds. <hi>David</hi> cannot alwaies ſay, <hi>God put ſuch joy in his heart</hi>: Yea, he profeſſeth the clean contrary ſometimes, That his ſoul was <hi>bowed down</hi>; that he <hi>watered his bed with teares.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> was almoſt like a damned man in Hell. But of the Reaſon of this deſolateneſſe, we may ſpeak hereafter; It's enough that this demonſtrateth God to be the Author of all our joy: And that as all the men in the world cannot make the Sunne ariſe in the morning, did not God appoint it that natural courſe; ſo neither are any able to bring this joy into their hearts.</p>
                        <p>Therefore in the ſecond place, <hi>The ſecond diſcovery of this joy is from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working it; Thou didſt put it into my heart:</hi> That is an excellent expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It ſheweth what dominion and ſoveraignty God hath over the heart: He can as eaſily put joy into thy ſoul, though afflicted, though tempted, though
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101245:188"/>
grieved with ſinne, as thou canſt pour Wine into a Bottle. He can with a word, command waters to become Wine. So that as the Orthodox maintain, That Gods grace in converting the heart, is irreſiſtible; it's inſuperable: The heart cannot reſiſt it with finall prevalency. For <hi>à nullo duro corde reſpicitur; quippe ad hoc datur ut tollat cor durum.</hi> So it's true alſo in ſpiritual joy; The grieved heart, the ſad heart cannot reject it, becauſe it's given to take away the ſad heart. Hence we read of the people of God, the Martyrs and others, that they have rejoyced under their tribulations, more then their Perſecutors did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all their abundance. How was this poſſible, but that God did ſo fill their hearts, that no outward or inward miſery could have any room there? This ſhould teach the people of God to walk ſo exactly, that they may not on the contrary ſay, God hath put more bitterneſſe into their heart, then any can have in their worldly miſeries. For as the joy of God is more then all earthly joy, ſo the ſenſe of Gods anger and wrath, cauſeth more ſorrow and anguiſh of ſpirit, then all outward calamities can do. <hi>A wounded ſpirit, who can bear?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Joy which God puts into our hearts, followeth upon a true godly ſorrow and mourning for ſinne.</hi> All the joy of thy heart, which doth not flow from humiliation and deep ſorrow for ſinne, it's but a blaze; it's like the <hi>crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thornes.</hi> And this is neceſſary to be obſerved; for the Hypocrite, who never had any true ſound grace, yet he may have ſome tranſitory joy. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>They received the Word with joy</hi>: And ſome <hi>rejoyced in John Baptiſts light</hi>; but it was for a <hi>ſeaſon only.</hi> And thus many in ſome fits, yea in ſome holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, find a gladneſſe and inward joy upon their hearts; but this never had a true ſorrow go before. Before <hi>Paul</hi> was admitted into Goſpel joyes, he was ſtriken to the ground, and had a deep ſenſe of his former guilt. Therefore the Promiſe is, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall rejoyce,</hi> Mat. 5. Therefore as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks concerning afflictions, it's true alſo of godly ſorrow; <hi>They that ſow in teares, ſhall reap in joy.</hi> Many deſire joy; they are willing to hear of a Sermon that may cauſe gladneſſe in their hearts; but then they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure the preparatory unto it: They do not love the Law ſhould wound them, before the Goſpel heal them. But this is the nature of all heavenly joy, it's a daughter to godly ſorrow. <hi>Verus paenitens de peccato doler, &amp; de dolore gaudet.</hi> And this is it which makes godly joy ſo welcome and ſo precious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heart was mourning, and humbled before, thinking it ſelf unworthy of any joy in the leaſt manner: Though others might rejoyce, yet not they. This then is the method God takes; Firſt the Spirit of God is a Spirit of Supplication and mourning, then it's a Spirit of Joy and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>This joy which God putteth in the heart, it's from ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly motives.</hi> Therefore the duty is ſo often called for to <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord</hi>: And it's called <hi>Joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> It ariſeth from Gods favour, from Goſpel-Priviledges; becauſe God is reconciled; becauſe ſinne is pardoned; becauſe we are <hi>juſtifica through the blood of Chriſt.</hi> So that the joy of a godly man, and of a natural man, differ as much as Heaven and Earth. For what makes thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at any time? Is it ſome worldly pleaſure? Is it not ſome earthly content? Is it not becauſe ſuch and ſuch earthly advantages befall thee? Thy heart is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cheerfull and merry, but from ſuch conſiderations. Now, how different, and poor, and contemptible are theſe to this heavenly Joy? For the gladneſſe of their heart, ariſeth from the love of God; from an Intereſt in Chriſt; from the conſideration of eternal glory. Theſe ſublime and ſpiritual Objects, do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh the godly ſoul. So that the delights of a beaſt, are not more inferiour to the delights of a man, as a rational man, then the delights of a man are to him, as a Chriſtian. What the Apoſtle ſpeaketh concerning the thoughts and words
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101245:188"/>
of a Child, comparatively to a man, the ſame is true alſo in reſpect of joy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Children have their joy; they laugh as Children; they rejoyce in their Babies as Children: but when they come to be men, they cannot rejoyce as Children; they cannot delight to play as they did, when little Boyes. Thus when thou art once made godly, and haſt taſted of more excellent Joy, thou canſt not delight in the pleaſures of ſinne, nor in the greateſt advantages of the world: They are below thee. Thou ſaieſt to thy ſelf, when inordinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in theſe things, as ſhe did, but falſly, to <hi>David; Thou haſt made thy ſelf like one of the vile fellows to day.</hi> The godly mans joy comes from an higher Spring, then the worlds doth.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Hence in the next place, <hi>No man can have this ſpiritual joy, but ſuch who are regenerated, and born of God</hi>: Who have a ſpiritual and ſupernatural life. We ſee in nature, that according to the ſeveral kinds of life, ſo there are ſeveral delights, and proportionable thereunto, the natural and animal life, the rational life, the ſenſe hath its delights, and reaſon hath its delght. Thus when a man is born again, he hath his joy and his delight. Do not ye read often of <hi>David,</hi> that profeſſeth the Word of God, was <hi>ſweeter then the honey or the honey-comb to him?</hi> Doth he not ſay, That his heart <hi>panted after God, like a parched wilderneſſe,</hi> and <hi>more then the hart doth after waters?</hi> And whence is all this, but becauſe <hi>David</hi> is a <hi>man after Gods own heart?</hi> And indeed, it's wholly impoſſible that a man ſhould rejoyce in any ſpiritual Object, till he himſelf be made holy. As our Saviour told his Diſciples, <hi>He had other meat to eat of, then they knew of.</hi> So hath every godly man, other joyes, other delights, then any natural man can conceive. Therefore do not keep off from godlineſſe, for fear of looſing thy joyes; do not think that is to bid farewell to all cheerfulneſſe and gladneſſe of heart: but rather, thou never yet didſt know what true joy means; as yet thou art a ſtranger to it; for none but a regenerate man can enter into this Joy.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>This joy which God puts into the hearts of his people, it's unſpeakable and unexpreſſible.</hi> Like that <hi>new Name,</hi> and <hi>hidden Manna, which none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but he that hath it.</hi> Prov. 14.12. <hi>A ſtranger doth not intermeddle with this joy.</hi> There are ſome things that are ſo experimentally perceived by us, that a man cannot expreſſe them: He feeleth them, and is fully perſwaded of them, yet he cannot tell how to expreſſe this to another. As life, a man doth feel and know he liveth, yet who can tell another what his life is? <hi>Job</hi> was in bitterneſſe and ſorrow, and it was above his expreſſion; his Friends cenſured him, but ſaith he, <hi>If your ſouls were in my stead, you would judge otherwiſe.</hi> If you felt what I feel, you would be of another mind. And thus it is in regard of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual joy; You are apt to condemn the generation of the godly; Why will they be ſo ſtrict and preciſe? Why will they not runne into the ſame exceſſe of ſinne, and enjoy the ungodly pleaſures of the world as others do? Oh know, you ſpeak fooliſhly in this thing! If your ſouls were in a godly mans ſtead; if you had ever felt what they feel; if you had ever perceived upon your ſouls that which they have done, you would quickly change your minds, and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation alſo. You would then ſay, An hour of this Joy, is more then a thouſand years of the worldly joy: That a drop of this, is more then an Ocean of carnal pleaſures. This made <hi>David</hi> call upon wicked men, to <hi>taſte and ſee how good God is.</hi> If you would taſte; if you would ſet your ſelves to try what this Joy is, you would then quickly perceive a difference: But none knoweth this, ſave thoſe who have the experience of it.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>The nature of this joy, is to put a man upon all holy actions</hi>: Upon active and ſerviceable waies for God. And thus in regard of its Effects and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, it differs from worldly joy, as much as Heaven from Earth; or Gold from droſſe. For when the heart of a wicked man is merry, what doth it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101245:189"/>
put him upon, but ungodly practices? Then they muſt go to their cups, to their ſports, then they muſt go to their frolick and wanton playes: Thus their joy makes them very wicked; whereas this godly joy putteth a man upon praiſing and bleſſing of God- <hi>Is any man merry let him ſing Pſalmes,</hi> Jam. 5.13. It puts him upon more ſervent and cheerfull praying, hearing; and no Chriſtian is ſo active and lively as he that is joyfull, <hi>Neh</hi> 8.10. <hi>The joy of the Lord</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be their ſtrength.</hi> There needeth not then any great labour to diſcern the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mans mirth and the wicked mans: For the wicked he encreaſeth his ſinne thereby, he is more hardned to do wickedly. This joy is like the Devil to the herd of ſwine, which were hurried violently to hell; they would never do that in a ſober ſad ſpirit, they do then.</p>
                        <p>We have declared the nature of this heavenly gladneſs abſolutely; <hi>Let us now conſider the aggravation of it comparatively to all other pleaſures whatſoever</hi>; that ſo all unregenerate men may ſee they live to their loſs, and that one day in godlineſs affords more true ſolid comfort, then the whole life of a wicked man, though he ſhould live <hi>Methuſalem</hi>'s age. And</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">How it exceeds all worldly Joy.</note>Firſt, <hi>Spiritual joy exceeds all wordly, in regard of the purity of its nature.</hi> It is an unmixed joy, there is nothing adhering to it, to make an abatement, or put a check to it; whereas all wordly joy hath gall as well as hony; there is no Roſe groweth without its pricks. Look over all the wordly comforts that every where are enjoyed, ſee if they have not a <hi>But</hi> in them; as was ſaid of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> He was a great man, an honoured man, a rich man, <hi>but he was a Leper,</hi> that took off from the reſt: So of every unregenerate man, He hath ſuch an eſtate, ſuch friends, ſuch advantages to delight in; <hi>but</hi> there is ſuch a ſinne, and ſuch a ſinne, which if rightly conſidered would marre all his comfort. Do not thou therefore ſet thy ſoul to rejoyce and to take its eaſe, for there is either the commiſſion of ſuch ſinnes, or the omiſſion of ſuch duties, that would quickly wound thy heart, and take thee off from all thy jollity; whereas now come to this heavenly joy, there is joy, and no cauſe of ſorrow joyned with it. This is like the upper region, where there are no Meteors: Look round about thee, Think of God, of Chriſt, of eternity, of death, yea of ſinnes, and thou haſt cauſe to rejoyce; for all theſe things work for thy good. It's true, there is a time when the godly are called to mourning, when they are to faſt and humble themſelves; but conſider, this holy mourning doth not oppoſe, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe heavenly joy. The more thou canſt mourn for thy own ſinnes, or the ſinnes of the Nation, the greater is thy joy in the Lord: So that ſuch mourning doth make thee abate of thy natural and earthly comforts, but not at all of thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly comforts: So that heavenly joy is of ſuch a pure nature, that it's better then gold, it cannot have any droſs mixed with it; it's like the pure flames of the fire, which cannot receive any mixture with it. Therefore do then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider over all thy worldly delights. Was there ever any that did afford meer matter of comfort? Is there not ſome occaſion of grief, of vexation, of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as well? whereas all heavenly things afford only delight, and no trouble at all.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Spiritual joy is more cordial and ſubſtantial</hi>; it doth more inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs a man, then any earthly joy can do: <hi>Diſce gaudere,</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca</hi>: Thou haſt put it into my heart, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 33.21. <hi>Our heart ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.5. <hi>My heart ſhall rejoyce in thy ſalvation.</hi> Hence you heard it was called <hi>unſpeakable joy</hi>; and the <hi>peace of God,</hi> which is the cauſe of this joy, is ſaid <hi>to paſs all underſtanding.</hi> Therefore our Saviour prayeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. that <hi>this joy might be filled is them</hi>; a notable expreſſion to declare that the comfort Gods people have, is of a farre more ſolid and real nature, then what men of the world have: They are never heartily and truely joyfull, for there is either the ſting of ſome ſinne, the guilt of conſcience, or the fear of ſome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101245:189"/>
danger, that doth greatly check their joy: Inſomuch that many times the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly of the world, they put the beſt face upon things they can; they would bear it out, as if they had peace, and they had comfort, when God knoweth, and their own heart, feeleth many tormenting feares within them. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks fully to this of a wicked man, <hi>Prov</hi> 14.13. <hi>Even in laughter the heart is ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>; his meaning is, that a wicked man in the midſt of all jollity, and a carnal mirth, yet he hath but a ſad heart, and why? There is guilt with him, there is a conſcience ſecretly repining in him, and though he ſtriveth to bear it down, and would make a greater noiſe then that, yet theſe whiſperings, and ſecret accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do greatly weaken their joy; for it's enough that conſcience accuſeth thee, though none in the world elſe can witneſs againſt thee, <hi>Quid proder it tibi non habere conſcium, habenti conſcientiam?</hi> What will it avail thee to have thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience accuſing thee, though there be no witneſs conſcious with it? Was not <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> in the midſt of all his jollity and exceſſive riot? Yet the appearing of an <hi>hand-writing</hi> made him quake, and his knees to tremble. Why might not he have thought it had been ſome good Angel, or there was ſome writing for him to encreaſe his kingdome? No, but before ever he can tell what it is, he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and trembles, his heart was guilty, <hi>Semper praeſumit ſaeva mala conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> Thus take the moſt wanton, looſe, and jolly ſinner that is, his heart being guilty, he alwayes thinketh and feareth the worſe; now the Lord remembers ſuch and ſuch ſinnes: So that it's not the laughing, and ranting, and ſinging of merry Songs, that demonſtrate a joyfull heart; no, there may be ſadneſs and terrour within for all that; whereas this ſpiritual joy filleth up the heart of a godly man, whatſoever preſents it ſelf, he can rejoyce. At this time, when <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth his joy, it was outwardly a moſt ſad time with him. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors judge, he was now purſued by <hi>Abſolom</hi> his own ſonne, who riſeth againſt him, his people forſake him, <hi>Shimei</hi> raileth at him, telleth him, God had now avenged the blood of <hi>Saul</hi> upon him; and all this was occaſioned by his own wickedneſs; yet in the midſt of all theſe ſad circumſtances, he had ſo much joy in his heart: So that the godly even while he weepeth and mourneth, hath joy, and the wicked even while he laugheth and rants it, yet hath gnawing worms within him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Heavenly joy is rational,</hi> ſetled upon ſound and ſolid grounds. If you ſee any godly man rejoyce, and walk with a chearfull ſpirit, it's well done, there is cauſe for it; who may do it if not he? Whereas take any natural unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, he hath not the leaſt cauſe of the leaſt ſmile: If he did as he ſhould do, he would roar and cry out, he would go and weep bitterly, he would ſmite upon the breaſt and the thigh, ſaying, What ſhall I do? Oh my ſinnes, my ſinnes! Now this is greatly to be conſidered, who hath the true cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and who not. Tell not me, ſuch a man liveth a jolly merry life, ſuch a man is at his hearts eaſe, he liveth in his pleaſures all the week long: Oh but what reaſon, what cauſe hath he to do ſo! If he did rightly conſider himſelf, if he did lay his ſinnes to his heart, he would mourn and weep, and bewail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all the day long; for what joy canſt thou have, as long as thy ſinnes are not pardoned, as long as God is angry with thee, as long as thou mayeſt tumble into hell every moment? Is it for ſuch an one as thou to be glad, and laugh, and take thy eaſe? No, our Saviour <hi>Luk</hi> 6.25. pronounceth a <hi>woe to you, for you ſhall mourn,</hi> though now you will not: <hi>There is no peace ſaith my God to the wicked man</hi>; it's the ſpeech of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 48 22. Stand off then, joy doth not belong to thee, it's the godly mans portion; none may, or hath cauſe to walk chearfully but he, for the favour of God is upon him, God is not angry with him, his ſinnes they are forgiven, death and the day of Judgement can do him no hurt, whether poor or rich, whether well or ill, whether living or dying, he hath cauſe to rejoyce, <hi>Phil</hi> 4 4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alway, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101245:190"/>
again I ſay rejoyce: Rejoyce alway.</hi> There is no time wherein thou mayeſt not rejoyce. Do not ſay, I have this affliction, I have this ſad tryall upon me: It's no matter, ſaith the Apoſtle: Let it be how it will be with thee, Rejoyce alway; and indeed let the wicked and ungodly tremble; let them cry out with horrour, thoſe that have the guilt of their ſinnes upon them, thoſe that every moment may be adjudged to hell; let them mourn and tremble: But for a godly man, he hath no cauſe at all, but to <hi>rejoyce in the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Joy from the Lord will have a good end, there will be no ſad reckoning for it afterwards:</hi> There will be no cauſe to repent of it; but all wordly joy though it doth pleaſe thee for a time, yet there is a ſting in the tail of it there will be a bitter account to be made at the day of Judgement, and this certainly you ſhould rightly conſider of: Theſe pleaſures, this carnal delight of mine, will it not coſt dear hereafter? Will not all this hony turn into choler? Will not my torments be according to my pleaſures? What ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> to his young man that is moſt given to follow his delights, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Rejoyce O young man, and walk in the wayes of thy heart,</hi> purſue thy luſts, care for nothing, trample Gods word under thy feet, <hi>but know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgement</hi>; and is not this like an hand-writing in the wall? The thoughts of what will be hereafter, may juſtly ſtrike out all thy preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: I am merry now, laughing now: But ſhall I do thus when death comes? ſhall I laugh when at the day of judgement I ſhall ſtand arraigned at his Tribunal? Oh do not admire ſuch pleaſures, that will coſt ſo dear at the latter end! But for the godly mans joy, that will never ſhame him, that will never grieve him, but as the Apoſtle ſpeakes about repentance, it's a <hi>repentance never to be repented of.</hi> Thus here is a joy that is alwayes to be joyed in, a joy that will never trouble thee hereafter, whereas for all this wordly joy thou muſt mourn again; it hath been the time of thy ſinning, and of thy rebelling againſt God, and therefore all this will turn into bitterneſs at the latter end; If theſe pleaſures would not turn into torment, then it were ſomething; but as theſe have abounded, ſo will thy torments and troubles alſo abound. Thou canſt not ſay with <hi>Agag,</hi> the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death and hell are paſt: What is the ſad end of all <hi>Dives</hi> his joy? Yea ſometimes they are deſtroyed in the very midſt of all their pleaſures, as the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtimes,</hi> and as <hi>Nabal</hi> were.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>The joy and gladneſs of a godly man is ſtable and perpetual, becauſe the ground and cauſe of it is unchangeable:</hi> God never ceaſeth to be his Father, he ſhall never be caſt out of the ſtate of Juſtification, he ſhall never loſe his intereſt in Heaven; now this rock alwayes abiding, their joy muſt alſo be immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It's true, though the godly have cauſe alwayes to rejoyce, yet they do not ſo actually; for the preſent they may mourn and be in bitterneſs, but that many times is cauſed by their own ſinne and weakneſs; or elſe God to give them more comfort, afterwards doth ſuſpend preſent comfort, as the Sunne is moſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come after a tempeſtuous black ſtorme; but though this be, yet the foundation of their joy remaineth ſure, there is the ſame cauſe why they ſhould rejoyce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. Oh but thus it is not with the unregenerate man, all his joy is but a blaze, and all the cauſe or ground of it is very uncertain. Every creature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they rejoyce in, is it not mutable? To day laughing, to morrow crying: To day cheerfull becauſe thou haſt it, to morrow mourning becauſe thou haſt loſt it. Thus in <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 20.5. <hi>Zophar</hi> ſaith, <hi>The triumphing of the wicked is ſhort, and the joy of an hypocrite for a moment:</hi> The oil to this lamp will quickly fail, thy honours, thy life, thy wealth, theſe things will not laſt alwayes. Oh then ſhould it not be thy wiſdome to lay up for ſuch joy, that will abide conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, that will never leave thee! Is it not evident folly to take thy delight in that, which may be loſt the next hour? As <hi>Jonah</hi> took great content in his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101245:190"/>
                           <hi>Gourd,</hi> and within a day a <hi>worme</hi> breedeth therein, and conſumeth all. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay of thy worldly joy, as thou mayeſt of thy life it ſelf; It is but a <hi>buble,</hi> a <hi>vapour,</hi> here to day and gone to morrow; if thou couldeſt preſerve all this delight continually, and death it ſelf could not rob thee of it, then go on, and make much of it: But to thy terrour thou wilt find the inſtability of it, as with the <hi>Sodomites, The morning was fair and pleaſant, but fire and brimſtone was upon them before night.</hi> For ought thou knoweſt, thou mayeſt go from laughing here, to eternal roarings in hell the next moment.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>Spiritual joyes tranſcend earthly, becauſe the ſoul can better perceive them,</hi> they are of a more ſpiritual and penetrating nature and efficacy: The ſoul can receive them as the ſpunge doth water, or the iron doth fire, the ſoul may be filled with it: but all bodily delights and joy, they are more groſs and thick: This reaſon give the Schoolmen, why all ſoul delights are above the body, and much more if they be ſpiritual and heavenly: As thoſe ſinnes which are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſeated in the ſoul, they are more deep and inward then bodily ſinnes; ſo that joy and delight which enters immediately into a mans ſoul, is farre more ſoaking and preſſing, then that which is upon the body primarily: For bodily joyes are like the Sunne-beames, which come in at a cranny, or little hole; but foul delight is as when the Sunne comes in at a window, or at a great door, there is capacity enough to receive it.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>All earthly joy is to be moderated,</hi> we may ſinne in it, we may go too farre, we may over-joy: Therefore the Pſalmiſt exhorts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with trembling.</hi> While we take any joy in theſe earthly things, we are to do it with trembling, for then is a temptation to ſinne, then are we in greateſt danger, in the midſt of heat we are ſubject to take cold. Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>Thoſe that rejoyce, muſt be as if they did not rejoyce:</hi> So great a care are we to have that our joy be moderated, we do not ſay it's unlawfull to take delight, and joy in the creatures, the Scripture commands to <hi>eat and drink with joy of heart,</hi> only we muſt not joy exceſſively, we may quickly let this joy overflow the bankes; and certainly the carnal and immoderate joy that men take even in lawfull things, is no little part of their iniquity: For why is it that thy heart can rejoyce in outward mercies, thou canſt take delight in theſe creatures, but haſt none at all in heavenly things? A Fair, a Market is thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, when thou canſt not call the Sabbath a delight: Is not all this, becauſe thy heart over-joyeth in theſe things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Exhortation,</hi> not to be diſheartned at godlineſs, as if it were a ſad, melancholy, mopiſh life: Oh know, thou never comeſt to have true joy, til thou live the godly, exact, and preciſe life! The cloſer thou walkeſt with God, the more fearfull to commit any ſinne, the more unſpeakable and ſolid is thy joy. Oh call not that laughter and mirth of the wicked man, joy! <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, it's not joy, it's <hi>madneſs:</hi> Do not ye ſee mad men; they will laugh, and hoot, and leap with jollity, when they are bereft of reaſon, and lye in chains bound up in a dark Dungeon? Such is all the worlds laughter: They die laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, They go to hell laughing, and is not this madneſs? Yet who can perſwade men to leave their carnal jollity, and to taſt how good and pleaſant the wayes of God are? Well, go on and take thy delights, thou wilt have laughing enough one day: <hi>for</hi> Prov. 1. <hi>God will laugh at thy deſtruction, and mock when thy fear cometh.</hi>

                        <p>WE have heard of one glorious <hi>Effect</hi> of the light of Gods countenance upon <hi>David,</hi> viz. <hi>A gladneſſe ſurpaſſing all the joy that can be in the world</hi>; now in this verſe, we have a ſecond, and no leſſe noble <hi>Effect</hi> of the ſame <hi>cauſe.</hi> For as the Sunne hath many ſeverall and notable effects upon the earth; it doth not only enlighten or comfort, but makes fruitfull, and aboundeth alſo in many other effects. Thus <hi>the favour of God,</hi> where that is perceived, it is not one or two, but many glorious conſequents flow from thence. And this in the text, is an <hi>holy ſecurity, and admirable quietneſſe of ſpirit, free from all ſinfull diſtempers,</hi> let his danger be never ſo great. So that this heavenly tranquillity, is a <hi>fruit</hi> of that <hi>Faith</hi> which he had in God, at this time, though ſo greatly tempted.</p>
                        <p>Therefore in the words, you have <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>godly ſecurity, a fruit of his Faith,</hi> expreſſed in <hi>two actions,</hi> as a manifeſtation of it; with the Reaſon, and the Cauſe of it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Actions</hi> demonſtrating his quiet ſpirit, are,

                              <item>1. <hi>His lying down in peace.</hi>

                        <p>His <hi>lying down</hi>; that denoteth, He would not be interrupted in his natural actions, and ordinary courſe of life; he would eat, and drink, and go to bed for all that.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe many go to bed, and though they put of their cloathes, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay aſide their tormenting and vexing cares, whereby, though they <hi>ly down,</hi> yet are <hi>reſtleſſe</hi> and <hi>ſleepleſſe,</hi> toſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Now certainly, if you do conſider in what a temptation and danger <hi>David</hi> was in, you will ſay it's impoſſible; or rather, that Faith which makes us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on God, in ſuch ſtreights, with the effects of it, are no leſſe admirable, then miraculous Faith. It's generally concluded on by the beſt Interpreters, that this Pſalm was made upon the ſame occaſion which the immediate one going before was; and that appeareth by the Inſcription, to be compoſed when <hi>David</hi> fled from <hi>Abſolom.</hi> So then, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He will lye down and ſleep</hi>: Take his ſweet reſt, when he was in that flight of his, purſued by <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom.</hi> And if you would know, how grievous that was, conſult 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. the whole Chapter, eſpecially verſe 30. there you will find, that <hi>Abſolom</hi> by fair pretences of Juſtice and Religion, had ſtolen the hearts of all the people

to himſelf, againſt <hi>David</hi> his Father; whereupon he makes Warre, raiſeth a great Army. The conſpiracy was carried on with great pride and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, inſomuch that <hi>David</hi> is forced to <hi>fly</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to runne whithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> he can for his ſafety; all the people did generally forſake him: So that he with ſome few, went up to Mount <hi>Olivet</hi>; and as he went, he <hi>wept,</hi> and covered his <hi>face,</hi> and went <hi>barefoot,</hi> and all the people went with him, and <hi>wept</hi> alſo. What a ſad ſight was this, to ſee <hi>David,</hi> ſo Religious a King, ſo potent, who had conquered ſo many Enemies, to be brought into this extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? Yea, his eſtate was ſo deſpicable, that one man <hi>Shimei,</hi> Chap. 16. came out and <hi>curſed</hi> him, <hi>railed</hi> on him; <hi>Come out thou bloody man, Thou man of Beliall</hi>; and <hi>threw ſtones</hi> and <hi>duſt</hi> at him. By all this, you ſee his miſery was great enough. But adde to this; That at this very time, <hi>David</hi> knew God brought this evil upon him for his <hi>Adultery,</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs buſineſſe</hi>; the Prophet had threatned him thus. So that both God and man ſeem againſt him; he is forſaken of all, and his conſcience tels him for what this is: He can eaſily tell the ſinnes that make it thus with him. Yet for all this, ſee his admirable Faith, in the powerfull effects of it; <hi>I will lay me down and ſleep.</hi> Would you think, that <hi>David</hi> could make ſuch a Pſalm as this, and ſpeak after this manner, even when he went <hi>barefoot</hi> and <hi>weeping</hi> in that direfull manner? This is ſo incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that ſome have thought it could not be literally true of <hi>David,</hi> and have made myſtical applications of it to Chriſt; but upon very weak grounds.</p>
                        <p>Yet leſt you ſhould think this came from ſome ſtupidity, or fool-hardineſſe, or from Stoical Apathie (for <hi>David</hi> doth in a high manner, that which the Stoicks ſo highly commend, but could never themſelves practice) he addeth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it; by which you may ſee, it was not carnal ſecurity, but holy confidence.</p>
                        <p>The Reaſon is taken from Gods <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>care</hi>: He doth not thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely take his reſt, becauſe though generally forſaken, yet ſome mighty men of valour did cleave to him, and he had old Souldiers, whereas the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours were many of them inexpert: Nor doth he think that he had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted them, by ſending his faithfull Friend <hi>Huſhai</hi> into <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s Court, to undermine him, while he pretended to ſerve him, but all is from God; <hi>Thou alone makeſt me dwell in ſafety.</hi> It was God, and he <hi>only,</hi> that could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend him.</p>
                        <p>In the expreſſion of <hi>David</hi>'s ſecurity, <hi>I will both lay me down and ſleep</hi>; the Hebrew word <hi>Juchdan,</hi> hath troubled Interpreters: The <hi>Septuagint</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it, <gap reason="foreign">

Others relate it to his own company, that did faithfully adhere to him in this his temptation. But they ſeem to take it moſt genuinely, that relate it to the actions; <hi>I will both lie down and ſleep</hi>: One as well as the other, to demonſtrate the fiducial frame of his ſpirit.

danger of all, and when he was ſo purſued, that he could not tell where he ſhould lie down, or where he ſhould ſleep; this is wonderfull. Oh, how may the very naming of this Doctrine, ſhame the beſt and choiceſt of Gods Children! For little afflictions, that are not to be named to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s, they diſquiet thee; they make thee toſſe up and down, and thou art reſtleſſe in thy ſpirit. Oh, do thou ſhame thy ſelf, and thy troubled heart for ever, by this Preſident which <hi>David</hi> hath ſet thee! And leſt you ſhould think this was but a ſuddain flaſh and lightning in <hi>David,</hi> you may find, that this fire did alwaies warm his breaſt. For look to the third Pſalm made by him, while he was in his flight, he ſaith there the ſame thing, only in the <hi>Prterperfect-tenſe</hi>: What he here ſaith he <hi>will do,</hi> you may there ſee he <hi>had done.</hi> Oh, you would think <hi>David</hi> had little occaſion to make Pſalmes, to be proclaiming his confidence in God! ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have had his whole ſoul taken up with his military affaires; but thus Faith doth put on ſpiritual Armory upon his ſoul. And that you may not think, only <hi>David</hi> could do this, ſee the like ſecure and holy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk, Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Doctrine xplain ed.</note>But let us explicate the Doctrine by ſeverall Propoſitions. As</p>
                        <p>Firſt, What is meant by <hi>Faith depending and adhering to God?</hi> To know this, you muſt underſtand, that the Scripture attributes <hi>three Acts</hi> to Faith; and ſo Faith is deſcribed <hi>Synecdochically</hi> by one of them, for its whole Nature. Thus Faith is ſometimes <hi>knowledge</hi>; ſometimes it's <hi>aſſent</hi> to the Truths revealed; and ſometimes it's a <hi>fiducial</hi> and confident reſting upon God, or Chriſt: and this is indeed the moſt noble and excellent Act of Faith: Even as reaſon and underſtand are the chiefeſt acts of man, though he can alſo <hi>ſentire.</hi> Faith as it doth thus rely on Chriſt, it Juſtifieth. But not only in matter of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> doth it thus depend on God, but alſo in all outward calamities and ſtreights, it in ableth the ſoul to reſt and leane on the Lord. This is that truſting, which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> doth ſo often exhort to, in the Pſalmes. For as a man cannot walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out legs, or a Bird fly without wings: ſo the ſoul of a man, being wholly unable and impotent, cannot ſubſiſt of it ſelf, but it muſt have ſomething to lean upon. It's like Ivy, that cannot grow of it ſelf. Now if the heart of man be corrupt, his truſt is wholly carnal; he beareth up his heart, and ſupports himſelf with ſome bladders or ſtilts that the world affords him. But if his heart be ſanctified, then he doth ſolely depend upon the Power and Promiſe of God. Now this truſting in God, is a ſpecial duty; and <hi>David</hi> many times uſeth this Argument, <hi>why</hi> God ſhould help him, <hi>becauſe he truſted in him.</hi> We cannot in an higher manner glorifie God, then by truſting in him: For, hereby we acknowledge God to be the <hi>Jehovah</hi>; that he alone doth all things. Inſomuch, that this is one of the chiefeſt duties required in the firſt Commandement. The grace then of Faith, hath this peculiar effect upon a man, that it lifteth up the ſoul to God, and maketh it reſt, and ſolely depend on him It's true, even in natural men, there ſeemeth to be a truſt in God; but that doth as much differ from this holy confidence, as light from darkneſſe: For, no natural man can put his truſt in God, there being as much grace required to put forth this, as any other holy duty.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This truſting in God, hath</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Its general Object.</hi> And</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Its more ſpecial and adaequate Object.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>general Object,</hi> is, <hi>Any good thing</hi> that we ſtand in need of. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the ſoul wants, or the body wants: Whatſoever thy neceſſities are, thou art to depend on God for the ſupply. This our Saviour inſinuateth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. to his Diſciples, when he tels them, they ſhould not be <hi>doubtfull</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfull, what they ſhould eat or drink,</hi> but reſt <hi>ſatisfied</hi> wholly in Gods
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101245:192"/>
                           <hi>proviſion,</hi> who is an <hi>heavenly Father.</hi> And therefore there is not any grace, hath ſuch a peculiar property to allay the tempeſts, and rebuke the ſtormes of the ſoul, as this hath. This is <hi>David</hi>'s Harp, to chaſe away the evil ſpirit. Whence are all thoſe ſoul dividing and tormenting cares, but from want of truſt in God? It were not poſſible thy heart ſhould be ſo diſquieted and toſſed up and down, if thou didſt thus reſt on him: For, <hi>this truſting in God, it is a Catholocum</hi>; it's a general Remedy to all Exerciſes, to all Dejections. And hence, when the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by Faith</hi>; the great Act of Faith in that place, is <hi>dependance</hi> on God.</p>
                        <p>But then, Faith as it's truſting and relying on God, hath a <hi>more ſpecial and noble Object</hi>; and that is, <hi>Chriſt our Mediatour.</hi> In the ſenſe of all our guilt and unworthineſſe, we are to throw our ſelves on him: And this is like the looking on the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> by which we are healed. It's not working, or labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but reſting of our ſouls on Chriſt that juſtifieth. And indeed, if we can truſt on him for our Juſtification, for our ſalvation, what a ſhame is it, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depend on him for ſupply of all outward neceſſities? Doth not the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with the higheſt reaſon that can be? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>If he hath given us Chriſt, how ſhall he not with him give all things elſe?</hi> Will not this ſhame all thy diſtruſtfull and dividing thoughts, when thou ſhalt ſay, I believe in God for the ſalvation of my ſoul, yet I cannot truſt him with my Children, my health, or any other ſtreight I am in?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Motives</hi> to truſt in God in the midſt of all Exerciſes, are <hi>two-fold:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gods Promiſe.</hi> And</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gods Power.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For as our Saviour ſaid, concerning thoſe who did not believe the Scripture, <hi>They erred, becauſe they did not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</hi> Thus it's here; All thy dejected and repining thoughts ariſe within thee, becauſe thou art ignorant of his Truth, his power.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, There muſt be Gods <hi>Promiſe,</hi> otherwiſe it's not truſt in God, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal preſumption. If a man ſhould neither work, nor eat, or drink, yet ſay, He truſts in God for his life, this would be deſperate preſumption; for there is no Promiſe made to ſuch. Therefore whatſoever thy heart is born up with, be ſure thou haſt a Promiſe for it: And if there be a Promiſe, then know <hi>Heaven and Earth will ſooner fail, then that Promiſe.</hi> It's true, in the Old-Teſtament diſpenſation, there were particular Promiſes made for many mercies, ſo that they might the more boldly confide in God. As <hi>David</hi> in this very particular, he had a peculiar Promiſe that the Kingdom ſhould be eſtabliſhed to him; and therefore he was aſſured, that this Conſpiracy of <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſhould not prevail. Now although we have not ſuch peculiar Promiſes made to us, that God will remove ſuch a calamity, take away ſuch an affliction, yet <hi>we have a general Promiſe for every good thing; and that all things ſhall turn to our good.</hi> Which may make <hi>every Believer</hi> ſay, <hi>I know, either God will take this affliction away, or it will be for my good</hi>: That it is better for me to have it, then to be without it. And is not here ground of quietneſſe enough within thee? This makes the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> give ſuch a Proviſo to all our Petitions; <hi>Let him ask in Faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting,</hi> (Chap. 1.) <hi>for if he doubteth, let him be aſſured, he ſhall have nothing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now how muſt a Chriſtian in every Prayer about temporal things, pray without doubting?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſhall not ſay as ſome do, That even in all temporal mercies, we are to pray with the ſame aſſurance as for ſpiritual; That temporal things are as abſolutely promiſed as ſpiritual: And therefore if any temporal mercy be not vouchſafed to us, it's wholly for want of Faith and Confidence. But I rather joyn with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101245:193"/>
thoſe that ſay, <hi>He muſt not doubt of Gods Truth and Goodneſſe to help, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt he doubt, whether he ſhall not have that or the equivalent</hi>: This he muſt aſſure himſelf of. And truly, if a Chriſtian would proceed thus farre, he would find a world of eaſe, and quietneſſe in his mind.</p>
                        <p>And as Gods Promiſe, ſo his <hi>Power</hi> alſo; that is a ſecond Motive for this truſt in God. For if we do not believe God is able to raiſe up the dead, to call things as are not, as if they were; If we think the temptation too great, the affliction too deſperate, then we cannot put any aſſurance in God.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, We adde in the Doctrine, that <hi>Faith depending upon God</hi>; but that is not <hi>abſolutely</hi> conſidered: For the Devils cannot truſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n him, neither may wicked men; yet God is able to help them, to ſave them: but <hi>relatively</hi> as a <hi>Father,</hi> as <hi>reconciled.</hi> Therefore Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.) makes this the ground of all the truſt his Diſciples muſt have, <hi>becauſe their heavenly Father is in Heaven.</hi> So that till we have theſe perſwaſions of God as a Father, we are but as ſo many vagabond Children, that know not where to have relief. The Child, becauſe he hath a Father, never takes care what he ſhall eat or drink, or put on, becauſe his Father will provide all theſe for him.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, We adde, That this Faith muſt depend on God, in a <hi>lively and ſtrong manner,</hi> as <hi>David</hi>'s was at this time; or <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not the dead Womb, or did ſo much as ſtagger within himſelf. For if thy Faith be weak; if it be fainting and languiſhing, though thou maiſt have ſupport, yet not ſuch prevalent peace within thee: Thou art in a Combate, not in a Triumph. <hi>David</hi> at another time, is like <hi>Sampſon</hi> without his ſtrength; he ſaith, <hi>All men are lyers.</hi> He thinketh God had forſaken him. So that unleſſe Faith be very vigorus, though thou maieſt be preſerved in thy afflictions, they ſhall not quite overwhelm thee, yet thou wilt not have this peaceable frame. Now the Children of God, ſhould think it not enough to rub through their troubles with agonies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, but with joy and quietneſſe. Grieve becauſe thy heart is ſo much as diſquieted; ſay, Oh weak wretch that I am, that I cannot be as much at eaſe, as if I had no affliction at all!</p>
                        <p>There remain two more Propoſitions to explicate this Doctrine. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, When we ſay, <hi>Faith doth thus quiet and compoſe the ſoul,</hi> you muſt take two Cautions to ſeaſon this.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That <hi>Faith doth not this principally of it ſelf</hi>; for that is but a grace or habit, created and infuſed into the ſoul: And therefore as all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces needs the continual quickning and aſiſtance of Gods Spirit, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth Faith. Hence our Saviour prayed for <hi>Peter, that his Faith might not fail</hi>: Implying, that grace of it ſelf would wither and decay, as well as any other, if God did not preſerve it. Therefore the <hi>Apoſtle Peter</hi> doth fully expreſſe the manner of Faiths Influence into this Perſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.5. It's the <hi>power of God,</hi> that doth principally, and efficiently keep us, only it's <hi>through Faith.</hi> We are not then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as if Faith of it ſelf had ſuch an inherent efficacy, that by it's ſole juriſdiction, it would command the ſoul, and ſay as God did at the firſt, <hi>Let there be light, and there ſhall be light.</hi> No: Faith it ſelf needs the daily quickening of Gods grace, as well as other graces. Yea, this grace would ſooner decay then others; becauſe of the hearts contrariety to it, making a man to live above the Principles of ſenſe and common reaſon. Inſomuch, that it's no wonder to ſee a man love God, be patient in afflictions; theſe though not wrought by the power of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101245:193"/>
nature, yet have a conviction from the light of nature; but ſo hath not <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond <hi>Caution</hi> is, <hi>That we do not think, as if we could believe it our ſelves</hi>: as if by our own humane ſtrength, we could obtain ſuch a peaceable frame of heart. No: If it could be ſo, then <hi>David</hi> at other times, and that it may be in farre leſſe extreamities, would not have been dejected, as he acknowledgeth himſelf to be. Neither would that man have prayed to Chriſt, to <hi>Help his unbelief,</hi> if he could have helped it himſelf. And the experience of the godly doth abundantly confirm this, in what agonies they are plunged; how grievouſly tormented: Oh, how deſirous to quiet their hearts! They Pray, they Meditate, they Read; and all cannot compoſe their ſouls. Now if their hearts were ſubject to their power, as the Winds and Waves are to Chriſt, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure ſuch Conflict within. This argueth therefore, that it's not in mans power to put forth ſuch ſtrong vigorous Acts of Faith, no more then we can command the Heavens to give rain: It's God that muſt both plant and water, and give the encreaſe.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, The truth of this Doctrine, doth <hi>extend even to thoſe great Afflictions and Calamities we are in, and that becauſe of our ſinnes.</hi> We can evidently ſee what ſinnes they are, that have provoked God to give ſuch a bitter ſtroke; our own hearts teſtifie unto us, and this argueth the greater work of Faith. For happily it might be granted, That in ſuch Afflictions and Temptations which befall us for <hi>Gods cauſe,</hi> and for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſake, we may be full of ſuch joy and ſincerity, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>James</hi> 1. <hi>Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.</hi> And thus the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> they could and did with <hi>David,</hi> lay themſelves down to ſleep in their dark Dungeons, and that the very night before they were to burn at the Stake.</p>
                        <p>But you will ſay, <hi>How can this joy and confidence hold in ſuch Calamities as fall upon us wholly, becauſe of our ſinnes, we behold Gods anger and our folly, hath brought this on us?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now in ſuch troubles, <hi>If we humble our ſelves unto the Lord for our ſinnes, and bewail them, we may have ſuch Calmes of ſpirit</hi>: For this was <hi>David</hi>'s caſe; The Prophet had told him afore-hand, that this ſhould fall out: Becauſe of his Adultery and Murder, his conſcience cryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud in the midſt of his military noiſe; yet for all that, he could thus ſet himſelf to his quiet reſt.</p>

                        <head>How the vigorous Actings of Faith do quiet the Heart.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſe things premiſed, Let us conſider, How theſe vigorous actings of faith, do thus quiet and appeaſe the heart.</hi> And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>In that faith doth in the firſt place carry us out to rely on Chriſt as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, whereby all our iniquities and ſinnes are done away:</hi> If then ſinne and guilt be removed out of the way, there cannot be any trouble. For as if there had not been ſinne, the earth would not have brought forth briars and thornes: So neither were it not for iniquity eating into the conſcience, there would not be the leaſt fear and trouble upon the heart. This is the wind that makes ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an earthquake at laſt. Wonder not then, if <hi>Davids</hi> faith did compoſe his ſoul in reſpect of that outward danger, for it had before removed a greater evil; <hi>the guilt of ſinne</hi> was now blotted out, <hi>David</hi> is not in that caſe, as when he cryed out, that his <hi>bones were broken,</hi> and that <hi>God ſets his ſinnes before him.</hi> Oh that is a wofull condition, when the guilt of ſinne and afflictions both meet together, when outwardly we have no hope, and inwardly no hope! But this faith doth in the firſt place. It obtaineth reconciliation with God, it ſeeth <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his great <hi>hoſt</hi> drowned in the ſea; and then it doth eaſily over-look other afflictions, for the favour of God is able to ſweeten all calamities. Thus it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> he tryumphs over all imaginable adverſaries; but why is he thus confident? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>there is no condemnation to ſuch as are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If then the Sunne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, the dark night will be quickly diſpelled; and ſo if the light of Gods favour doth ariſe, the feares and troubles which ariſe from outward exerciſes are quickly diſſipated. If then thou complaineſt thy ſtrength is ſo ſmall, every temptation is ready to blow thee down; as certainly the leaſt puff will hurl a man down, if faith be not lively, the <hi>Damſels</hi> charging of <hi>Peter</hi> to be of Chriſts company, made him curſe and ſwear, and fearfully apoſtatize; here was no ſuch great cauſe, he was not arraigned, impriſoned, ſentenced to die; but this temptation blew down a ſtrong Oak: which teacheth us, that a little calamity may throw us to the ground, if faith be not lively; and a great one cannot, if faith be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous. If (I ſay) thou complaineſt of thy weakneſs, thy feares; Let faith in Chriſt as a Mediatour be more powerfully put forth.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith doth quiet and compoſe the ſpirit by impetration, or obtaining of God ſuch a ſpirit. For as you heard,</hi> ſeeing it lyeth not in the power of man, to give himſelf ſuch a ſweet bleſſed frame: No, he would give a world for it, if it lay in his power; it can only be obtained by application unto God: Now that which moſt prevaileth with God is <hi>faith, Whatſoever you ask believing, you ſhall have it:</hi> It's faith only that makes the omnipotent God work for thee and in thee; ſo that when we ſay faith makes the heart thus ſtill and quiet, you muſt not think it comes from faith as a <hi>natural cauſe,</hi> as the fire burneth; but <hi>morally</hi> by prevailing with God. This is the grace that God doth ſo honour; if we truſt on him, if we reſt on him, then God promiſeth to give reſt and peace to our ſoules: Inſomuch that it's <hi>a Chriſtians duty above all things to keep up the grace of faith,</hi> to attend to that, leſt the whole kingdome be loſt, when that is loſt; for God is to us as we believe, ſo God works for us as we truſt in him; ſo that our diſtruſt makes God to be as no God, or as an Idol-god, having eies not to ſee us, or hands not to help us. Gods power will not communicate it ſelf but upon believing; as Chriſt told <hi>Mary, Said I not unto thee, if thou wouldſt believe thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of the Lord?</hi> That glory was to make <hi>Lazarus, dead your dayes, and ſtinking in the grave to live again:</hi> Now no leſs glorious alterations,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101245:194"/>
and changes will God work upon thee if thou truſt in him; for hereby Gods <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> is engaged, and he will never deceive thoſe, that wholly rely upon him. You ſee then, why faith put forth in a lively manner, can thus quiet the ſoul: <hi>Becauſe it's the condition to which God doth make glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith doth inſtrumentally compoſe the ſoul, becauſe by it other graces are alſo ſet a work, and ſo the more purified and cleanſed the ſoul is from all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the clearer the heart is</hi>: As the clearer the ſpring is, then though it be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſtirred, yet for all that the ſtreames will be pure. Thus it is with a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, when his heart is ſanctified, cleanſed, and adorned with grace; then though he is plunged into tribulations, inſtead of diſcontent, impatience, grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and murmurings, inſtead of dejections and diſquietneſs there is joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and heavenly mindedneſs; as if Juniper or ſweet herbs be thrown into the fire, the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e draweth out their ſweet ſmel; or as the wind blowing upon the ſweet flower, makes it ſmell more fragrantly. Thus alſo when afflictions fall upon the godly, faith having purified their hearts, there do runne forth admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſweet breathings of the ſoul. That faith exciteth other graces, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Where all thoſe glorious acts of grace, which thoſe Worthies abounded in, are attributed unto their faith.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>Faith lively exerciſed muſt thus ſerene the heart of a man,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which Faith quieteth the Soul.</note> 
                           <hi>becauſe it doth ſuggeſt many noble and excellent arguments, which do abundantly quiet and eſtabliſh the ſoul.</hi> Faith is argumentative, it is very ingenious to find out all thoſe Conſiderations, which the Scripture affoards. Now the Scripture is like the Apothecaries ſhop, that can furniſh with all cordials. As</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Faith argueth from Gods giving of Chriſt, every thing elſe that is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us as Chriſt is.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>If he hath given us Chriſt, how ſhall he not with him give all things elſe?</hi> He doth not ſay <hi>ſome</hi> things, but <hi>all things</hi>; and then the expreſſion <hi>how ſhall he not?</hi> implyeth that it is a moſt abſurd and irrational thing to think otherwiſe. Now then faith doth thus quiet the ſoul. Be not afraid or troubled; the God that afflicts thee, is he that hath given Chriſt to thee. Now if ever God would have refuſed thee, it would have been in this: Know then, that theſe afflictions, theſe troubles, they are good for thee, they are neceſſary to humble thee, to make ſinne bitter, they are as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in their kind, as Chriſt was in his kind. It cannot be want of love, that theſe exerciſes are upon thee, for is not Chriſt the great pledge of Gods love to thee? Therefore faith turneth the heart of a man from that which is grievous and vexing, to that which is pleaſing and comfortable. Though God giveth not this or that outward mercy, yet he giveth Chriſt, the fountain and original of all.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith repreſents God out of his word in ſome Attributes chiefly above others, inſomuch that the heart of a man being thereby lifted up to heaven to God himſelf, it cannot be diſturbed by things below.</hi> As the Bird while ſoaring aloft in the heavens, is not skared with this fear and that noiſe; ſo while faith beareth up the heart to God, and makes abode with him, it's not diſquieted: It's the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the waters that make giddy; if we look up to the heavens, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſturb the brain. Now theſe things in God doth faith powerfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>The wiſdome of God</hi>; that whatſoever the Lord doth, it cannot be done wiſer: Therefore he is called <hi>the only wiſe God.</hi> Now what wonderfull comfort may be ſuggeſted from hence? That there is no affliction, no temptation, though never ſo heavy, but it cometh and is ordered by infinite wiſdome. If thou hadſt the diſpoſing and ordering of all things, it could not be done more wiſely then it is; nay thy own love to thy ſelf, if wiſe, would order this affliction to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101245:195"/>
thee. For do not you ſee a man, whoſe parts of body are gangreend; yet becauſe he is wiſe, though he loveth his eaſe, yet willingly reſigning himſelf to have thoſe parts cut off, for the good of the whole: So that is one of the moſt comfortable conſiderations which faith ſupplies the heart with, that whatſoever temptation is fallen upon thee, the wiſe God hath ordered it; ſo that to repine or to be diſcouraged, is to ſay in effect, Why is not God wiſer? Why doth he not order things with more perfect knowledge? Oh but as long as faith worketh, as long as that puts forth it ſelf, ſo long it beholds matter of wiſdome and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in all Gods proceedings.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>It repreſents the tender love and bowels of God as a Father,</hi> ſo that all thoſe ſtrokes they come from love. It's his very pity for a while to break and bruiſe them, that they may be healed more effectually. Is the Artificer angry with his plate when he breakes it, and throweth it into the fire? No, it's for to make it more compleat: If ſo be that we were wholly without corruption, if we could walk without ſinne, then God would no more afflict us here on earth, then he doth the glorified Saints and Angels in heaven; but our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſuch, that God did not love us or regard us, if he did not chaſtiſe us.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith repreſents the ſoveraignty and ſupream dominion, which God hath over the hearts of his children</hi>; therefore he is called <hi>the Father of Spirits.</hi> Now neither man himſelf, nor all the Angels of heaven, are able to give ſuch a compoſed frame. As God only knoweth the hearts of men, ſo he only faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and frameth them. If you ask, <hi>How is it poſſible that</hi> David <hi>ſhould be thus immoveable? What could keep in his corruption and fleſh from repining and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> I anſwer, it's God with whom all things are poſſible: It is this that faith ſuggeſts, though thy heart be impatient, though thou canſt not command the waves thereof to be ſtill, yet God in heaven can. Oh it's eaſily confeſſed, that it is not fleſh and blood that can make ſuch quiet calmneſs of ſoul! No, it muſt be an omnipotent work of the great God. Did not God put terrour into <hi>Cain</hi>'s heart, that though he had built Cities, though he did all he could to allay his ſpirit, yet ſtill he trembleth, and cannot but tremble?

                           </gap> contrary, God he puts joy into the heart of a believer, he bids it lye down and be content; and although never ſo many Hornets come buzzing to ſting him, yet faith keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them off: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>We have heard, that it is the property of <hi>faith</hi> depending on God in a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner, to compoſe and quiet the heart in the midſt of all calamities, as if there were none a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> all. Now becauſe even in wicked men, there is a carnal ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſpirit; that though the anger of God be upon them, though their ſinnes have found them out, yet they can take their eaſe and pleaſures, and lay nothing to heart, and this is an Epidemical diſeaſe. It is good therefore to ſearch into the bottome and difference of a gracious confidence, from a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                        <p>Now there are two <hi>ſorts of theſe carnally confident and ſecure men under their troubles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, There is the <hi>Stoical</hi> man, of whom <hi>Senecae</hi> and others of that ſect,<note place="margin">The Stoical Security.</note> do much boaſt: They ſpeak great and ſwelling words, about that man who ſhall fully have received their principles, and confirme himſelf therein: They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in ſuch a man an indolency and an impaſſibility; that let him be daſhed upon by never ſo many decumane waves, yet for all that he ſtands immoveable like a rock, and is not troubled. Hence is that ſpeech of theires ſo famous, that their wiſe man, if he were burning in <hi>Phalaris</hi> his Bull, he would cry out, <hi>Dulce eſt, &amp; ad me nihil pertinet.</hi> Thus the Stoical Philoſophy, would ſerve to ſet forth as admirable and compoſed a ſpirit under tribulations, as the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But</p>
                        <p>Let us diſcover <hi>the ſinfulneſs of ſuch a Stoical ſtupid ſpirit.</hi> And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Although the Stoicks did thus Thraſonically boaſt in their Books, and <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeakes high and tranſcendent ſpeeches in this matter, yet when they came to practiſe, they were <hi>feeble and effeminate:</hi> So that they were nothing but words, and empty expreſſions; witneſs that Stoick, who in his health had maintained that pain was nothing; it was but a fancy when he was grievouſly tormented with the Gout, cryed out of his errour, acknowledging when he ſaid ſo, he did not know what pain meant. But now if we look upon the godly in the midſt of their exerciſes, we ſhall find, they did <hi>really put forth ſuch calm and joyfull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, under the heavieſt preſſures. David</hi> (you heard) ſaid, he had done thus, as well as he would do ſo, and the Apoſtles went out <hi>rejoycing from the Councel,</hi> where they had been perſecuted, <hi>becauſe they were accounted worthy to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt,</hi> Act. 5.41. And thus the many thouſands of Martyrs; they did, though not in <hi>Phalaris his Bull,</hi> yet in as great torments, cry out, Oh how ſweet and comfortable is this! So that no ſect in Philoſophy, the Stoicks nor none elſe are able to bring ſuch a multitude of Martyrs, as the Chriſtian Religion hath: Therefore it's only Gods Word, and the Spirit of God, that can enable us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and take our reſt under ſad afflictions.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>The Stoical diſcipline did teach a brutiſh ſtupidity and ſenſleſneſs under miſeries:</hi> They would deſtroy the very paſſions of grief and fear from a man. Thus they make a man to be no better then a ſtock or a ſtone, that is ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the hammer and axe that comes upon it; but <hi>Chriſtian Religion doth not take away affections, but it moderateth and ordereth them. David</hi> you ſee, though thus calme in his ſpirit, yet he is affected with his calamity; he goeth bare foot, covereth his head, and weepeth as he goeth, and Chriſt himſelf wept at <hi>Lazarus</hi> his death. It's the Scriptures rule, neither to deſpiſe the affliction of God, nor yet to ſink under it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. We do then preach, that when God brings into ſtreights, we ſhould not prophanely ſlight them, and not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

our ſelves under Gods hand; or that we ſhould become like bruit beaſts, and be void of an holy fear and grief under his chaſtiſements: But we are ſo to be affected, as yet not to be ſinfully diſquieted. The heart is to be moved, but not to be diſturbed.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, This Stoical ſenſleſneſs is not a gracious calmeneſs, <hi>becauſe it doth wholly depend upon their own ſtrength and power.</hi> It was from ſome pretnded inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You ſee <hi>David</hi> here and in other places, whenſoever he proclaimeth exceeding quietneſs in his heart, it is ſtill <hi>from God,</hi> not from himſelf, becauſe <hi>the Lord takes care for him,</hi> becauſe <hi>the Lord is his ſtrength and his helper</hi>; inſomuch that if we conſider the motive and original of theſe two confidences, we ſhall find them as diſtant from each other, as the Eaſt from the Weſt; we ſhall find that the one comes from within, the other from without; and therefore that the one is a meer puff, and inflated tumor of the ſoul, a meer buble, which of it ſelf would break, but the other ſolid and induring, being the ſtrength of God himſelf who is omnipotent; for Gods ſtrength is vouchſafed to a godly man, and Chriſt ſheweth forth his power in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. <hi>When I am weak, then I am ſtrong.</hi> Whereas the proud Philoſoper, when he was ſtrong, then he was weak: Yea <hi>Paul</hi> findeth a kind of omnipotency in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but not of himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>This Philoſophical boldneſs is only for carnal and vain ends; it was for vain glory, it was to pleaſe their own humours</hi>; it was not to glorifie God, to ſet up his power and goodneſs. You ſee <hi>Davids Pſalmes</hi> breathing forth <hi>praiſe and honour to God continually,</hi> you ſee there is nothing owned but Gods power; whereas whatſoever theſe Apes of fortitude and courage did, it was for vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and to ſet up themſelves. The Martyrs were ſo humble and ſenſible of their unworthineſs, even under their greateſt joy and ſupport, that they refuſed the name of Martyr, as too great a word: They ſaid Chriſt only deſerved to be called ſo; for the Scripture gives him that name: So that the wonderful ſtrength and conſolations, wherein the Martyrs did abound, were accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with deep apprehenſions of their own unworthineſs, at that very time.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Mirth and jollity of moſt wicked men under Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: How it differs from a gratious Confidence.</note>In the ſecond place, Let us come more cloſely to <hi>the generall diſeaſe of all people almoſt</hi>; and that is of ſuch, who though afflicted, though ſtricken with diſeaſes, and ready to give up the ghoſt, or though the hand of God be againſt them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes; yet they will ſay, I will lay me down and ſleep, yea I will ſet my ſelf down, <hi>and drink, and make my ſelf merry, ſinging not care only, but all godly ſorrow away.</hi> Is not this the general corruption of moſt men, who when under the ſad paſſages of Gods providence towards them, they runne to merry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? They do all they can to chaſe away any ſorrowfull thoughts, and think <hi>their only remedy to be carnal pleaſures.</hi> But let not the prophane jolly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure man boaſt in this; for hell doth not more differ from heaven, then this diſpoſition of the godly man, from carnal confidence. For</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>This ariſeth from a meer bruitiſh ſtupidity.</hi> There hearts are hardened, and are like a Stone or Adamant; ſo that as theſe melt not into water by any art, ſo neither will theſe ſtupid ſinners apprehend the danger they are in, though never ſo afflicted. <hi>Though a fool be pounced in a morter, yet his folly will not depart from him.</hi> He doth no more learn under afflictions, then the bruit beaſts. Do not call this mans his confidence, but his ſottiſhneſſe; his ſtupidity. It's with him, as the Drunkard <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.34, 35. who when he is in as great
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101245:196"/>
danger as one that lyeth down in the Sea, or that lyeth upon the top of a Maſt, yet he feareth not: They have ſtricken him, but he felt it not. So that what a miſerable creature a ſenſleſſe ſottiſh Drunkard is, tumbling in the Streets, and trampled upon, yet feeling nothing at all, ſuch miſerable wretches are theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed ſinners; even like the wanton Calf, that leapes up and down, while pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the ſlaughter: Whereas holy confidence is accompanied with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act tenderneſſe and heavenly feeling, as of their own infirmities, ſo alſo of Gods power and grace.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>This prophane ſecurity, as it comes from ſottiſhneſſe and ſtupidity, ſo from desperate ignorance and blindneſſe.</hi> If they did know what curſes might every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fall upon them; if they did but apprehend the wrath of God ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure them; Oh, how quickly would their jollity be turned into mourning, and their laughter into howling! Stupidity and ignorance commonly go together; yea, one is the cauſe of the other. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18, 19. <hi>Their underſtandings were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the blindneſſe upon them, and then they were paſt feeling.</hi> The blind man doth not ſee the deep ditch, and dangerous holes he is ready to fall into. And therefore obſerve thoſe, who in time of affliction, diſeaſe or dangers, have ſuch ſecurity upon them, and ſee if they be not miſerable, poor, and ignorant men, that know nothing of ſinne; the damnable nature and guilt of it: That conſider not what it is, to lie roaring in hell torments to all eternity. So that all the eaſe they have, is becauſe they are a blind ignorant people. But now the godly mans confidence ariſeth from ſpiritual knowledge; and the more his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is inlightened, the more holy ſecurity he hath. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth, that <hi>Believers might grow in the knowledg of Gods love, the depth and bredth of it,</hi> Ephſ 1.5, 3. Becauſe the more this is known, the more confident and quiet they are. And this is the reaſon why Gods people at firſt, while the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of ſinne are freſh and terrible upon them, while the Law is powerfull in its operations, they have not ſuch a calm and ſerene ſpirit: It is for want of that Scripture knowledg of God. The more they know the Promiſe, and the nature of God and Chriſt revealed, the greater boldneſſe and confidence they have.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>The ſecurity that wicked men have, ariſeth from an immoderate deſire to take their pleaſures while they may have them, being deſperate for the future, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting no good hereafter.</hi> And truly, this is the condition of many; their hearts are filled with a deſperate fool-hardineſſe, that they will take their pleaſures and jollity while they may; They expect little in the world to come. So that theſe very conſiderations which ſhould take them off from ſuch ſecurity, through their corruptions they further themſelves in. See this notably deſcribed <hi>Eſa.</hi> 22 12, 13. When God call'd to weeping and mourning, there was <hi>eating fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wine,</hi> the clearn contrary: And what moved them? even the ſad condition they were in: <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die.</hi> Oh, why not rather, Let us mourn and humble our ſelves, for we ſhall die! But they are deſperate; They will take their pleaſures while they may, they know not how ſoon they may be deprived of them. Such as theſe are filled up with deſperate prophaneneſſe. That as <hi>Saul</hi> and his Armour-bearers did deſperately throw themſelves upon the Spear, to kill themſelves: Thus do theſe men laugh and drink, and will have their pleaſures, though they know death will deprive them of all. Such men are ſaid to <hi>make a league with hell and the grave</hi>; They will do well enough for all this. Or rather, they think they ſhall be damned; their conſcience ſecretly whiſpers that to them; therefore they will have their pleaſures while they can. O miſerable and wretched men, wo be to ſuch that ever they were born.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, This prophane ſecurity differeth from ſpiritual confidence, <hi>in reſpect of the Author and efficient cauſe</hi>: For it's plain who giveth <hi>David</hi> this holy quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; it's <hi>God that maketh him dwell confidently</hi>; it's God that commands reſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101245:197"/>
and eaſe to the ſoul; whereas this carnal ſecurity cometh wholly <hi>from the Devil:</hi> It's he that lulle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h them aſleep. Our Saviour diſcovered this in that parable, when he ſaid, <hi>While the ſtrong one kept the houſe, all things were in quiet.</hi> You would wonder to ſee a man curſe and ſwear, and follow all the pleaſures of his heart; yet that he can lay himſelf to ſleep; that he ſhould not think his chamber would be as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ull of Devils, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s was full of frogs: That he ſhould not cry out, Oh, I dare not ſleep, for fear this night the Devils fetch my ſoul to hell. Now all this carnal ſecurity in his ſpirit, ariſeth from the Devil, who is ſaid to <hi>reign in the hearts of the children of diſobedience:</hi> It's he that filleth the ſoul with ſpiritual madneſſe. As when he poſſeſſed the bodies of men, he threw them into the fire and water, and made them cut and launce their bodies, without any grief at all; the like he doth upon the ſouls of men, hurrying them into beaſtly, wicked, and ungodly waies; and by that meanes, even into hell it ſelf, as he did the Herd of Swine, when he entred into them, carrying them violently into the Sea. What was it that made <hi>Judas</hi> ſo deſperately betray innocent blood, though he had ſo much warning; ſo many admonitions to the contrary? Though ſome were ſtricken down with amazement, yet nothing will ſtop him; The Devil did drive him: The Devil had entred into his heart, even as he did alſo fill <hi>Ananias</hi> his heart. So that as you ſee it's with godly men, when filled with the holy Ghoſt, they would boldly confeſſe Chriſt, though they endured all torments for it: Thus when the Devil hath poſſeſſion of mens hearts, and the Lord leaveth them to his temptations, then they are mad and obſtinate; they ſcoff and mock at the Day of Judgment. As the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tels us of ſuch prophane mockers; <hi>Where is the day of his coming? Are not all things as they were,</hi> 2 Pet. 3 4. Thus like <hi>Leviathan,</hi> they laugh at the Spear; and as the Prophets hearers, becauſe he ſo often preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>burden of the Lord,</hi> therefore they took it up by way of ſcoff; <hi>The burden of the Lord, The burden of the Lord.</hi> Thus do they about hell and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Carnal ſecurity differeth from this heavenly confidence, in reſpect of the Concomitants and Companions.</hi> For though <hi>David</hi> had this great quietneſſe of ſoul, knowing God would help him, yet he doth carefully uſe all the meanes God hath appointed: He doth not preſume or tempt God, but he <hi>prayeth to God,</hi> and flyeth for his ſafety, and getteth all the poſſible ſuccour he can. So in that grand aſſurance and confidence which the people of God have about their eternal happineſſe, there is alſo an holy fear and trembling. Therefore the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to <hi>work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who had ſo much confidence, as to ſay, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt?</hi> yet he <hi>kept under his body, leſt when he had preached to others, he himſelf ſhould become a reprobate,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. But as for the wicked careleſſe man, he promiſeth himſelf all happineſſe and future good, though he ſit ſtill, and ſtirre not a foot towards Heaven; yea, though he go in the contrary path, yet he flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, as if that were the way to happineſſe.</p>
                        <p>

Oh, turn your joy into ſorrow! Go out with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and let God ſee you ſmite upon the breaſt, and ſtrike upon the thigh, crying out, Oh, what have I done! Oh, mad wretch that I am! merry and jolly, when in the Devils dungeon; when in the chains of darkneſſe; when upon the very borders of Hell? It may ſhortly be no more ſaid, ſuch an one is eating and drinking, but his body rotting in the Grave, and his ſoul roaring in Hell.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Effect</hi> is, <hi>To dwell in ſafety. David</hi> though now in baniſhment, and had no Houſe of his own to lay his head in, yet is as confident, as if he had been at reſt in his dwelling place. But becauſe all that dwell, are not ſecure; eſpecially in times of violence and warre, therefore he addeth <hi>ſafety.</hi> Some tranſlate the word <hi>in Spe,</hi> in <hi>Hope</hi>; and ſo it may denote both the outward <hi>condition,</hi> and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>dispoſition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Here is the <hi>ſolitarineſſe</hi> of this <hi>Efficiency, It's God alone.</hi> It's not <hi>David</hi>'s own care, nor the aſiſtance of others, but God alone: All the glory is to be aſcribed ſolely to him. Indeed, ſome relate the word to <hi>David,</hi> as if <hi>David</hi> though alone, God made him dwell in ſafety: He can keep one man ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, in the midſt of all enemies. Thus God promiſeth to <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 33.28. <hi>Iſrael ſhalt dwell in ſafety alone.</hi> But we rather take it as attributed to God: And thence Obſerve,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That it is God alone, who doth preſerve in ſafety.</hi>

                        <p>Did he withdraw his protection, every ſtone in the ſtreet, every tile on the Houſe, might be an Executioner. If we conſider how many waies man is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to death and dangers, we muſt acknowledge it even a Miracle, that we riſe ſafe, and go to bed in ſafety. It's good to ſuggeſt this truth to you; for who is there that doth acknowledge God in theſe common mercies? That bleſſeth God
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101245:198"/>
for preſerving him daily in his <hi>wits,</hi> in his <hi>ſenſes,</hi> in <hi>bodily health</hi> and dangers? For although theſe be bodily mercies, and we delight in them as ſuch, yet we do not look up to God the Giver of them; whereas that Petition, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread,</hi> doth not only extend to nouriſhment, but Protection alſo. It's God giveth every crum of Bread: It's God giveth thee breath, every time thou breatheſt. The Pſalmiſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.1, 2.) doth extend this ſafety, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to particular perſons, but <hi>Families,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi>: All care in a <hi>Family,</hi> all military power in a <hi>City</hi> is in vain, if God doth not guard it.

                           <note place="margin">Angels.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that ſome godly men have greatly blamed Chriſtians, that they are no more thankfull to God for thoſe Guardes he hath appointed them. Not that we are to pray unto Angels, or that there is a peculiar Tutelar Angel vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to every man; though not only the Papiſts, but even ſome of the Antients, and of later Orthodox Divines, have been of that Opinion, though abhorring all Angel-worſhip. Not (I ſay) to determine that; yet in the generall it's plain, that the Scripture makes the Angels to be <hi>our helps and defenders.</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that by them as Inſtruments, we are preſerved from thoſe falls and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which otherwiſe would come upon us. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. God is there ſaid <hi>to give his Angels charge over us.</hi> Yea, <hi>They ſhall bear thee up in their hands, as a tender Nurſe beareth a young Child</hi>; that the godly do not ſo much as daſh a foot againſt the ſtone.

And ſo you have a full place to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth about thoſe that fear him.</hi> Oh, how many preſervations, how many Providences do we conſtantly receive, and never take any notice of!</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Gods Providential Preſervation is two-fold; either <hi>General,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">III</note> which extends to all creatures, or <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>Particular,</hi> that reacheth in a peculiar manner to the godly.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>general</hi> Preſervation, is in reſpect, even of Beaſts themſelves. Therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36 6. <hi>David</hi> takes notice of Gods hand, that <hi>preſerveth man and beaſt.</hi> Hence (<hi>Mat</hi> 6.) <hi>A ſparrow</hi> (ſo inconſiderable a Bird, yet) <hi>doth not fall to the ground, without Providence.</hi> It hath indeed, been the Opinion of ſome, yea ſome Fathers; That the Providence of God doth not extend to minute and particular things: But the Scripture is clear in this. So that the leaſt fly cannot move it ſelf, or the worm creep, without Gods Providence. It's God then, that preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the irrational creatures, and that without any derogation to his Majeſty; for he cannot but do it, becauſe of his ſupream Perfection.</p>
                        <p>But then for the <hi>Preſervation of man,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Believers</hi>; there his care is more ſingular and peculiar. In this ſenſe ſome expound that place, <hi>The Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all men, eſpecially thoſe that believe,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.10. Gods care to his people, is notably diſcovered by our Saviours expreſſion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.18. where he ſaith, <hi>Not one hair of our head ſhall fall to the ground</hi>: Compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.30. <hi>The very hairs are numbered.</hi> So then, the leaſt danger cannot befall us, without the Providence of our heavenly <hi>Father.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hence it is that all the dangers, yea and death it ſelf, comes by Gods appointment</hi>: No ſooner or later, nor no other waies then he hath decreed.<note place="margin">IIII.</note> Thus <hi>David</hi> comforted himſelf, that though his enemies plotted againſt him, yet <hi>his times were in Gods hand</hi>; and to God <hi>do belong the iſſues of death,</hi> Pſal. 68.20, So that it lyeth not in the power of all thy enemies, to kill thee when they will. <hi>David</hi> did often acknowledge this, That it was God, who did preſerve him in all his trouble.

Not upon that ground which the Stoick ſaid, <hi>Si fatale eſt ut convaleſcat, fatale etiam eſt ut medicum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibeat</hi>: If it be the deſtiny to be well, it will be the deſtiny to call for the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; but becauſe <hi>Gods Decree doth include in it the meanes.</hi> So that we muſt ſay, <hi>God hath appointed in the uſe of meanes, to prolong ſuch a mans life,</hi> viz. <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s <hi>nineteen years</hi> longer. It's true, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The wicked ſhall not live out half their daies</hi>; but that is in reſpect of their hopes and expectations, as alſo in reſpect of the ordinary courſe of nature. Many men by their wickedneſſe do ſhorten their daies, in reſpect of ſecond cauſes. Therefore do not ſinfully fear this or that will kill thee, for thy times are in Gods hand, and he hath appointed the <hi>period</hi> of any godly mans life in much mercy, becauſe they have done their work; and to preſerve them from great evils to come.</p>

                        <p>And one remarkeable way, is, <hi>By reſtraining and keeping them from ſuch counſels or actions that may bring death and danger.</hi> Do we not ſee raſhneſſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially drunkenneſſe and other vices, which make men bold, are the cauſe of many a mans death? God therefore keeps his people in a ſober and wel-adviſed way. Why is it ſaid, <hi>That wicked men ſhall not live out half their daies,</hi> but that the ungodlineſſe of men doth bring them to untimely deaths? Yea, we read of that good King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> whoſe death was ſo much lamented, that he brought it upon him by raſhneſſe, and fooliſh temerity; for he would unneceſſarily go and fight with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Necho</hi>; and though he was ſo ſeriouſly adviſed to the contrary, yet he would adventure to his ruine, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. <hi>David</hi> himſelf, by his own unbelief and ſinne, did bring himſelf into danger. And in the matter of <hi>Achiſh,</hi> when he was forced to feign himſelf mad; but alwaies while he was in Gods way, every thing proſpered with him. Therefore Gods mercy is eſpecially ſeen to the godly, in that he makes them <hi>keep within their calling and bounds</hi>; and that is a ſafe way. If you obſerve, you ſhall find the greateſt dangers befall men out of their Calling. They go beyond their bounds, and then they ſmart for it. The Bird is ſafeſt, while ſhe is on her Neſt. Therefore when the Devil tempted our Saviour to throw himſelf down the Pinacle of the Temple, he anſwered, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt God, Mat.</hi> 4 7.
