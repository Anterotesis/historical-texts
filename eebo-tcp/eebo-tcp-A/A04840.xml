            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pious Alacrity he vtters his intentions to an Act

<hi>Decernere, Constituere,</hi> to purpose, or to resolue.
<hi>Resolutions</hi> are the Moulds wherein Actions are
cast; and no man can define a <hi>Deed</hi> better, then to
call it the effect of what our purpose had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
And euery purpose is a silent Dialogue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Soule and her Faculties, by whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that which we resolue, is established. For man
is a <hi>Theater,</hi> wherein are many subtile spectators,
waiting vpon euery action; He is a short Modell
of a Common-wealth. Each Sense is an Agent,
each Faculty an Officer; Hee hath his <hi>Common-Pleas</hi>
in his <hi>Common sense;</hi> his <hi>Chancery</hi> in the
<hi>Conscience;</hi> he hath his <hi>Proiectors,</hi> and those as
busie, as the State hath any; <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
and the quicke <hi>Imagination.</hi> The <hi>Memory</hi> is
his <hi>Recorder;</hi> and lastly, the Tongue is the <hi>Speaker</hi>
in <hi>this</hi> Assembly, who reports those Acts which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8472:5"/>
which are designed: <hi>I said.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Intents doe not alwayes come to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,
nay they do not alwayes need it; and then
the office of the tongue is not required. A resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may sometimes speake without the Organs
of vtterance;<note place="margin">Ambros. offic. lib. 1: cap. 3.</note> it may be intelligible, it may be audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and yet not vocall: As Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> speakes
of <hi>Susanna, Conscientia loquebatur vbi vox non
audiebatur.</hi> In religious purposes that determine
in God; and in which there is no parties intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
but God, and the soule; there is no necessity
to vse words. Words are but the Interpreters of
our mindes one to another, but as Midwiues that
deliuer our thoughts; and howeuer betwixt Man
and Man this verball trafficke be necessary: yet
betwixt vs and God that sees our thoughts before
the tongue hath formed them into syllables, or set
the stampe of language vpon them, it is not so. He
reades vs in the power of speech, and not onely in
the Organs which actuate that power: Hee is the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>, so well acquainted with the heart,
that he dictates to it, as it doth to the tongue.
And therefore hee that vnderstand our words
whilest they are in <hi>Principijs,</hi> in their concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and parentage; whilest they are yet <hi>Intra
causas,</hi> lodged and couched within their causes,
(as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> expresseth it; <hi>Vox mea non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in ore erat, &amp; auris Dei iam in Corde erat.</hi>
He, I say, that knowes our thoughts, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we vtter them in words, but before wee our
selues know what we shall next thinke, cannot need
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8472:5"/>
a <hi>Dixi (I said)</hi> to informe him of our purposes:
since his intelligence precedes our thoughts, hee
cannot but take his information from them, better
then from our words; and so the sense of the Text
will hold as well in a <hi>Cogitavi</hi> (as one Translation
of ours reades it) <hi>I thought I will confesse,</hi> as in a
<hi>Dixi, I said.</hi> For in Gods apprehension they are all
one, and no way distinguisht, saue in a little Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of time; for <hi>thoughts</hi> are words elder Brothers:
and the Dialect they speake, is our Mother tongue,
the originall language of Mankinde which neuer
yet suffered confusion. When the tongues were
dispersed at <hi>Babel,</hi> the <hi>thoughts</hi> were not; and
howsoeuer each Nation be distinguished in his
peculiar speech, we all thinke alike; euen as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and laughter haue the same wayes of expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in all parts of the world. So that this <hi>Dixi</hi>
was not so much the language of <hi>Dauids</hi> Tongue,
as of his Heart;<note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. 32.</note>

               <p>He that hath opportunity to vnfold his griefe,
hath made the first approach to comfort; and he
that hath the Grace to acknowledge his fault, is in
a ready way to pardon: There is no affliction so
great as his, that wants a tongue to vtter it; and
there is no sinne of such a desperate malignity, as
the silent sinne; when the Offender is dumbe and
speechlesse. A <hi>misery</hi> lodg'd in the heart, is like an
<hi>Exhalation</hi> inclosed within the Earth, which
shakes the foundation of Reason, and Patience; or
like a <hi>dampe,</hi> it ouerlayes the Spirits, <hi>Strangulat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusus

Eye, to weepe out at, or a vent by the tongue,
streight it growes tamer. When once a window
is opened to giue it Aire, that fume which would
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8472:6"/>
haue stifled vs, breathes out, &amp; cleares the roome.
Such a Meteore, such a boysterous Exhalation is
sinne. What strange convulsions doth it cause
within the soule? How doth it contract our hopes
of Mercy; and like an East-winde dry vp, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our comforts? what stormes, what guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts,
what blacke cloudes of despaire doth it raise
in the Conscience? but so soone as a sinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects
himselfe, is brought to a remorse, how
calmely is the storme allayed, by a religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition?
how sweetly doth this cloud discharge it
selfe, when it relents into a showre of penitent
teares? For 'tis the most naturall way for sinne to
evaporate by the eye, (as <hi>Elias Cretensis</hi> sayes)
<hi>Ex peccati fumo ortae sunt la chrymae:</hi> Lastly, how
gently doth this dangerous vapour breathe out by

serue me for a <hi>Preface</hi> to
to my ensuing discourse. My subject being so full
of <hi>straitnes,</hi> if I would hold proportion with it, will
not giue me the libertie of a larger introduction.
Yet before I take the words asunder, you must take
along with you, some <hi>Praecognita,</hi> some <hi>presupposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
by which you may looke back from my <hi>Text,</hi>
to the beginning of this Chapter, and haue therein
a briefe <hi>Epitome</hi> of the <hi>History</hi> here contained.
<hi>Israel</hi> had againe provoked the Lord to anger,<note place="margin">Connexion.</note> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8472:23"/>
his former chastisements for their
sinnes. Now sinne seldome goes without some pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
attending on it. God was in their debt,
<hi>and againe his anger was kindled against them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 1.</note> In
this anger, he permits <hi>Dauid</hi> their King to add his
sinne to theirs; and so to fill vp the measure and
number of their transgressions, by his own, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the people vnnecessarily and vnlawfully. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
commands and preuailes against <hi>Ioab</hi> and the
<hi>Princes,</hi> that gainesayed it at the first; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
lest they should loose his fauour, they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his commands. His sinne was 9 moneths and
odd dayes old, before he saw it: and the Lord let
him see the deformitie of it, at this growth, by some
visitation different from the great pestilence he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
offered him; as some collect out of 1
Chron. 27. 24. wherevpon he recall'd <hi>Ioab, (he fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
not the numbring, because there fell wrath for
it against Israel.)</hi> His owne heart hereupon smote
him first, &amp; he acknowledged his folly: &amp; present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Gad</hi> his <hi>Seer</hi> was sent to let him know, that God
would also smite him for this follie: yet with such
a mercifull hand, <hi>Dauid</hi> might conceiue, it was
rather for <hi>discipline,</hi> then <hi>destruction,</hi> and vpon as
easie termes as might sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d with his justice. Strike he
would; yet so, that <hi>Dauid</hi> should prescribe in what
kinde: whether by <hi>famine, sword,</hi> or <hi>pestilence.</hi> And
although these conditions seeme hard on <hi>man's</hi>
part, who is the <hi>delinquent,</hi> because they are all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be avoided, then chosen: yet they are easie
and moderate, on <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Iudges</hi> part: who needed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8472:23"/>
not to haue giuen any at all. Nay any one of them,
or all at once, and thousands more, he might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
injustice haue inflicted. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi>
thought himselfe mercifully dealt with, and vpon
his second wiser thoughts, professeth as much in
my text. <hi>Dixit autem David ad Gad: Coarctor,

               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> is here the <hi>Delinquent,</hi> arraigned a little
before, v. 12. but by none of his glorious titles: as
they are giuen him in the precedent chap. v. 1. <hi>The
anointed of the God of Iacob: the sweet Psalmist of
Israel,</hi> &amp;c. But as the <hi>Lord</hi> instructed <hi>Gad, Goe and
say vnto Dauid: plaine Dauid.</hi> It was the <hi>King</hi>
when he commanded <hi>Ioab,</hi> to goe and number the
people: but it is now <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he is convented
and vnder discipline. But whether we haue him by
the <hi>title of the King,</hi> we are sure it is <hi>the Person of
the King.</hi> And when <hi>Great ones</hi> sinne, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
doe it, according to the eminencie of their
place, with authority, with a high hand. In this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
the <hi>King</hi> would satisfie his curiositie, &amp; that
meerely, in hauing the summe of the people taken;
<hi>Vt sciam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>that I may know the number of the people.</hi>
A knowledge <hi>vnfruitfull</hi> at the best, and sauouring
of <hi>infidelity</hi> also; being he had a promise from the
Lord, that his people should be as the <hi>starres</hi> for
number, or the <hi>sands</hi> on the sea shore. Yet he was
so transported with this humor, that say what <hi>Ioab</hi>
and all the <hi>Captaines</hi> would, the <hi>King's word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed.

time this goes to curbe or oppose that, they will

presently shake hands with virtue, and banish out
of their actions <hi>Optimus,</hi> so they may but retaine

               <p>It is likely <hi>David</hi> slept but little that night. For he

               <p>And for what are his denunciations and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

<hi>Gad vnto David.</hi> That <hi>Avenger</hi> beares no hostile

where and how he intendes to wound him. And
that partie must be very negligent of his owne

prevent the blowe hee sees comming. The Lord
therefore herein dealt with <hi>David</hi> (and <hi>David</hi>

we may goe and doe the like. For this farther fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
holy <hi>David</hi> found in the sight of the Lord,
that hee sent the <hi>same prophet</hi> the second time,

Yet such was the variety here presented to <hi>David:</hi>
all euills of punishment, all harbingers for death,
but vnder diuerse shapes: all distastfull to flesh and
bloud, that it wonderfully poses and puzzles him
vpon which he should determine. And <hi>variety</hi> of
objects distracts euen <hi>in good things.</hi> We haue

which to choose, he knew not.</hi> He saw it was so
happy for his owne good to be with <hi>Christ,</hi> yet so
needfull for the good of others to haue his dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
differd. We may commonly obserue there
are the worst stomacks at the best furnisht tables.
When it is <hi>Coena dubia,</hi> the <hi>Guests</hi> knowe not what
to tast first, and so omit all, hauing full eies, but
empty panches. Thus also are many <hi>Students</hi>
more pos'd with the multitude of bookes, then the
difficultie of their matter. The <hi>Authors of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode</hi>
are so numerous, that they become to some
the <hi>Authors of Confusion,</hi> who cannot discerne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
so many pathes, what tract is best to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
It was therefore a iudicious obseruation of a
graue <hi>professour,</hi> (though it may seeme a <hi>Paradoxe</hi>
in our <hi>Vniversities,)</hi> that our <hi>rich Libraries,</hi> made
but <hi>meane Scholars.</hi> Vpon this ground: because
either out of their greedines of knowledge, and
inconstant curiositie, they will <hi>tast</hi> of all <hi>Authors,</hi>

reading is wearines to the flesh)</hi> and they thinke it
too long a taske for so short a life, to turne ouer so
much as the <hi>Indexes</hi> of all, they growe oscitant, &amp;
will peruse none. This is like the turning off a
<hi>Greyhound</hi> at the whole <hi>Heard:</hi> where his game is
so plentifull, and he hath so many in chase, that he
pinches none.</p>
               <p>Now where there is <hi>variety,</hi> but all <hi>are mala
culpae,</hi> the diuerse <hi>waies on the right hand and the
left, that lead to destruction,</hi> the <hi>number</hi> may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of election, but not <hi>the matter.</hi> Though all
sinnes be not aequall, yet all are aequally to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded
and declined. For there are some things
of that nature, that a man must not yeeld to,
though the <hi>Rack,</hi> or other most exquisite <hi>torments</hi>
should be vsed, to extort his consent. Therefore
it was a noble resolution of one of the <hi>Princes of
Condee,</hi> to whom the <hi>French King Charles the</hi> 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
made this offer, and bid him make his choice; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would heare a <hi>Masse,</hi> or suffer prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t <hi>death,</hi>
or perpetuall <hi>Imprisonment.</hi> He was as suddaine,
as religious and zealous in his answere, <hi>Primum
Deo juuante nunquam eligam. As to the first, I detest
the Idolatrous Masse: and for the other 2. I leaue
them and my selfe to the will of the King; yet hope
the Lord will order and dispose these also to the best.</hi>
With such courage did that <hi>mother,</hi> happy in the

rather to vndergoe all torments,<note place="margin">Macc: 7.</note> then to prolong

It is good to see the bottome of a danger at

the heat of an affliction will be soone past over,
it addes comfort and courage and resolution to
the patients, who hope for release, at the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of that short time. It was <hi>King Davids
discretion</hi> here, since he could not resolue, which

Commentators,</hi> could see a <hi>determinate choice</hi> of
