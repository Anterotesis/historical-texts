            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

who tooke such great paines and travailes for the benefit of us, and succeeding generations: I have therefore in this booke se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected many, and those speciall observations, out of Authentick Authors, famous for their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and approoved for truth in all ages, containing the acts of many Emperours and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Solemnization of their birth-dayes, with the Triumphs and Pompes that were then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as also their Funeralls, the destrunction of many Cities, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>: they containe also many Customes, Rites, Conditions, manners of many strange Nations, and describing the properties and natures of sundry Creatures, as Beasts, Birds, Fishes, and also of Mettalls, and Minerals, as Gold, Silver, Lead, Quick-silver, Iron,
<pb facs="tcp:9426:6"/>
and the like; as also remarkable things of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> and their Prophesies, with the Orders of <hi>Knighthood,</hi> that are now the most famous through the world: the beginnings and invention of many <hi>Mysteries</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> as of <hi>Printing,</hi> and the invention of the great <hi>Bombards,</hi> and such like, which I doubt not but will yeeld satisfaction to all that are addicted to these kinds of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Now there will not want those that will be readier to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, then to encourage my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in this kinde, objecting that it seemes to be needlesse to read them here, when as they can have them in the proper Authours: I answer, though some few may be so well stored with <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Bookes,</hi> yet there bee thousands that neither are furnished with <hi>Bookes,</hi> nor
<pb facs="tcp:9426:7"/>
yet with the <hi>Languages</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours writ in, and so are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deprived of this benefit. Howsoever, I have laboured, and I repent mee not; for this <hi>Booke</hi> will bee beneficiall to all that shall without prejudicate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions read it, and herein they have the choycest flowers, pickt and cull'd out of many <hi>Gardens</hi> for their benefit, and what more is, they may in lesse time, and little charges obtaine their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires by this, which they cannot by many Bookes: For reading with a strict collection, (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the difficulty of Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is knowne to all men of judgement to be difficult, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and troublesome; yet I weigh none of these, so that my Labours may afford any profit to the perusers of them.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9426:89"/>
cover it in very faire linnen clothes. Afterward they carry the body out of the Citty into some place; for they thinke it an hainous thing to bury one in the Temple. Their monkes go before the Herse with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, the Priests follow singing untill they come unto his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher or grave: if it be for a poore man that is dead, they gather mony in every street for the labour and paines of the religious, and that they offer unto him. The friends of the dead commeth oftentimes to the grave weeping and bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and they set the Sacrifice of their meats for the dead upon the monument; as bread, flesh, cheese, egges, milke, and the feast is of nine dayes space after the manner of the Ethnicks, and all this is eaten for the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:9426:90"/>
soule of the dead, of the poore, or else of the Fowles of the ayre, or Ants; for they say it is as acceptable unto God, to give and offer almes to bruit beastes and Fowles needing it, as unto men, when it is offered for the love of God.</p>
               <p>There bee some that set Birds at liberty to fly, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained and shut up, giving mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney according to to the value of the birds. Some cast bread to fish in the water for Gods sake, saying, that they shall get of God a noble reward for such bounty and pitty towards those that need it. The <hi>Turkes</hi> have also three divers manners of washing them, the first is a sprinkling of all the whole body with Water, and that this should not be in vaine nor frustrate, they shave the haires
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9426:90"/>
from every part of their body, saving onely the beards in men, and the haires upon womens heads. And yet they wash them very curiously and kembe them often, therefore in the more famous Cities there be Bathes which they use continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Where there bee no such, they have some secret place prepared to wash them in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that they may bee well cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with water before they go out of the house. They have another kinde of washing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing necessary, as when they ease nature of superfluities. For then in some secret place they wash their secret parts, there is none seene standing or upright when hee delivereth nature of superfluous burdens. The third kinde of washing is to purifie the instruments of sences wherein
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:9426:91"/>
they wash both hands and arms, even to the elbowes, then their mouth, their nostrills, and all their face. Both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe make a scraping of filthy places every moneth twice or thrice, but especially when they frequent the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, otherwise they should be burnt as violaters &amp; prophaners of a sacred place. They use such severity in warre, that no souldier dare take away any thing unjustly, for if he doth, he shall be punished without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: as you shall read in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the 3 severall deaths that the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> punished their offenders withal.</p>
               <p>They have ordinary keepers and defenders of those things as be in souldiers waies, the which are bound to maintaine the Orchards and Gardens, with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:9426:91"/>
their fruits, about high waies, so that they dare not take an apple or such like, without the licence of the owner. For if they did, they should suffer death for it.</p>
               <p>Of this writeth one <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew Giurgevitus,</hi> that was cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thirteene yeares in <hi>Turkie,</hi> after this sort. When I was in the <hi>Turkes</hi> army in his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition against the <hi>Persians,</hi> I did see a certain Horseman headed, with his Horse and Servant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, because his Horse being loose entred into the fields of another man.

Wherefore the Noble<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men, the Priests, and the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sort, which passe over their lives in quietnesse and idlenesse, whensoever they chance into their hands, they are thought most miserable of all, for the Merchant seller of them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

No man is so happy, of what condition soever he be, or of what age, beauty or art he be, that they will lay him, being sicke in his journey, at any Inne or lodging-house: For first he is compelled to goe with stripes, and if he cannot so doe, he is set upon some yong beast, and if he cannot sit, hee is bound with his body flat, even
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:9426:97"/>
like unto a packe or a burden, if he dyeth, they take away his clothes, and cast him into the next ditch or valley for Dogges and Ravens. They keepe their captives not onely in chaines, but also with gyves upon their hands; as they lead them, the distance betweene them is about a yard, lest they should once spurne and hurt another, and this doe they for feare their bondmen hurle stones at them. For where as every one that is a common Merchant and seller of men, leadeth a great number of bondmen, so that ten of them oftentimes have five hundred in chaines, they feare the force of such a great multitude, if their hands should bee at liberty to throw or cast any thing. In the night-time they make their feet sure with chaines and irons, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:9426:97"/>
lay them upon their backs, open to the injury of the ayre: the women are used with more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, they that are able, do goe upon their feete, and they that are lesse able, be carryed upon young cattell, and those that are so weake, that they may not suffer the shaking of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or asses, or such like, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in hampers and panniers, like unto Geese and Swans. The night is more heavy unto them, for then either they are shut up in strong holds, or else are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to suffer the filthy lust of those that have bought them, and great lamentation is heard both of young men and young women, suffering much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, so that they spare not them of sixe or seven yeares of age in this misery, such is the cruelnesse of that filthy Nation,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:9426:98"/>
against nature in the rage of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnesse. When the day commeth, they are brought forth into the market as sheepe and goates to bee sold, when they that would buy them come, the price is made, if the captive pleaseth him, all his apparrell is cast off, that hee might bee seene of his master that shall bee: all his parts and members are viewed, touched, searched, and tryed, if there be any fault in his joynts or not, if he pleaseth not the buyer, he is rejected againe to the seller; and this is as often done as any doth cheapen or goe about to buy: If the buyer liketh the bond-man; hee is carried away to a most grievous servitude, as to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plow-man or sheepheard, that he might not remember the more grievous sciences. If any

be taken with his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, noble men will buy him gladly, and make him ruler of his villages, and him charge of his grounds, vineyards, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, but his children must bee bondmen, if they persevere and continue in Christian Faith: they have a determinate time to serve, the which being past, they are made free, and yet their children except they be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, continue in servitude and bondage at the will and pleasure of the Lord.</p>

none goeth afoot, but rides eyther on Horseback, or upon some Oxe.

They have no bread, nor use any baking, nor table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes, nor towells, they use no handkirchifs, nor never wash their hands, body, nor apparell. They eate no pot-herbes nor pulse, but onely the flesh of all kinde of living things, as Cats, Dogs, Horse, and all kinde of great Mice. They roste the bodies of such as they take in Warre, to shew their cruelty, and desire of revenging: and where many meete together in the eating of them, they teare them with their teeth
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:9426:134"/>
like Wolves, and drinke the blood thereof, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served afore in cups, otherwise they drinke Cowes milke. One of them eateth the lice from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers head, saying, thus will we doe to our Enemies. It is an hainous thing with them to suffer any drinke to bee lost, or any meate, and therefore they cast no bones to Dogges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the marrow be taken away, and many other things are reported of them, which <hi>Munster</hi> setteth forth more at large. In Warre they have swords of a yard in length, their Horsemen are very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in shooting, their Princes never enter into War, but stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a far off, they cry unto their owne company, and exhort them, if they see any thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: they carry their wives and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:9426:135"/>
their children, because their Wives be attyred like men, and also images of Men, on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back to their Warres, that they might seeme a great number, and more terrible to their Enemies. They thinke no shame nor ignominy in flying if it be necessary and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent so to doe. If they get the victory they spare none, neither Women nor Children, nor olde folkes; they slay al saving crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and artificers, whom they reserve to their uses. They are very incontinent, and therfore they take as many Wives as they will, and may sustaine, and they except none, but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the daughter, and sister, and yet they bee much given to the Sodomiticall sinne.</p>
               <p>They doe not make account of any Woman as of their Wife,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:9426:135"/>
nor yet thinke her worthy of dower, before that shee hath brought forth a Childe, and therefore they may refuse her which is barren, and take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: they which are taken in adultery, both Men and women are put to death by the Law. Every Wife hath her mansion, her owne Family, and liveth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chastely.</p>
               <p>This Nation observeth many superstitions: No man maketh urine in his Mansion, but if hee doth, he is slain without pitty: if necessity compelleth him, then his tent and all things therein are purged with fire after a curious sort. When they chuse and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their Prince, they meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a faire field, and then they set him in a Golden throne and Chayre, to whom the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is due, either by succession,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:9426:136"/>
or by election, and falling down before him, they cry all after this sort, with one consent and a loud voyce: We beseech, we will and command, that thou beare rule over us. He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, If you will have this done of me, it is necessary that you be ready to doe all that I shall command: when I call, to come, and whithersoever I send, to goe, and to commit, and put the whole rule into our hands. When they have answered, we bee ready: Hee saith againe, Therefore my word shall bee my sword, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple clap their hands with great rejoycing. Then the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men take him from the regall seate, and make him to sit softly upon a cushin, or a cloth layd upon the ground, saying thus: Looke up, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

There is also all the treasure and jewels which the late deceased Emperour left, wherewith this new Emperour rewardeth every Noble-man, and that which remayneth, he
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:9426:137"/>
commandeth to bee kept to his owne use. In his hands and power all things bee, and no man dare say, this is mine, or his. No man ought to tarry in any part of the land, but where he is assigned.

The Earth shall sweat signe of judgement: from Heaven shall come a King which shall reigne for ever, that is to say, in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane flesh, to the end, that by his presence he judge the <hi>world,</hi> so the unfaithfull as well as the faithfull, shall see God with their eyes aloft among his Saints; and in the end of the

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:9426:140"/>
therefore not to be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> before they come to passe, shee said of her selfe these words: they shall thinke mee a false and blinde Prophetesse, but when they shall see these things come to passe, they will remember me, and cal me no more a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesse, but a Prophetesse of the Almighty God.</p>
               <p>The sixt was called <hi>Samia,</hi> borne in the Ile of <hi>Samos,</hi> which said: He being rich, shall bee borne of a poore Maide; the creatures of the Earth shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him, and praise him for ever.</p>
               <p>The seventh was called <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana,</hi> because she prophesied at <hi>Cumas,</hi> a towne of <hi>Campania</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>: shee prophesied that hee should come from Heaven, and reigne heere in poverty: he
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:9426:141"/>
should rule in silence, and bee borne of a Virgin. Shee is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to have written Nine bookes of the <hi>Sibyls</hi>: they were all presented by an old woman to <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> but he not willing to pay so great a summe of money as was daman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, denied them: whereupon the old woman burnt three of them, requiring as much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the other sixe, as for all; which being denied, shee also burned the other three, asking as much for the three remaining as for the rest, which <hi>Superbus</hi> amaz'd, gave, and the old trotte vanished. These bookes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned manifest prophesies of the Kingdome of Christ, his Name, his Birth, and Death: they were burned by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traytour <hi>Stilico,</hi> so that those Prophesies which are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,

               <p>The eight was called <hi>Helles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontica,</hi> borne at <hi>Marmisea,</hi> in the Territory of <hi>Troy.</hi> A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shall descend of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> called <hi>Mary,</hi> and of her shall be borne the Sonne of God, named <hi>Iesus,</hi> and that without carnall copulation: For shee shall bee a Virgin before and after his Birth, he shall be both God and Man, he shall fulfill the Lawes of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and shall adde his owne Law thereunto: and his kingdome shal remaine forever.</p>
               <p>The ninth was of <hi>Prygia,</hi> and prophesied in the towne of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cire:</hi> one of her sayings were: The Highest shall come from Heaven, and shall confirme the counsell in Heaven, and a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin shall be shewed in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes of the desarts.</p>

               <p>THE compasse of the Citty of <hi>Calechut</hi> is the space of Sixe Thousand buildings, which be not joyned together as our houses be, but are separate a good space asunder: the length of the Citty is a thousand pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their houses be very low; so that they are not above the height of a man on horse-backe from the ground, they be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the top with boughes and branches of trees com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly.</p>
               <p>Their King is addicted to the worshipping of devils: He doth not deny <hi>God</hi> to be the maker of Heaven and earth, and the first cause and Author of things: but hee saith, that GOD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

the office of judgement to an ill spirit, and to doe right to mortall men, and this spirit they call <hi>Deumo.</hi> The King hath the picture of this devill in his Chappell, sitting with a Diadem on his head, like unto the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> but his Diademe hath foure hornes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and this picture gapeth with a wide mouth, shewing foure teeth: It hath a deformed nose, grimme and terrible eyes, a threatning countenance, croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fingers, with tallants and feete much like unto a Cocke: they that looke upon this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible monster, are suddenly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, it is so loathsome and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a thing to behold. About the Church are painted devils, and in every corner Sathan is made of brasse sitting, with such workmanship, that hee seemeth

to cast flames of fire for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming of soules miserably, and in his right hand the picture of the Devill, putteth a soule to his mouth, and with his left hand it reacheth another. Every morning their Priests doe clense this Idoll with Rose-water, and other sweete waters, and they perfume it with divers sweete things, falling downe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping it.

ground, without any cloth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and the Priests standeth round about him as hee sitteth, never comming neerer him, then within foure paces, marking the Kings words most reverently: when he hath done eating, the Priests offer the reliques of the Kings meate to yong Crowes and Birds to be eaten, which Fowle is an haynous thing to kill, and therefore they flye eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in safety. When the King marrieth a Wife, he useth not to goe to bed unto her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that his new married wife hath been defloured of the most worthy Priest. For this Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the KING giveth him as a reward five hundred Crownes.</p>
               <p>The Priests are in the first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of estimation with them, then Senators which beare a

               <p>When the King goeth forth
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:9426:166"/>
into some strange countrey, or to Hunt, the Priests kepe the Queene company at home, and nothing can be more acceptable to the King, then that they should be acquainted with the Queene in venerous acts, and therefore the King knoweth for a certainty, that those children which he hath by his Wife, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accounted his children; but he taketh his sisters children as most neere unto him in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full consanguinity, and taketh them heires to the Crowne.</p>

They cover their heads with a linnen roller, whereof one part han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth downe by the Fore-head, so that they cover al their mouth

therewith. For they are almost as much ashamed to shew their mouthes as their privy parts, and therfore they keep their mouths close, never opening them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it bee to take meate, and that because they would not let any filthy aire and vapour to slip out thereby. They doe greatly esteeme fat and corpulent woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and such as have large and faire breasts and dugges. Within this Countrey the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile of sixe dayes journey will bring a man to a place called <hi>Tagaza,</hi> from whence is brought much plenty of Salt, the which is carryed away upon Camels backs into divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and especially to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome called <hi>Melli.</hi> The people called <hi>Mellitae</hi> be somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Equinoctiall, and have most fervent heates, and

therfore at certaine times in the yeare their blood is infected, so that if they had no remedy by Salt, they could not live by any meanes: their Salt is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into such lumps, that one salt stone is enough to be borne upon one mans shoulders. But when they come to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey called <hi>Melli,</hi> they loade one Cammell with two salt stones, as for the poorer sort, that are not able to have Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, they carry their Salt upon their shoulders, and some up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, and that in such a company, that they seeme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in multitude like unto an army of men.</p>
               <p>This Salt they bring unto a great water, where every one dischargeth his burden of Salt upon the Land, and make great Hills thereof, leaving a

certaine signe for the true knowledge of every mans heap, this done they depart: and then commeth the <hi>Nigrits,</hi> who will not bee knowne, nor yet talke with any other kind of people, they come neer with their ships<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and where they see and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the heaps of Salt, they lay great store of Gold neigh unto every heap of Salt, even as they thinke it convenient for the Merchandize, and agreeable to equity for the exchange, and then they depart, leaving the Gold and Salt together. The <hi>Nigrits</hi> which went a farre off returne againe, and every one looketh upon his owne heape<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if the Gold that was left by it, pleaseth him, and seemeth sufficient for the exchange, then hee taketh the said Gold away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaving the Salt behinde him
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:9426:215"/>
and not minding to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If the heape of Gold doth not seem unto them suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the exchange of the heap of Salt, then they leave both still, and depart againe in some secret place, minding to come againe within a little after. But those <hi>Nigrits</hi> which cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to be knowne, come againe to the said place, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way such heapes of Salt, as they see the Gold to bee taken from; or else they adde a little more Gold to the heape that was left before, or otherwise they carry away their Gold, leaving the Salt still, if the bargaine please not them. And thus doe they use their Merchandize, so that the one seeth not the other, and that by an old custome. It is a great labour with these <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grits</hi> to carry their salt upon
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:9426:216"/>
their shoulders, because they lacke all manner of beasts meete for that carriage almost, the which commeth through the unfruitfulnesse of the earth: for they have very little store of Grasse, and that which they have is pestilent also; and therefore they dayly drinke water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little salt hath bin resolved, and this is their greatest remedy and most especiall medicine. They never have raine but in <hi>August, September,</hi> and <hi>October.</hi> But these men that come after this sort, and exchange Gold for Salt, without any talke of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine or sale, are thought to be marvellous blacke, having their lower lip hanging downe to the breast somewhat red, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in excoriate and chapped, so that blood commeth out, but the upper lip is small like unto ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
