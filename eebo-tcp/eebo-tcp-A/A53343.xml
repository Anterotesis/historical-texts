            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Juſtice <hi>Hales,</hi> between <hi>Nathaniel</hi>
and <hi>John Letten</hi> Plaintiffs, and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar
Moreſco</hi> Widow Defendant;
concerning the Cuſtome of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
in caſe an Accepted Bill of Exchange be
loſt; The Queſtion was, Whether the Accepter
was bound to pay the Mony on the ſecond Bill;
And upon Hearing, by conſent of Counſel on
both ſides, a Verdict was agreed on in theſe
Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVE find the Cuſtome of Merchants to be,
That if the firſt Bill which is Accepted be
loſt after Acceptance, and before payment thereof,
The Merchant who Accepted ſuch Bill, is bound to
pay the Mony upon the ſecond Bill to the Party by
the Bill appointed to Receive the ſame, or to ſuch
Perſon to whom it is by Endorſement appointed to be
paid; If the Party who is to Receive the Mony,
ſhall give unto the Party ſo Accepting ſufficient
ſecurity to ſave him harmleſs for ſuch payment,
and not otherwiſe.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:110418:2"/>
With this Caſe, as it relates to the Parties,
Plaintiffs and Defendant, it is not intended, nor
is it any way proper to intermeddle; nor is it
poſſible for any perſon, without knowledge of
the particular circumſtances attending it, to give
any judgment therein: But becauſe the right
ſtating and determining the general Queſtion,
and the Cuſtome of Merchants therein, may be
of univerſal Concern; and becauſe on this
Occaſion various Diſcourſes have been amongſt
Merchants themſelves, who ſeem of different
judgments and apprehenſions thereabout; It is
thought neceſſary to propoſe the ſame to the
ſerious and mature conſideration of Merchants,
and to deſire their judgments thereupon, which
may ſerve as a Rule in future, and lead
the way to the ſettlement of other Matters of
like nature, now controverted amongſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:110418:2"/>
               <head>In order to the Reſolution of the ſaid Queſtion, It
hath been obſerved,</head>
               <p>FIrſt, That generally and univerſally all Merchants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in this, That though the firſt Accepted Bill were
loſt, yet that the Party to whom the Money was due
ought not to loſe the ſame; and that the Accepter is
bound to pay the Money on the ſecond Bill, ſo as he may
be ſecured to pay the ſame but once.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That concerning the way and manner,
whereby the Accepter may be ſecured, the Merchants do
not agree amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>I. Some affirm, That the Party requiring the Money
on the ſecond Bill, is bound by the Cuſtome of Merchants
to give good ſecurity by Bond in a penal Sum to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter,
to ſave him harmleſs againſt his Accepted Bill;
and that unleſs ſuch ſecurity be given to the ſatisfaction
of the Accepter, the Accepter is not bound to pay the
Money.</p>
               <p>II. Others affirm, That though it be uſual and oftentimes
practiſed by Merchants in ſuch Caſes to give ſecurity one
to another, to avoid trouble; yet that there is no ſuch
Cuſtome to neceſſitate a Merchant ſo to do, or to debar
him of his Right for default thereof: But in ſuch Caſe,
The Merchant claiming the Money may bring his Action
on the ſecond Bill; and that if on Tryal he prove the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of the firſt Bill, and his right and propriety to
the Money, he ought to have judgment againſt the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
for the principal Sum, but not for any coſts of Suit,
unleſs the loſs of the Accepted Bill was by the Accepter
himſelf; And the Judgment in this Caſe is a Security to
the Accepter againſt the Accepted Bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:110418:3"/>
III. Others affirm, That the payment of the Money
on the ſecond Bill (after the uſual time limited by the
Cuſtome of Merchants for payment of Bills) to a perſon
to whom the ſame is duely endorſed, and his Receipt and
Diſcharge thereon, is of it ſelf, according to the nature
of Bills of Exchange, and the Cuſtome of Merchants, a
ſufficient diſcharge of, and ſecurity againſt the firſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
Bill.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons and Grounds for each of theſe ſeveral
Opinions ſeem to be in ſubſtance as follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe which Aſſert the firſt Opinion alledge,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, That they have often known it practiſed, in caſe
of the loſs of a firſt Accepted Bill, that ſecurity hath
been given to ſave the Accepter harmleſs, and that they
never knew it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Acceptation is that only which
obligeth the Party on whom the Bill is drawn, and that
therefore he ought, on payment, to have up his Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or elſe to be well ſecured againſt it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That if perſons be diſhoneſt, it may fall out,
That the firſt accepted Bill may be endorſed to one man,
and the ſecond Bill to another man: In which caſe they
do conceive, he that hath the Accepted Bill is by prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
entitled to the money; ſo that if the Accepter
ſhould pay the money on the ſecond Bill, and not have
good ſecurity, If afterward the firſt accepted Bill ſhould
be found endorſed to another, That perſon would Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
payment by virtue of the ſaid accepted Bill, and ſo
the Accepter ſhould be forced to pay the ſame Bill twice,
beſides the trouble and vexation of Suits; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ought to be ſecured againſt theſe inconveniences
before he part with his money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe that are of the ſecond and third Opinions,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, They propoſe ſome things to be conſidered in
reference to the Cuſtomes of Merchants in general, as</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:110418:3"/>
I. That every Uſage or common practice amongſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
doth not amount to the denomination of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of Merchants, ſo as always to oblige; many things
paſſing between Merchant and Merchant in a way of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and friendſhip, by way of accommodation, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
therefore preſently be called a Cuſtome; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</p>
               <p>It is uſual, and the common practice of Merchants,
Upon the taking up and delivering of money by exchange,
That the party who takes up the money and draws his
Bill, doth give his firſt Bill on the Poſt-day, and ſends
for his money on the ſecond Bill a day or two after; Yet
no Merchant will ſay, That this uſe and common practice
is an obliging Cuſtome; But rather the contrary, That
it is only a common Civility, and that the party that
draws the Bill, may by the true and ancient Cuſtome of
Merchants, refuſe to deliver any Bill before he receives
the money for the value therein expreſſed.</p>
               <p>II. That no one, two, or more particular Merchants,
affirming, That they have known ſuch a thing practiſed in
in ſuch a caſe, and that they never knew it otherwiſe, is a
ſufficient ground to determine that practice to be a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of Merchants, ſo as to oblige all Merchants in the
courſe of Exchange thereunto: For though it might be
ſo practiſed between ſome, which thoſe particular Men
heard of, Yet the ſame Caſe might be conteſted by others,
and adjudged after another manner, which they might
never hear of.</p>
               <p>III. That the Cuſtomes of Merchants do not ſeparate
between Juſtice and Equity, <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> between Law
and Chancery, but both are comprehended, and ought
to be conſidered in the determination of any Matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Merchants touching Bills of Exchange; So that
there is no Rule ſo poſitive, but that differing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
may alter the Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:110418:4"/>
There are ſome common principles which are taken for
foundations, and unalterable, not ſo much becauſe they
are received for the Cuſtome of Merchants, as that they
are in their own nature juſt and equitable, and carry the
reaſon with them, that bears teſtimony to and for them:
Such are theſe following:</p>
               <p>That every mans word ſhould be as good as his deed.</p>
               <p>That every Creditor muſt have a Debtor.</p>
               <p>That every one ſhould anſwer for his own Act, or for
his own neglect, and that thereby another ſhould not
be detrimented.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like are principles upon which all the
ſeveral particular Cuſtomes of Merchants are founded,
and are inviolably to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>But there is no particular Cuſtome, to which a <hi>not
otherwiſe</hi> can be ſubjoined, becauſe the circumſtances
may vary the Caſe; for inſtance:</p>
               <p>It is a received Cuſtome of Merchants, That if there
be a neglect of proteſting a Bill within the time limited,
That then the Drawer is diſcharged, and the Party
claiming the mony ſhall have no Recourſe againſt him for
the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To explain this Caſe, ſuppoſe</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> receives of <hi>Richard 100 l.</hi> and gives to <hi>Richard</hi>
his Bills of Exchange for the ſame ſum on <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi>
payable to <hi>Richard</hi> or his order at 2 Uſance.</p>
               <p>This Bill is not paid by <hi>William</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
in due time for non payment by <hi>Richard,</hi> or his
Aſſigns, Yet <hi>Richard</hi> comes and requires ſatisfaction of
<hi>Thomas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Queſtion be barely and ſingly put to moſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
Whether <hi>Richard</hi> that paid the value hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
on <hi>Thomas</hi> the Drawer, in caſe the Bill was not
paid by <hi>William</hi> on whom is was drawn, It is probable
they will readily anſwer, That <hi>Richard</hi> hath his Recourſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110418:4"/>
on <hi>Thomas</hi> the Drawer, or that <hi>Thomas</hi> is bound to pay
the money to <hi>Richard,</hi> if the Bill were not paid by <hi>William</hi>
on whom it was drawn, and a Proteſt made for non pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in due time, and <hi>not otherwiſe;</hi> and that they have
often known, that the Drawer was diſcharged, and no
way liable, unleſs a Proteſt for non payment were made
in due time, without which they never knew that the
Drawer was chargeable.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer ſeems very plauſible; but let the matter
be examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Caſe is this:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> had no money or effects in the hands of <hi>William,</hi>
on whom he drew the Bill, nor was <hi>William</hi> any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to <hi>Thomas;</hi> But <hi>Thomas</hi> having occaſion for mony,
takes up this money of <hi>Richard,</hi> and gives him his Bill for
the ſame on <hi>William,</hi> hoping he would honour his Bill,
and orders him upon payment to Redraw the money on
him again, which he promiſeth <hi>William</hi> to pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> by neglect keeps the Bills by him, or ſends
them to other places to negotiate, ſo that it happens that
the Bill comes not to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> till the time mentioned
in the Bill, and the time limited by the cuſtom of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
there, for making the Proteſt, be expired.</p>
               <p>When the Bill is preſented to <hi>William,</hi> he returns an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
(to a Proteſt then made after the limited time) that
he will not accept or pay the ſaid Bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> Returns back to <hi>Thomas,</hi> who anſwereth, That
the Proteſt was not made in due time, and that therefore
he is by the Cuſtom of Merchants diſcharged.</p>
               <p>If this ſhould be taken for Good, Then <hi>Richard</hi> would
be a Creditor without a Debtor: <hi>William</hi> could not be
his Debtor, becauſe he did never accept the Bill; and
<hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould not be his Debtor, becauſe the Proteſt was
not made in time. Then, <hi>Thomas</hi> would gain 100 <hi>l.</hi> for
nothing, and <hi>Richard</hi> would loſe as much. Can this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally

conſiſt with juſtice and good conſcience? And if
not, No more can it conſiſt with the Cuſtom of Merchants,
which is bottom'd on that foundation.</p>
               <p>The Caſe being on Evidence made out to be as above
expreſſed, <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhall by the Cuſtom of Merchants be
obliged to repay the money to <hi>Richard;</hi> and thoſe very
Merchants which gave their opinion in the general, with a
<hi>not otherwiſe,</hi> will no doubt on the conſideration of
theſe Circumſtances ſubſcribe hereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Caſe have this variation from what is above,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>William</hi> was really indebted to <hi>Thomas,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhall not be obliged to pay back, or to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the money to <hi>Richard;</hi> But onely ſhall be bound to
aſſign unto <hi>Richard</hi> ſo much of his Debt owing by <hi>William,</hi>
as the ſaid Bill did amount to; It will not be mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
whether <hi>William</hi> be ſolvent or inſolvent, for that <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
by neglecting to proteſt in time, hath loſt the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ſo is to take <hi>William</hi> onely for his Debt,
whether he be good or bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Caſe have this variation,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Bill of Exchange was accepted by <hi>William,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Richard</hi> ſhall have no Recourſe at all on <hi>Thomas;</hi>
but having <hi>William</hi> obliged by his Acceptance, ſhall take
him only for his Debtor.</p>
               <p>And in caſe of <hi>William</hi>'s Inſolvency, and that <hi>Thomas</hi>
drew the money only on his Credit; <hi>Thomas</hi> may, if he
will, repay the money to <hi>Richard,</hi> and take up the Bills,
which is eſteemed fair dealing; but if he will not, <hi>Richard</hi>
hath no right, according to the Cuſtom of Merchants, to
enforce him: But in this caſe <hi>Richard</hi> muſt come in as a
Creditor to <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> muſt be charged as a
Debtor to <hi>William.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus premiſed theſe things, concerning the

Secondly, They alledge, That in ſome Caſes, and
under ſome Circumſtances, though the Accepted Bill be
loſt, yet there may be no need to require ſecurity of the
party that demands the money on the ſecond Bill, nor
any reaſon for him to give it; and ſo the General Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before laid down is not to be admitted with a <hi>not
otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. If the Bill of Exchange be drawn payable to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
directly, without any expreſſion of order, as thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText xml:lang="unk">

                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>All Merchants will agree, That <hi>A. B.</hi> hath no power
according to the Cuſtome of Merchants to Endorſe or
Aſſign the ſame to any other; and that if he ſhould take
upon him ſo to do, yet ſuch Endorſment is invalid, and the
party to whom ſuch Bill is Endorſed cannot have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
upon the Accepter in his own name or right, by
virtue of ſuch Endorſement: And that <hi>G. H.</hi> is only liable
to pay the money to <hi>A. B.</hi> and to no other; unleſs <hi>C. D.</hi>
who paid the value, ſhould before the actual payment
countermand the ſame; which not being done, though
the firſt Accepted Bill be loſt, it would be altogether
needleſs for <hi>G. H.</hi> to require ſecurity of <hi>A. B.</hi> becauſe the
payment of the money to <hi>A. B.</hi> and his Receipt doth
fully diſcharge <hi>G. H.</hi> the Accepter from that parcel.</p>
               <p>II. That the Accepted Bill is not onely loſt, that is to
ſay, miſlaid, or out of the way for the preſent, but extinct
and deſtroyed, may poſſibly in ſome Caſes, as in deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by Fire or Shipwrack, be certainly known, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
evidenced: And if ſo, Then it will be unneceſſary
to require ſecurity againſt that which is certainly known
not to be.</p>
               <p>III. It may fall out ſometimes accidentally; whereof
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110418:6"/>
there is experience, That the Accepted Bill hath been loſt
by the perſon that Accepted it, or by his ſervant, and in
ſuch Caſe it ſeems unreaſonable, that the party claiming
the money on the ſecond Bill ſhould be forced to give
ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They ſay, If ſuch a Cuſtome were admitted,
That on the loſs of an Accepted Bill the party claiming
the money ſhould be remedileſs without firſt giving ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
many inconveniences might enſue.</p>
               <p>I. It's probable ſome perſons may not be able to give
ſecurity, and yet of ſuch perſons there would be the
greateſt reaſon to require it: But that a poor man in ſuch
a Caſe ſhould loſe his money, and another enjoy it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any right, would be very unjuſt.</p>
               <p>II. It may be conſidered, That a great part of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
remitted by Exchange is for the Accompt of perſons
reſiding beyond ſea; and what Factor will be willing to
become ſecurity, and procure another alſo to be ſecurity
with him, whom he muſt indemnifie, when as he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
with the money preſently, but his Bond lies out
againſt him forever. So that in ſuch Caſe the Foreigner
will be at a loſs, and hereby the Trade may be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
and leſſened.</p>
               <p>III. May not a perſon out of deſign to gain time, and
to keep the money, pretend he hath Accepted a Bill
when he never did; and ſo if both Bills cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
remain with the money? It hath been ſeveral
times known, That when money hath been demanded on
a Bill not Accepted, Anſwer hath been made on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
by the party on whom the Bill was drawn, That he
had Accepted the other Bill; when as in ſome time after
both Bills have been produced, and neither of them Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted:
Now if the other Bill had miſcarried, the falſity
could not have been detected.</p>
               <p>IV. The Accepter on this pretext, to gain time and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110418:6"/>
keep the money, may be over curious and diſlike the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
tendred: And if it be anſwered to this, That then
the party may bring his Action, and the Court will judge
of the ſecurity; It may be conſidered, 1. That this will
be a means to beget Suits, inſtead of preventing them:
2. That it may deter men from offering themſelves as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
leſt they ſhould thereby come to have their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits
queſtioned in a publick Court, and ſo render it more
difficult to obtain ſecurity: 3. It would be a double
charge if the ſecurity were not approved, or allowed of.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They ſay, The only reaſon of requiring
ſecurity is to indemnifie the party that pays the money on
the Bill, that he be not charged twice for the ſame parcel,
but that he be aſſured that he pays the money to the right
party: This they conceive is done by a Tryal at Law, and
a Judgment thereupon; becauſe on Tryal the Court will
examin all Circumſtances, and the party claiming the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
muſt prove his right and propriety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Suppoſe the Bill of Exchange be made payable to <hi>A. B.</hi> or
his order, and that <hi>A. B.</hi> hath Endorſed the Accepted Bill to <hi>L. M.</hi>
and the other Bill not Accepted to <hi>J. K.</hi> and taken a value of each of
them; Shall not <hi>L. M.</hi> having the Accepted Bill recover payment of
<hi>G. H.</hi> notwithſtanding his former payment to <hi>J. K.</hi> on the other Bill
unaccepted, or any Judgment had thereupon; it being a Rule in the
courſe of Exchange, That it is onely the Acceptance of the Bill that
obliged <hi>G. H.</hi> on whom it was drawn to the payment, and that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſements
of Bills amongſt Merchants doth transfer Property?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is anſwered, That the payment of one of the Bills to <hi>J. K.</hi>
in caſe the ſaid Bill was duely endorſed by <hi>A. B.</hi> to him, and paid at or
after the due term, limited by the Cuſtome of Merchants for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Bills of Exchange, was a good payment of that parcel, and
a due diſcharge to the Accepter of his Acceptance, and ought to be
accepted as a good Plea in Barr, to any Action brought by <hi>L. M.</hi> on
the Accepted Bill againſt <hi>G. H.</hi> the Accepter, or <hi>E. F.</hi> the Drawer;
if there have been a Judgment in the Caſe, That hath determined the
Endorſement to be duely made, and ſo there will need no other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be examined but the payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:110418:7"/>
For the clearing this matter, upon which the main difficulty depends,
It muſt be conſidered,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That though there be two or three Bills given, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt,
ſecond, and third, Yet they are all to be underſtood to be but one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
and the giving of ſeveral Bills, is intended to ſupply the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
that might happen by the miſcarriage of the Poſt or other
accident, and therefore to Parts not far remote, as to <hi>France, Holland,
&amp;c.</hi> there is uſually given but two Bills, firſt and ſecond; and to Parts
more remote, as to <hi>Venice, Italy, &amp;c,</hi> there is given three Bills, firſt,
ſecond and third.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the tenor of every Bill of Exchange is conditional,
to pay the one, the other not being paid: This Condition is always
expreſſed in the ſecond Bill, and ſometimes in the firſt; however it is
always implyed, for a firſt denotes there is a ſecond, and amongſt
Merchants it is always ſo underſtood; and therefore when they give
but one Bill, it is uſually expreſſed, <hi>Pay this my ſole (or my onely) Bill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the Acceptance of one Bill, doth oblige the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
to the payment of the parcel, and is not, nor ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to the particular Bill underwritten, or to any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to whom the ſame is Endorſed, but is underſtood generally of
the parcel, and to pay the ſame to ſuch perſon as at the time of the
falling due of the Bill (according to the Cuſtome of Merchants) ſhall
have right to demand and receive the ſame.</p>
               <p>That the Acceptance is not reſtrained to the Bill underwritten, but
is to be extended to the Parcel, which takes in all the Bills: It is
ſuppoſed no Merchant, acquainted with the Trade and Courſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
will deny: Yet if any ſhall ſay, That the Accepter is ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged to the Bill underwritten, and not to the Parcel generally;
and that upon the Acceptance of one Bill the other are rendred invalid,
and become onely Scrolls; They are deſired to conſider,</p>
               <p>I. Whether this be not contrary to the very deſign and end of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
two Bills, which is to prevent the Inconvenience may happen by
the loſs of one.</p>
               <p>II. Whether this would not in a great meaſure cut off the Trade
and Accommodations of Merchants in the Trade of Exchange. Bills
are ſent for Acceptance, and then tranſmitted to other places to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate:
But who would dare to adventure an Accepted Bill, if the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
thereof ſhould be the loſs of the money.</p>
               <p>That the Acceptance cannot be reſtrained to any particular perſon,
to whom the ſame is payable or Endorſed, is evident; Becauſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Cuſtome of Merchants, the perſon that paid the value
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110418:7"/>
hath power of Countermanding the payment, at any time before it be
due and actually paid, or duely Endorſed to another; and in caſe of
Endorſements, it is the ſame ſtill, for he that paid the value on the
laſt Endorſement hath the power of Revocation: Hence it is, that it
is ſo unſafe for a Merchant to pay a Bill before it be due; becauſe if
he that paid the value doth ſignifie a countermand before the Bill be
due, and make out his title to the money, he that paid the Bill before
due, ſhall be adjudged to have paid it in his own wrong, and be obliged
to pay it again, notwithſtanding he had his Accepted Bill delivered him
up by the other.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the Acceptance of a Bill, is always to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
according to the nature and tenor of Bills of Exchange, and
the Condition therein expreſſed or implyed, <hi>viz.</hi> to pay one, the other
not paid, and ſo the Obligation by the Acceptance is to the parcel,
and not to any of the Bills diſtinctly and ſeparately, but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally:
So that <hi>G. H.</hi> having paid <hi>J. K.</hi> may truly and juſtly anſwer
to <hi>L. M.</hi> demanding by his underwritten Bill, That he hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
what his Obligation by his Acceptance obliged him to, <hi>viz.</hi> to
pay the parcel, <hi>i. e.</hi> one Bill, the other not being paid: And this Plea
in this Caſe, is the ſame in effect, and ought to be ſo taken, as that of
Conditions performed to a Bond in the Courſe of our Law, is.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Though Endorſements of Bills of Exchange do amongſt
Merchants transfer Property, Yet there is no rule of preference, ſo
as poſitively to determine the Right to be in one and not in the other:
In the Caſe alledged,</p>
               <p>I. Suppoſe <hi>L. M.</hi> with the Accepted Bill endorſed to him, and
<hi>J. K.</hi> with the other Bill Endorſed to him, come both together at the
time of payment to demand the money of <hi>G. H.</hi> It is ſuppoſed there
is no Cuſtome of Merchants obliging him to pay this and not that,
but that it is in the choice of <hi>G. H.</hi> to pay which of them he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth;
though it may be beſt for him to prevent trouble to pay neither,
and to keep the money till the matter be determined, which in foreign
Parts would be in a day or two by the Court Conſulate, but in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
if he be ſued, he may pay the money into Chancery, and thereby
be diſcharged, and leave the two Competitors to try their Title. If
he reſolves to pay one, it will be readily granted, that in prudence
he will chuſe to pay him that hath the Accepted Bill, thereby to take
up his firm.</p>
               <p>II. Suppoſe as this Caſe is, That the firſt Bill Accepted doth not
appear at the time limited for payment, but onely the ſecond Bill En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſed
by <hi>A. B.</hi> to <hi>J. K.</hi> In this Caſe there cannot be a preference,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110418:8"/>
becauſe there appears but one Claimer: That which our Law in ſome
Caſes gives a Right by way of preference, <hi>viz.</hi> The time of Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as in Mortgages the firſt takes place, will not here be material,
the doubt being about the Acceptance, and not about the time of the
Endorſement. Oftentimes there is no Dates put to the Endorſements
on Bills of Exchange: and when there is, It may fall out that the firſt
Accepted Bill may be Endorſed after the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj</hi> It is further Objected, That <hi>L. M.</hi> who paid his money to
<hi>A. B.</hi> upon the Endorſement of the firſt Accepted Bill to him, might
not do it on the Credit of <hi>A. B.</hi> the Endorſer, nor on the Credit of
<hi>E. F.</hi> the Drawer, but on the Credit of <hi>G. H.</hi> and his Acceptance;
and that he would not have truſted <hi>A. B.</hi> but depended on <hi>G. H.</hi> the
Accepter: Whereas <hi>J. K.</hi> who took the Endorſement of <hi>A. B.</hi> on
the ſecond Bill, muſt needs be underſtood purely to truſt <hi>A. B.</hi> in the
Caſe: And it's probable, that <hi>L. M.</hi> in confidence of the ſolvability
of <hi>G. H.</hi> the Accepter, might not ſend for the money at the time,
knowing the Accepter to be always liable: And if in the mean time
<hi>G. H.</hi> ſhould pay the money to <hi>J. K.</hi> on the ſecond Bill, and that
thereby <hi>L. M.</hi> ſhould be debarred of any Recourſe againſt <hi>G. H.</hi> the
Accepter, he ſhould be remedileſs, not having proteſted in time;
Which would barr all Civility, and alſo obſtruct the Trade, by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Negotiating of Bills of Exchange.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection is founded on Suppoſitions and Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and ſeems to be the Language of a Goldſmith Banker, and not
of a knowing Merchant: For the clearing the ſame,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is to be conſidered, That of late years there are two kinds or
ſorts of Negotiating Bills of Eexchange; one very ancient between
Merchant and Merchant in the Courſe of Exchange, whereby a Bill
on <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is made uſe of at <hi>Paris, &amp;c.</hi> one and the ſame Bill by
ſeveral Endorſements ſupplying ſeveral mens occaſions in diſtinct
places: The other very novel in <hi>England,</hi> between the Goldſmith
Banker and the Merchant or Factor; The Goldſmith by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
advancing the money, and the other aſſigning him the Bill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it ſhould be a Rule to every man in the Courſe of
Exchange, to take care that he delivers his money to a ſufficient reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
perſon: Whereas the firſt ſuppoſition in the Objection is, That
<hi>L. M.</hi> paid his money to <hi>A. B.</hi> on the Credit of <hi>G. H.</hi> the Accepter,
and not on the Credit of <hi>A. B.</hi> the Endorſer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is anſwered,
That <hi>J. K.</hi> might pretend alſo, that he paid his money on the Credit
of <hi>E. F.</hi> the Drawer, and not on the Credit of <hi>A. B.</hi> the Endorſer;
and the Conſequences would be as fatal to <hi>J. K.</hi> if the Accepted Bill
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110418:8"/>
were paid to <hi>L. M.</hi> for that he could never have recourſe on <hi>E. F.</hi> the
Drawer, but only on <hi>A. B.</hi> the Endorſer; and the like recourſe
may <hi>L. M.</hi> have, though the Proteſt were not made in time. <hi>L. M.</hi>
ſhould have taken care to whom he delivered his money, and if he
look'd on the Accepter only, he therein acted irregularly, and the
ſame ought not to be any Argument on his behalf.</p>
               <p>If it be ſeriouſly examined, it will appear, That many, if not
moſt of the Frauds and Abuſes touching Bills of Exchange have riſen,
or been occaſion'd from this irregular proceeding, in not obſerving
the Rule abovementioned.</p>
               <p>Whence is it, That ſome perſons, when their Credit is low, that
they cannot take up money by Exchange, do pretend to deliver money
by Exchange, and cauſing the Bills to be made payable to them or
Order, Negotiate the firſt Bills (which are delivered on the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day)
on the Credit of the Drawer, and thereupon receive the mony,
and preſently abſent themſelves, and never pay the value to the
Drawer.</p>
               <p>Whence is it, That ſome Factors (deſigning to make an advantage
by Failure) having Bills ſent them to receive for other mens Accompts,
do negotiate, or rather diſcount the Bills with Goldſmith-Bankers,
and thereby defeat their Principals; But from this, That the Bankers
(who make great advantage on ſuch occaſions) reſt and rely on the
ſufficiency of the Drawer or Accepter.</p>
               <p>And thus, upon this Suppoſition, it comes to paſs, That ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(who are or would be reputed honeſt men) do for gain become
aſſiſtant, and helpful to others to carry on unjuſt and fraudulent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p>It is true, That Bills of Exchange made payable to ſuch a perſon
or order, being Endorſed by him for a value received, ought to have
their Courſe; and in ſuch Caſe the Goldſmith Banker will ſay, The
Merchant ought to have taken care whom he entruſted.</p>
               <p>And may it not with as much and more reaſon be ſaid to the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in the preſent Caſe, They ſhould have taken care whom they
entruſted and delivered their money to?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That in matters of Exchange all punctuality ought to be
obſerved, as well in demanding the money on a Bill, as in paying it:
It is acknowledged, that the Accepter is always bound for the parcel
until payment: But if any will forbear or neglect to ſend for his
money in the proper time, ſuch neglect ought not to be to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of any but himſelf.</p>
               <p>A Maſter of a Ship firms three Bills of Lading for a Bag of 500
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110418:9"/>
Pieces of Eight, received at <hi>Cadiz</hi> from <hi>William,</hi> to be delivered at
<hi>London</hi> to him or his Order: The Maſter keeps one Bill, <hi>William</hi>
keeps the other two; One of which he aſſigns to <hi>Richard,</hi> for the
value of him; The other he aſſigns to <hi>Thomas,</hi> for the value of him.
The Ship arrives at <hi>London: Richard</hi> forbears or neglects for ſome
days to ſend for the Bag of money: In the mean time, <hi>Thomas</hi> ſends
his Bill of Lading, receives the Bag of money, and delivers up the
Bill of Lading with a Receipt thereon. Shall <hi>Richard</hi> in this Caſe
have any other recourſe than againſt <hi>William,</hi> who dealt unjuſtly in
aſſigning one parcel to two perſons; and he cannot blame the Maſter
for delivering the money to <hi>Thomas,</hi> but himſelf for not ſending for it
ſooner.</p>
               <p>So in the preſent Caſe, <hi>L. M</hi> hath no reaſon to blame <hi>G. H.</hi> for
paying the money to <hi>J. K.</hi> but rather to blame himſelf for not ſending
for it ſooner.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To that Suppoſition in the Objection, That this would
obſtruct Trade, by hindering the Negotiating of Bills of Exchange;
It may be Anſwered from what is before alledged, That the frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent
and unjuſt Negotiation of Bills, by inſolvent perſons, may
in ſome meaſure be thereby prevented: But the Mercantile and
true Negotiating of Bills of Exchange, by perſons of Credit, will be
advanced, and the Honour of the Trade of Exchange preſerved.</p>
               <p>It is a Principle taken for granted in the Courſe of the Trade of
Exchange, That all Merchants Trading in Exchange, are (or ought
to be) perſons of Credit, able to draw by Exchange, and therefore
the dammages recoverable in Caſe of Proteſt for non payment, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Cuſtome of Merchants, is onely the common Charges of
the Proteſt, Commiſſion and Port of Letters, and the Rechange, that
is, the difference of price between the Redrawing and the Remittance.
And nothing can ever advance the Trade of Exchange, or uphold the
Honour of it, unleſs it be managed by perſons of Credit and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>The Objecter would introduce a new Principle, and takes it for
granted, That Bills of Exchange are Negotiated by perſons of no
Credit or Eſtates, ſuch as he dares not truſt of themſelves: And that
he might continue to deal with (<hi>i. e.</hi> to fleece) theſe ſecurely, is the
Ground of his Objection, and the Trade he fears would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>

               <head>The Reſult upon the Whole.</head>
               <p>FRom theſe ſeveral Diſcourſes and Argumentations
there may ariſe a Determination of Two Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What Courſe ſhould be taken, in Caſe an Accepted
Bill be loſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſeems to be Reſolved thus:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. That the Accepter by virtue of his Acceptance,
underwritten on one Bill, is bound to ſatisfie the parcel,
that is to ſay, one Bill or the other; or if one miſcarry,
then the other.</p>
               <p>II. That if the Accepted Bill were loſt by the Accepter
himſelf or his Servant, then he ought to pay the money on
the other Bill without requiring ſecurity.</p>
               <p>III. That though the Accepted Bill were not loſt by
the Accepter or his Servant, Yet if the Bill were payable
to ſuch a perſon, and not to him or his order, and no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand
ſignified to him, The Accepter might with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pay the money to him on the ſecond Bill, without any
other ſecurity than a diſcharge for the ſame.</p>
               <p>IV. That if the Bill were payable to Order, The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
on payment of the money on the other Bill, might
require ſecurity to indemnifie him from the Accepted Bill,
or any trouble and charge ariſing by reaſon thereof;
which, if it can be complied with, is a good way of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
and hath been often practiced.</p>
               <p>V. The not giving ſecurity in this Caſe, ought not to
render the Accepter Unactionable, or deſtroy the Right
of the party claiming the money by the other Bill.</p>
               <p>VI. That the Accepter paying the money to a perſon
to whom the other Bill was rightly Endorſed, after the
time limited by Cuſtome for payment, and having up the
ſaid Bill, and a diſcharge thereon, ought not to be further
chargeable by the Bill on which the Acceptance was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:110418:10"/>
VII. That the Accepter if he be not contented to pay
the money on the other Bill, and that the Demandant and
he cannot agree thereabout, Yet the Accepter, if he
be a Merchant of Repute and Credit, and without ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
deſigns, will maintain the Honour of Exchange,
and be ready, as he ought, (were there a Court Merchant
in <hi>England</hi>) to pay the money into the Court; Which
ſhould be his ſecurity for that parcel againſt all Claimers:
Whether this is practicable in the Courſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, Learned Counſel muſt direct. However, if
the Accepter be ſued at the Common Law, he may addreſs
to Chancery, pay the money into that Court, and take the
Indempnity thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What Courſe is to be taken when one parcel
is really transferred to two perſons; The Accepted Bill
to one, The other Bill to another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſeems to be thus Reſolved:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. When there appears but one of the Bills at the time
limited for payment, the payment thereof ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Accepter of the parcel, that is to ſay, of the
other Bill or Bills. This Caſe will be the ſame in ſubſtance
with the other Queſtion; there it is in ſuppoſition, here
in reality; therefore the Reſolves to that may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to this.</p>
               <p>II. When both Bills appear at the time of payment, It
is in the Accepter his choice to pay either of them, there
being no poſitive Cuſtome of Merchants that gives Right
by preference.</p>
               <p>III. That though it be in his choice to pay either, Yet
it will be moſt adviſable (if he pay any) to pay the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
Bill, that ſo he may take up his firm.</p>
               <p>IV. That it is beſt in that Caſe for the Accepter to pay
neither, but to pay the money into Court, as is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the ſeventh Reſolve on the former Queſtion.</p>
               <p>V. That in this Caſe it may be equal, and prevent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110418:10"/>
and Charges, for the two Demandants to agree, and
jointly to bear the hazard or loſs.</p>
               <p>VI. That where they cannot agree, and that the whole
mony is paid and adjudged to one, the other ought to have
his Recourſe only againſt the Endorſer, who is obliged
to make good, not only the Principal, but all Charges and
Dammages: And that in this Caſe, the time of the Proteſt
will not be material, the Redemand of the money not
being for any failure of the Party on whom it was drawn.</p>

               <head>Of the Time of the falling due of Foreign Bills of
Exchange.</head>
               <p>MAny Diſputes have of late years ariſen amongſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
concerning the time of the falling due of Bills
of Exchange; which is a matter of great moment, in order
to the making of Proteſt in the due and limited time: For
when on the one hand, ſome apprehend Bills to be due
ſooner, by over diligence, diſcontents, animoſities and
quarrels are occaſioned amongſt Merchants; and on the
other hand, while others take them to be due later, by
neglect, they run into hazards and inconveniences:
Therefore it would be requiſite, and a very neceſſary
Work, ſo to ſettle this by a Univerſal Concurrence of
Merchants, that in future all Quarrels and Diſputes herein
might be prevented.</p>
               <p>In order to which, upon this occaſion, That which hath
been obſerved of the difficulties and differences concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this particular, is alſo humbly offered to the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Merchants.</p>
               <p>Theſe difficulties for the moſt part do ariſe from the
difference between the New and Old Stile, and the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of the Months of the Kalendar, ſome Months
having 31 days, ſome but 30, and <hi>February</hi> but 28, except

                  <head>The Firſt Caſe.</head>
                  <p>Bills of Exchange are drawn from <hi>Paris,</hi> payable in
<hi>London</hi> at 2 Uſance, and bear Date, the 6 <hi>December, 6 Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
6 <hi>March, 6 July, 6 August:</hi> To find out when theſe
Bills are due in <hi>London,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some do examin when they would have been due
in Foreign Parts, reckoning the 2 Uſances from the Date,
and then ſubſtracting the 10 days for the difference of the
Stile; as thus, 2 Uſances from the 6 <hi>December</hi> is the 6 <hi>Feb.</hi>
the 6 <hi>February</hi> New Stile is the 27 <hi>January</hi> Old Stile; and
ſo they make the Bills above to fall due in <hi>London,</hi> the
27 <hi>January, 24 February, 26 April, 27 Auguſt, 26 October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For reaſon of this their way and opinion, They alledge,
That the Bills being made in <hi>France,</hi> the 2 Uſances ought
to be accounted according to the Computation in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others do examin what the true Date of
the Bill is according to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Accompt, and ſubſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the 10 days for the difference of the Stile from the
Date, they then reckon the 2 Uſances, as thus, The 6 <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
New Stile is the 26 <hi>November</hi> Old Stile, 2 Uſances
from the 26 <hi>November</hi> is the 26 <hi>January;</hi> and accordingly
they account the Bills before mentioned to fall due, the
26 <hi>January, 27 February, 24 April, 26 Auguſt, 27 October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To evidence this manner of Reckoning to be the true
and right way, and that the other is not proper, nor ought
to be ſettled, it is alledged,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Command or Direction by the Bill of
Exchange is to the Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> to pay ſuch a ſum
in <hi>London</hi> at 2 Uſance, which doth neceſſarily imply 2
months to be accounted in <hi>London</hi> from the Date: Though
the Bill be made in <hi>France,</hi> yet its reference is to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
in <hi>London,</hi> who is to pay it there at ſuch a time.</p>
                  <p>If the 2 Uſances ſhould be calculated according to the
Accompt in <hi>France,</hi> it would fall out, That ſometimes
there would want in <hi>London</hi> 3 days of 2 months, as in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110418:11"/>
Bill Dated the 6 <hi>January,</hi> and at another time there would
be 2 days more than 2 months, as on the Bill Dated the
6 <hi>March;</hi> whereas the Merchant in <hi>London</hi> ought to have
2 months time for the payment of his money; which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating
according to the ſecond Opinion he would always
have.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the firſt manner of Accompting were
allowed, it would fall out, when both Stiles are put to
ſome Bills of Exchange, and but one Stile to others,
though all from one place, and of one day, That there
would be two or three days difference between the falling
due of the one and of the other; as ſuppoſe one Bill Dated
at <hi>Paris</hi> the
<list>
                        <item>6 January.</item>
                        <item>27 December.</item>
                     </list>
All Merchants will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
(the real Date according to both Stiles being thus
expreſſed) That this Bill would fall due the 27 <hi>February.</hi>
Whereas another Bill Dated at <hi>Paris</hi> the 6 <hi>January,</hi> if the
2 Uſance be reckoned as in <hi>France,</hi> and then the 10 days
ſubſtracted, that Bill would fall due the 24 <hi>February.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that both theſe Bills being Dated on the ſame day
at the ſame place, payable at the like Uſances, ſhould not
fall due on one and the ſame day in <hi>London,</hi> would be very
incongruous and unreaſonable.</p>
                  <p>It is true, That according to this Rule, It will fall out
(in regard of the difference of the month of <hi>February</hi>)
That ſome Bills that vary 2, 3, or 4 days in their Date,
will fall due on one and the ſame day: Bills Dated at
<hi>Rouen</hi> the 7, 8, 9, and 10 <hi>January,</hi> will all fall due in
<hi>London</hi> the laſt of <hi>February:</hi> The 7 <hi>January</hi> New Stile is
the 28 <hi>December</hi> Old Stile, and 2 Uſances from the 28
<hi>December</hi> is the 28, that is (except in the Leap year) the
laſt of <hi>February:</hi> The 8, 9, and 10 <hi>January</hi> New Stile is
the 29, 30, and 31 <hi>December</hi> Old Stile, and to reckon 2
Uſances from the 29, 30, and 31 of <hi>December,</hi> would be
the 29, 30, and 31 <hi>February,</hi> if <hi>February</hi> had ſo many
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110418:12"/>
days; but becauſe that month hath but 28, or at moſt but
29 days, they muſt all fall due the laſt of <hi>February.</hi> And
whereas ſome would account the two firſt of thoſe Bills
to be due the 26 and 27 <hi>February,</hi> The ſame would be
inconſiſtent with the General and Univerſal Received
Cuſtome, That every Uſance is to be taken for a month
as it falls in the Kalendar; and as to go beyond the month
would be an addition, ſo not to go to the extent of it,
would be a diminution of the 2 Uſances; according to the
Proverb, <hi>Where it is not to be had, the King muſt loſe his
Right:</hi> So where the days cannot be found in the month,
there they muſt be content with what there is. But it
doth not from hence follow, that any ſhall loſe or abate of
his Right where it may be had, and no more doth it in
this Caſe; and therefore they ought to reckon as far as
the month will bear. If any ſhall ſay, That the 29 <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
wants 2 days of the end of that month, and
that therefore the Bill muſt fall due 2 days before the end
of the ſecond month following; It is a Method not known
or practiſed amongſt Merchants, and would occaſion new
Diſputes never heard of: For by the ſame reaſon it may
be pretended, That a Bill Dated in <hi>Rouen</hi> the 28 <hi>February,</hi>
ſhall not be due in <hi>London</hi> till the 20 <hi>April,</hi> becauſe that day
is 10 days before the end of the month, as the 18 <hi>February</hi>
was, on which the Bill was Dated.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That this latter way of Accompting, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the months fall out in <hi>England,</hi> from the true Date
of the Bill, was the ancient practice, and the other way
never inſiſted on till within theſe 30 years laſt paſt; as alſo
that in <hi>France</hi> and other Parts, on Bills from <hi>England,</hi> they
firſt find out the true Date, and then reckon the 2 Uſances:
As for inſtance: A Bill Dated at <hi>London</hi> the 26 <hi>December,</hi>
at 2 Uſance, will be accounted due at <hi>Rouen</hi> the 5 <hi>March,</hi>
thus, the 26 <hi>December</hi> Old Stile is the 5 <hi>January</hi> New Stile,
and 2 Uſances from the 5 <hi>January</hi> is the 5 <hi>March;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110418:12"/>
if they accounted according to the other way, it would
be thus, 2 Uſances from the 26 <hi>December</hi> is the 26 <hi>February,</hi>
and the 26 <hi>February</hi> Old Stile is the 8 <hi>March</hi> New Stile:
So the Bill ſhould not be due at <hi>Rouen</hi> till the 8 <hi>March,</hi>
whereas in truth, according to the practice there, it is
due the 5 <hi>March:</hi> Alſo Bills Dated in <hi>London</hi> the 18, 19,
20, and 21 <hi>December,</hi> at 2 Uſance, are accounted due at
<hi>Rouen</hi> the laſt of <hi>February.</hi> And thus much hath been
lately certified from the ſaid place.</p>
                  <p>Many perſons, becauſe of the Diſputes about the way
of accounting the time, do calculate both ways, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one way, ſometimes the other, according as they
find their intereſt and advantage, which occaſions much
inconvenience and diſorder; and therefore it is propoſed,
That the latter way of accounting before-mentioned
ought to be only practiſed, as being moſt reaſonable, moſt
certain, and the truly ancient Cuſtome and Practice.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Some do calculate theſe Bills thus: The 10 <hi>March</hi> is

31 <hi>January,</hi> and not before.</p>
                  <p>For reaſon hereof they ſay, It is by Univerſal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
and Practice amongſt Merchants acknowledged,
That Uſance from <hi>France</hi> is one month, according as the
months are in the Kalendar, and that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

of one month they muſt reckon to the laſt of the
two months following, or elſe they do not allow two
full Kalendar months for the 2 Uſances, which undeniably
ought to be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> It is Objected, That if ſo, then it would fall out,

<hi>May,</hi> the 21 of <hi>August,</hi> the 20 or 21 of the next month,
according as it hath 30 or 31 days, and the 21 of <hi>August</hi>
next.</p>
                  <p>Others do affirm, That ſuch expreſſions are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
and taken according to the Stile in the place
where the Bills are payable; for though the Drawer
make the Bills in <hi>Paris,</hi> yet by his Bill he ſpeaks to one in
<hi>London,</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> and till the Bill come to <hi>London</hi> to
the Party on whom it is drawn, it may be ſaid to be
ſilent, but then being preſented to him for Acceptance
or Payment, it ſpeaks with authority, and muſt be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
either with a refuſal, or elſe with compliance. So that
what conſtruction would be made of a <hi>Pariſians</hi> Word or
Order, if he were in perſon at <hi>London,</hi> and ſhould ſay to
his Factor, <hi>On the 15 of the next month pay, &amp;c.</hi> the ſame
ought to be made of the like expreſſion in his Bill; and
accordingly ſuch Bills are, and ought to be accounted due
and payable on the 15 of the next month, the 15 of <hi>May,</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:110418:14"/>
the 31 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the laſt of the next month, and the 31
of <hi>Auguſt</hi> next.</p>
                  <p>This laſt way of reckoning when ſuch Bills are due,
according to the Stile where the Bills are payable, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
moſt agreeable to Reaſon and the Nature of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
and ought to be the onely Method and Rule in
ſuch Caſes. However it were better that perſons would
always take care, that the Stile, according to which ſuch
expreſſions are by them intended, ſhould be inſerted in
the Bills, which would prevent all inconvenience: And
if they neglect ſo to do, they muſt onely blame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
if it anſwer not to their apprehenſions and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

                  <head>The following Rules were in former times by all generally
received as the Cuſtome of Merchants.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, That Uſance, whether it be one month or three
months, according to the Cuſtome of the Place where the
Bill is drawn, The months are always to be accounted
according to the Kalendar, whether the months contain
in them more or leſs days.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That theſe Uſances are to be accounted from
the true and real Date of the Bills, according to the Stile
and reckoning of the place where the Bills are payable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That New Stile being always 10 days before
Old Stile, it muſt always be, that the <hi>10th</hi> of one month
New Stile is the laſt of the former Old Stile; and that
Uſance being a full month, it muſt extend from the laſt of
one month to the laſt of the next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That for all Bills payable at a certain day or
time, mentioned in the Bill of Exchange it ſelf, if there
be no declaration in the Bill what Stile is thereby inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
it ought to be underſtood according to the Stile of
the place where the Bill is to be paid.</p>

                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:110418:14"/>
By theſe Rules, as being the Cuſtome of Merchants in
<hi>London,</hi> it is conceived, That all Queſtions touching the
falling due of Foreign Bills of Exchange, may and ought
to be determined.</p>
