            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To the Honourable
CITY of LONDON.</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat having a <hi>wrinkle</hi> more in their Arſe ſince they knew of General <hi>Monk</hi>'s
Fidelity to his Countrey, and it being now all in a <hi>pucker,</hi> and rumpled
with the Frownes of an incenſed, and inraged people, they humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
the ſoft, and tender hands, of your fair, and pittifull Dames, to ſtroke
it, and ſmooth it out; although they well know, that the general cry, and
vogue of the Nations, is to have it ſtretched out according to the
Kings Lawes.</p>
            <p>That they are ſick of a new, and ſtrange diſeaſe, called the <hi>Vertigo</hi> of the
Tayl, a dizzineſſe, wherein they perceive Divine Vengeance going round;
and are informed, that the City Doctor <hi>Dun,</hi> hath a ſoveraign remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, which, with <hi>Paddingtons</hi> wholeſome air, never yet fail'd the Patient.</p>
            <p>That they would make it their requeſt to this Honourable City, that they would be graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to paſſe by, and forget their high inſolencies and affronts, in the breaking down their Gates, and
deſtroying the Perculliſes, though in point of Honour, you are obliged to ſet up their quarters, and your
gates together.</p>
            <p>That having now a rattle at their Tail, if you once but cry Halloe, they will run over the three
Kingdomes without any purſuit, till they have run themſelves down to Old <hi>Nick,</hi> where you may be ſure
they ſhall never trouble you any more; elſe, give them but breathing time, and up riſeth the Rump, as
plump as any Partridge. Back again they will to the Onions and Garlick in <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Gardens, rather then
you ſhall taſte the Manna of a Free Parliament; for as for this <hi>Monk,</hi> they know not what he is.</p>
            <p>Remember their unwearied deſires, and endeavours after your wealth and goods, and with what an
envious eye they have aimed at your peace and proſperity; think on their frugal, and mild adminiſtration
of Government, which hath begger'd, and butchered three Kingdomes, and left not any intire part of the
body, but a miſhapen, ſhameleſſe, Sr. Rump.</p>
            <p>They have little more to add to this heap of confuſion you are brought to, but to offer to your ſerious
conſideration, the Merits of the Good Old Cauſe, which they have intruſted in the hands of Alderman
<hi>Tichburn</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> till their return, but yet before they goe, if you prevent them not by paring their nayles,
they will ſcratch their Arſe to the <hi>Bare bones,</hi> but they'l be revenged on you all; For that party by a new
carving, are the Sides-men to the RUMP. They have but theſe following requeſts to make you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That you would ſend a T—Sirreverence, to Collonel</hi> Overton, <hi>for the victualling the Garriſon at</hi> Hull; <hi>there the
Rebellion begun, and thither will the Reliques of it take to for Refuge. That you would tye up the tackle of this</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane
