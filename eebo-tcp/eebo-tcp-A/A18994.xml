         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8523:4"/>
This hath equally (with the other) it force, power, authoritie, rule, and iuriſdiction. Briefly it is deſcended from the ſame ſtocke: namely, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall crowne of this land. But this neuertheleſse, though parcell of the ſame gouernment or pollicie, he hath paſſed ouer, onely with a bare mention.</p>
            <p>Neither is it anie maruell: for being (when hee wrote that worke) in the midſt of ſo weightie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, ambaſſadour in the court of France: it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemes, than contrarie, his buſineſse, there, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented him: how could he otherwiſe, or at the leaſt be iudged ſo, by any probabilitie, being (as he was) of that authoritie in his own profeſsion, <hi>viz.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the ciuill law, haue pictured (as he did) that courſe ſo liuely, where leaſt hee was experienced, and omitted the other?</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhops (he ſaith) and Biſhops haue a certaine peculiar iuriſdiction in teſtaments, lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tithes, mortuaries, marriages, adulterie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, orders, religion, &amp;c. Theſe (he ſaith be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their courtes, after the faſhion and maner of the law ciuill, or rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon by citation, libel, <hi>conteſtationem litis,</hi> examination of witneſses priuily, by exceptions, replications apart, and in writing, allegations, matters by ſentences giuen in writing, appellations from one to another, as well à <hi>grauamine,</hi> as <hi>à ſententia definitiua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8523:4"/>
Their names he addeth and titles of Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, aduocates, aſſeſsors, ordinaries, commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. far from the maner (as he ſaith, and as it is indeed) of our order in the common lawe of England, that part of the policie or gouernment of the land that hee handled at large, and this is all the light he hath left of the ſpirituall courſe, the other.</p>
            <p>I haue therefore aduentured (gentle reader) to imitate that worthy learned man in his ſecular tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als there, in this ſpiritual cogniſance, <hi>The triall of Baſtardie</hi> here.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſse, becauſe it ariſeth, the queſtion of Natiuities in the ſecular courts, but incede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly: and the Ordinaries iurisdiction (by conſequence) not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie in that triall, but <hi>delegata</hi> (as it followeth more at large in this treatiſe:) it muſt, this part of that ſecond part of gouernment, be alwaies vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as the iuriſdiction to the Ordinarie is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandata</hi> from the prince, and not otherwiſe. I haue therefore compoſed it, and not (I hope) vnaptly, atreatiſe of it ſelfe: and that becauſe the iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this triall is diuerſe from the reſt. This is therefore preſented vnto thee heere: the reſt thou ſhalt haue, if God permit, in the tractat of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time (if it pleaſe thee to accept it) this thou ſhalt haue withall, <hi>viz.</hi> How the lawes,
<pb facs="tcp:8523:5"/>
how the canons, haue and do either of them eſteem of Baſtardy diuerſly: and how they haue and do, the laws and canons, make their computations (in degrees of conſanguinitie) diuerſly.</p>
            <p>This computation (verily) in degrees in this kind, inconſideratly, that is to ſay, without regard of the laws, and canons, how they repute the ſame, begat in former ages no ſmall error in Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, the laws of Matrimonie, the holy Fathers numeration, and auncient Computation of the Church.</p>
            <p>Of ſuch an effect as this, that infringed ſo long ago the prohibibition of marriage, commended alſo vnto thee here in euery kind, where both the tree, and forbidden fruit is pictured, <hi>Eſtimandum eſt,</hi> or rather to be feared it is, of ſuch coniunctions had, a baſe kind of people, ignoble, and licentious to be begotten, apt to prouoke in time, euen the reſt to naughtineſſe alſo, and make them become in fine, nor manly in war, nor ſtable in faith, nor honoured of men, nor beloued of God.</p>
            <p>But let no man be here too ſeuere a iudge: for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſomtimes ſprings from lawleſſe knowledge, and vice againe from lawfull: neither let me flatter nor offend: the one is no defence of ſinne, nor the other impeachment of lawfull matrimony: for neyther doth the adulterous child that is vertuous, nor ſhake
<pb facs="tcp:8523:5"/>
off, nor ſhadow his adulterous parents crime, nor the legitimat that is vicious, diſhonour the vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led bed. And to this effect it is written, <hi>Sicut boni filij adulterorum, nulla eſt defenſio ſic mali filij coniugatorum, nullum eſt crimen nuptiarum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let him therfore neuer feare to ſincke, that hath this reſt to beare him, namely, vertue: for though his parents be the worſt, their vileneſse ſhall not blemiſh him at all, if vertue beares him vp: for if themſelues (if conuerts afterwards) their former life deſtroys not, much more their off-ſpring dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with his proper vertue ſhines, and ſhall not be eclipſed with the oprobrious liues of his parents; and why? <hi>Non eſt eius culpa qui naſcitur,</hi> It is anſwered thus, it is not his default that is borne, <note place="margin">Hierom. in Epiſt. cont.

            <p>I would be loath in mouing a charitable iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſonne, to ſeeme to giue hope to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or libertie to offend, Godforbid.

doth owe a certaine honour, reuerence, and feare to his parents, and therefore vnto others of his kinne, which come verie nigh of the ſame, in ſo much that in old time (as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> ſheweth) it was not lawful for the ſonne, to bath in one place with his father, leaſt he ſhould ſee him naked.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, ſuch perſons muſt needes be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and in companie together: if nature therefore abhorred not knowledge in ſuch, they ſhould haue too much opportunitie to licentious liuing, whoſe neereneſſe remooueth all ſuſpition from the world.

            <p>Thirdly, ſuch marriages ſhall hinder that mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loue and friendſhip, that is both profitable and honeſt to human ſocietie, for when a man doth take a wife that is a ſtranger to him, all the kinred of his wife be knit vnto him by a certaine league of friendſhip and loue, as if they were his owne: this hath nature ordeined alreadie in blood.

In the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the determinations of the moſt famous and moſt excellent vniuerſities &amp;c. fourth Chap. after the authour (whoſoeuer he was) had cited, touching ſuch vnlawfull marriages, the doctours of the church of Chriſt, that were of greatest authoritie, fame, and renowne, he deſcended to others, which, though not of ſo great authoritie, yet their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their credit, learning and grauitie, was receiued worthely, amongſt whom he affirmed (to this effect) of an Archbiſhop in this land, <hi>viz.</hi> being asked by what reaſon the forbidding we ſhould not marrie in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſanguinitie nor affinitie, had ſo great ſtrength and power in the church? anſwered. <hi>The laws and Canons of the church, be full of this commandement, and there be many decrees of the old fathers alſo, that we ſhould not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with any of our blood, &amp;c. and as for the cauſe and reaſon of this commaundement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I might ſay that the ſimple and plaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, to obey the power and authoritie of them to whom Chriſt ſaid, It is not you your ſelfe that ſpeaketh, but the ſpirit of your father</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There is light &amp; darkneſſe, good and euill, there be lawfull and expedient, lawfull not expedient, nor lawfull, nor expedient marriages; theſe be ſeen in diuers families, in outward degrees, in nigh kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: with this, I commend to the reader the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Engliſh church, that is, to conſider in contracts of matrimonie, what is lawfull, what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, what expedient.</p>

Thy <hi>ius primogeniti,</hi> thy fathers inheritance, take it by the legall figure, it is lawfull for thee, and number vnto that, by that computation there, <hi>viz.</hi> Father, Sonne, 1. 2. and ſo in order in the reſidue. But ſeeke not a wife by that computation, in the other that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth; namely the canonicall figure, ſpecially in the midſt of the tree, thou haſt no portion there: thou ſhalt not come neere it, but touch it not in any wiſe: it is the kindred of thy fleſh, yea, thy fathers bloud, which forced, he that caſt out <hi>Adam</hi> from the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden, and ſet the cherubins there, and the blade of a ſword, to keepe the way of the tree of life, <note place="margin">Gen. chap. 3.</note> hath ſaid, That bloud ſhalbe vpon thee: and though thou tarrieſt <hi>(i.</hi> Thou dieſt not the death) becauſe the <note place="margin">Leuit. chap. 20</note> iudiciall is gone, yet the morrall law abideth, which thou tranſgreſſeſt, and neuer dwelleſt long in that ſeede, and thy fathers inheritance togither: for the Lord hath ſet a ſword, to keepe the way thereof, from that poſteritie.</p>
               <p>It commeth thus to paſſe that two legal degrees do make but one canonicall: brothers (for example) reckoned after the ſecular lawes in the ſecond degree in legal ſucceſſion; after the canons be numbred in the firſt, in cauſes of matrimonie: their children (there) in the fourth, here in the ſecond: (there) their nephewes in the ſixt, here in the third, and ſo deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtill in the collateral lines (for otherwiſe they differ not) the 8 and 10 by the lawes, the 4 and 5 by the canons, and ſo of the reſidue.</p>

This is after the Canons, and not the ſecular lawes, whoſe reaſon and difference we haue handled in the ſecond chapter before, neuertheleſſe it ſhall not be ſuperfluous to deliuer (as they tearme them) ſuch Magiſtral rules as the autenticall maiſters, fathers and doctors of the law haue determined in theſe lines to diſtinguiſh as well the degrees, as to ſhew the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference we haue mentioned betweene the lawes and the Canons, the firſt wherof is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the right or ſtraight aſcending and deſcending lines, how many perſons there be (computation had <note place="margin">The firſt rule</note>

of themſelues &amp; the perſons that be placed betwixt them) whoſe diſtance is demaunded, ſubſtracting but one, there be ſo many degrees.

               <p>The ſame concluſion is of <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> and his deſcending d. for there be numbred likewiſe fiue perſons, and ſo concluded foure degrees.</p>
               <p>If thou wouldſt know how they differ, D. from d, thou ſhalt finde there be numbred nine perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude eight degrees, &amp; that they differ conſequentlie D. and d. either from other in the eight degree: the rule holdeth in this line in the reſidue, all one here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the laws and Canons, onely their difference is in the Collaterals, whoſe Magiſtral rules be theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Collaterals in the equall line, how many perſons <note place="margin">The ſecond rule.</note> there be from either of them to their common ſtock, ſo far they differ either fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other; from <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) to D. there be foure perſons, from h4. likewiſe to the ſame ſtocke D, be foure perſons, <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> and h4. ſhall differ therfore, and be diſtant from themſelues in the fourth degree. This is after the Canons.</p>
               <p>After the laws it is otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> collaterals in the equal line, how far they differ either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their ſtock in number of perſons, in that number doubled they be diſtant from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues; this is apparant in the Legal figure, in the 2.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8523:37"/>
of perſons from D and from h 4 to the ſame D there, there be numbred likewiſe foure perſons; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe numbers doubled from the perſons to their common ſtocke, that is to ſay, either from <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> to D, or h 4 to the ſame D, in that Legal figure maketh the number of eight: ſo many degrees ſhall the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be a ſunder, and this diuerſitie ariſeth as we haue touched in the 2. Chap. before, in that euery perſon addeth a degree in the collaterals, after the laws: as two brothers make two Legal degrees, which after the Canons do make but one. Their computations be diuers, as alſo their cauſes be diuers, whoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and difference we referre to the ſaid 2. chapter before, only this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we may note in this place, becauſe it is not mentioned there, <hi>viz.</hi> In the equal collaterall line, whether the line conſiſteth of euen or odde numbers, the degree falleth alwaies out (in number) to be euen, after the lawes: this may be ſeen in the Legal figure in the 2. and 4. and 1. and 3. ſtocks there, for 2. make 4. and 4. make 8. in the equal col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral line, as alſo do 1 make 2, &amp; 3, 6, in the ſame col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral line: this appeareth in this Canonicall figure otherwiſe, for 1 maketh one, 3 three, 5. fiue, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The rule remaineth now to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, touching <note place="margin">The third rule.</note> collaterals in the vnequall line, which after the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Collaterals in the vnequal line, how far they differ (the furdeſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) from their ſtocke, ſo farre they be either of them diſtant from themſelues: for example, D is the ſtocke to <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> and f4 in this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, to know their diſtance in bloud, we muſt make our computation from the furtheſt: this appeareth in the figure to be <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, which differeth in the fourth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8523:37"/>
degree from D, ſo many degrees therefore ſhall hee differ from f4 and conſequently <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> and f4 either from other. The ſame in the other deſcending colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terals vnto <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, <hi>Vſquè ad lineam aequalitatis:</hi> that is to ſay, The ſame computation that is had from <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> to the ſaid common ſtocke, the ſame computation ſhall hold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> and euery deſcending perſon from the ſame ſtocke collaterall vnto <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, euen to his equall collaterall line: for they increaſe not (as we haue ſaid before) one degree vnto <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, till they ſhal haue excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his equall collaterall line.</p>
               <p>This (if wee proſecute our example in the ſame ſtocke, D) ſhalbe manifeſt: for <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> differing from this ſtocke in the fourth degree, differeth therefore from e4 in the fourth degree, from f4 in the fourth, from g4 in the fourth: and from h4 in the fourth. Hence it is holden an infallible rule in the canons, that a perſon begotten, begetteth not a degree, till the equall line be exceeded: and then (and not before) they increaſe in euery added perſon.</p>
               <p>It is otherwiſe after the legall computation, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the lawes it is thus: <hi>viz</hi> collaterals in the vnequal line, how many perſons there be, (ſubſtracting the ſtocke) ſo many degrees. This appeareth in the ſame ſtocke and perſons that wee ſuppoſed in the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall computation before: for <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> differeth heere (as there) from D in the fourth degree: but e 4 (heere) in the fift, f4 in the ſixt, g4 in the ſeuenth, and h4 in the eight, and ſo euery perſon without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception (after the lawes) doth increaſe a degree.

Conſequently they ſhalbe, euerie perſon in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinitie to my wife, in affinitie vnto me; in what degree in the one, in that degree in the other; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the firſt kinde, be they brother, ſiſter, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, neece, or any other perſon mentioned in this figure: for note, it conteineth not (this figure) but onely affinitie in the firſt kinde, and that to the fourth degree: foraſmuch as the prohibition of marriage, by the canons (now) exceedeth not the ſame in kind, nor degree. <note n="d" place="margin">c.

               </p>
               <p>It ſhalbe neceſſarie heere, wee further declare the force and operation of affinitie (touching this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of marriage) that is ſprung by vnlawfull knowledge, either in matrimonie, or without: for ſo it may be as vnlawfully contracted in the one, as in the other; as if <hi>Titius</hi> ſhall haue knowledge with <hi>Berta,</hi> whoſe mother hee marries afterwardes, and knowes hir likewiſe carnally, in this caſe ſhall <hi>Titius</hi> be diuorced from <hi>Bertas</hi> mother, and prohibited to contract with <hi>Berta</hi> hir ſelfe; and the reaſon is, <hi>Titius</hi> ſhall not dwell with the mother whom he married, becauſe hee contracted affinitie with her before, in his knowledge had with hir daughter. And he ſhall <note place="margin">Stat. anno 28. Hen. 8 cap. 8. verſe, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dilate. &amp;c.

               <p>Briefly thus the law conſiders in theſe caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> which goeth before, or followeth, the affinitie, or the contract; if affinitie, then the contract is diſabled that is had afterwardes; but if the contract, that affinitie

preuaileth nothing that is ſubſequent.

               <p>The ſecond kind therfore of affinitie is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Ad to the firſt kind therof a perſon carnallie, as to thy brothers wife (ſuppoſing thy brother to be dead) a ſecond husband, a ſecond husband I tearme him, in reſpect of thy affinitie with hir; for happilie ſhe had vttered a double ſecond before, with theſe thou haſt nothing to do, but this ſecond to thy brother, more properly thy brothers ſucceſſour, is the ſecond kinde of affinitie vnto thee <note n="f" place="margin">35. Q. eod. de propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis.</note>.</p>
               <p>If thou wilt haue the third breefly, it is this, ad to thy ſecond affinitie a perſon likewiſe carnallie, as to thy brothers wiues husband (ſuppoſing hir to bee dead as thy brother was before) another wife this is, <hi>Quid pro quo,</hi> one for another, merrily engliſhed. For a reed a Rams horne; but in earneſt take hir and thy third affinitie together.</p>
               <p>So it is ſaid to be <hi>Primum genus, i.</hi> The firſt kind of affinitie, <hi>Quia primo emanat de conſanguinitate: vel quiae (vna perſona mediante) contr ahitur. Secundum, i.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kind of affinitie, <hi>Quia ſecundo loco emanat, poſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, vel quia duabus perſonis mediantibus contrahitur.

               </p>
               <p>The effect we haue explaned hereof, in theſe three ſeueral kindes already, briefly they be ſo called, the firſt of <hi>one,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>two,</hi> the third of <hi>three;</hi> but we proſecute onely the firſt, for the other we haue rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8523:40"/>
them to manifeſt the better this firſt, as alſo to giue a light (as I haue ſayd) of the former Canons, and otherwiſe they haue no being here.</p>
               <p>Touching therefore this firſt kind of affinitie, it is to be noted, and ſo it may be gathered by that we haue ſayd before, <hi>viz.</hi> It is contracted <hi>inter ſp onſum &amp; conſanguineas ſponſae,</hi> and againe, <hi>inter ſponſam &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguineos ſponſi,</hi> as much to ſay, It is contracted (this firſt kind of affinitie) reciprocally, <hi>i.</hi> between the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and conſanguines of the wife; and <hi>è conuerſo,</hi> betweene the wife and conſanguines of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, howbeit betweene the conſanguines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by this marriage, there is no affinitie contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, more than was betweene <hi>Hobſon</hi> and <hi>Iobſon,</hi> by looking through a hedge when they ſpyed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſomewhat nearer, but <hi>Hoc aliquid nihil eſt, i.</hi> ſo far from this attinencie, that it hath no conſequence at all.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that the father and ſonne may contract and conſumate marriage with the mother &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as widdows &amp; widdowers do; &amp; may do, &amp; their ſons and daughters, ſuch as be ſo prouided for their children, when they couenant for themſelues: hence may alſo two brothers contract and conſumate mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with two ſiſters <note n="g" place="margin">C. quod ſuper his ext. de conſ. &amp; aff.</note>, the like of the vncle and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <note n="h" place="margin">C. r. &amp; 2. eod. tit. xxxv. q. v. ſanè.</note>.</p>
               <p>Many attinencies may hereby be ſprung between the ſame perſons: this may be ſeen in children of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers families, that be ſons either of them to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; to their husbands, ſons and brothers; and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and nephew, to themſelues.

               <p>The poſitiue conſtitutions therfore of the church of England haue added certaine perſons vnto theſe; that is to ſay, onely in names and tearmes, but not in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8523:46"/>
degree, for though they be not found to be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Leuitical, in their names and tearms their nearneſſe (notwithſtanding) in the ſame degrees, is as manifeſt as the reſt, &amp; whoſe ſhames thou diſcouereſt equally with theirs, &amp; thine owne abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Be not therfore deceiued, it is not the name of Conſanguinity, or affinity, wherin the ſubſtance co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of this prohibition, but the degree. I might cite many laws, but let the ſtatutes ſuffice, they follow in their orders, <hi>viz.</hi> in the chapter next enſuing, there thou ſhalt find them mentioned, not the Leuitical names, but degrees.</p>
               <p>Such be in the aſcending line, thy grand-mother, grand fathers wife, wiues grand-mother; not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned (there) in their names and tearmes, equallie (notwithſtanding) diſtant in degree from thee, with thy ſonnes daughter, daughters daughter, wiues ſons daughter, wiues daughters daughter, whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition comprehendeth, in their ſeueral names and tearmes: adde vnto theſe thy ſons ſons wife, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſonnes wife, whom the church hath decreed the ſame prohibition extends to. For note, their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in their lines, <hi>viz.</hi> They be diſtinguiſhed by aſcending and deſcending lines: that is to ſay, Of thy grand-mother and thy ſonnes daughter, and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters daughter, which be only of the perſons we haue mentioned laſt, conſanguines vnto thee, and in the ſecond degree.</p>
               <p>The ſame reaſon (in affinitie) is of the reſt, that is to ſay, Thy grand-fathers wife, thy wiues grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be equallie (from thee) diſtant with thy wiues ſonnes daughter, &amp; wiues daughters daughter theſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8523:46"/>
in affinitie, the other in conſanguinity, as for thy ſons ſons wife, daughters ſons wife, they be equals vnto thee with thy wiues ſons daughter, wiues daughters daughter, <hi>i.</hi> They differ not in line nor degree: only as before is ſaid, they be diſtinguiſhed from the perſons we haue mentioned before by conſanguinitie, &amp; affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: otherwiſe the prohibition equally holdeth in them all. Such perſons be alſo in the vnequall colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall lines, <hi>viz.</hi> Thy brothers daughter: thy ſiſters daughter; brothers ſonnes wife; ſiſters ſonnes wife; wiues brothers daughter; wiues ſiſter daughter: that is to ſay, equally diſtant from thee in conſanguinitie, thy brothers and ſiſters daughters, with thy fathers and mothers ſiſters: adde vnto theſe in affinitie thy fathers brothers wife, thy mothers brothers wife, wiues fathers ſiſter, wiues mothers ſiſter: Theſe in the aſcendents. In the deſcendents, to the other; that is to ſay, to thy brothers and ſiſters daughters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguines vnto thee, and deſcendents, adde (in affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) thy brothers and ſiſters ſonnes wiues, and thy wiues brothers, and hir ſiſters daughters.</p>
               <p>Theſe be all in conſanguinitie and affinitie vnto thee in the vnequall collaterall lines, aſcending and deſcending, aſwel mentioned as not mentioned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in the Leuitical law in their names and termes, in the ſame ſecond degree. This may appeare more plainly in the table of prohibited marriages, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within that table annexed at the end of this booke.</p>
               <p>Touching now the canons, <hi>i.</hi> The poſitiue canon lawe, I referre thee to the figures of conſanguinitie and affinitie before, as alſo to this table mentioned.</p>

It ſhal be therefore needleſſe, further to ſpeake of the prohibition of the canons, than briefly that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and computation canonicall wee haue mentioned alreadie may declare it: for that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, vnderſtand withall the prohibition of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; that is to ſay, to the fourth degree: for <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> in that example, may not marrie with any letter in the figure.

            <head>¶ Of the Table and Catalogues heerin contained of degrees.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onferring theſe Catalogues in the table that enſueth together, that is to ſay, the Engliſh and Canonicall with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitical, ſome perſons there ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare within the Leuiticall names and degrees; ſome without the Leuiticall names, but in the degrees; others there ſhall appeare without the Leuiticall names and degrees; the due conſideration whereof is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt of the aſcendents and deſcendentes, ſuch no doubt, though they exceed the Leuiticall names and degrees, yet they be prohibited infinitelie to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in ſo much that <hi>Adam</hi> if he had liued to this day, could not haue married againe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Collaterals, ſuch (with the Leuitical in name and degree) no man doubteth of their prohibition; otherwiſe, that is to ſay, If they differ but in name, <hi>Communi co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſenſu &amp; iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio putantur in Leuitico prohiberi,</hi> thou art (for example) expreſly in the Leuiticall forbidden to marrie thy brothers wife, thy wiues ſiſter is not mentioned there in name, otherwiſe than thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Thou ſhalt not take a wife with hir ſiſter (during hir life) to vexe hir in vncouering hir ſhame vpon hir; but thy brothers
<pb facs="tcp:8523:53"/>
wife neuertheleſſe comprehendeth hir degree, and whom equally thereforethou art prohibited to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is to ſay, as with thy brothers wife, ſo with thy wiues ſiſter, this vnderſtand of the reſidue in this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>viz.</hi> Mothers brothers wife, wiues fathers ſiſter, &amp;c. For the third, that is to ſay, ſuch collaterals as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed both the name and degree Leuitical, doe alſo exceed this prohibition, <hi>i.</hi> they may marrie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion or ſcruple, conſideration had of ſuch collaterals as doe ſauour ſo of the aſcendent and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent lines, that they be parents, or <hi>in loco paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> the one to the other, ſuch be in names collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, becauſe we haue no other tearms to cal them by, <hi>Plures enim ſunt res quàm vocabula,</hi> ſuch is the ſcarſity of our ſpeech, that more things there be, than wee haue names to call them by; ſuch be thy brothers line, ſo neere thine own as may be, we muſt not call them deſcendents, for confounding of lines, nor yet allow them that laterall libertie to make them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward degrees, <hi>Laterall</hi> they be tearmed or <hi>Collaterall à latere,</hi> as much in effect as ſideward of the ſide wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they be placed, as by the figure it may appeare and other deſcriptions in the treatiſe: but ſo neer they be the ſide, that they warme it, and be warmed by it, ſide by ſide, and bloud by bloud; and yet we muſt call them Collaterals, and yet I exhort thee beware of them, they be not forbidden expreſlie, and by name by the law, the Leuiticall law I meane, no more thou ſhalt finde it forbidden expreſly to marrie with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other perſons of thy kinred beſides, thou wilt not therfore ſay it is lawful, god forbid thou ſhouldſt. This I haue red in the works of learned men, it is for
<pb facs="tcp:8523:53"/>
bidden by the right of nature, it is forbidden, by the law that is written in euerie mans heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it is forbidden by loue and charitie, the which we haue handled in this treatiſe before, it is forbidden by title and right of nigh kinred: to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, many great things ſhalt thou finde, if thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt about thee, not forbidden expreſly by the law that <hi>Moſes</hi> made, and yet the ſame be forbidden by a certaine plaine expreſſe commaundement of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſequently by the law of God: for what commaunded <hi>Moſes</hi> from the Lord, as lawfull to be done, that was not expedient? Shall we ſeeke a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition then by name, for euerie perſon, and do the thing (if we finde it not) that is neither expedient nor honeſt? God forbid. I finde it written of <hi>S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> that he affirmed plainlie, The lawe of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth that brothers children ſhould marry, and yet I cannot finde it there expreſly; the occaſion grew by one <hi>Patern,</hi> that had a ſonne by one woman, and a daughter by another, which daughter had a daughter, whom <hi>Patern</hi> would haue married to his ſonne, the maidens halfe vncle, wherein conſulting with <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in this caſe, receiued this aunſwere; I neither thinke nor iudge, ſaith <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> that your biſhop an holy man doth ſo much as looke after my ſentence and iudgement in this matter, for if he had, he would haue written to me of it, and in ſomuch that he writeth not, he ſheweth plainly that he iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this no matter to be doubted on: for what doubt may there be in this caſe, whether thy ſonne and thy daughters daughter, or thy neece by thine owne daughter may marry together, ſeeing the law of God
<pb facs="tcp:8523:54"/>
forbiddeth, that thy ſon ſhould marrie with thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers daughter. And what (faith the ſame author) is moreſolemne, accuſtomed, or more reuerentlie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, than the charitable kiſſe betweene vncle and neece, which he oweth to hir of duety, as to his daughter, &amp; ſhe to him as to hir father? ſhalt thou then go &amp; make this innocent kiſſe of loue and charity, in which is none offence nor ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euil, to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, whilſt thou inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſt ſuch a mariage? as if he ſhuld ſay, Wilt thou betray (as <hi>Iudas</hi> did his maiſter) the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly law of nature, &amp; take away from thy dear pledges or children ſo deuout &amp; religious (a ſacrament) he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it, but a token of pure and naturall loue, as alſo he doth, wee may terme it ſtil.</p>
            <p>And touching the furtheſt diſtant of the perſons we haue mentioned laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Brothers children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a maner, they be brothers and ſiſters, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming all of one parent, grandfather grandmother, or both; but the ſecond ſtocke of the tree, or figure of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinitie, in this treatiſe before, if it were for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, yet for the reuerence that they owe to the ſame pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, <hi>Theodoſ</hi> the Emperour would haue them abſtain from marriage the one with the other. But to leaue the Emperours law, there is a law of this land, (the Lord preſerue it and the life of the ſame) this we haue touched in the diuiſion of this table hereafter; but there is a law, and this we haue touched too, the Lord write it in our minds and in our hearts, that he may be our God, and we may be his people.</p>

            <p>Theſe catalogues doe concurre togither in 16 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, wherein they differ not in name, number, nor degreee: there the Leuiticall ceaſſeth, in name and number; and the Engliſh and canonicall go on, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied ſtill with the Leuiticall degree, to the number of 14 perſons more: there ceaſſeth the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and the poſitiue canon goes on alone, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe accompanied with the 2 degree, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 12 perſons more; and there that degree reſteth, and leaueth the canon catalogue alone, &amp; yet the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue reſteth not, but hath betake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it to outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, namely the 3 and 4, wherewith it goeth on to the number of perſons mentioned in this table hereafter.</p>
