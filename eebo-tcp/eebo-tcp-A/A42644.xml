            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable the Parliament, and the Councell of State of <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The most <hi>Humble Expression of Sir</hi> Balthazar Gerbier, <hi>concerning his Integrity and zeale to this State and Nation; and the account he desires to give thereof:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS the thoughts of men are only knowne to God, and men onely to judge by words and actions; As it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to all States that men should not offend by words or deeds; So it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to know their intentions, especially in unsetled times, that there wants no men who minde but mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; who also make it their work to traduce all such as run not their course; Which being a known Truth, justly moves the said Sir <hi>Balthazar Gerbier,</hi> to declare, first, that it was a true zeale towards this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which moved him to come to it, in the year 1616 (from <hi>Zealand</hi> his Native Country, belonging to the States Generall) and to apply himself during the best part of so many yeares since to the publique service; Hee never to his knowledge by Word or Action, said or did any thing, that might or could contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the truth of that zeale by him profest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:46391:2"/>Secondly, That as soon as he perceived this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be threatned with disturbances, hee (by the intercession of the Prince Elector Palatine, the then King being at <hi>Yorke</hi>) became an humble Suitor for leave to retire, and to return beyond the Seas, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then to abandon all Court entertainments, and imployments, that could have argued in him a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, contradicting what he had so long profest; and so preferred the keeping entire and spotlesse his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity before all other worldly considerations in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as in particular, the recovery of all such summes of money as hee hath disburst during his Residency abroad, for the service of the State, and at home in his charge of <hi>Master of Ceremonies,</hi> for which hee had gotten some Tallies struck upon Bishops, which were stopt soon after that it was told at Court, he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not to pay Assessements, and which was the cause also that Sir <hi>Clement Cotterell</hi> being at <hi>Oxford,</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly invested in his charge, though it was setled upon the said Sir <hi>Balthazar Gerbier,</hi> during life, by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent under the then great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> first as adjoynt to his Predecessor Sir <hi>John Finet,</hi> and since his decease in quality of <hi>Sole Master of Ceremonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which could not be taken from him, except he had merited that which was most unjustly and injuriously told to his face, (by the Instigation of the Lord <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington</hi>) that hee had deserved to be hanged by his Legges, for having named those who did betray this State. The Interest whereof, being the cause of what he then did, was ever so deare unto him as it shall ever be preferred by him beyond all that may concern his particular, as in that of his Office of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Ceremonies,</hi> during life, he shall never complain
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46391:2"/>
against the State, that it was, during his absence setled upon a Gentleman, who for his service in quality of publique Minister hath well deserved; and who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all the necessary qualities, is so fit for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that during his seven years absence, he hath not only continued to contribute to the maintenance of the Army by due payments of Assessements, and all kind of taxations, (though himself deprived of all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments). But publiquely profest to wish the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of this State, against all Forreigne and Inland Enemies, with the same zeale and integrity of mind as he hath proceeded with, during his former twelve yeares constant Residency in the Court of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> whence he did as diligently as possibly he could, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertize the State of all the Trecheries intended and acted against the same, as he did divers times repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the late King, that his Neighbours would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver consider his power, except it was seasoned with an harmonious concordance of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> of which truth the said Sir <hi>Balthazar Gerbier,</hi> appeales to his Journalls which the State doth possesse.</p>
            <p>But his fidelitie to the State proved to him his utter ruine, so great then being the resentments of those who were offended; that in obedience to the Parliament he named those who advertised the publick ministers of State in forraign Courts, especially those of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> of all the secrets of this State, and who did crosse and overthrow divers of the most important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires wherein the honour and greatnesse of this Nation was concerned. Fourthly</p>
            <p>That his late re passing the seas hither with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was on the same grounds he first came to this State
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46391:3"/>
whence he departed without standing in need of any <hi>quietus est,</hi> having that of his own conscience, the free score whereon he was again moved to present himself, and to offer to give such a ful account of all his actions as should be thought fit, besides the explaining of all such expedients contained in severall of his papers, both written and Printed, and as were sent first by himself to the right Honourable Master Speaker, since the year 1646, and by M. <hi>Reni Augier</hi> this States resident at <hi>Paris</hi> (to whom the said Sir <hi>Balthazar Gerbier</hi> shal alway appeal, as to an infallible witnesse of his zeal, affection &amp; fidelity to this State) By which expedients (whenput in practice) the revenue of the State may be augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by two or three hundred thousand pound <hi>per an.</hi> &amp; this with notable advantage &amp; applause of the people, as may prove the present use of one of them, by him so long since proposed, which having bin observed by the late Dr. <hi>Dorisla,</hi> hath also by some active person been presented to the Parliam. under the notion of an Office <hi>of general Remembrances of matters of Record,</hi> which when setled, and practised as it ought to be, may render to the State more then fortie thousand pound <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And finallie the ground of the said Sir <hi>B. Gerbier</hi> his comming over to be for the erecting of an Academy, on all such Principles and orders as are mentioned in his Treatises heretofore presented to divers Members of this Honorable Court of Parliament, and of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of State, and in the following leaves.</p>
            <p>For the performance whereof he in his own person (&amp; in those of his own family) undertakes, as also to prove his said design to tend to the glory of God, the honor of the Nation, the improvement of all lovers of Vertue, and the breeding of youth therein.</p>

on this most Noble, and most necessary designe (how great and laborious soever it may prove to him and his) to apply all his time, his cares, labours, faculties, and all possible industry, as well in his owne person, as by those that shall teach the <hi>Hebrew, Greeke, Latine, French, Italian, Spanish, German,</hi> and <hi>Low Dutch,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall sorts of Hands of excellent Writing both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Moderne Histories, joyntly with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and Government of the most famous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and States of the World, besides the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall Naturall Philosophy, as also what is most necessary and most Noble, of the Mathematicks, to wit, Arithmetick; the true method of keeping Books of Account, by Debter and Creditor, as is practized in <hi>Italy,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <p>They will also, Travelling in a more mature age, be the more secured against those, who make it their practice to corrupt young men, &amp; to infuse into them destructive Principles, to their Country, and to their Religion, which is so generally manifest, as no doubt both <hi>Germains, Polonians, Sweds, Danes</hi> and <hi>Flemings</hi> will soon resolve to Travell towards these parts, and to this Academy, which will also redound to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular glory to the Nation, both for the present and for the future, and make good that the present time

               <p>

               <p>They shall not speak any injurious word one to another under the same penalty,</p>
               <p>They shall not without consent go forth on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatsoever, not only during the dayes of their studies, but the Wednesdaies and the Saturdaies in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>They shall not repaire to any kinde of Victualling Houses or Taverns, on pretence of entertainments of such friends as they shall bee visited by, but present them with what is fit within doores, their Chambers, Orchards, or Gardens, and without any offence or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the Academy.</p>

               <p>And whereas possibly by reason of the late yeares disturbances in this State, and the great alterations, and variety of the dispositions of men, The Academy in the receiving of Schollers cannot wel except against any Lovers of Vertue that are minded to improve themselves, Nor suffer any Scholler to bring in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or quarrell about any former passages of the Times, as to reproach one another, much lesse to meddle with any matter of State.</p>
               <p>All Schollers or others belonging to the said A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademie, are to observe and keep this said Rule exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or else to depart, and loose the quarters pay by them advanced according to contract and custome.</p>
