            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He excellent Monsieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> I remember, in his Dedicatory Epistle of his Principles of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, to that illustrious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Princess <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; shewed Himself so much a Courtier, as to profess unto Her Highness, that of all Persons living, who had perused his former Writings, He knew none, that perfectly understood them, except Herself only. This, Madam, is somewhat more than
<pb facs="tcp:55028:3"/>
what I shall adventure to say to you, in this my humble Address. Not that I might not, with the Authority of Truth, and the willing Testimonies of all judicious Persons, whom you have at any time dignified with your incomparable Conversation, affirme; That A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteness of Wit, and Soundness of Iudgement are as Eminent in you, as in any that I know, of either Sex. But, that I conceive it to be more consistent with my Duty of Conformity to the strict Laws of your Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (which is supreme among your many Virtues, if there can be Supremacy where All are Superlative) only to ask you leave, so far to justifie My self, in this way of Devotion, as publikely to own my Assurance; that of all my Readers, none will meet with fewer Difficulties, or discover more Lapses and Errors, than your self: nor could that Book be clearly understood by the Author, when He wrote it, which you cannot easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand, when you are pleased to read it; be the Argument thereof of what kind soever, and the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage either <hi>Italian, French,</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> which are all equally your own.</p>
            <p>But, I have little reason to speak of <hi>justifying</hi> this my Devotion, to the World; when that, by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Tribute of Admiration and Reverence, which your Excellencies duely receive from it, is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that I am not capable of declaring a greater Prudence, in any action of my whole life, than in this of laying down both my self and this mean Oblation of my Observance and Gratitude, at the feet of a Personage, whose single Name is acknowledged to define All the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Perfections of Humanity: and, upon consequence, cannot fail to give to both Me and my Writings not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:55028:3"/>
an Estimation among Good Men; but also a full Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the Malevolence of Evil. And, I have been very lately told by some (and Those such Eminent Witts too; as that very Noble Persons, to whom they have Dedicated their Labours, have thereby received no small Additions of Honour) that they seriously Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the good fortune of my resolution of invocating your Patronage of this Epicurean Philosophy; forasmuch as they were confirmed, that I had taken the most certain course, to procure Immortality thereunto, by offering it up to the Favour of so great an Example of all Heroick Accomplishments, as that Her Memory must ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue verdant and sacred to all Posterity since it could not be, while Generous Minds should conserve the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of Her as the Mirrour in which Vertue used to dresse Herself, when she would appear Amiable and Graceful; but that they must often cast some glances of valew upon the Remains of Him, who had so deep a sentiment of Her goodness, as to have known no other Ambition, but that commendable one of making Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self eternally known for Her most humble and obsequious Votary.</p>
            <p>That, which would more become me, were to make my <hi>Excuses</hi> for the exceeding Boldness of this my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; and to pravent such <hi>Objections</hi> as may lye against the Rashness of my Zeal: in selecting such a way to express my Reverence, as cannot secure me from a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Prophanation; and praesenting to you such a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of my Thankfulness, as, if estimated according to its own Vnworthiness, must make it a quaestion, whether I had any designe of being Thankful at all. And here, to the <hi>First,</hi> I might justly plead; that a great Part of
<pb facs="tcp:55028:4"/>
this Volume was composed in your House (the chief Mansion of well-order'd Hospitality) and All of it in the strength of your Inspiration. That the Book comes not into your hands, to Informe, but only Remember you of many of those Discourses of Nature, which your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Husband and your self have often suffered me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain (would to God, I might have said, satisfy) your eager Curiosity withal, at those hours your industrious Minds required Relaxation from the bent of more grave and advantageous Thoughts. That, having the Honour of so great a Trust, as that of your most prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lives committed unto me; it highly concern'd me, to study and pursue all ways of Demonstrating my self not altogether uncapable thereof, and more especially this of Natural Philosophy, which being the Grounds, is also the Measure of a Good Physician. And, that when your Husband being acquainted with my Purpose of Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the Nature of Souls, both Brutal and Human, in a distinct Work, though but the Remaining Moity of this Physiologie; had injoyned me to deliver the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, as soon as I should have finished it: I instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehended, I had an opportunity of a Double Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the one of being equally Grateful to Two singular Friends; the other, of Allying those Two Treatises by Consecration, which would be of so neer Affinity in their Subjects.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Other</hi>; I might easily alleage, that Great spirits use not to estimate Praesents that are brought them, by the value they carry in themselves: but the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those who offer them. That Thank fulness is the Poor mans wealth, and makes him, in the eyes of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity, stand in competition, for respect, with the Rich. That though this my Oblation hold no proportion to the
<pb facs="tcp:55028:4"/>
immense height of your Merit, yet it is equal to that of my Power, and, indeed, the best that my Gratitude was able to advance upon the slender stock of my Capacity. And, that I never intended it as a Retribution f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r your incompensable Favours; but only as an Homage, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that I confess my self infinitely your Debtor.</p>
            <p>But, Madam, for me to attempt to Excuse, unto your self, the Vnfitnesse of this Act of my devotion; is no lesse unnecessary, than for me to justifie to the World, that I have placed it upon a most worthy Object: forasmuch as I have no more reason to doubt, that so transcendent a Charity, as is diffused through and surrounds your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Soul, can be large enough to dispense with the Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Ceremonies, and Poverty of the Offering, where you are satisfied of the sincere Respects, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Fidelity of his Heart, who tenders it; than I have to fear, that the World should not most readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm my judgement, that your Deserts have rightfully entitled you to all the Demonstrations of Honour and Reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence, that can possibly be given to you.</p>
            <p>The Chief part, therefore, yea the whole of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Duty, is only humbly to Beg your benigne Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Dedication, as the Best Expression I was able to make of those profound sentiments which as well your Goodness in General to others, as your Particular Favours to my self, have impressed upon my Soul. And this I now do, upon the Knees of my Heart; and solemnly vow, that as I esteem a perfect Friend, the greatest Treasure of my life, so I do and ever shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you the most perfect of Friends: That I shall confess my self to have lost not only all Piety, but all
<pb facs="tcp:55028:5"/>
Humanity also, when ever I shall willingly lose any the least opportunity of serving you: and that your own Good Angell (I speak familiarly, but at the same time believe you to be under the Tuition of a Legion of Good ones) cannot more fervently desire your complete Happiness, than, Incomparable Madam,</p>

To enumerate all these Modern dissenting Doctors (the most modest of all which hath not blushed to hear his pedantique Disciples salute him with the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Attributes of a Despot in Physiologie, and the only Cynosure by which the benighted reason of man may hope to be conducted over the vertiginous Ocean of Error, to the Cape of Veritie) is neither useful to our Reader, nor advantageous or pertinent to our present Design. But, to reduce them to <hi>four General Orders,</hi> or range them into four principal Classes; as it may in some latitude of interest, concern the satisfaction of those who are less conversant among Books: so can it in no wise affront the patience of those, whose studies have already acquainted them with the several kinds of Philosophy now in esteem.</p>

For, as the <hi>Disposition</hi> or Dispensation of the Chaos of Atoms into so excellent a form, can be ascribed to no other Cause, but an <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi>: so neither can the <hi>Production</hi> or Creation of the same Chaos be ascribed to any other Cause, but an <hi>Infinite Power,</hi> as we have formerly demonstrated in our <hi>Darkness of Atheism, cap.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, since it is most probable that Atoms were the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Prima,</hi> or material Principle of the World; as we shall clearly enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate in a singular Chapter subsequent: we may adventure to affirm, that God created exactly such a proportion of Atoms, as might be sufficient to the making up of so vast a Bulk, as this of the World, and that there remained no one superfluous. 'Tis unworthy a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to acknowledge any superfluity in Nature: and consequently a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous soloecism to say the <hi>God</hi> of Nature knowing not how to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the quantity of his materials to the model or platform of his stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, created more Atoms, then were necessary, and left an infinite Residue to be perpetually hurried too and fro in the ultramundane space. If they shall <hi>urge</hi> upon us, that no man was privy to the Councel of God at the Creation, and consequently no can know, whether He created either more Atoms then were requisite to the amassment of this World, or more Worlds then this one: we may justly <hi>retort</hi> the Argument upon them, and conclude, that since no man was privy to the Councel of God, they have no reason to pretend to know, that God created either more matter, or more Worlds; and so the whole substance of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute must be reduced only to this: That they have no more Reason for the support of their opinion of a Plurality of Worlds then we have fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But yet notwithstanding, is not that Body thus extremly Dense, of less <hi>Extension,</hi> then when having its parts more remote each from other, it possessed a larger space: in respect, that whatever of Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is found in the Pores, or Intervals made by the mutually rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts, ought not to be ascribed to the Body rarified, but to those small Inanities that are intercepted among the dissociated particles. For instance; when we observe a Sponge dipt in Liquor to become turgent and swell into a greater bulke; we cannot justly conceive, that the Sponge is made more Extense in all its parts, then when it was dry or compressed: but only, that it hath its pores more dilated or open, and is therefore diffused through a greater space. But we may not digress into a full examen of the nature of Rarefaction and Condensation; especially since the Syntax of our Physical Speculations will lead us hereafter into a full and proper considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.<note place="margin">

The nature of a <hi>Disseminate</hi> Vacuity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the Analogy of a heap of Corn.</note> we cannot state the Doubt more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly, then by proposing it under the analogy of this <hi>Example.</hi> Let a man intrude his hand into a heap of Corn, and his hand shall possess a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sensible space among the separated Grains: his hand again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, that space doth not remain empty, but is immediately repossessed by the mutuall confluent grains, whose Confluxibility, not impeded, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

their instant convention. And yet betwixt the Grains mutually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened there remaine many intercepted or interposed Spaces or Intervalls, unpossessed by them; because the Grains cannot touch each other so <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum totas superficies,</hi> according to all parts of their superficies, as to be contiguous in all points. Exactly thus, when any Body is intruded into Aer, Water, or any such rare and porous nature, betwixt whose inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued parts there are many Interstices variously disseminated, it doth possess a certain sensible space proportionate to its dimensions: and when that Body is withdrawne, the space cannot remain empty, because the insensible or atomical particles of the Aer, Water, &amp;c. agitated by their own native Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet, betwixt the convened particles, of which the Aer, and Water, and also all porous Bodies are composed, there remain many empty spaces (analogous to those Intervalls betwixt the incontingent Grains of Corn) so minute or exiguous, as to be below the perception and commensuration of sense. Which is the very Difficulty, concerning which there are so many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies extant, as their very Lecture would be a Curse to the greatest Patience.

The first <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of a <hi>Disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Vacuity,</hi> desumed from the evidence of <hi>Motion,</hi> in General: and <hi>Aristotles</hi> error concerning the Essence of <hi>Place,</hi> concisely detected, and corrected.</note>Our First Argument is that Reason given for a Vacuum by <hi>Epicurus: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Nisi esset Inane, non haberent Corpora neque uti essent, neque quo motus suos obirent, cùm moveri ea quidem manifestum sit:</hi> Unless there were a Vacuum, Bodies could have neither where to consist, nor whither to be moved; and manifest it is, that they are moved. Which solid Reason, though seemingly perspicuous, hath in it so many recesses of obscurity, as may not only excuse, but efflagitate a cursory paraphrase. First, we are to observe that, in the theory of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> the Notions of <hi>Inanity</hi> and <hi>Locality</hi> are one and the same <hi>essentially,</hi> but not <hi>respectively: i. e.</hi> that the same space when replenished with a Body, is a <hi>Place,</hi> but when devoid or destitute of any Tenent whatever, then it is a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> did not sufficiently profound the Quiddity of <hi>Place,</hi> when He taught, <hi>that the Concave superficies of the Circumambient did constitute the Essence thereof.</hi> For, when it is generally conceded that the <hi>Locus</hi> must be adaequate to the <hi>Locatum</hi>; it is truly praesumed, that the internal superficies of the Circumambient or Place, ought to be adaequate to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal superficies of the Locatum or Placed; but not to its <hi>Profundity,</hi> or Internal Dimensions. And, since it is of the formal reason of Place, that it be <hi>Immoveable,</hi> or uncapable of Translation; for, otherwise any thing might, at one and the same time, be immote and yet change place: it is evident, that the superficies of the Circumambient is not Immoveable, since it may both be moved, the Locatum remaining unmoved, and <hi>è contrà,</hi> persist unmoved, when the Locatum is removed. And, therefore, the Concave superficies of the Circumambient may, indeed, obtain the reason of a Vessel, but not of a Place. And, upon consequence, we conclude, that the <hi>Space comprehended within the superficies of the Circumambient,</hi> is really and essentially what is to be understood by <hi>Place</hi> Since that Space is adaequated perfectly to its Locatum in all its internal Dimensions, and is also truly Immoveable; in regard that upon the remove of the Locatum,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55028:28"/>
it remains fixt, unchanged, unmoved; in the same state as before its occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, it persevers after its desertion. And when the Body removed possesseth a new Space: the old Space is instantly possessed by a new Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Thirdly, that this argument desumed from the Evidence of Motion, was proposed by <hi>Empiricus, (advers. Geometr.)</hi> more Syllogistically, thus, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>For Illustration, let us Imagine, that the Uuniverse (having nothing of Inanity interspersed among its parts) is one Continued Mass of Bodies so closely crouded, ramm'd, and wedged together, that it cannot receive any the least thing imaginable more: and keeping to this Hypothesis, we shall soon deprehend, whether any one Body among those many disposed within this compact or closely crouded Mass may be removed out of its own to invade the place of another. Certainly, if all places be full, it must extrude another body out of its place, or become joint-tenant with it and possess one and the same place. Extrude a body out of its possession it cannot, because the Extruded must want a room to be received into; nor can the Extruded dispossess a third, that third expel a fourth, that fourth eject a fifth, &amp;c. Since the difficulty sits equally heavy on all: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the invaded doth not resign to the invading, there can be no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Motion, and consequently no one Atome in the Universe can be moved.

                        <hi>there can be no Beginning of Motion.</hi> Which to explain, let us suppose that a Body, being to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through the Aer, doth in the first degree of motion propel the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous aer, the space of a hairs bredth, Now, the Universe being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely full, that small space of a hairs bredth must be praepossessed, and so the Body cannot be placed therein, untill it hath thence depelled the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Aer. Nor can the contiguous Aer possessing that space of a hairs bredth be depelled <hi>per latera</hi> to a place behind: because that place also is replete with Aer. Insomuch, therefore, as the body to be moved, cannot progress through so small a space, as that of an hairs bredth, because of the defect of place for the reception of the Aer replenishing that space: it must of necessity remain bound up immoveably in that place, wherein it was first situate. But if we conceive the Aer to have small Inane <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olas,</hi> or Spaces (holding an analogy to those spaces interceding betwixt the Grains of a Heap of Corn or Sand) variously interposed among its minute insensible particles: then may we also conceive, how the Motion of a Body through the Aer is both begun and continued: <hi>viz.</hi> that the Body moved, doth by its superfice protrude the particles of the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aer, those protruded particles being received into the adjacent empty interstices, press upon the next vicine particles of aer, and likewise protrude them, which received also into other adjacent empty spaces become contiguous to, and urgent upon other next particles of Aer, and so forward untill, upon the successive continuation of the Compression by protrusion, and the consequent dereliction of a place behind, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral particles of the Aer, compressed by the anterior parts dissilient, are effused into it: and so, how much of Aer is compressed and impelled forward, so much recurrs backward <hi>per latera,</hi> and is dilated. The same also may be accommodated to the Lococession of the Parts of <hi>Water</hi>; allowing it this praerogative, that being propelled by a Body movent, it doth by its particles more easily propel the contiguous particles of the Aer, then its own; because the empty minute spaces of the aer incumbent upon the Water, are larger, which may be the reason, why water propelled for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, becomes tumid and swelleth somewhat upwards in its superfice, and is depressed proportionately backward. Now according to this the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, ought we to understand the Reason of <hi>Epicurus</hi> for a Vacuum, desu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the necessity of motion.</p>

Having praepared a short Tapor of Wax and Sulphur grosly powdered, light and suspend it by a small Wier in a Glass Vial of proportionate reception, wherein is clean Fountain Water sufficient to possess a fifth part, or thereabout, of its capacity: and then with a Cork fitted exactly to the Orifice, stop the mouth of the Vial so closely, that the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the most subtle Atom may be prevented. On this you shall perceive the flame and fume of the Sulphur and Wax instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diffuse and in a manner totally possess the room of the Aer, and so the fire to be extinguished: yet not that there doth suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed either any diminution of the Aer, since that is imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all possibility of evasion praecluded; or any ascent of the Water, by an obscure motion in vulgar Physiology called <hi>Suction,</hi> since here is required no suction to supply a vacuity upon the destituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of aer. But if you open the orifice, and enlarge the imprisoned Aer, you shall then indeed manifestly observe a kind of obscure suction, and thereupon a gradual ascention of the Water: not that the flame doth immediately elevate the water, as well because it is extinct, and the water doth continue elevated for many hours after its extinction, as that, if the flame were continued, can it be imagined that it would with so much tenacity adhaere to the tapor, as is requisite to the elevation of so great a weight of water; but rather, that upon the Coangustation or compression of the aer reduced to a very close order in the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of its insensible particles, the empty spaces formerly intercepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them being replenished with the exhalations of the tapor; when the orifice is deobturated, there sensibly succeeds a gradual expiration of the atoms of Fire, as the most agile, volatile and prepared for motion, and then the aer, impelled by its own native Fluxibility, re-expands or dilates it self by degrees. But since the narrowness of the Evaporato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

remain any of the atoms of Fire in possession of their Vacuities, as long continues the reexpansion of the Aer; and that reexpansion pressing upon the sides of the water, causeth it to ascend, and continue elevated. And no longer, for so soon as the aer is returned to its native contexture, the water by degrees subsideth to the bottom, as before the accension of the Tapor: and so that motion commonly called a <hi>Suction in avoidance of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity,</hi> is more properly a <hi>Protrusion,</hi> caused by the expanding particles of aer compressed.</p>

That the ambient Aer, surcharged with too great a cloud of exhalations from the fire, was forced to a violent recession or retreat, and a fresh supply of aer as violently came on to give place to the receding, and maintain the reception of fresh exhalations; and so a third, fourth and continued relief succeeded: and that by this continued and impetuous afflux, or stream of new aer, loaden with cold Atoms, the activity of the cold could not but be by so much the more intense at the mouth of the furnace, then abroad in the open aer, by how much the more violent the stream of cold aer was there then elsewhere. To complete and assure the Experiment, I caused two dishes, of equal capacity, to be filled with river Water; placed one at the mouth of the furnace, the other <hi>sub Dio:</hi> and found that near the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace so nimbly creamed over with Yce, as if that visibly-freezing Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montane Wind, which the Italian calls <hi>Chirocco,</hi> had blown there, and much sooner perfectly frozen then the other.

After a long and anxious scrutiny for a full solution of this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> our thoughts happily fixed upon this: That, the Salt being in dissolution reduced <hi>(Analysi ret. ograda)</hi> into its most minute or Atomical Particles, there ought to be in the Water Consimilar or adaequate Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for their Reception; and that those Spaces being once replenished, the Dissolution (because the Reception) ceaseth.

So that our Assertion ought not to be condemned as a Kaenodox inconsistent to the laws of Nature, while it imports no more then this; that, as the Granules of a heap of Sand mutually flow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to replenish that great Cavity, which the hand of a man by intrusion had made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by extraction left, by reason of the <hi>Confluxibility</hi> of their Nature: so also do the Granules, or Atomical Particles of Aer, Water, and other Bodies of that <hi>Rare</hi> condition, flow together, by reason of the <hi>Fluidity</hi> or <hi>Confluxibility</hi> of their Nature, to praevent the creation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manence of any considerable, or <hi>Coacervate Vacuum</hi> betwixt them.

This done, and the Tube fixed in an erect or perpendicular position; upon the subduction of your finger from the lower orifice, you may observe part of the Quicksilver contained in the Tube to descend speedily into the restagnant or subjacent Quicksilver, leaving a certain space in the superior part of the Tube, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to apparence at least, absolutely Void or Empty: and part thereof (after some Reciprocations or Vibrations) to remain still in the Tube, and possess its cavity to a certain proportion, or altitude of <hi>27</hi> digits, or <hi>2</hi> feet, <hi>3</hi> digits and an half (proximè) constantly. Further, if you recline, with a gentle motion also, the upper extreme of the Tube, untill the lower, formerly immersed in the Quicksilver, arise up into the region of the Water incumbent on the surface of the Quicksilver: you may perceive the Quicksilver remaining in the Tube to ascend by sensible degrees up to the superior extreme thereof, together with part of the Water; both those liquors to be confounded together; and, at length, the Quicksilver wholly to distill down in parcels, surrendring the cavity of the Tube to the possession of the Water.

                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning this, some there are who confidently affirm the space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the superfice of the Quicksilver defluxed and the superior extreme of the Tube, to be an absolute COACERVATE VACUITIE: such as may be conceived, if we imagine some certain space in the world to be, by Divine or miraculous means, so exhausted of all matter or body, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit any corporeal transflux through the same. And the <hi>Reasons,</hi> upon which they erect their opinion, are these subsequent.</p>
                  <p>This space, if possessed by any Tenent,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Art.</hi> 3. The Desert space in the Tube argued to be an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Vacuum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acervate,</hi> from the impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion with <hi>Aer.</hi>
                     </note> must be replenished either with common <hi>Aer,</hi> or with a more pure and subtle substance called <hi>Aether,</hi> which some have imagined to be the Universal <hi>Caement</hi> or common <hi>Elater,</hi> by which a general Continuity is maintained through all parts of the Universe, and by which any Vacuity is praevented: or by some <hi>exhalation</hi> from the mass of Quicksilver included in the Tube.</p>
                  <p>First, that it is not possessed by <hi>Aer,</hi> is manifest from several strong and convincing reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) Because the inferior end of the Tube, <hi>D,</hi> is so immersed into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent mass of Quicksilver below the line <hi>EF,</hi> that no particle of aer can enter thereat.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Because, if there were aer in the Tube filling the deserted space <hi>CK,</hi> then would not the circumambient or extrinsecal aer, when the Tube is educed out of the restagnant Quicksilver, and Water, rush in with that violence, as to elevate the remainder of the Quicksilver in the Tube, from <hi>K</hi> to <hi>D,</hi> up to the top <hi>C,</hi> and break it open, as is observed: in regard, that could not happen without a penetration of bodies. So that, if we suppose any portion of aer to have slipped into the Tube below, at the subduction of the finger that closed the orifice: then would not the Mercury reascending (upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55028:36"/>
the inclination of the Tube down to the horizontal line <hi>KM,</hi>) rise up quite to the top <hi>C,</hi> but subsist at <hi>OP.</hi> But the contrary is found upon the experiment.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) When the Tube, after the deflux of the Mercury to <hi>K,</hi> is reclined so as the extreme <hi>C,</hi> be of the same horizontal altitude with the point <hi>K,</hi> as is visible in the Tube <hi>LM</hi>: then doth the Mercury in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject vessel reascend into the same, and again possess the desert Space <hi>KC,</hi> or <hi>NM.</hi> This being so, Whither can the aer, if any the least portion of it were resident in the space <hi>NM,</hi> retreat, since the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <hi>M,</hi> is hermetically closed, and so no way for its egression can be praetended.

                  <p n="4">(4) If any portion of Aer chance to intrude into the cavity of the Tube, which may come to pass either if, when the superior orifice of the Tube is inverted, it be not exactly obturated by the finger of the Experimentator; or, if at the extraction of his finger the lower e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>treme be not immersed deep enough in the subjacent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, to prevent the subingress of some aer; or, if the orifice of the

Tube educed out of the region of the subjacent Mercury and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not wholly deobturated at once, but so as there is only some slender inlet of Aer: We say, if in any of these Cases it happen, that some small portion of aer be admitted into the cavity of the Tube; we have the evidence of our sense, and the most infallible one too, that the aer so admitted doth not ascend to the top <hi>C,</hi> but remaine visible in certain small Bubbles (such as usually mount up to the surface of seething water) immediately upon the superfice of the Mercury at the altitude of 27 digits <hi>K.</hi> As if, indeed, the aer were attracted, and in a manner chained down by the <hi>Magnetical Effluviums</hi> of the earth, together with the pendent Quicksilver: which having more <hi>Ansulae</hi> or <hi>Fastnings,</hi> whereon the small Hooks of the Magnetical Chains exhaling from the Globe of the Earth, may be accommodately fixed, is therefore attracted downward more forcibly, and, in that respect, is reputed to have the greater proportion of <hi>Gravity.</hi> Again, If upon the inclination of the Tube, and the succeeding repletion of the same by the regurgitating Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, that portion of aer formerly entered be propelled up to the top of the Tube, <hi>C</hi>; and then the Tube again reduced to its perpendicular, so as the Quicksilver again deflux to <hi>K</hi>: in this case the aer doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at <hi>C,</hi> but sinks down as formerly to <hi>K</hi> also, and there remains incumbent upon the face of the Quicksilver. Which Descent of the aer cannot be more probably referred to any Cause, then the Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Magnetick streams of the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) Having admitted some few Bubbles of aer to slide up by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of the Mercury into the desert Space <hi>KC</hi>; and then reclined the Tube to the altitude of the horizontal line <hi>KM</hi>: you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the delapsed Quicksilver not to be repelled up again quite to the top, as before the irreption of aer, but to make a stand when it arrives at the confines of the included aer at <hi>OP,</hi> leaving so much space, as is requisite for the reception of it. Nor can it do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, without a penetration of Dimensions, by the location of two Bodies in one and the same place.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6) Moreover, after the acquiescence of the Quicksilver at <hi>K,</hi> if you stop the inferior extreme <hi>D,</hi> with your finger, while it remains im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed in the restagnant Quicksilver <hi>EF,</hi> so as to praeclude the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reption of any more aer; and then invert the Tube again: the Scene of the Desert Capacity <hi>CK,</hi> will be changed to the contrary extreme stopt by your finger, and yet without the least sign of aer pervading the mass of Quicksilver in a kind of small stream of Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, contrary to what evene's, when aer is admitted into the Tube in a small quantity, for in that case, upon the inversion of the Tube, you may plainly behold an intersection between the descending Quicksilver and the ascending aer, which mounts up through it in a small stream or thread of Bubbles.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7) To those, who conceive that a certain portion of the <hi>Circumstant</hi> Aer, being forced by the compression of the restagnant Mercury in the Vessel, rising higher, upon the deflux of the Mercury contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Tube, doth penetrate the sides of the Tube, and so replenish the desert Capacity therein: we answer; that though we deny not but aer may penetrate the pores or Incontiguities of Glass, since that is demonstrable in Weather Glasses, and in the experiment of

Sr. <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> of making a sensible transudation of Mercury mixt with Aqua Fortis in a Bolt-head, through the sides thereof, if gently confricated with a Hares-foot on the outside; yet cannot it be made out, that therefore the Desert Capacity in the Tube is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with Aer, for two inoppugnable reasons. (1) Because though the Tube be made of Brass, Steel, or any other Metal, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(2) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if the desert Cavity were replete with aer; the incumbent aer could not rush in to the Tube, at the eduction of its lower end <hi>D,</hi> out of the restagnant Mercury and Water, with such violence; since no other cause can be assigned for its impetuous rushing into the Tube, but the regression of the compressed parts of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aer to their natural laxity, and to the repletion of the violent or forced Vacuity. Since, if the whole Space in the Tube were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, <hi>i. e.</hi> if there were as many particles of Body, as Space there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: doubtless, no part of place could remain for the reception of the irruent aer.</p>

                     <hi>Naturam abhorrere Vacuum,</hi> is indeed, a maxim, and a true one: but not to be understood in any other then a <hi>metaphorical</hi> sense. For, as every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal, by the instinct of self-conservation, abhors the solution of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity in his skin, caused by any puncture, wound, or laceration; though it be no offence to him to have his skin pinkt or perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated all over with insensible pores: so also by the indulgence of a Metaphor, may Nature be said to abhor any great or sensible vacuity, or solution of Continuity, such as is imagined in the Desert Space of the Tube; though it be familiar, nay useful and grateful to her, to admit those insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible inanities, or minute porosities, which constitute a <hi>Vacuum Dissemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> We say, by the <hi>indulgence of a Metaphor</hi>; because we import a kind of <hi>sense</hi> in Nature, analogous to that of Animals. And, tollerating this Metaphorical Speech, that Nature hath a kind of sense like that of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; yet, if we allow for the vastity of her Body can it be conceived no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55028:37"/>
greater trouble or offence to her, to admit such a solution of Continuity, or Emptiness, as this supposed in the Desert space of the Tube, then to an Animal, to have any one pore in his skin more then ordinarily relaxed and expanded for the transudation of a drop of sweat. This perpended, it can seem no <hi>Antiaxiomatisme,</hi> to affirm, that nature doth not abhor Vacuity, <hi>per se,</hi> but onely <hi>ex Accidenti</hi>: i. e. upon this respect, that in Nature is somewhat, for whose sake she doth not, without some reluctany, admit a Coacervate or sensible Vacuity. Now that somewhat existent in Nature <hi>per se,</hi> in relation to which, she seems to oppose and decline any sensible Vacuity, can be no other then the <hi>Fluxility</hi> of her Atomical Particles, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially those of <hi>Fire, Air,</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi> And, for ought we poor Haggard Mortals do, or can, by the Light of Nature, know to the contrary, all those vast spaces from the margent of the Atmosphere, whose altitude ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not 40 miles (according to <hi>Mersennus</hi> and <hi>Cassendus</hi>) perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, up to the Region of the fixed Stars; are not only Fluid, but <hi>Inane</hi>; abating only those points, which are pervaded by the rayes of the Sun and other Celestial Bodies. But, why should we lead the thoughts of our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up to remote objects, whose sublimity proclaims their incertitude; when from hence only, that the Aer is a <hi>Fluid</hi> substance: it is a manifest, direct and unstrained consequence, that the immediate cause of its avoidance of any sensible or coacervate Vacuity, is the Confluxibility of its Atomical particles; which being in their natural contexture contiguous in some, though not all points of their superficies, must of necessity press or bear each upon other, and so mutually compel each other, that no one particle can be removed out of its place, but instantly another succeeds and possesses it; and so there can be no place left empty, as hath been frequently explained by the simile of a heap of Sand? Now, if the Confluxibility of the insensible particles of the aer, be the immediate and <hi>per se</hi> Cause of its avoidance of any aggregate sensible solution of Continuity: we need no farther justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our position, that Nature doth oppose vacuity sensible not <hi>per se,</hi> but only in order to the affection of Confluxibility, <hi>i. e. ex Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denti</hi>

Which whether they have done, so as to demonstrate, that the sole cause of the Aers impetuous rushing into the canale of the Tube, and prodigiously elevating the ponderous bodies of Quicksilver and Water residuous therein, is not the Reflux of the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent aer, by the ascention of the restagnant Quicksilver in the vessel, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to too deep and diffused a subingression of its insensible Particles, to recover its natural laxity, by regaining those spaces, from which it was expelled and secluded; and to supply the defect of this reason, by substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting some other syntaxical to their hypothesis of the Aether, which shall

That the Atoms of Heat and Cold ordinarily trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix Glass, is evident from the Experience of Weather-glasses: in which the cause of the descent of the Water included, is the Rarefaction of the aer therein by the Heat, and the cause of the ascent of the water in cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the Condensation of the same aer by Cold; neither of which were possible, if the subingression of Cold and Hot Atoms through the Glass were excluded. And, that the aer incarcerated in a Thermometre, or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peramental organ of Silver, Coper, or Brass, is subject to the same mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of qualities, upon the same vicissitude of Causes: hath been so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experimented, as to cut off all praetext of diffidence. Which is also a sufficient manifest, that the Atoms of Heat and Cold are more exile and penetrative, then those of the common Aer of use to Animals in Respirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: insomuch as they insinuate themselves through such bodies, whose almost continued parts interdict the intrusion of the grosser particles of Aer, which cannot permeate through ordinary Glass. (1) Because, if you shut your self in a closet, or chamber, that hath but one small window consisting of one entire pane of Glass, and that so caemented into Lead, as that no chinke is left between; and whose cranies as well in the door, as elsewhere are all damm'd up: you cannot hear the voice of another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, though speaking very loud and near the Glass on the outside, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding you lay your ear close thereunto. Now, since a <hi>Sound</hi> (at least the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of a sound) can be nought else, but a subtle portion of the aer modified; as shall be professedly commonstrated, when time hath brought us so far on our praesent journey, as the proper place for our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Nature of Sounds: and yet this so subtle and fine a portion of the aer cannot penetrate Glass of an ordinary thickness: we have the auctority of no weak nor obscure Reason, to countenance this our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that the Atoms of Cold and Heat, are more exile and searching, then the common Aer. (2) If you include small Fishes in a large vial of the thinnest Glass, filled with River water; they may live therein for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months, provided the orifice of the Glass remain open and free to the aer: but, if you once stop it, so as to exclude the aer, they shall expire in few moments. Whence we may conclude, that however Fishes seem to have an obscure kind of Respiration, such as may be satisfied with that small portion of Aer, which is commixt with Water: yet is not that thin and subtile aer, supposed to penetrate Glass, the same they (or any other Animal) use in Respiration. Which had those grand Masters of mysterious Disquisitions, <hi>Mersennus</hi> and <hi>Robervallius</hi> animadverted; they might have soon divined, what would be the event of their intended Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of including some small Animal, as a Mouse or Grashopper, in a Glass of sufficient capacity, and luting on the same on the top of the Tube, where the Desert Space useth to be, in the Experiment of Mercury, so to try whether the vital organs thereof could keep on their motions in a place devoid of aer: insomuch as that purer substance dimanant from the region of the circumjacent Aer, is not corporeal enough to serve the necessity of Respiration in any Animal, though ne're so minute.

                        </hi> For, indeed in the ordinary Translation of bodies through the aer, it is no wonder that the adjacent aer is propelled by them; since they leave as much room behind them, as the aer propelled before them formerly possessed, whereinto it may and doth recur: but in this case of the Experiment, the condition is far otherwise, there being, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, a place left behind, but such as the aer propelled before cannot retreat into it, in regard of the interposition of another dense solid &amp; impervious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Upon which consideration, we formerly and pertinently reflected when reciting some of those Experiments vulgarly objected to a <hi>Vacuum Dissemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum,</hi> we insisted particularly upon that of a <hi>Garden Irrigatory</hi>: shewing, that the Reason of the Waters subsistence, or pendency therein, so long as the orifice in the Neb remains stopped, is the defect of room for the aer pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon by the basis of the Water to recur into upon its resignation of place; because all places being full, there can be none whereinto the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior aer may recede, until upon deobstruction of the hole above, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent aer enters into the cavity of the Vessel, and resignes to the aer pressed upon below, and so the motion begins and continues by a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive surrender of places. For, though the aer contiguous to the bottom of the Irrigatory, be not sufficient to resist the compressure of so great a weight of water, by the single renitency of the Confluxibility of its atomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal particles; yet the next contiguous aer, possessing the vicine spaces, and likewise wanting room to recede into, when compelled by the first aer, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates the resistence: which becomes so much the greater, by how much the farther the pressure is extended among the parts of the circumjacent aer; and by so much the farther, is the pressure of the circumjacent aer extended, by how much the greater is the pressure of the next contiguous aer; and that pressure is proportionate to the degrees of Gravity and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity in the body descendent. Which is manifestly the reason, why the water doth not descend through the perforated bottom of the Vessel, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Gravity thereof is not sufficient to counterpoyse so diffused, prolix, and continued resistence, as is made and maintained by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxibility of the parts of the circumambient aer successively uniting their forces.</p>

                     <p n="1">(1) Have you not formerly affirmed, that no body can be moved, but it must compel the aer forward, to suffer a certain <hi>subingression</hi> of its insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible particles into the pores, or Loculaments of the next contiguous aer, such as is requisite to the leaving of a space behind it for the admission of the body moved? And, if so; how comes it, that when most bodies are moved through the aer, with so much facility, and therefore cause the parts thereof before them to intrude themselves into the incontiguities of the next vicine aer, with a force so small, as that it is altogether insensible: yet in this case of the <hi>Experiment,</hi> is required so great a force to effect the subingression and mutual Coaptation of the parts of the aer?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cause</hi> seems to be this.<note place="margin">

                     <p n="2">(2) Whence do you derive this <hi>Resistence</hi> of the Aer?</p>
                     <p>From its <hi>Gravity.</hi> For, the Aer of its own nature is Heavy, and can be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55028:41"/>
said to be <hi>Light</hi> only <hi>comparatively,</hi> or as it is less ponderous then Water and Earth: nor can there be given any more creditable reason of the Aers ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency upward here below near the convexity of the Earth, then this; that being in some degree ponderous in all its particles, they descend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the upper region of the Atmosphere, and in their descent bear upon and mutually compel each other, untill they touch upon the surface of the Earth, and are by reason of the solidity and hardness thereof reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed or rebounded up again to some distance: so that the motion of the Aer upwards near the face of the Earth, is properly <hi>Resilition,</hi> and no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but a <hi>violent</hi> one. Now, insomuch as the Aer seems to be no other, but a common Miscelany of minute bodies, exhaled from Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and other concretious sublunary, and proportionately to their Crassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or Exility, emergent to a greater or less altitude: it can be no illegal process for us to infer, that all parts thereof are naturally endowed with more or less Gravity proportionate to their particular bulk; whether that Gravity be understood to be (as common Physiology will have it) a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity congenial and inhaerent, or (as Verisimility) their conformity to the magnetick Attraction of the Earth. And, insomuch as this <hi>Gravity</hi> is the cause of the mutual <hi>Depression</hi> among the particles of aer in their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency from the upper region of the Atmosphere down to the surface of the Earth: we may well conceive, that the <hi>Depression</hi> of the inferior parts of the aer by the superior incumbent upon them, is the origine immediate from whence that <hi>Reluctancy</hi> or <hi>Resistence,</hi> observed in the Experiment, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the induction of a praeternatural Inanity between the Parts thereof.

                     </p>
                     <p>To profound this mystery of Nature to the bottom, we are to request our Reader to endure the short recognition of some passages in our prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent discourses. (1) That upon the ordinary translation of bodies through the Aer, the resistence of its insensible parts is so small, as not to be discoverable by the sense; because the subingression of its contiguous parts into the loculaments of the next vicine aer, is only perexile, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial: and that we may safely imagine this superficial subingression not to be extended beyond the thickness of a single hair; nay, in some
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55028:41"/>
cases, perhaps, not to the hundreth part thereof. <hi>So stupendiously subtle are the fingers of Nature in many of her operations.</hi> But, that the resistence observed in the present Experiment, for the enforcing of a praeternatural Vacuum, is therefore deprehensible by the sense, because in respect of a defect of place behind the body propellent, into which the parts of the aer compelled forward may circulate, the subingression must be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found; and so the resistence being propagated farther and farther by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, must grow multiplied, and consequently sensible. (2) That the Force of the body propellent is greater, then the force of the next conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous aer protruding the next, and the force of the third protruded wave of the aer (for a kind of Undulation may be ascribed to aer) greater on the Fourth, then that of the Fourth upon the Fifth, and so progressionally to the extrem of its diffusion or extension: so that the Force becomes so much the weaker and more oppugnable, by how much the farther it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and dwindles or languishes by degrees into a total cessation. (3) That, as upon the succussion, or shock of a Bushel apparently full of Corn, is left a certain sensible space above, unpossessed by any part or Grain thereof; which coacervate empty space responds in proportion to those many Disseminate <hi>Vacuola,</hi> or Loculaments intercepted among the incontingent sides of the Grains, before their reduction to a more close or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the succussion of the Bushel: so likewise, upon the impulse of the aer by a convenient body, is left behind a sensible space absolutely empty, as to any part of aer; which Coacervate empty space must respond in proportion to those many Disseminate spaces intercepted among the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contiguous parts, or Granules of the aer, before their reduction to a more close order, or mutual subingression and coaptation of sides and points, by the body compressing.</p>
                     <p>These Notions recogitated,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Art.</hi> 4. The <hi>Aequipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derancy</hi> of the External Aer, pendent upon the surface of the Restagnant Mercury, in the vessel, to the Cylindre of Mercury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduous in the Tube, at the altitude of 27 digits: the cause of the Mercuries constant sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence at that point.</note> our speculations may progress with more advantage to explore the proxime and proper Cause of the Mercuries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant subsistence at the altitude of 27 digits, in the Tube perpendicularly erected. For, upon the credit of their importance, we may justly assume; that upon the compression of the circumambient Aer by a small quantity of Quicksilver (suppose only of two or three inches) impendent in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave of the tube, can be caused, indeed, some small subingression of the particles thereof; but such, as is only <hi>superficial</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi>: in respect the weight of so small a proportion of Quicksilver is not of force sufficient to propel the parts of the aer to so great a crassitude that the space de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the Aggregate of Disseminate Vacuities should amount to that largness, as to become visible above the Quicksilver in the Tube; since the quantity of the Quicksilver being supposed little, the force of Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or Resistence in the parts of the aer, arising from their inhaerent Fluidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, must be greater then the force of compression arising from Gravity; and therefore there succeeds no sensible Deflux of the Quicksilver. But, being that a greater and greater mass of Quicksilver may be successively infused into the Tube, and so the compressive force of its Gravity be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively augmented; and thereupon the aer become less and less able suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively to make resistence: 'tis difficult not to observe, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Compression from Gravity in the Quicksilver, may be so equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized to the Resistence from Gravity in the Aer, as that both may remain <hi>in statu quo,</hi> without any sensible yeilding on either side. Hence comes it, that at the aequipondium of these two Antagonists, the space in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55028:42"/>
Tube detracted from the Aggregate of minute Inanities disseminate in the aer, is so small as not to be commensurated by sense: and at the cessation of the Aequilibrium, or succeding superiority of the encreased weight of the Quicksilver, the parts of the Aer being compelled thereby to a farther retrocession and subingression; the space detracted from the Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of disseminate Vacuities in the aer, becomes larger, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently sensible, above the Quicksilver in the upper region of the Tube.</p>

But, when the quantity, and so the Gravity of the Quicksilver contained in the Tube is so augmented, as to exceed the Resistence of the aer; then is the aer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled or driven back, by the restagnant Quicksilver rising upwards, to a sensible subingression of its atomical particles, and the Quicksilver in the Tube instantly defluxeth into the place resigned by the restagnant, until it arriveth at that point of altitude, or standard, where the resistence of the aer becomes again equal to the force compressing it, and there subsisteth, after various reciprocations up and down in the Tube.<note place="margin">

                     <p>However, that we may not dismiss our Reader absolutely jejune, who came hither with so great an Appetite; we observe to him, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant subsistence of the Mercury at the altitude of 27 digits, doth seem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to proceed from the manifest Resistence of the Aer, then from any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Quality in the Mercury, unless its proportion of Gravity be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. This may be collected from hence; that <hi>Water</hi> infused into the

So that it is manifest, that with what Liquor soever the Tube be filled, still will the Aer resist its deflux at a certain measure: provided only, that the Tube be long enough to receive so much of it, as the weight thereof may equal that of the Mercury at 27 digits, or the Water at 32 feet.</p>

When, as the weight of Quicksilver carries the same proportion to the weight of Water, of the same measure or quantity, as 14 to 1: so reciprocally doth the Altitude of 32 feet, carry the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to 27 digits, as 14 to 1. And hence comes it, that, if <hi>Water</hi> be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which truly, is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifest argument, that the Aer, according to the measure of its weight, or the praecise rate of its resistence, becomes aequilibrated to the Mercury at the altitude of 27 dig. since the superaffused Water doth no more then advance the Aequilibrium according to the rate of its weight, or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of resistence. Besides, it is farther observable, that because the Tube is replenished by a 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part in 27 dig. of the altitude, above the first Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrium (a proportionate access to the Mercury in the Tube, being made by a like part of that in the subject vessel, impelled into it) therefore is the <hi>Vacuum</hi> above the Mercury in the Tube, diminished also by one 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. part; and the compression of the Aer, impendent on the surface of the restagnant Mercury, relaxed and diminished also by a 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part. So that if the vessel underneath the Tube be large enough to admit an addition of Water suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively affused, until so much of the restagnant Mercury, as formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, shall be again propelled up into the Tube: then must the whole Tube be replenished, and so the whole Vacuity disappear, for then all Compression of the incumbent aer ceaseth, and so much space as was possessed before the Experiment, both without and within the Tube, by the Mercury, Water, Aer, is again repleted.</p>

                     <p>To extricate you from this Labyrinth, we retort; that the cause of the Aequilibriums constancy to the point of 27 digits, whatever be the quantity of the Mercury contained in the Tube, is the same with that, which makes the descent of two bodies of the same matter, but different weights, to be <hi>Aequally Swift</hi>: for a bullet of Lead of an ounce,<note place="margin">

For, in respect, that a Cylindre of Quicksilver contained in a Tube of a large diametre, doth not descend more swiftly, then a Cylindre of Quicksilver contained in a Tube of a narrow diametre: therefore is it, that the one doth not press the bottom, upon which as its Base, it doth impend, more violently then the other doth press upon its Base; and consequently, the restagnant Quicksilver about the larger Cylindre doth not, in its elevation or rising upward, more compress the Basis of the impendent Cylindre of Aer, then what is restagnant about the lesser Cylindre. Whereupon we may conclude, that a great Cylindre of Aer resisting a great Cylindre of Quicksilver, no less then a small doth resist a small: therefore ought the Aequilibrium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the depressure of the Quicksilver, and the resistence of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Aer, to be constant to the altitude of 27 digits, aswell in a large, as a narrow Tube.

And this secret reveals what we explore. For, according to the same scale of Proportions, we may warrantably conceive; that, by how much the higher the Cylindre of Quicksilver is in the Tube, by so much the more forcibly it impendeth upon its Base, in the Restagnant Quicksilver; and so having obtained a vent below, falleth with so much the more rapidity of motion or exsilition thereupon: and upon consequence, by so much the more violently is the incumbent Aer compressed by the restagnant Quicksilver ascending, its resistence overcome, and the subingression of its insensible particles into the inane Loculaments of the vicine aer, propagated or extended the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the space detracted from the Aggregate of Disseminate Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so much the larger, and consequently the <hi>Coacervate Vacuum</hi> appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the superior region of the Tube, becomes so much the greater. And, because the Resistence made against the subingression, dilating or distend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self, is in the instant overcome, by reason of a greater impulse caused by the Cylindre of Mercury descending from a greater altitude; and that resistence remains,<note place="margin">

or the superficies of a Body: (2) <hi>Successive, i. e.</hi> Time and Motion, but especially Time, which may be otherwise expressed by the Term, <hi>Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Hereupon, when they deliver it as oraculous, that Quantity is a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Accident</hi>: they confidently inferr, that if any Quantity, or Perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, or Successive, be objected, that is not or separately, or conjunctly Corporeal, it ought to be exploded, as not <hi>Real,</hi> or an absolute <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>

                  <p>Now this their <hi>Scheme</hi> is defective.

We say, <hi>more General then those Two</hi>; because as well all Substances as Accidents whatever, have both their Existence in some Place, and their Duration in some Time; and both Place and Time are, even by those who dispute whether they are Accidents, or not, willingly granted to persever constantly and invariately the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Because it offends Truth in the confinement of all <hi>Quantity,</hi> or Dimension, and so of that of Place and Time, to the Category of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi> nay even of <hi>Corporeal</hi> ones: when there wants not a species of Quantity, or Extension having Dimensions, that is not <hi>Corporeal</hi>; for, nor Place, nor Time, are Corporeal.

of these praemised Considerations, will easily and totally cure the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Difficulty</hi> objected. For, when it is urged, that betwixt the opposite sides of a vessel supposed to be absolutely devoyd of any Body whatever, nothing doth intercede, and consequently that they are Contiguous; we need no other <hi>solution</hi> but this: that (indeed) nothing <hi>Corporeal</hi> doth interced, betwixt the diametrally opposite sides of a voyd concave, that is either Substance, or Accident; but yet there doth intercede <hi>something Incorporeal,</hi> such as we understand by <hi>Spatium, Intercape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, Distantia, Intervallum, Dimensio,</hi> which is neither Substance nor Accident. But, alas! that Thing you call <hi>Space</hi> is, according to your own supposition, an absolute <hi>Vacuum</hi>: What though? it must not therefore be <hi>Nothing,</hi> unless in the sense of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi>: because it hath a <hi>Being (suo modo)</hi> and so is <hi>something.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same also concerns those <hi>Dimensions,</hi> which we conceive,<note place="margin">

And so we may conclude, that those Dimensions, which must remain in that supposed <hi>Inane Region</hi> circumscribed by the concave of the Lunar Orb, in case God should adnihilate the whole mass of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all their off springs, included therein; are, in truth, not Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, but <hi>Spatial.</hi>

Which to praevent, we observe, that from the very word <hi>Spatial</hi> Dimensions, it is sufficiently evident, that we understand no other Spaces in the World, then what most of our Ecclesiastical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors allow to be on the outside thereof, and denominate <hi>Imaginary</hi>: not that they are meerly <hi>Phantastical,</hi> as Chimaera's; but that our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can and doth apprehend them to have Dimensions, which hold an analogy to the Dimensions of Corporeal substances, that fall under the perception and commensuration of the sense.

                  <p>That <hi>Place</hi> is not the immediate and contiguous <hi>superfice</hi> of the body invironing the <hi>Locatum,</hi> may by the single force of this Demonstration be fully evicted. <hi>Immobility</hi> is essential to Place, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> well acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; for if Place were moveable, then would it follow of inevitable necessity, that a body might be translated without mutation of place, and <hi>è converso,</hi> the place of any thing might be changed, while the thing it self continues immote; both which are <hi>Absurdities</hi> so manifest, as no mist of Sophistry can conceal them even from the purblind multitude: Now the superfice of the Circumambient can in no wise praetend to this proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of place, Immobility; as may be most conveniently argued from the example of a Tower; for that space, which a Tower possesseth, was there before the structure, and must remain there the same in all dimensions after the ruine thereof; but the superfice of the contiguous Aer, the immediate Circumambient, is removed, and changed every moment, the whole mass of Aer being uncessantly agitated more or less, by winds and other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences: <hi>Ergo.</hi> So numerous are the shifts and subterfuges of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Disciples of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whereby they have endeavoured to <hi>Fix</hi> this <hi>Volatile</hi> superfice of the Circumambient: that should we insist upon only the commemoration of them all; we might justly despair of finding any Charity great enough, to pardon so criminal an abuse of leasure.</p>

For, when it is questioned (1) How a body can persist invariately in the same place, though the circumambient be frequently, nay infinitely varied? (2) How a body can change place, though the Circumambient accompany it in its remove? (3) Why one body can be said to be thus or thus far, more or less distant from another? we may easily satisfie all with this one obvious Answer, that all mobility is on the part of the Locatum, all Space continuing constant and immote. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hence come we to understand, in what respect Place is commonly conceived to be exactly <hi>adaequate</hi> to the <hi>Locatum</hi>: for, the Dimensions of all Space possessed, are in all points respondent to those of the body posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55028:52"/>
there being no part of the body, profound or superficial, to which there is not a part of Space respondent in aequal extent; which can never be made out from the mere superfice of the Circumambient, in which no one of the Profound or Internal parts of the Locatum, but only the <hi>superficial</hi> are resident. Moreover, hence also may we understand, How <hi>Incorporeal substances,</hi> as God, Angels, and the Souls of men, may be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be <hi>in loco.</hi> For, when God, who is infinite, and therefore uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Circumscription, is said to be in Place; we instantly cogitate an infinite Space: which is more then we can do of Place, if accepted in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi> Notion, which imports either that God cannot be in any place, or else He must be circumscribed by the contiguous superfice thereof: which how ridiculous, we need not observe. For <hi>Angels</hi> likewise, who dares affirm an Angel to be in a place, that considers his Incorporiety, and the necessity of his circumsciption by the superfice of the Circumambient, if <hi>Aristotles</hi> Definition of Place be tolerable? To excuse it with a distinction, and say, that an Angel may be conceived to be in a determinate place, not <hi>Circumscriptivè,</hi> but <hi>definitivè, i. e.</hi> So <hi>Here,</hi> as no <hi>where</hi> else: is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely and upon inference, to confess the truth of our assertion; Since that <hi>Here,</hi> designs a certain part of Space, not the superfice of any circumam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient. For, though you reply, that an Angel, being an incorporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, wants as well <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>profound</hi> Dimensions, by which his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may respond to <hi>Space,</hi> as those <hi>superficial</hi> ones, that respond to <hi>Place</hi>: yet cannot that suffice to an evasion, since if his substance hath any <hi>Diffusion</hi> in place, as is generally allowed; and though it be constituted <hi>in puncto,</hi> as is also generally conceived: nevertheless, doth that Diffusion as necessarily respond to a certain aequal part of Space, as a point is a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate part of space. This perhaps, is somewhat abstruse, and therefore let us conceive an Angel to be resident in some one point of that <hi>Inane Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> circumscribed by the concave of the Lunar orb, formerly imagined: and then we may without any shadow of obscurity understand, How his substance may respond to a certain part, or point of the Inane Space, so as He may be said to be <hi>Here,</hi> not <hi>There,</hi> in this but no other place: but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible it is, to make it out, How the substance of an Angel constituted <hi>in puncto</hi> of an empty space, can respond to the superfice of a Body Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambient, because all Bodies formerly included in that sublunary Region are praesupposed to be adnihilated. Lastly, by the Incorporiety of Space we are praeserved from that Contradiction, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> endeavouring to praevent, praecipitated himself upon no small Absurdity, <hi>viz. that the supreme Heaven, or Primum mobile is in no Place.</hi> For, if we adhere to his opinion, that place is the superfice of a body circumambient; the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> being the extreme or bounds of the World, we deny any thing of <hi>Corporiety</hi> beyond it, and so exempt it from <hi>Locality</hi>: but if we accept space to be the same without and within the world, we admit the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> the noblest, largest, and most useful of all Bodies in the World, to enjoy a Place proportionate to its dimensions, and motion, as adaequately as any other. The necessity of which concession, <hi>Thales Milesius</hi> well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, when interrogated, What <hi>Thing was greatest?</hi> He answered, <hi>Place</hi>: because, as the World contains all other Bodies, so Place contains the World.</p>

                        <hi>Art.</hi> 2. The Generall praesumption that Time is <hi>Corporeal,</hi> or an <hi>Accident</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on Corporeal Subjects; the chief Cause of that Difficulty</note> of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a clear and perspect theory of the <hi>Quiddity</hi> of Time, from the Lecture of those prolix Treatises, whose plausible Titles promise satisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: we shall soon find the chief <hi>Cause</hi> to be this; that most Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers have praesupposed Time to be some <hi>Corporeal Ens,</hi> or at least some certain <hi>Accident</hi> inexistent in and dependent on Corporeal Subjects; when (in verity) if it be any thing at all it seems to be the <hi>Twin-brother</hi> of <hi>Space,</hi> devoyd of all relation to Corporiety, and absolutely independent on the Existence of any Nature whatever. For, to Him, who shall, in abstract and attentive meditation, sequestre Time from all Bodies, from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, successive alternations, and contingent vicissitudes insequent upon those motions; <hi>i. e.</hi> all Years, Months, Weeks, Dayes, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and all Accidents or Events contingent therein: it will soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear most evident, that Time (<hi>in suo esse</hi>) owes no respect at all to Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, its constancy, variety, or measure; since the understanding must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Time to continue to be what it ever was and is, whether there be any Motion or Mutation in the World, or not, nay, whether there be any World or not. For, examining what is meant by the term <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and what by the term <hi>Motion,</hi> in their single importances apart: we discover, that Motion holds no relation to Duration, nor <hi>è converso,</hi> Duration to Motion, but what is purely <hi>Accidental,</hi> and <hi>Mental,</hi> i. e. imagined by man, in order to his commensuration of the one by the other.</p>

Physic.</hi>) by way of explanation, thus renders: Days and Nights are Accidents supervenient up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ambient Aer, the one being caused by the praesence, the other by the absence of the Sun; Hours are also accidents, as being parts of day or night; but Time is coextended to each day, night &amp; hour, &amp; therefore we say, that this day is long, this night short, while our thoughts are constantly pointing

at Time in that respect supervenient; Passions likewise and Indolences, or Dolours and Pleasures, are Accidents not without Time evenient; last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Motion and Quiet are Accidents contingent in Time, and therefore by it we commensurate the Celerity and Tardity of Motion, the long or short duration of Quiet: therefore is Time the Accident of Accidents.

                        <hi>Art.</hi> 5. <hi>Aristotles</hi> so much magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Definition of Time, to be the <hi>Measure of Motion Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial, &amp;c.</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended and found too light.</note> positively and magisterially determines Time to be, <hi>Numerum Motus (coelestis ac primi) secundum prius &amp; posterius,</hi> the Number of the first Coelestial Motion, according to former and later, <hi>i. e.</hi> insomuch as in Motion we may observe parts <hi>Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Consequent</hi> by a perpetual succession. At the first word of this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Definition, some superficial <hi>Criticks</hi> have sawcely nibbled, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (forsooth) that it sounds soloecistical, because <hi>Number</hi> is Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity <hi>Discrete,</hi> but <hi>Time Continued</hi>; and therefore that the Word <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> ought to be its substitute: but alas! had they read His whole discourse of the nature of Time, they could not have been ignorant, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> intended nothing less, then that Time should be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Quantity <hi>Discrete</hi>; when both in his praecedent and subsequent lines He expresly teacheth, that <hi>Motion is continued, in respect of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, and Time in respect of Motion.</hi> Had They Excepted against the <hi>whole,</hi> indeed, their Quarrel had bin justifiable, and our selves might safely have espoused it; because, if Time be the Measure of Coelestial Motion, then must it follow, that if there were a Plurality of Worlds, or <hi>Prima Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia's</hi>; there would also be a Plurality of Times, because a Plurality of Motions. To those of His Disciples, who reply, that in case there were many <hi>First Moveables,</hi> and consequently many distinct Motions; yet would there be but <hi>one</hi> Measure of them all: we rejoyn, if it be supposed that some of the many Motions are swifter then others, then of necessity must they have many <hi>Prior</hi> and <hi>Posterior</hi> Parts; and if so,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55028:54"/>
how can all those, more or less discrepant in velocity and tardity, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one and the same measure? or, what sober man can admit, that there would be but one Time, where must be many distinct <hi>subjects</hi> of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so of Time? Nor can it more avail them to distinguish Time INTERNAL from EXTERNAL, assigning to each particular <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> a proper or <hi>Internal</hi> Time within its ambite, and one General or <hi>External</hi> Time to them all in common: because it is a manifest <hi>Adynaton,</hi> that there should be a General Time, without a General Motion, whose parts being prior and posterior, in respect of perpetual succession, must be the common <hi>Norma,</hi> or Rule of observation to all the rest; nor, indeed, can we admit, that a Flux of ten hours at once, or together, is possible, where ten Spheres are in one hour moved. And, therefore, though <hi>Aristotle</hi> seems to have had some Hint of the true nature of Time, in his <hi>Objection</hi> against those, who opinioned it to be <hi>Coelestial Motion</hi>: yet he lost it again, when He defined it to be the <hi>Measure of Coelestial Motion.</hi> For, Reason atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth the contrary, it being evident that the Coelestial Motion is rather the Measure of Time: insomuch as the measure ought to be more known then the thing measured; and Time is a certain Flux no less independent upon Motion then Quiet. Which those Worthies well understood, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Time to be IMAGINARY, such as flowed infinitely in duration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Creation, and shall continue its flux infinitely after the Dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World.</p>

(6) And therefore, as every Body, or Thing, in respect to its HERE or THERE, enjoyes a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate part of the <hi>Mundane Space</hi>: So likewise doth it, according to its NOW, or THEN of Existence, enjoy a proportionate part of the <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane Duration.</hi> (7) As, in relation to Place, we say, <hi>Everywhere,</hi> and <hi>Somewhere</hi>

And therefore those two illustrious Attributes, <hi>Immensity,</hi> whereby He is praesent in all places, and <hi>Aeternity,</hi> whereby He is existent at all Times, are proper only to God.

Hence comes it, that as by the Longitude, of any standing measure (V.G.) of an Ell, we commensurate the longitude of Place: so by the flux of an Horologe do we commensurate the flux of Time. And, insomuch as no motion is more General, Constant and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, then that of the Sun: therefore do we assume its motion for a <hi>General Horodix,</hi> by it regulate all our computations, and confide in it as an universal Directory, in our Mensuration of the flux of Time. Not that the Feet of Time are chained to the Chariot of the Sun, so as the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeration or Retardation of the motion of that should cause an equal Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity, or Tardity in the progress of this: but that Custom hath so prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, as we compute the flux of Time by the diurnal and annual revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun. For, in case the motion of the Sun were doubly swifter, then now it is, that of Time would not therefore be doubly swifter also; but only the space of two dayes would then be equal to the space of one, as now during the praesence of the Sun to our Hemisphere: nor, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if the motion of the Sun were doubly slower, would the pace of Time be likewise doubly slower; but only the Space of one day, would be equal to that of two. And, therefore, He that will defend <hi>Empedocles</hi> conceit, that in the beginning of the World, the length of the dayes did by six parts in seven exceed that of our dayes: must demonstrate that the urnal Arch of the Sun was then by six of seven larger then now, or its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so much slower.</p>

trifling with words not well understood; or that they had praecariously usurped the Quaestion; or that the same Instants are in Eternity, that are in our Time, but with such Eminency, that infinitely <hi>more</hi> are contained in Eternity, then in our Time. How much better were it said, that we are Coexistent with God; or, that we are existent in a small part of that Duration, in which God infinitely existeth?

This may receive ample justification from that speech of the <hi>Hebrew Poet,</hi> whose Inspirer was the Holy Ghost, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 101.) <hi>Thou shalt Change them and they shall be changed; but thou, O God! art the same forever, and thy years shall not fail.</hi> For here YEARS are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God, but not any mutation of Substance: so that when our years are exhausted, in a short, or span-like flux of Time, the Glass of His Duration is alwayes full.

Besides, Time, or the succession of Duration, is not the Cause, that induceth Corruption: but the <hi>Native Imbecillity</hi> of compound Natures, invaded and subdued by some <hi>Contrary Agent</hi>; and God is a <hi>Pure, Simple, Homogeneous</hi> substance, and so not subject to the invasion of any Contrary. Evident it is, therefore, that <hi>Aristotle,</hi> when He urged this Sophism, spoke more like a Poet, then a Philosopher; since Poets only use to give Time the Epithite of <hi>Edax rerum:</hi> nor could He be so absurd, as to dream, that Time was a vast Animal, with sharp teeth, an insatiate appetite, and a belly inexplebile, or an old man armed with a Sithe, as the Poets describe <hi>Saturn,</hi> making <gap reason="foreign">

For, He must allow either that the whole of any Body is something besides, or distinct from the Aggeries, or Mass of Parts, of which it is composed: or, that all the Parts, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether taken, are somewhat greater then the whole amassed by their convention and coalescence.

Nor, need we despair to make him swear, that <hi>Arcesilas</hi> did not jeer the Disciples of <hi>Zeno,</hi> when he exemplified the inexhaurible division of Magnitude, in a mans Thigh, amputated, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, and cast into the Sea; ironically affirming the parts thereof so infinitely subdivisible, that it might be incorporated <hi>per mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimas,</hi> to every particle of Water therein; and consequently, that not only <hi>Antigonus</hi> Navy might sail at large through the thigh, but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55028:63"/>
also that <hi>Xerxes</hi> thousand two hundred ships might freely maintain a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val fight with 300 Gallies of the Greeks, in the compass of its dispersed parts. We deny not, but <hi>Zeno's</hi> Argument against Motion, grounded on the supposition of interminable Partibility in Magnitude, is too hard and full of Knots, to be undone by the teeth of common reason: yet who hath been so superlatively stupid, as to prefer the mere plausibility thereof to the contrary Demonstration of his sense, and thereupon infer a belief, that there is no Motion in the World? What Credulity is there so easie, as to entertain a conceit, that one granule of sand (a thing of very small circumscription) doth contain so great a number of parts, as that it may be divided into a thousand millions of Myriads; and each of those parts be subdivided into a thousand millions of Myriads; and each of those be redivided into as many; and each of those into as many: so as that it is impossible, by multiplications of Divisions, ever to arrive at parts so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely small, as that none can be smaller; though the subdivisions be repeated every moment, not only in an hour, a day, a month, or a year, but a thousand millions of Myriads of years? Or, What Hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack hath been so wild in Phansie, as to conceive that the vast mass of the World may not be divided into more parts then the Foot of a Handworm, a thing so minute as if made only to experiment the perfection of an Engy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope? And yet this must not be granted, if we hearken to the spels of <hi>Zeno</hi> and the Stoicks; who contend for the Divisibility of every the smallest quantity into infinite parts: since, into how many parts soever the World be divided, as many are assumable in the Foot of a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, the parts of this being no less inexhaustible, nor more terminable by any continued division, then the parts of that, according to the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Infinitude. And, hereon may we safely conclude, that albeit the Arguments alledged in defence of Infinite Divisibility of every Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Continuum, were (as not a few, nor obscure Clerks have reputed them) absolutely indissoluble: yet notwithstanding, since we have the plain Certificate of not only our Reason, but undeluded sense also to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Contrary, ought we to more then suspect them of secret Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Collusion; it being a rule, worthy the reputation of a First No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in the examination of those Physical Theorems, whose Verity, or Falsity is determinable by the sincere judicature of the sense, we ought to appeal to no other Criterion, but to acquiesce in the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification thereof; especially where is no Refragation, or Dissent of Reason.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding the manifest necessity of this apodictical Truth, yet have there been many <hi>Sophisms</hi> framed, upon design to evade it: among which we find only <hi>Two,</hi> whose plausibility and popular approbation seem to praescribe them to our praesent notice.</p>

Since, as in a Continuum two parts are not denyed to exist, though it be never divided into those two parts: so likewise are not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite parts denied to exist therein, though it be never really divisible into infinite parts. Otherwise, we demand, since by those requisite divisions and subdivisions <hi>usque ad infinitum,</hi> still more and more actuall parts are discovered; can you conceive those parts, which may be discovered to be of any <hi>Determinate Number,</hi> or not? If you take the <hi>Affirm.</hi> then will not there be parts enough to maintain the division to infinity: if the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat.</hi> then must the parts be actually infinite. For, how can a Continuum be superior to final exhaustion, unless in this respect, that it contains infinite parts, <hi>i. e.</hi> such whose Infinity makes it Inexhaustible. Because, as those parts, which are deduced from a Continuum, must be praeexistent therein before deduction (else whence are they deduceable?) so also must those, which yet remain deduceable, be actually existent therein, otherwise they are not deducible from it. For, Parts are then Infinite, when more and more inexhaustibly, or without end, are conceded Deducible.</p>

the side thereof: because each of all its points must be possessed by just so many, nor more nor fewer lines, then may be drawn betwixt the points of the opposite sides; which is highly absurd. (6) That, with the danger of no less absurdity, would not a semicircle be greater then its Diametre; since to every point in the semicircle there would respond another in the Diametre, and there would be in both as many points, on which as many perpendicular Lines, deduced from them, might be incident. (7) That, according to the supposition of Insectility, of many Concentrick Circles the Exterior would not be greater then the Interior; insomuch as all the Lines drawn from all the points of it toward the Centre, must pass through as many points of the other. Many other Exceptions lye against our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sectility; but being they are of the same Nature with these, rather Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical, then Physical, and that one common solution will serve them all: we may not abuse our leasure in their recitation.</p>

                     <p>First, we conceive it not justifiable, alwayes to expect the eviction of Physical Theorems; by Geometrical Demonstrations.

Thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Opticks, <hi>Euclid</hi> concedes a <hi>Least Angle</hi>; and <hi>Vitellio</hi> admits a <hi>Least Light,</hi> such as being once understood to be divided, hath no longer the act of Light, <hi>i. e.</hi> wholly disappears: which is no less, then in Opticks to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Term, or point of Consistence to the Division of Quantity, which yet in Geometry they hold capable of an infinite process. We are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of a most pertinent Example, for the illustration of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The <hi>Geometrician</hi> Demonstrateth the Division of a Line into two equal segments, to be a thing not only possible, but most easie: and yet cannot the <hi>Physiologist</hi> be induced to swallow it, as really performable.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55028:65"/>
For He considers (1) That the superfice of no body can be so exactly smooth and polite, as to be devoyd of all uneveness or asperity, every common Microscope discovering numerous inaequalities in the surface of even the best cut Diamonds, and the finest Chrystal, Bodies, whose Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucency sufficiently confesseth them to be exceeding polite: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that there is assumable thereon no Line so perfectly uniform, as not to be made unequal by many <hi>Valleculae</hi> and <hi>Monticulae,</hi> small pits and protuberances frequently interjacent. (2) That the Edge of no Dissecting Instrument can be so acute, as not to draw a line of some Latitude. (3) That should the edge of the acutest Rasor be laid on the foot of a Handworm, which may be effected by the advantage of a good Magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glass, and a steady hand: yet is that composed of many Myriads of Atoms, or insensible particles of the First universal Matter. And thence Concludes that no real Line drawn upon the superfice of any the smoothest Body, can be practically divided into two Halfs, so exactly, as that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction shall be in that part, which is truly the median to both extremes. Since, that part, which appears, to the sense, to be the median, and is most exiguous; doth yet consist of so many Myriads of particles, as that though the edge of the Rasor be imposed by many Myriads of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles aside of that, which is truly in the middle, yet will it seem to the eye still to be one and the same. This duely perpended, we have no cause to fear the <hi>section of an Atome,</hi> though the edge of a knife were imposed directly upon it: Since the edge must be gross and blunt, if compared to the exility of an Atome: so that we may allow it to divide an Assembly, or Heap of Atoms, but never to cut a single one.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We judge it expedient in some cases to accommodate sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions Geometrical to Subjects merely Physical; but to this end only, that we may thereby acquire <hi>majorem</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, a greater degree of <hi>Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> or advance our speculations to more Exactness. Thus the soul of the Mathematicks, <hi>Archimed, (de Arenarum num.)</hi> supposed the Diametre of a grain of Poppy seed to consist of 10000 particles; not that He conceived that any Art could really discern so vast a multitude of parts in a body of so minute circumscription: but that, by transferring the same reason to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body of larger dimensions, He might attain the certitude of his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition by so much the nearer, by how much the less he might have erred by neglecting one of those many particles. Thus also is it the custom of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians, in order to their exactness in Calculations, to imagine the Semi-diametre, or Radius of any Circle, divided into many Myriads of Parts; not that so many parts can be really distinguished in any Radius, but that, when comparation is made betwixt the Radius, and other right lines, which in parts Aliquotal, or such as are expressed by whole numbers, do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly respond thereunto, particles may be found out so exile, as though one, or the fraction of one of them be neglected yet can no sensible Error ensue thereupon. And this (in a word) seems to be the true and only Cause, why Mathematicians constantly suppose every Continuum to consist of Infinite parts: not that they can, or ought to understand it to be Really so; but that they may conserve to themselves a liberty of insensible Latitude, by subdividing each division of Parts into so many as they please; For, they well know, that the Physiologist is in the right, when He admits no Infinity, but only an Innumerability of parts in natua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Continuum. Lastly, if these Reasons appear not weighty enough to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55028:66"/>
counterpoise the Contrary Persuasion; we can aggravate them with a Grain of noble Authority. For, no meaner a man then <hi>Plato,</hi> who seems to have understood Geometry as well as the Aegyptian <hi>Theuth,</hi> the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Inventor thereof (<hi>vide Platon. in Phaedro</hi>) and to have honoured it much more in a solemn Panegyrick (9. <hi>dialog. de Rep.</hi>) sharply reprehends <hi>Eudoxus, Archytas, Menaechonus,</hi> &amp;c. for their errour in endeavouring to adjust Geometrical speculations to sensible objects: subnecting in positive termes, that (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55028:67"/>
all things were composed of those two, as <hi>Elementary</hi> Principles. That which imposed upon their <hi>Accusers</hi> judgment, was this, that supposing <hi>Atoms</hi> and the <hi>Inane Space</hi> to be <hi>Ingenite</hi> and <hi>Incorruptible,</hi> they conceived the whole of Nature to arise from them, as from its two universal Parts; but never dreamt so wild an Alogy, as that all <hi>Concretions,</hi> that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Generation, and subject to destruction by Corruption, must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Consistence from those two, in the capacity of Elements, or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponentia.</hi> For, albeit in some latitude and liberty of sense, they may be conceded Elements, or Principles of the Universe: yet doth it not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow, that therefore they must be equal Principles, or Elements of <hi>Generables</hi>; since Atoms only fulfill that title, the Inane Space affording only <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Discrimination.</hi> Nor is it probable, that those, who had defined Vacuity by <hi>Incorporiety,</hi> should lapse into so manifest a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as to allow it to be any Cause of Corporiety, or to constitute one moiety of Bodies. Besides, neither can <hi>Epicurus</hi> in any of those Fragments of his, redeemed from the jaws of oblivion by <hi>Laertius, Cicero, Empiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Plutarch, &amp;c.</hi> nor his faithful Disciple and Paraphrast, <hi>Lucretius,</hi> in all his Physiology, be found, to have affirmed the Contexture of any Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Inanity, but of all things simply and solely from Atoms. And for <hi>Democritus,</hi> him doth even <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself wholly acquit of this Error; for (<hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Phys.</hi>) enumerating the several opinions of the Ancients concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principles, or Elements of all things, He saith of him; <hi>Fecit prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiorum Genus unicum, Figuras verò differentes.</hi> All therefore that lyeth against them in this case, is only that they asserted the interspersion or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semination of Inanity among the incontingent particles of Bodies concrete, as of absolute necessity to their peculiar Contemperation: which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our selves obliged to embrace and defend, untill it shall be proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, by more then paralogistical arguments, that there is any one Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world so perfectly solid, as to contain nothing of the Inane Space intermixt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which till it can be demonstrated that a Concretion may be so solid, as to be Indissoluble, we have no cause to expect.</p>

(2) They are praesumed to coalesce, and their Concretions to consist without Inanity interspersed among their incontiguous particles: which is impossible. (3) Their Defendants themselves concede a degree of Dissolution beyond them: and consequently that they know a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Senior. (4) Their Patrons must grant either that they, by a praevious deperdition of their own nature, are changed into Concretions, which by mutation of Forms escheat again into Elements; in which case Elements can be no more the Principle of Concretions, then Concretions the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Elements, since their Generations must be vicissitudinary and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as that of Water and Ice: or, that, conserving their own natures immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they make only confused Heaps, and confer only their visible Bulks to all productions; in which case, nothing can <hi>revera</hi> be said to be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, since all Generations owe their proprieties and peculiar denominations to their Forms. (5) Whoso admits a reciprocal or symbolical Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elements: must also admit one Common, and so a Former Matter, which may successively invest it self in their several Forms; For Contraries, while Contraries, cannot unite in the assumption of the same nature. (6) That <hi>Achilles,</hi> or Champian Objection, that Vegetables and Animals owe their Nutrition and Increment to the four Elements, is soon conquered by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying; that Elements are not therefore the First Principles, but rather those from whose respective Contexture they borrowed the nature of Elements, and so derived an aptitude, or qualification requisite to the condition of Aliment.</p>

                  <p>Which to suppose, is to dote: (1) Because if the nature of the whole be one and the same with that of its Parts: then must the Principles, no less then the Concretions consisting of them, be obnoxious to Corruption.

(3) Because from hence, that (concordant to <hi>Anaxagoras</hi>) all things are actually existent in all things, and that the difference resteth only in the external Apparence, arising from the praedominion of such or such over such or such parts of the Consimilar Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: it necessarily ensues (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> argueth against Him, 1 <hi>Physic.</hi> 4.) that in the contusion, section, or detrition of Fruits, Herbs, &amp;c. there must frequently appear Blood, Milk, Sperm, &amp;c. as being thereby enfranchised from the tyranny of those parts, which ruled the rost in the induction of the outward apparence, and emergent out of those Clouds which concealed and disguised them.

Of this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire our Reader to be judge, when he hath made himself competent, by a patient hearing, and upright perpension of the pleas of both parties, here praesented.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) <hi>Anti-Atomist</hi>; Whence had these minute and indivisible Bodies, called Atoms, their original? or, out of what were they educed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atomist</hi>; This inapposite Demand lyeth open to a double response. As a mere <hi>Philosopher</hi> I return; that the assumption of Atoms for the <hi>First Matter</hi> doth expresly praevent the pertinency of this Quaere. Nor would <hi>Aristotle, Plato,</hi> or any other of the <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philosophers, who would not hear of a <hi>Creation,</hi> or production of the First Matter out of Nothing, but contumaciously maintained its <hi>Ingeneration</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> have had Gravity enough to suppress the insurrection of their spleen against the absurdity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: since to enquire the Matter of the <hi>First</hi> Matter, is a <hi>Contradiction in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis.</hi> As a proficient in the sacred School of <hi>Moses,</hi> I may answer; that the fruitful <hi>Fiat</hi> of God, out of the <hi>Tohu,</hi> or infinite space of Nothing, called up a sufficient stock of the First Matter, for the fabrication of the World in that most excellent Form, which He had Idea'd in his own omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient intellect from Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) <hi>Anti-Atomist</hi>; If Atoms be smooth and sphaerical, as their Inventors suppose; it is impossible they should take mutual hold each of other, so as by reciprocal adhaesion and coalition to constitute any Concretion. For, what power can mould an heap of Millet-seed into a durable figure, when the Laevitude or politeness, and roundness of the Grains inexcusably interdict their Coition into a Mass?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atomist</hi>; This Objection discovers the rancour, no less then the praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Interrogation did the weakness of the proposers. For, they could not be ignorant, that the Defendants of Atoms do not suppose them to be all
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55028:69"/>
smooth and globular, but of <hi>all sorts of figures</hi> requisite to mutual <hi>Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Coalition, Cohaerence.</hi> And therefore they could not but expect this solution. That, though polite and orbicular Atoms, cannot by mutual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension and revinction each of other, compact themselves into a Mass; yet may they be apprehended and retained by the Hooks, and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Creeks and Angles of other Atoms, of Hamous and Angular figures, and so conspire to the Coagmentation of a Mass, that needs no other Caement besides the mutual dependence of its component particles, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its Tenacity and Compingence. This may receive light, from observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the successive separation of the dissimilar Parts of Bodies, by Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. For, first those Atoms, which are more smooth, or less angular and hamous, easily extricate themselves, and disperse from the Concreted Mass; and then, after many and various Evolutions, circumgyrations, and change of positions, the more rough, hamous, and angular, they expede themselves from reciprocal concatenation, and at last, being wholly disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pursue the inclination of their inhaerent Motive Faculty, and disappear. Experience demonstrating, that by how much more Unctuous and Tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous any Consistence is, by so much a longer time do the particles thereof require to their Exhalation. Thus is Water much sooner evaporated, then Oyl: and Lead then Silver.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) <hi>Anti-Atomist</hi>; If Atoms be unequal in their superfice, and have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and hamous processes; then are they capable of having their rugosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties planed by detrition, and their hooks and points taken off by amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: contrary to their principle propriety, Indivisibility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atomist</hi>; the hooks, angles, asperities, and processes of Atoms are as insecable and infrangible as the residue of their bodies, in respect an equal solidity belongs to them, by reason of their defect of Inanity interspersed, the intermixture of Inanity being the Cause of all Divisibility.</p>

                  <p n="4">(4) <hi>Anti-Atomist</hi>; That Bodies of small circumscription, such as grains of sand, may be amassed from a syndrome, and coagmentation of Atoms; seems, indeed, to stand in some proportion to probability: but to conceive a possibility, that so vast a Bulk, as the adspectable World bears may arise out of things but one degree above nothing, such insensible materials con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened and conglobated; is a symptome of such madness, as Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adust cannot excuse, and for which Physitians are yet to study a cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atomist</hi>; To doubt the possibility, nay dispute the probability of it: is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the greater madness. For, since a small stone may be made up of a Coagmentation of grains of Sand; a multitude of small stones, by coacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, make up a Rock; many Rocks by aggregation, make a Mountain; many Mountains, by coaptation, make up the Globe of Earth; since the Sun, the Heavens, nay the World may arise from the conjunction of parts of dimensions equal to the Terrestrial Globe: what impossibility doth he incurr, who conceives the Universe to be amassed out of Atoms? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, no Bulk can be imagined of such immense Dimensions, as that the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55028:69"/>
greatest parts thereof may not be divided into less, and those again be subdivided into less; so that, by a successive degradation down the scale of Magnitude, we may not at last arrive at the foot thereof, which cannot be conceived other then Atoms. Should it appear unconceivable to any that a Pismire may perform a perambulation round the terrestrial Globe; we advise him to institute this Climax of Dimensions, and consider, first that the ambite of the Earth is defined by miles, that miles are commensurated by paces, paces consist of feet, feet of digits, digits of grains, &amp;c. and then He may soon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that the step of a Pismire holds no great disproportion to a grain, and that a grain holds a manifest proportion to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, a digit to a foot, a foot to a pace, a pace to a perch, a perch to a furlong, a furlong to a mile, and so to the circumference of the whole Earth, yea by multiplication to the convexity of the whole World. If any expect a further illustration of this point, it can cost him no more but the pains of reading the 45. page of our Treatise against <hi>Atheism</hi>; and of <hi>Archimeds</hi> book <hi>de Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum Numero.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Atomist</hi>; This inference is ingenuine, because unnecessary, since all Atoms are not Consimilar, or of one sort, nor have they an equal aptitude to the Conformation of all Bodies. Hence comes it, that of them are first composed certain Moleculae, small masses, of various figures, which are the seminaries of various productions; and then, from those determinate seminaries do all specifical Generations receive their contexture and Constitution, so praecisely, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not owe their Configuration to any others. And, therefore, since the Earth, impraegnated with Fertility, by the sacred Magick of the Creators Benediction, contains the seeds of all Vegetables; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not arise but from the Earth, nor subsist or augment without roots, by the mediation of which, other small consimilar Masses of Atoms are continually allected for their nutrition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor without moysture, by the benefit of which, those minute masses are diluted, and so adapted for transportation and final assimilation; nor without the influence of the Sun, by vertue whereof their vegetative Faculty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, cherished and promoted in its operations.

of all things: then may it be thence inferred, that the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> are invisibly contained in Flints, nay more, in a Sphaerical Glass of Water, exposed to the directly incident rayes of the Sun; our sense convincing, that Fire is usually kindled either way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atomist</hi>; Allowing the legality of your Illation, we affirm, that in a Flint are concealed not only the Atoms, but <hi>Moleculae,</hi> or Seeds of Fire, which wanting only retection, or liberty of Exsilition, to their apparence in the forme of fire, acquire it by excussion, and pursuing their own rapid motion <hi>undiquaque,</hi> discover themselves both by affecting the sight and accension of any easily combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on which they shall pitch, and into whose pores they shall with exceeding Celerity penetrate.

It being manifest, that violent motion generateth Heat: and confessed even by <hi>Aristotle</hi> (1. <hi>Meteor.</hi> 3.) that Fire is nothing but the <hi>Hyperbole</hi> or last degree of Heat. Secondly, That the seeds of Fire are not contained either in the sphaerical Glass or the the Water included therein; but in the Beams of the Sun (whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is altogether of Igneous Atoms) which being deradiated in dispersed lines, want only Concurse and Coition to their investment in the visible form of Fire; and that the Figure of the Glass natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally induceth, it being the nature of either a Convex, or Concave Glass to transmit many Beams variously incident towards one and the same point, which the virtue of Union advanceth to the force of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>

These considerations therefore enable us to conclude, that those who constitute a Continuum of points Mathematical, absurdly maintain, (1) That a point added to a point makes an augmentation of quantity; (2) That no Motion is successive, but only Discrete; (3) That all motions are of equal velocity, <hi>sunt enim puncta mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimum quod pertransiri possint:</hi> and <hi>Arriaga's</hi> Quiet, imagined to be in motions, is no part of Motion. (4) That a Wheel is dissolved, when cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumrotated upon its Axis; for, since the Exterior Circle must praecede the Interior, at least, by one point, it follows that the same points do not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond to the same points; which is absurd and incredible.

Then our Reason if we contemplate the <hi>inside</hi> thereof, will discover a great variety of Organs necessary to the several functions of an Animal.

Now, if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively compute, how many particles go to the composure of each of those organical parts, and how many Myriads of Atoms go to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of each of those particles (for even the Spirits inservient to the motion of one of its toes, are compositions consisting of many thousands of Atoms), as we shall think it no wonder, that the exile and industrious fingers of Nature have distinguished, sequestred, selected, convened, accommodated, coadunated, and with as much aptitude as decorum dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed such an incomprehensible multitude of Parts, in the structure of so minute an Animal; so may we, in some latitude of analogy, conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture the extreme Parvity of Her common Material, Atoms.

For, in so doing He will acquire autoptical satisfaction, that none of them are exactly orbicular and perpolite, but all of various angular figures, pyramidal, pentahedrical, cubical, trapezian, heptahedrical, octahe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical, dodecahedrical, icosahedrical, &amp;c. nay of so many irregular and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar apparences, as must refute his error with a delightful Wonder. Though, in troth, it can be no wonder to him that considers the Defect of any Cause, that should break off the angles from those fragments vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, after their detrition from hard bodies, and so tornate them into smooth sphaerules: observation ascertaining, that when hard bodies are broken into large pieces, those pieces are alwayes angular, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely discrepant in the parts of their superfice; and Reason

thence inferring, that lesser pieces must confess the like irregularity and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of figures among themselves. True it is, they enter the eye in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sphear, because of the exiguity of their Angles; for every small, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Icosahedrical body, nay even Oblong and Cylindrical, posited at ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive distance, the extremities of their images being, in their long trajecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through the aer, confracted, retused, and so entering the <hi>Retina tumica</hi> in a lesser angle; alwayes appear orbicular.

A singular <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toptically<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating the various Configurations of the minute Particles of Concretions.</note> delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and satisfactory. Exposing a vessel of Salt water, to the Sun, or other convenient heat, so as the aqueous parts thereof may be gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evaporated; we may observe all the Salt therein contained, to reside in the bottome, conformed into Cubical Masses. And, if we do the like with Alum Water, the Alum will concrete in Octohedrical figures. Nay, the Cubes generated of Salt, will be so much the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by how much the more and deeper the Water, wherein it was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved; and <hi>è contra,</hi> so much the smaller, by how much shallower the Water: so that from a large vessel will arise saline Cubes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions equal to those of a Gamesters Die; but from a small we shall receive Cubes, by five parts of six, lesser, and if we drop a small quantity of brine upon a plane piece of Glass, the Cubical Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereon fixing, will be so minute, as to require the help of an Engyscope to their discernment. Now, as to that part of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, which more directly points at our praesent scope; we may perceive the greater Cubes to be a meer Congeries or assembly of small ones, and those small ones to be coagmentated of others yet smaller, or certainly composed of exiguous Masses bearing the figure of Isoscele Triangles, from four of which convened and mutually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, every Cube doth result. Hence is it obvious to Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that those small Cubes, discernable only by an Engyscope, are contexed of other smaller, and those again of smaller, until by a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive degradation they arrive at the exility of Atoms, at least of those Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leculae, which are the Seminaries of Salt, and, according to evident pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, of either exactly Quadrate, or Isoscele Triangular figures. Now, insomuch as the same, allowing the difference of Figure, is conjectural also concerning Alum, Sugar, Nitre, Vitriol, &amp;c. Saline Concretions: why may we not extend it also to all other Compositions, especially such as have their Configurations certain and determinate, according to their specifical Nature.</p>

What makes a Dog, by the meer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity of his nose, find out his Master, in the dark, in a whole host of men? but this; that those subtle <hi>Effluvia,</hi> or Expirations, emitted insensibly from the body of his Master, are of a different Contexture from those of all others, and so make a different impression upon the mamillary processes, or smelling Nerves of the Dog. The like may also, with equal reason, be demanded concerning those wayes of Discrimination, whereby all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals agnize their own from others young; and Beasts of prey, in their difficult venations, single out the embossed and chased, though blended together with numerous Herds of the same species.

Nor doth the Verisimility hereof hold only in objects of the sight and smelling; but diffuseth to those of the Hearing, Tasting, and Touching: as may be soon inferred by him, who shall do us the right, and himself the pleasure to descend to particulars.

                     <hi>esse Figuras Atomorum incomprehensibiles, non infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas,</hi> that the figures of Atoms are so various, as to be incomprehensible, though not simply infinite: this can be nor Problem, nor Paradox. For, though the species of Regular Figures be many, of Irregular more, and of those that are producible from both regular and irregular, according to all the possible wayes of their Commixture and Transposition, so amusing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly various; as that the mind of man, though acquainted with all the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Arithmetique and Algebra, cannot attain to a definite compute, nor praecise d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ription of them all: yet do they not run up to absolute Infinity, so as that there can be no extreme and terminating species. That the variety of Figures competent to Atoms, ought to be held <hi>only Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible</hi>; these Reasons evince (1) Since Atoms are circumscribed and limitate in Magnitude, that Configurations in diversity infinite should arise from that finite magnitude, is clearly impossible. For, every distinct figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration praesupposeth a distinct position of parts; and the parts of finite Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude may be transposed so many several wayes, as no further way of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position can remain possible: otherwise there would be new and new parts inexhaustibly, and so magnitude would become infinite. (2) If the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of figures were infinite, then could not the Qualities arising to concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the various Contexture of their parts, be certain and determinate: since, allowing an inexhaustible novelty of Configurations, their insensible particles might be so variegated, as that a better then the best, and a worse then the worst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Configurations might be produced; which is no obscure absurdity. (3) All things are determined by Contrary Qualities, which are so extreme, that they admit many mediate or Inclusive degrees, but none Exclusive, or without their boundaries. (4) That only a Finite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety is sufficient to that incomprehensible diversity of figures, observed in nature.</p>
                  <p>That the variety of Figures allowable to Atoms, is <hi>Incomprehensible</hi>; may be thus familiarized. Thinke we, what great multiplicity of words may be composed of only a few Letters variously transposed. For, if we assume only Two Letters, of them we can create only two words; if three, 6; if four, 24; if five, 120<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if six, 720; if seven, 5040; if eight, 40320; if nine, 362880<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ten, 3628800: so that before we fulfil the 24 Letters, the number of words componible of them, according to all the possible ways of positions, will swell above our computation. This done, let us no more but exchange Letters for Figures, and assuming only Round, Oblong, Oval, Eliptick, Lenticular, Plane, Gibbous, Turbinate, Hamous, Polite, Hispid, Conical, Obtuse, Tetrahedical, Pentahedrical, Hexahedrical, Heptahedri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Dodecahedrical, Icosahedrical, Striate or skrewed, Triangular, Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical Atoms: cast up to what an inassignable number the Figures produci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from them, according to the several wayes of their Composition and transposition, may amount. Doubtless, we shall discover so great variety, as
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55028:77"/>
to elude our comprehension. If so, how much more incomprehensible must that Diversity be, which is possible from the assumption, and complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Regular and Irregular figures, that a good Geometrician can conceive, and which it is justifiable for us to allow existent in Nature?</p>
                  <p>But as for the LAST; viz. <hi>that the number of Atoms,</hi>

Atoms: from this we must declare our Dissent. Because, how great a number soever be assigned to Atoms, yet must the same be Defined by the Capacity of the World, i. e. of the Universe, as hath been formerly intimated. And, therefore, the common Objection, that if so, the summe of things existent in the World, would be Finite; is what we most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admit, there being no necessity of their Infinity, and a copious syndrome of reasons, that press the Contrary. And as it is unnecessary to Nature: so likewise to her Commentator, the Physiologist; to whom it sufficeth, having exploded this delirium of Infinity, to suppose (1) that the material Principles of the Universe are essentially Figurate, (2) that the species of their figures are incomprehensible, as to their Variety, (3) that the Number of indivisible Particles comprehended under each difference of Figures, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so incomprehensible, but not inexhaustible, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> inconsiderately imagined.</p>

For, He dreamt, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that all Atoms were from all Eternity endowed, by the charter, of their uncreate and independent Essence, with that ingenite Vigour, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Energy, called Gravity, whereby they are variously agitated in the infinite space, without respect to any Centre, or General term of Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence: so as they could never discontinue that natural motion, unless they met and encountred other Atoms, and were by their shock or impulse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected into another course.

this may most conveniently be done in melted Mettals, as particularly in Lead yet floating in the Fusory vessel. To apparence nothing more quiet and calm: yet really no quicksand more internally tumultuated. For, the insensible particles of Fire having penetrated the body of the crucible, or melting pan, and so permeating the pores of the Lead therein contained; because they cannot return back upon the subjacent fire, in regard they are uncessantly impelled by other ingeneous particles continually succeeding on their heels, therefore are they still protruded on, untill they disunite all the particles of the Lead, and by the pernicity and continuation of this their ebullition, hinder them from mutual revinction and coalescence: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make the Lead a fluid, of a compact substance, and so keep it, as long as the succussion of igneous particles is maintained from the fire underneath. During this act of Fusion, think we, with what violence or pernicity the Atoms of Fire are agitated up and down, from one side to another, in the small inanities interspersed among the particles of the Lead; otherwise they could not dissolve the compact tenour thereof, and change their posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions so as to introduce manifest Fluidity: and, since every particle of the Lead, suffers as many various concussions, repercussions, and repeated vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations, as every particle of Fire; how great must be the Commotion on both sides, notwithstanding the seeming quiet in the surface of the Lead?</p>

But, insomuch, as <hi>Atoms,</hi> if we except their three congenial Proprieties, <hi>viz.</hi> Magnitude (which by a general interest, retains to the Category of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) Figure, and Motion; are unanimously assumed to be <hi>Exquales,</hi> seu <hi>Qualitatis Expertes,</hi> absolutely devoid of all Quality: it may seem, at first encounter, to threaten our endeavors with infelicity, and damp Curiosity with despair of satisfaction. And yet this Giant at distance, proves a mere Pygmie at hand. For, the <hi>Nakedness,</hi> or <hi>Unqualifiedness</hi> of Atoms, the point wherein the whole Difficulty appears radicated; to a closer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration must declare it self to be the basis of our exploration, and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably necessary to the Deduction of all sensible Qualities from them, when disposed into Concrete Natures. Because, were any Colour, Odour, &amp;c. essentially inhaerent in Atoms; that Colour, or Odour must be no less intransmutable then the subject of its inhaesion: and that Principles are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>transmutable, is implied in the notion of their being Principles; for it is of the formal reason of Principles, constantly to persever the same in all the transmutations of Concretions. Otherwise, all things would inevitably, by a long succession of Mutations, be reduced to clear Adnihilation. Besides, all things become so much the more Decoloured, by how much the smaller the parts are into which they are divided; as may be most promptly experimented in the pulverization of painted Glass, and pretious stones: which is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration enough, that their Component Particles, in their Elementary and discrete capacity, are perfectly destitute of Colour.

And if it be enquired, why the Aer, when agitated by the wind, or a fan, appears Colder, then when quiet: what solution can be more satisfactory, then this, that by reason of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it doth more deeply penetrate the pores of the skin, and so more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously affect the sense?

                  <p>But we are restrained to an insistence only upon our 3 Heads assumed. As Letters of divers Figures, U, G, A, E, O, when praesented to the eye, carry 3 different species, or aspects; and when pronounced, affect the Ear with as many distinct sounds: exactly so do Atoms, respectively to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety

of their Figures, and determinate Contexture into this or that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, occurring to the Organs of Sight, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, make divers impressions thereupon, or praesent themselves in divers Apparences, or what is tantamount) make divers Qualities. (2) As one and the same Letter diversly posited, is divers to the Sight, and Hearing, as may be instanced in Z, N, y, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, b, d, p, q: so likewise doth one and the same Atom, according to its various positions, or faces, produce various affections in the Organs of Sense. For instance, if the Atome assumed be Pyramidal: when the Cone is obverted to the sensory Organ, it must make a different impression upon it, from that which the Base, when obverted and applyed, will cause. (3) As the same two three or more Letters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their mutation of Site, or Antecession and Consequution, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part divers words to the eye, divers sounds to the ear, and divers things to the mind; as ET, TE, IS, SI, SUM, MUS, ROMA, AMOR, MARO, RAMO, ORAM, MORA, ARMO, &amp;c. so also may two three, or more Atoms, according to their various positions and transpositions, affect the sense with various Apparences, or Qualities. (4) And as Letters, whose variety of Figures exceeds not those of the Alphabet, are sufficient only by the variety of order, to compose so great diversity of words, as are contained in this, or all the Books in the World: so likewise, if there were but 24 diverse Figures competent to Atoms, they alone by variety of Order, or transposition, would suffice to the constitution of as incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible a diversity of Qualities. But, when the diversity of their Figures is incomparably greater: how infinitely more incomprehensible must that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Qualities be, which the possible changes of their Order may produce?</p>

Now, seeing that no one of the three ingredients, in their simple and divided state, do retain to that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Colour in the remotest degree of affinity; from what original can we derive this emergent Redness? Doubtless, only from hence; that the Water doth so penetrate, by a kind of Discussion separate, and educe the smaller particle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them, suffer various refractions and reflections from their several obverted faces, and praesent themselves to the eye in the apparence of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Colour. And to confirm you herein; you need only instead of oyl of Tartar, infuse the like proportion of oyl of Vitriol into the same Tincture of Senna: for, thereupon no such redness at all will arise to the composition. Which can be solved by no better a reason than this; that the oyl of Vitriol wants that virtue of commoving and converting the educed particles of the Senna into such positions and order, as are determinately requisite to the incidence, refraction, and reflection of the rayes of Light to the eye, necessary to the creation of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. On the Contrary, instead of Senna, infuse Rose leaves in the Water, and superaffuse thereto a few drops of the Spirit of Vitriol: and then the infusion shall instantly acquire a purple tincture, or deep scarlet; when from the like or greater quantity of oyl of Tartar instil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, no such event shall ensue. Both which Experiments collated are Demonstration sufficient, that a Red may be produced from sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples absolutely destitute of that gloss, only by a determinate Commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and position of their insensible particles: no otherwise then as the same Feathers in the neck of a Dove, or train of a Peacock, upon a various position of their parts both among themselves, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the incident Light, praesent various Colours to the eye; or as a peice of Changeable Taffaty, according as it is extended, or plicated, appears of two different dyes. The same may also be conceived of the Caerule Tincture caused in White Wine by <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> infused when the Decoction thereof shall remain turbid and subnigri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>

The reason of this Phaenomenon is clearly the same with that of a heap of <hi>Needles</hi>; which when confused in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, transverse, &amp;c. irregular positions, on every side prick the hand

                  <p>By the same reason also may we comprehend, why <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> whose Ingredients in their simple natures are all gentle and innoxious, is so fiery and almost invincible a poyson to all that take it: why the Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> freshly extracted, kindles into a fire, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused with the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar:</hi> why the Filings of <hi>Steel</hi> when irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with Spirit of <hi>Salt,</hi> suffer an aestuation, ebullition, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution into a kind of Gelly, or Paste: with all other mutations sensible, observed by Apothecaries and Chymists, in their Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of Dissimilar natures, from which some third or neutral Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity doth result.</p>

The faithful <hi>Exposition</hi> thereof.</note> Without repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to reason, it may be conceived (1) That in the University of Nature are certain most tenuious Concretions, or subtle Contextures, holding an exquisite analogy to solid bodies. (2) That by these, occurring to the sense; and thence to the Mind, all Vision, and Intellection is made: for they are the same that the Graecian Philosophers call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the Latine <hi>Imagines, Spectra, Simulachra, Effigies,</hi> and most frequently <hi>Species Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onales.</hi> (3) That among all the sundry possible wayes of the generation of these Species Visible, the two primary and most considerable are (1) by their <hi>Direption</hi> from the superficial parts of Compound bodies, (2) by their <hi>Spontaneous Emanation,</hi> and Concretion in the aer; and therefore those of the First sort are to be named <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and those of the second <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. (4) That those Images, which are direpted from the extreams of solid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, do conserve in their separated state the same order and position of parts, that they had during their united. (5) That the ineffable or insuperable <hi>Pernicity,</hi> whereby these Images are transferred through a free space, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon both the <hi>Pernicity</hi> of the Motion of <hi>Atoms,</hi> and their <hi>Ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ity</hi> or <hi>Exility.</hi> For, the motion of Atoms, while continued through the Inane Space, and impeded by no retundent, is supposed to be inexcogitably swift: nor are we to admit, that when an Atom is repercussed by another directly arietating against it, and afterward variously bandied up and down by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tusion of others encountring it; these partial or retuse motions are less swift, i. e. are performed in a space of time more assignable or distinguishable by thought, then if they were extended into one direct, simple, or uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed motion. And for the second Fundament, the extreme Tenuity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; insomuch as these Images are praesumed to be no more but certain superficial Contextures of Atoms: it cannot seem inconsequent, that their Pernicity can know no remora.

Here we are arrested with wonder, either how these great Masters of Learning could derive this wild conceit from their Oracle, <hi>Aristotle</hi>; when introth all they could ground upon his Authority of this kind, is desumable only from these words of his, <hi>Colorem rei Visibilis movere perspicuum actu, quod deinceps oculum moveat:</hi> or how they could judge it consentaneous to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that those Affections should be attributed to meer <hi>Accidents,</hi> which are manifestly Competent only to meer <hi>Substances.</hi> For, to be moved or to be the subject of Local Motion, to be impinged against, and reflected from, or permeate a body; to be dilated, contracted, inverted, &amp;c. cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, nor indeed by a sober man be conceived, without absolute <hi>substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</hi> Some there are, we confess, who tell us, that they kindled this Conceit from sundry scattered sparks blended both in his general Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Motion and Alteration, and particular Enquiries into the nature of Dreams, and Sounds, in his Problems: and these, thereupon, most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently state the whole matter, thus. That the Visible Object doth first Generate a Consimilar Species in the parts of the aer next adjacent; that this Embryon species doth instantly Generate a second in the parts of the aer next to it, that generates a third, that third a fourth, and so they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or spawn each other successively in all points of the Medium, untill the last species produced in the aer contiguous to the Horny membrane of the eye, doth therein produce another; which praesents to the Optick Nerve the exact delineations and pourtraiture of the Protoplast, or Object.

That's if not an impossibility absolute, yet a Difficulty inexplicable; first because no man ever hath, nor can explain the <hi>Modus Propagationis,</hi> the manner of their Propagation: Secondly, since the parts of space intermediate betwixt the Object and the Eye, though but at a small distance removed, are innumerable; and a fresh propagation must be successively in each of those parts; and the space of Time required to each single propagation is a moment; certainly it must be long before the propagation could attain to so small a part of space, as is aequal to one Digit. If so; how many hours would run by, after the Suns Emergency out of an Eclipse, before the light of it would arrive at our eye? since, as the moments, or points of space betwixt it and us are more then innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable; so likewise must the moments, or points of Time, while a fresh spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is generated in each point of that vast space, be more then innumerable: and yet we have the Demonstration of the most Scientifick of our senses, that the light of the Sun is darted through that immense space, in one single moment.

(7) If Visible Species con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing of Matter; how can they with such insuperable Velocity be projected on a speculary body, and recoyl back from it to so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as is commonly observed, even in the Repercussion, or rather Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of a Species from a Concave Glass: How consist of Various Parts, and conserve the order and position of them invariate, and the Colours of each clearly inconfused, through the interval of the Medium?

For, having supposed, that one inch of a Wax Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle may suffice to maintain its flame, for the space of an hour: let us thus reason. Since the Diminution of that inch, perpendicularly erected, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant, i. e. that there is no distinguishable moment of time, wherein there is not a distinct round of Wax taken off the upper part thereof, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predatory activity of the flame: how many must the Round Films of Wax be, that are successively direpted? Certainly, as many as there are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable points, or parts in the 24 part of the Aequator, or ambite of the Primum Mobile, successively interjacent toward the Meridian. And if, in stead of that vast Heaven, the Primum Mobile, you think it more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to assume the Terrestrial Globe (whose Magnitude, in comparison of the other, amounts not above a point) observe what may be thence inferred. Since, according to the supputation of <hi>Snellius</hi> and <hi>Gassendus,</hi> the ambite of the Earth is commensurable by 26255 Italian miles; and the 24 part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of makes 1094 miles, and so 1094000 paces, and so 5470000 feet, each whereof is again subdivisible into 1000 sensible parts: it follows, that as the product, or whole number of these parts in the 24 part of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Globe Terrestrial ariseth to 5470000000; so likewise must the distinct membranules of Wax successive derepted from the inch of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the space of an hour fulfil the same high number of 5470000000.

Now if we consider, how Crass the Emanation of an Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, or an odorous Anathymiasis, is comparatively to the substance of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Species (for no meaner a Philosopher then <hi>Gassendus,</hi> whose name sounds all the Liberall Sciences, hath conceived; that the Visible Images effluxing from an Apple in a whole year, if all cast into one bulk, would not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55028:88"/>
exceed that of the odorous vapour exhaled from it in one moment) we shall not gainsay, but a solid Body may constantly maintain an Emanation of its Images Visible, for many hundreds of years, from its superficial parts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any sensible abatement of Quantity, or variation of Figure. To which we shall superadd only this; that should we allow these substantial Effluxes, that are supposed to constitute the Visible Species, to amount in many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, to a mass deprehensible by sense, in case the collection of them all into one were possible: yet would it be so small, as to elude the exactest observation of man; for, who that hath perchance weighed a piece of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or Gold, and set down the praecise gravity thereof in his life time, can obtain a parrol from the grave and return to complete his experiment; after the deflux of so many Ages, as are required to fulfill the sensibility of its mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noration?</p>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> the PRODUCTION of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Visible; <hi>Epicurus</hi> Text may be fully illustrated by this Exposition. That a solid Body, so long as environed with a rare or permeable space, may be conceived without Alogie, freely to emit its Images: because it hath Atoms ready in the superfice, that being actuated by their coessential mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty, uncessantly attempt their Emancipation, or Abduction; and those so exile, that the Ambient cannot impede their Emanation. (2) That in regard they conserve the Delineations both of the Depressed and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts in the superfice of the Antitype, or Object, after their Efflux therefrom: therefore do the Images deceding from it become Configurate of Atoms cohaerently exhaling in the same Order and Position that they held among themselves, during their Contiguity, or Adhaesion. Which also satisfies for the praesumed meer superficiality, i. e. <hi>Improfundity</hi> of the species: because it is deraded only from the Extremities of the Object. (3) That, forasmuch as no Cause can be alledged, why the particles of the Image should, in their progress through a pervious medium to considerable distance, be deturbed or discomposed from that Contexture, or order and situation, which they obtained from the Cortex or outward Film of their solid original: therefore do they invariately hold the same Configuration, untill their arrival at the eye. Which to familiarize, we are to reflect upon a position or two formerly conceded, viz. that Atoms are, by the impulse of their ingenite Motion, variously agitated even in Concretions most compact; and yet cannot without difficulty expede themselves from the Interior or Central parts, because of their mutual Revinction, or Complication: but for those in the Exterior or superficial parts, they may, upon the least evolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion disingage themselves, having no Atoms without to depress, but many within to express or impel them. (4) That, since the Motion of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, when at liberty to pursue the Tendency of their Motive Faculty, is <hi>Aequivelox:</hi> hence is it, that those Atoms which exhale from the Cavities or Deprest parts of the superficies of any Concretion, and those which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale from the Prominencies, or Eminent Parts, are transferred together in that order, that they touch not, nor crowd each other, but observe the same distance and decorum, that they had in their Contiguity to, and immediate separation from the superficies. So that the Antecedent Atoms cannot be overtaken, or praevented by the Consequent: nor those farther outstrip these, then at the first start. (5) That the Emanation of Visible Images is <hi>Continent,</hi> i. e. that one succeeds on the heels of another, <hi>jugi quodam Fluo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> in a continued stream more swiftly then that thought can distinguish any
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55028:89"/>
intermediate distance. So that, as in the Exsilition of Water from the Cock of a Cistern perpetually supplied by a Fountain, the parts thereof so closely succede each other, as to make one Continued stream, without any interruption observable: are we to conceive the Efflux of Images to be so Continent, that the Consequent press upon the neck of the Antecedent so contiguously, as the Eye can deprehend no Discontinuity, nor the Mind discern any Interstice in their Flux. And this ushers us to the reason, why <hi>Apuleius,</hi> discoursing in the Dialect of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> saith, <hi>Profectas à nobis Imagines, velut quasdam exuvias jugifluore manare.</hi> (6) And lastly, that a Visible Image doth not so constantly retain its Figure, and Colours, as not to be subject to Mutilation and Confusion, if the interval betwixt its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and the eye be immoderately large: as may be exemplified in the species of a square Tower, which by a long trajection through the aer, hath its Angles retused, so that it enters the eye in a Cylindrical Figure.

                  <p>We confess, that <hi>Epicurus</hi> supposition, of the spontaneous Evolution and consequent Avolation of Atoms from the extremes of solid Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; is not alone extensible to the solution of this Difficulty: and therefore
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55028:89"/>
we must lengthen it out with that consentaneous Position of <hi>Gassendus (de apparente magnitudine solis humilis &amp; sublimis, Epist.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 24.) <hi>Lucem sollicitare species,</hi> that <hi>Light</hi> doth sollicite and more then excite the Visible species of Objects, as well by agitating the superficial Atoms of Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as by Carrying them off in the arms of its reflected rayes. For, that Light is intinged not only with Colours, which it pervades, but also with those, which it only superficially toucheth upon, provided the Colorate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be compact enough to repercuss it; all opace and speculary bodies, on which its beams are either trajectly, or reflextly impinged, sensibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate. And though it may be objected, that the sollicitation of <hi>Light</hi> is not necessary to the Dereption, or Abduction of Images Visible; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is generally praesumed, that they continually Emane from Objects, and so as well in the thickest Darkness, as in the Meridian light: it must not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding be confest, that they are unprofitable to Vision, unless when they proceed from an object <hi>Illustrate</hi>; and consequently that they flow hand in hand with the particles of Light reflected from it superfice. Which truly is the reason why the Eye that is posited in the dark doth well discern Objects posited in the Light; but that which is in the light hath no percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of objects in the dark.</p>

                        </gap>l, yet not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> that Visible Species are not Emitted from bodies, unless Light strike upon them, and being repercussed, carry their superficial Atoms, which constitute the Visible Species, off from them, in direct lines towards the eye: though He may perhaps want a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, yet not the evidence of Experience and probability, to credit his Paradox. Nor is there, why we should opinion, that only the Primary, or first incident Light is reflected; because Light emaneth from the Lucid, in a continued Fluor, so that the praecedent particles are still contiguously pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by the consequent: and hence is it that Light is capable of repercus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions even to infinity, if solid and impervious bodies could be so disposed, as that the first opposed might repercuss it on the second, the second reflect it to the third, the third to the fourth, &amp;c. successively, so long as the Fluor should be continued, and no Eclipse intervene. For, the reason, why Light, formerly diffused, doth immediately disappear, upon the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any body, that intersects it stream; is really the same with that, wherefore Water exsilient from the Tube of a Cistern, in an arched stream, doth immediately droop and fall perpendicularly, upon the shutting of the Cock: the successive flux of those parts of Water, which, by a close and forceable pressure on the back of the praecedent, maintained the Arcuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the stream, being thereby praevented, and the effluxed committed to the tendency of their Gravity. And the reason, why by the mediation of a small remainder of light, after the intersection of its fluor from the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid fountain, we have an imperfect and obscure discernment of objects; is no more then this: that only a few rayes, here and there one, are incident upon and so reflected from the superfice thereof, having touched upon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a few scattered particles, and left the greater number untoucht; which therefore remain unperceived by the eye, because there wanted Light suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to the illustration of the whole, and so to the Excitement and Emissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a perfect species.</p>

There may you, whether with more delight, or wonder, is not soon determined, behold a spacious Theatre in the vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous aer, adorned with great variety of Scenes, and Catoptrick represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; the Images of Castles, Palaces, and other Buildings of excellent architecture, with sundry ranges of Pillars, praesented according to the rules of Perspective. This Scene withdrawn, upon the sayling by of the Cloud, there succeeds another, wherein, by way of exquisite Landskip, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited spacious Woods, Groves of Cypress, Orchards with variety of trees, but those artificially planted in Uniform rows like a perfect Phalanx, large Meadows, with companies of men, and herds of beasts walking, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and couching upon them: and all these with so great variety of respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Colours, so admirable a commixture of Light and Darkness, and all their motions and gestures counterfeited so to the life, that to draw a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip of equal perfection seems impossible to human industry.</p>
                     <p>It may well be conceived, though not easily exprest,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Art.</hi> 5. Most ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Investiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Causes</hi> thereof.</note> how much this Parastatical Phantasm (which the Inhabitants of Rhegium call <hi>Morgana</hi>) hath excruciated the greatest Wits of <hi>Italy,</hi> while they laboured to explore a reason for the apparence of such things in the Cloud, as were not found either on the shore, or adjacent fields. This much encreased the ardor of Curiosity in me, so that crossing over from Messana to Rhegium, at the usual time of the Apparition, I examined all the Circumstances thereof, together with the situation of the place, the nature and propriety of the soyl, and the constitution of the vapours arising from the Sea: and examining my obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations by Physical and Optical reasons, I soon detected the Causes of the whole Phaenomenon. First I observed the Mountain called Tinna, on the Sicilian side, directly confronting Rhegium, to run along in a duskish obscure tract upon Pelorus; and the shores subjacent, as also the bottom of the Sea, to be covered with shining sand, being the fragments of <hi>Selenites, Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and other <hi>pellucid</hi> Concretions, devolved from the eminent parts of the land, the contiguous Hills, that are richly fraught with veins of those Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Then I observed that these translucid sands, being, together with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors from the Sea and Shore, exhaled into the aer, by the intense fervor of the Sun; did coalesce into a Cloud, in all points respondent to a perfect Polyedrical, or Multangular Looking-glass: the various superficies of the resplendent Granules, making a multiplication of the species; and that these, being opacated behind by crass and impervious vapours, directly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Mountains, did make reflection of the various Images of objects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective to their various positions to the eye. The several Rows of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the aereal Scene are caused by one single Pillar, erected on the Shore; for being by a manifold reflection from the various superficies of the tralu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent particles, opacated on the hinder part by dense Vapours, in the specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Meteor, it is multiplyed even to infinity. No otherwise then as one single Image, posited betwixt two polyedrical Looking-glasses, confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55028:91"/>
disposed, is so often repercussed or reflected from superfice to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that it exhibiteth to the eye almost an infinite multitude of Images ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly consimilar. Thus also doth one man standing on the shore, become a whole Army in the Cloud; one Beast, a whole Herd, and one Tree a thick-set Grove. As for the vanishing of this first Scene, and the succession of a second, adorned with the representations of Castles, and other magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent structures; the Cause hereof is this: since the eye of the Spectator hath its sight variously terminated in the several speculary superficies of the Cloud, that is in perpetual motion according to the impulse of the Wind; it comes to pass, that according to the rules of the Angles of Incidence and Reflection, divers Species are beheld under the same constitute Angle, and as the speculary Vapour doth reflect them toward the eye, which divers species are projected from objects conveniently situate; and particularly from the Castle on the ascent towards Rhegium from the place of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
                     <p>Some, perhaps, may judge our affirmation, of the Elevation of those shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Grains of Vitreous Minerals into the aer, by the meer attraction of the Sun; and the Coalition of them there with the Cloud of Vapours: to be too large a morsel, to be swallowed by any throat, but that Cormorant one of Credulity. If so, all we require of them, is only to consider; that Hairs, Straws, grains of Sand, fragments of Wood, and such like Festucous Bodies, are frequently found immured in Hailstones: which doubtless, are sufficient arguments, that those things were first elevated by the beams of the Sun, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyling from the earth, into the middle region of the aer, and there coag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentated with the vapours condensed into a Cloud, and frozen in its descent.</p>

                  <p>For <hi>Sensation in Common,</hi> He defines it to be a simple <hi>Perception,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a certain <hi>Motion,</hi> derived from a body conveniently objected, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, by Impression, to the small Fibres, or Capillary Filaments of a Nerve, and by those, in regard of their Continuity, transmitted to the Tribunal, or Judicatory Seat of the Soul, or Mind (which He supposeth to be the <hi>Glandula Pinealis,</hi> in the centre of the Brain) and there distinctly apprehended, or judged of. So that the Divers Motions imprest upon the slender threads of any Nerve, are sufficient to the Causation of divers perceptions; or, that we may not eclipse his notion by the obscurity of our Expression, that the Impulse, or stroke given to the Nerve, doth, by reason of the Continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its parts, cause another Motion, in all points answerable to the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the External Organ, to be carried quite home to the Throne of the Mind, which instantly makes a respective judgment concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Object, from whence that particular Motion was derived. In a word, that only by the Variety of Strokes given to the External Organ, thence to the filaments of the Nerve annexed thereto, thence to the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence Chamber of the Soul: we are informed of the particular Qualities, and Conditions of every Sensible; the variety of these sensory Motions being dependent on the variety of Qualities in the Object, and the variety of judgments dependent on the variety of Motions communicate.</p>
                  <p>And for the sense of <hi>Seeing,</hi> in <hi>special</hi>; He conceives it to be made, not by the mediation of Images, but of certain <hi>Motions</hi> (whereof the Images are composed) transmitted through the Eye and Optick Nerve to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals of the Brain: praesuming the Visible Image of an Object to be only an exact representation of the motions thereby impressed upon the External Sensorium; and accordingly determining the Reason of the Minds actual Discernment of the Colour, Situation, Distance, Magnitude, and Figure of a Visible, by the Instruments of Sight, to be this. (1) The Light desilient from the adspectable Body, in a direct line, called by the Masters of the Opticks, the Axe of Vision, percusseth the diaphanous fluid Medium, the Aether, or most subtile substance (by Him assumed to extend in a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Fluor through the Universe, and so to maintain an absolute Plenitude, and Continuity of Parts therein.) (2) The Aether thus percussed by the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, serving as a Medium betwixt the Object and the Eye; conveyeth the impression through the outward Membranes and Humors, destined to Refraction, to the Optick Nerve most delicately expansed into the <hi>Retina Tunica,</hi> beyond the Chrystalline. (3) The Motion thus imprest on the outward Extreme of the Optick Nerve, runs along the body of it to the inward Extreme, determined in the substance of the Brain. (4) The Brain receiving the impression, immediately gives notice thereof to its Noble Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,

the Soul; which by the Quality of the stroke judgeth of the Quality of the Striker, or Object. In some proportion like an Exquisite <hi>Musitian,</hi> who by the tone of the sound thereby created, doth judge what Cord in a Virginal was strook, what jack strook that string, and what force the jack was moved withall, whether great, mean, or small, slow or quick, equal or unequal, tense or lax, &amp;c.</p>

For, if the object assumed be polisht <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>; since that apparent Tersness in the surface thereof is introduced by the detrition of its grosser inaequalities by Sand, and that Sand is nothing but a multitude of Polyedrical solid Grains, by the acuteness and hardness of their Angles cutting and derasing the more friable particles of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: it must follow, that each of the grains of Sand must leave an impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its edge, and so that the whole superfice must become scarified by innumerable small incisions, variously decussating and intersecting each other. If <hi>Steel</hi> of a speculary smoothness, such as our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chalybeat Mirrours; since the Tersness thereof is artificial, caused by the affriction of Files, which cut only by the acuteness of their teeth, or lineal inaequalities: it is not easie to admit, that they leave no scratches, or exarations on the surface thereof; and where are many Incisions, each whereof must in Latitude respond to the thickness of the Tooth in the File, that made it, there also must

And, as for Autoptical Evidence; that Marble, Steel, and Glass are unequal in their superfice, is undeniable not only from hence, that a good Engyscope, in a convenient light, doth discover innumerable rugosities and Cavities in the most polisht superfice of either: but also from hence, that Spiders and Flyes do ordinarily run up and down perpendicularly on Venice Glass, which they could not do, if there were not in the surface thereof many small Cavities, or Fastnings for the reception of the Uncinulae, or Hooks of their Feet. To which may also be added, the Humectation of Glass by any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor affused; for, if there were no Fosses and Prominences in the superfice thereof, whereon the Hamous particles of the Liquid might be fastned, it would instantly run off without leaving the least of moisture behind.

This may be verified by a single reflection on the Cause hereof, which is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, or Asperity of the superfice of Bodies, seemingly most polite: for, in respect of that, it is of necessity, that various Rayes, proceeding from the various parts thereof, variously convene in the parts of the Medium; and insomuch as each of those rayes doth represent that particle only, from which it was effused, and no other, in their concurse they cannot but represent other and other parts, according to the respective places or regions of the Medium, in which the Eye is posited, that receives them. However, we shall familiarize it by <hi>Example.</hi> Let two men at once behold a Third, one before, the other behind: and both may be said to behold the same man, but, truly, not the same parts of him; because the eyes of one are obverted to his Anterior, and those of the other to his Posterior parts. Take it yet one note higher. Let the Face of a man be the Object, on which though divers persons gaze at the same time, one on the right a second on the left side, a third confrontingly, a fourth and a fifth obliquely betwixt the other three; and all may be said to have an equal prospect of the face: yet can it not be asserted, that they do all see the same parts thereof, but each a particular part. Whence it may be inferred, that albeit we may allow them all to behold his Fore-head, Eyes, Nose, Cheeks, Mouth, &amp;c. yet can we not allow them all to see the same parts of Forehead, Eyes, Nose, Cheeks, &amp;c. because of their unequal situation, which Causeth that the whole spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies prodient from the face, doth not tend into the whole medium, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to various parts of it, respective to the various faces of the deradiant parts. Moreover, because this praesumed Inaequality is not competent only to the greater parts of the face, such as the Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Chin, &amp;c. but as justly considerable in the very <hi>Skin,</hi> which hath no designable place, wherein are not many smaller and smaller Eminencies and Depressions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible (if not by the Opticks of the body, yet) by the ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Have you not frequently observed, when many Candles were burning together in the same room, how, according to the various interposition of opace bodies, various degrees of Shadows and Light have been diffused into the several quarters of the same? and can you give any better reason of those various Intersections and Decussations of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lights, then this; that the rayes of Light streaming from the diverse Flames, are directly and inconfusedly trajected through the several inane Receptaries of the Aer, respective to the position of each Candle, without reciprocal impediment; the rayes of one, that are projected to the right hand, in no wise impeding the passage of those of another, that are projected to the left, in the same sensible part of the Aer. Exactly so do the rayes of divers Species Visible, in their progress through the aer, pass on in direct and uninterrupted lines, without Confusion: and though they may seem to possess the same sensible part of the medium, yet will not reason allow them to possess the same Insensible particles thereof; in regard the distinct transmission of each clearly demonstrateth, that each possesseth a distinct place.

For, as the whole Hemisphere Visive includes the reason of the whole Visible: so do the parts thereof include the reason of the special Visibles, though situate at unequal distance. And, since, the Hemisphere may be, in respect either of its whole, or parts, more Remote, and more Vicine; hence comes it, that no more Rayes arrive at the Eye from the Remote, than the Vicine: because in the Vicine, indeed, are less or fewer bodies, than in the Remote, but yet the Particles, or Faces of the particles of bodies, that are directly obverted to the Pupil, are more. Which certainly is the Cause, why of two bodies, the one Great, the other Small, the Dimensions seem equal; provided the Great be so remote, as to take up no greater a part of the Visive Hemisphere, than the small: because, in that case, the rayes emanant from it, and in direct lines incident into the pupill of the Eye, are no more then those deradiate from the small, and consequently cannot represent more parts thereof, or exhibit it in larger Dimensions. Whereupon we may conclude that the Visive Faculty doth judge of the Magnitude of Objects, by the proportion that the Image of each holds to the amplitude of the Concave of the Retina Tunica: or, that by how much every special Image shall make a greater part of the General Image, that fills the whole Hemisphere Visive, and so possess a greater part of the Concave of the Retina Tunica; by so much the greater doth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty judge the quantity thereof to be: and <hi>

A Concave Lens, whether Plano-concave, or Concave on both sides, whether it be the segment of a great, or small Circle, projects the Image of an Object, on a paper set at convenient distance from the tube that holds it, Confused and insincere; because it refracts the rayes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of even to Disgregation, so that never uniting again, they are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in divided streams and cause a chaos, or perpetual confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. On the Contrary, a Convex Lens refracts the rayes before divided, even to a Concurse and Union, and so makes that Image Distinct and Ordinate, which at its incidence thereon was confused and inordinate. And so much the more perfect must every Convex Lens be, by how much greater the Sphere is, of which it is a Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For, as <hi>Kircher</hi> well observes (<hi>in Magia parastatica.</hi>) if the Lens be not only a portion of a great sphere, V. Gr. such a one, whose diametre contains twenty or thirty Roman Palms; but hath its own diametre consisting of one, or two palmes: it will represent objects of very large dimensions, with so admirable similitude, as to inform the Visive Faculty of all its Colours, Parts, and other discoverables in it superfice. Of which sort are those excellent Glasses, made by that famous Artist, <hi>Eustachio Divini,</hi> at Rome; by the help whereof the Painters of Italy use to draw the most exquisite Choro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical, Topographical, and Prosopographical Tables, in the World.

                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:55028:98"/>Now, to draw these lines home to the Centre of our problem; since the Rayes of a Visible Image trajected through a <hi>Convex</hi> Perspicil, are so refracted, as to concurr in the Visive Axe: it is a clear consequence, that therefore an object appears both larger in dimensions, and more distinct in parts, when speculated through a Convex Glass, than when lookt upon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Eye; because more of the rayes are, by reason of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity of its extreme obverted to the object, conducted into the Pupil of the Eye, than otherwise would have been. For, whereas some rayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from those points of the object, which make the Centre of the Base of the Visive Pyramid, according to the line of Direction, incurr into the Pupil; others emanant from other parts circumvicine to those central ones, fall into the Iris; others from other parts circumvicine fall upon the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids; and others from others more remote, or nearer to the circumference of the Base of the Pyramid, strike upon the Eyebrows, Nose, Forehead, and other parts of the face: the Convexity of the Glass causeth, that all those rayes, which otherwise would have been terminated on the Iris, eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, brows, nose, forehead, &amp;c. are Refracted, and by refraction deflected from the lines of Direction, so that concurring in the Visive Axe, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pupil of the Eye in one united stream, and so render the Image im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest on the Retina Tunica, more lively and distinct, and encreased by so many parts, as are the rayes superadded to those, which proceed from the parts directly confronting the Pupil. On the Contrary; because an Image trajected through a <hi>Concave</hi> Perspicill, hath its rayes so refracted, that they become more rare and Disgregate: the object must therefore seem less in dimensions, and more confused in parts; because many of those rayes, which according to direct tendency would have insinuated into the Pupill, are diverted upon the Iris, Eyelids, and other circumvicine parts of the face.</p>

The most common Diminutions of Sight, and those that may best expect relief from Dioptrical Aphorisms, and the use of Glasses; are only Two: <hi>Presbytia,</hi> and <hi>Myopia.</hi> The <hi>First,</hi> as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, being most familiar to old men, is (<hi>Visus in perspiciendis object is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquis obscuritas; in remotis verò integrum acumen</hi>) an imperfection of the sight, by reason whereof objects near hand appear obscure and confused, but at more distance, sufficiently clear and distinct. The Cause hereof generally, is the defect of due Convexity on the outside of the Chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Humor; arising either from an Error of the Conformative Faculty in the Contexture of the parts of the Eye, or (and that mostly) from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of part of the Chrystalline Humour by that Marasmus, Old Age: which makes the common Base of the Image Visible to be traje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted so far inwards, as not to be determined precisely in the Centre of the concave of the <hi>Retina Tunica.</hi> And therefore, according to the law of Contrariety, the Cure of this frequent symptome is chiefly, if not only to be hoped from the use of <hi>Convex</hi> Spectacles, which determine the point of Concurse exactly in the Centre of the Retina Tunica; the rayes, by reason of the double Convexity, viz. of the Lens and Chrystalline Humor, being sooner and more vigorously united, in the due place.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Other,</hi> being Contrary to the first, and alwayes <hi>Native,</hi> commonly

named <hi>Purblindness,</hi> Physitians define to be <hi>Obscuritus visus in cernendis rebus distantibus; in propinquis verò integrum acumen:</hi> a Dimness of the sight in the discernment of Objects, unless they be appropinquate to the Eye. The <hi>Causes</hi> hereof generally are either the too spherical Figure of the Chrystalline Humor; or, in the Ductus Ciliares, or small Filaments of the Aranea Tunica (the proper investment of the Chrystalline) a certain ineptitude to that contraction, requisite to the adduction of the Chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line inwards towards the retina tunica, which is necessary to the discernment of objects at distance: either of these Causes making the common Base of the Image to be determined in the Vitrious Humor, and consequently the Image to arrive at the retina tunica, perturbed and confused. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our advice is to all Purblind Persons, that they use <hi>Concave</hi> Spectacles: for such prolong the point of concurse, untill it be convenient, i. e. to the concave of the retina tunica.</p>

                     <p>This may receive both Illustration and Confirmation from this easie <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</hi> Having placed horizontally, in a valley, a plane Looking Glass, of no more then one foot diametre; you may behold therein, at one intuition the Images of the firmament, of the invironing Hills, and all other things circumsituate, and those holding the same magnitude, as when specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated directly, and with the naked eye: and this only because, though the Image in Dimensions exceed not the Area of the Glass, yet is it such, as that together with the things seen, it doth also exhibit the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of each from other. Exactly like a good Landskip, wherein the ingenious Painter doth artificially delude the eye by a proportionate diminution and decurtation of the things praesented, insinuating an opinion of their Distance. And therefore, the Reason, why the Images of many things, as of spacious Fields, embroydered with rowes of Trees, numerous Herds of Cattle, Flocks of Sheep, &amp;c. may at once be received into that narrow window, the Pupill of the eye, of a man standing on an Hill, Tower, or other eminent place, advantageous for prospect: is only this, that to the Speculation of the Hemisphere comprehending all those things, in that determinate magnitude, is required no greater an Image, than to the Speculation of an Hemisphere, whose diametre is commensurable
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55028:99"/>
only by an inch. Since neither more rayes are derived from the one to the Pupil of the Eye, than from the other: nor to the judication of the one to be so much Greater than the other, is ought required, beside an Opinion that one is so much more Distant than the other. And this we conceive a sufficient Demonstration of the Verity of our last <hi>Paradox,</hi> viz. that the Eye sees as much, when it looks on a shilling, or other object of as small dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metre; as when it looks on the greatest Ocean.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55028:99"/>
from a <hi>Comparison of the thing interjacent between the object seen, and the Eye.</hi> For, though that <hi>Comparation</hi> be an act of the <hi>Superior Faculty</hi>; yet is the connexion thereof to the sense, necessary to the making a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning the Distance of the Visible. And, most certainly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do two things at distance seem to be Continued, because they strike the Eye with cohaerent, or contiguous Rayes. Thus doth the top of a Tower, though situate some miles beyond a Hill, yet seem Contiguous to the same, nay to the visible Horizon; and this only because it is speculated by the Mediation of Contiguous Rayes: and the Sun and Moon, both ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and occident, seem to cohaere to the Horizon because though the spaces are immense, that intercede betwixt their Orbs and the Horizon, yet from those spaces doth not so much as one single Raye arrive at the Eye, and those which come to it from the Sun and Moon are contiguous to those which come from the Horizon. And hence is it, that the Tower, Hill, and Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon seem to the sight to be equidistant from the Eye; because no other things are interposed, at least, seen interposed, by the comparison of which, the one may be deprehended more than the other. Besides, the distance of the Horizon it self is not apprehended by any other reason, but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of things interjacent betwixt it and the Eye: for, look how much of Space is possessed valleys and lower grounds interjacent, so much of Space is defalcated from the distance; the sight apprehending all those things to be Contiguous, or Continued, whose Rayes are received into the Eye, as Contiguous, or Continued, none of the spaces interjacent affording one raye. Of which truth <hi>Des Cartes</hi> seems to have had a glimpse, when (<hi>in Dioptrices cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 15.) he conceds; <hi>objectorum, quae intuemur, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneam cognitionem, ipsorum distantiae melius dignoscendae inservire:</hi> that a certain praecognition of the object doth much conduce to the more certain dignotion of its Distance.</p>

(2) Of <hi>Reason</hi>; because of all <hi>Twin Parts</hi> in the body, as Ears, Hands, Leggs, Testicles, &amp;c. one is alwayes more vigorous and perfect, in the performance of its action, than the other.

Bacon. Niceron,</hi> and other the most eminent Professors of the Optiques, <hi>That the Visive Axes of both eyes concurr and unite in the object speculated:</hi> is yet a verity, well worthy our admission, and assertion. For, the Axes of the Eyes are so ordained by Nature, that when one is intended, the other is relaxed, when one is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, the other is idle and unconcerned; nor can they be both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at once, or imployed, though both may be at once relaxed, or unimployed: as is Experimented, when with both eyes open we look on the leaf of a Book; for we then perceive the lines and print thereof, but do not <hi>distinctly</hi> discern the Characters, so as to read one word, till we fix the Axe of one eye thereon; and at that instant we feel a certain suddain sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation, or gentle impulse in the Centre of that eye, arising doubtless from the rushing in of more spirits through the Optick Nerve, for the more efficacious performance of its action. The <hi>Cause</hi> of the impossibility of the intention of both Visive Axes at one object, may be desumed from the <hi>Parallelism</hi> of the <hi>Motion</hi> of the Eyes; which being most evident to sense, gives us just ground to admire, how so many subtle Mathematicians, and exquisite Oculists have not discovered the Coition and Union of the Visive Axes in the object speculated, which they so confidently build upon, to be an absolute Impossibility. For, though man hath two Eyes; yet doth he use but one at once, in the case of <hi>Distinct</hi> inspection, the right eye to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern objects on the right side, and the left to view objects on the left: nor is there more necessity, why he should use both Eyes at once, than both Arms, or Leggs, or Testicles, at once. And for an <hi>Experiment</hi> to assist this Reason; we shall desire you only to look at the top of your own Nose, and you shall soon be convicted, that you cannot discern it with both eyes at once; but the right side with the right eye, and afterward the left side with the left eye: and at the instant of changing the Axe of the first eye, you shall be sensible of that impulse of Spirits, newly mentioned.

                        </gap>, indeed, is it possible, that while your right eye is levelled at the right side of your nose, your left should be levelled at the left side, but on the contrary averted quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rom it: because, the motion of the eyes being <hi>Conjugate,</hi> or <hi>Parallel,</hi> when the Axe of the right eye is converted to the right side of the nose, the Axe of the left must be converted toward the left Ear. And, therefore, since the Visive Axes of both Eyes cannot Concurr and Unite in the Tipp of the Nose; what can remain to persuade, that they must Concurr and unite in the same Letter, or Word in a book, which is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inches more remote than the Nose? And, that you may satisfie your self, that the Visive Axes doe never meet, but run on in a perpetual Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelism, i. e. in direct lines, as far distant each from other, as are the Eyes themselves; having fixed a staff or launce upright in the ground, and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it to the distance of 10 or 20 paces, more or less: look as earnestly as you can, on it, with your right eye, closing your left, and you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to eclipse a certain part of the wall, tree, or other body situate beyond it. Then look on it again with your left eye, closing your right; and you
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55028:100"/>
shall observe it to eclipse another part of the wall: that space being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which is called the Parallaxe. This done, look on it with both eyes open; and if the Axes of both did meet and unite in the staff, as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally supposed, then of necessity would you observe the staff to eclipse ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both parts of the Wall together, or the middle of the Parallaxe: but you shall observe it to do neither, for the middle shall never be eclipsed; but only one of the parts, and that on which you shall fix one of your eyes more intently than the other. This considered, we dare second <hi>Gassendus</hi> in his promise to Gunners, that they shall shoot as right with both eyes open, as only with one: for levelling the mouth of the Peece directly at the mark, with one eye, their other must be wholly unconcerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor is it ought but the tyrannie of Custome, that can make it difficult.</p>

(1) <hi>Visus Perfectissimus,</hi> when we see the smallest (visible) particles of an object, most distinctly: (2) <hi>Perfectus,</hi> when we see an object distinctly enough, in the whole or parts, but apprehend not the particles, or minima visibilia thereof: (3) <hi>Imperfectus,</hi> when besides the object directly obverted to the Pupil of the eye, we also have a glimmering and imperfect perception of other things placed <hi>ad latera,</hi> on the right and left side of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the verity of this Paradox, that we see but with one eye at once, is restrained only to the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> degrees of Sight, and extends not to the <hi>Last.</hi> For, Experience assures, that, as many things circumvicine to the principal object, on which we look only with one eye open, praesent themselves together with it, in a confused and obscure manner: so likewise, when both eyes are open, many things, obliquely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident into each eye, are confusedly, and indistinctly apprehended. So that in confused and Imperfect Vision, it may be truly said, that a man doth see with both eyes at once: but not in Distinct and Perfect.</p>

                        <hi>Art.</hi> 1. A research in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reason of the different Effects of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave</hi> Glasses, as well <hi>Dioptrical,</hi> as <hi>Catoptrical.</hi>
                     </note> we shall here attempt the Conjectural Solution of those so much admired Effects of <hi>Convex</hi> and <hi>Concave</hi> Glasses; that is, Why the Rayes of Light, and together with them those substantial Effluxes, that essence the Visible Images of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, being trajected through a Convex Glass, or reflected from a Concave, are <hi>Congregated</hi> into a perpendicular stream: and likewise, why the Rayes of Light, being trajected through a Concave, or reflexed from a Convex, are <hi>Disgregated</hi> from a perpendicular radius.</p>
                  <p>First, insomuch as Glass, of the most polite and equal superfice is full of insensible <hi>Pores,</hi> or Perforations, and solid impervious <hi>Granules,</hi> alternately interspersed; we may upon consequence conceive, that each of those solid Granules is as it were a certain <hi>Monticle,</hi> or small Hillock, having a small top, and small sides circularly declining toward those little Valleys, the Pores.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55028:101"/>
This conceded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if a Glass, whose superfice is <hi>Plane,</hi> be obverted to the Sun, since the small Pores thereof tend from one superfice to the other in direct and parallel lines, for the most part; it must be, that all the Rayes incident into the Pores, pass through in direct and parallel lines, into the Aer beyond it: and so can be neither Congregated, nor Disgregated, but must constantly pursue the same direct course, which they continued from the body of the Sun, to their incidence on the surface of the Glass. But if the Extream of the Glass, respecting the Sun, be of a <hi>Convex</hi> figure; then, because one Pore (conceive it to be the Central one) is directly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Sun, and all the others have their apertures more oblique and, pointing another way; therefore it comes to pass, that one ray, falling into the directly obverted pore, is directly trajected through the same, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth on into the aer beyond it in a direct line; but another ray, falling on the side of the Hillock next adjacent to the right pore, is thereby Refracted and Deflected, so that it progresseth not forward in a line parallel to the directly trajected ray, but being conjoined to it, passeth on in an united stream with it. And necessary it is, that the Angle of its Refraction be by so much the more <hi>obtuse,</hi> by how much nearer the point of the Hillock, from which it was refracted, is to the direct or perpendicularly transmitted ray; and, on the contrary, by so much the more <hi>Acute,</hi> by how much the more remote: because <hi>There</hi> the ray falls more deeply into the obvious pore, and strikes lower on the adjacent Hillock, whose Protuberancy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth less Deflect it; but <hi>Here</hi> the ray falls higher on the side of the Hillock, and so by the Protuberancie, or Devexity thereof is more deflected. But if the Extreme of the Glass confronting the Sun, be of a <hi>Concave</hi> figure; in that case, because one pore being directly open, others have their apertures more obliquely respecting the Sun, it comes to pass, that the ray falling into the direct pore, is directly trajected, and passeth through the aer in a perpendicular; but another ray falling on the side of the next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Hillock, is thereby refracted and deflected, so that it doth not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue its progress in a line parallel to the directly-transient ray, but is abduced from it, and that so much the more, by how much the farther it passeth beyond the Glass. And necessary it is, that the Angle of its Refraction be also so much the more obtuse, by how much nearer the point of its incidence on the side of the Hillock, is to the Aperture of the Direct pore; because it falls deeper into it, and strikes lower on the devex side of the Hillock: and on the contrary, so much the more Acute, by how much more remote its point of incidence is to the Aperture of the Direct pore; for the contrary respect. And this is the summ of our Conjecture, touching the reasons of the different Trajection of Rayes through Convex and Concave Glasses.</p>
                  <p>As for the other part of our Conception, concerning <hi>Reflexed</hi> Rayes; if the Glass obverted to the Sun be <hi>Plane</hi> in it superfice, then, because all the Topps of the solid and impervious <hi>Hillocks,</hi> are directly obverted to the Sun, therefore must it be, that all the rayes incident upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Reflected</hi> back again toward the Sun, if not in the same, yet at least in Contiguous lines. But if the face of the Glass obverted to the Sun, be <hi>Convex</hi>; then, because the topp of one Hillock is directly obverted, and those of others obliquely respecting the Sun; it comes to pass, that one ray being directly Reflected, the others are reflected obliquely in lines quite different: and this in an Angle by so much more Acute, by how much
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55028:101"/>
nearer the Topps of the obliquely respecting Hillocks are to that of the directly respecting one; and by so much the more obtuse, by how much the more Remote. And, if the side of the Glass turned toward the Sun, be <hi>Concave</hi>; because the Top, of one Hillock is directly, and those of others obliquely obverted to the Sun; hence comes it, that the Ray incident on the directly-obverted one, is directly Reflected, and those that fall on the topps of the obliquely-obverted ones, are accordingly reflected obliquely, toward the Directly reflected; so that at a certain distance they all Concurr and Unite with it in that point, called the <hi>Term of Concurse</hi>: and this in an Angle so much more Acute, by how much nearer the Topps of the obliquely-reflecting Hillocks are to that of the Directly-reflecting one; and <hi>è contra.</hi>

If you admit the Image of a man, or any thing else, through a small perforation of the wall, into an obscure chamber, and fix a Convex Lens in the perforation, with the Convex side toward the Light; you shall, admoving your eye thereto, at Convenient distance, observe the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Image to be <hi>Amplified:</hi> but, receiving the Image on a sheet of white Paper, posited where your Eye was, you shall perceive it to be <hi>Minorated:</hi> the Contrary Effect arising from a <hi>Concave Lens,</hi> posited in the hole, with its Concave side toward the Light.

Some affirming the design of Nature therein to be, that the Chrystalline being veyled over with this obscure parget, might have its own splendor more intense by Congregation: because, according to the position of <hi>Alhazen (lib.</hi> 1. <hi>propos.</hi> 33.) as a small light in a dark obscure place is better perceptible, as diffusing a brighter lustre, than in a wide, luminous place; and consequently makes the circumjacent parts more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: so doth the internal splendour of the Chrystalline become more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious, because the inner circumference of the whole Uvea Tunica is lined with this footy matter, the rayes deradiating from it by reflection from the opposite opacity of the Membrane, becoming reassembled and united in a more vigorous lustre. <hi>Others</hi> conceiving the intention of it to be, the Recreation or Reflection of the Visive Spirits; because when ever the Chrystalline is offended, or rather the Amphiblestroides, with too ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement a Light, we use, for present remedy, to close our eyes, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits recoyling upon the Chrystalline from the natural darkness of this Coat, are reassembled, and so refreshed. And <hi>others</hi> contesting that the only use of it is, the Interception of Light; for, since the Pupil, or anterior per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foration of the Uvea Tunica, is the only Aperture, or portal framed for the intromission of the Visible Images, and there ought to be no other passage, whereat Light might intrude it self into the concave of the Eye: what could
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55028:104"/>
wise Nature have thought on more convenient to the Exclusion of unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary light, than the interjection of this sable Curtain? Experience evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that nothing intercepts and shuts out Light, than opace Bodies inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. These, indeed, are ingenious and plausible Conceits, but if truth be to be preferred to Acuteness; we may determine, that the only and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per use of this Atramentous or sooty Blackness is, that the Rayes of Light, incident on the Concave of the Amphiblestroides, (GHI) and thence resilient back to the Concave of the Uvea Tunica, might by the Blackness of its lining be extinguisht, i. e. absolutely terminated: lest thence again Reflected to the Amphiblestroides, they might perturb the Visible Image, and consequently the sight.

For, in the Chrystalline,<note n="8" place="margin">The <hi>Chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi>
                     </note> by reason of its greater both Density and Convexity, the rays of the species are more strongly Refracted and more closely United, than in any other part of the Eye: which justifieth their opinion who make it the Primary Medium of Vision. Because, as a Convex Lens posited in a hole of the wall, admits the species into an obscure room and also collect the rayes of it: so doth the Chrystalline both admit and congregate them. And because it is Diaphanous, therefore are not the species terminated therein, as <hi>Galen,</hi> and after him most <hi>Anatomists</hi> have dreamt: since otherwise no reason can be alledged, why the species should not be as well terminated in the Horny Membrane, the Vitreous, or Aqueous Humour.

                     </note> because the species are therein Terminated, as in an opace body. <hi>Scheinerus</hi> opinioned, that the species, which otherwise, by reason of several refractions before their arrival at the Chrystalline, would have been exhibited in <hi>Reverse</hi> positions, are therein refracted, and Rectified.

Which that we may clearly understand, let us consult the great <hi>Scaliger,</hi> who (<hi>in Exercit.</hi> 325.) thus concisely Comments thereupon. If the Perspicuum (saith He) suffer condensation so far as to the amission of its Transparency, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the trajection of the Visible Species; it instantly becomes Colorate, and ought to be accounted Terminate, because it bounds or limits the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive rayes. Wherefore, the law of Consequence injoineth, that we explore the Essence of Colours, in the Gradual Termination of the Diaphanum; and derive that Termination (1) from meer <hi>Condensation,</hi> without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of any other thing to the Diaphanum; as may be instanced in the <hi>Starrs,</hi> for they become visible, though of a Lucid nature, only because they are of a Compact or Dense contexture.

The same likewise is to be understood of Aer and Water; for, those three Elements are all perspicuous, though in divers degrees: Fire being most perspicuous, Aer possessing the next degree, and Water coming behind them both, as seeming to be a Medium betwixt Perspicuity and Opacity. And, therefore, from the admission of the parts of that Opace Element, Earth, to any other of the three Diaphanous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one or other Colour among the many must arise. But, the Perspicuum passeth first into Whiteness, and therefore is it that Perspicuity, Light and Whiteness, are of the same nature, cozen Germans once removed, and discriminate only by Degrees: as, on the contrary, an Opacum, Darkness, and Blackness are also cognate. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly,</hi> that <hi>Epicurus,</hi> in this text, according to the litteral importance thereof, and the Exposition of <hi>Gassendus,</hi> his most judicious and copious Interpreter, had this and no other meaning. That in the Extrems, or superficies of all Concretions, there are such certain Coordinations and Dispositions of their component particles (which, according to our <hi>First Assumption</hi> in the immediately praecedent Chapter, borrowed from the incomparable <hi>Bullial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> are never contexed without more or less of Inaequality.) as that, upon the incidence of Light, they do and must exhibit some certain Colour, or other, respective to their determinate Reflection and Refraction, or Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the rayes thereof, and the position of the Eye, that receives them. That from these superficial Extancies and and Cavities of bodies are emitted those substantial Effluviaes, constituting the visible Image; which striking upon the primary Organ of Vision, in a certain Order and Position of particles, causeth therein a sensation, or Perception of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Colour. But, that these Colours are not really Cohaerent to those superficial particles, so as not to be actually separated from them, upon the abscedence of Light: and, consequently that Colours have no Existence in the Dark. Moreover, that the substance of Light, or the minute par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, of which its beams consist, are necessarily to be superadded to the superficial particles of bodies, as the Complement, nay the Principal part of Colour: as may be inferred from these words of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> registred by <hi>Plutarch</hi> (1. <hi>advers.

                  </p>
                  <p>But, First, to praevent the excess of your wonder, at that so Paradoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal assertion of his, <hi>That there are no Colours in the dark,</hi> or that all colours vanish upon the Amotion or defection of Light; we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that it is one thing to be <hi>Actually</hi> Colorate, and another to be only <hi>Potentially,</hi> or to have a <hi>Disposition</hi> to exhibit this or that particular Colour, upon the access of the Producent, Light. For, as the several <hi>Pipes</hi> in an Organ, though in themselves all aequally <hi>Insonorous,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of sound, have yet an equal Disposition, in respect of their Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to yield a sound, upon the inflation of Wind from the Bellows; and as the seeds of <hi>Tulips,</hi> in Winter, are all equally <hi>Exflorous,</hi> or destitute of Flowers, but yet contain, in their seminal Virtues, a Capacity or Disposition to emit various coloured flowers, upon the access of fructify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat and moysture, in the Spring: so likewise may all Bodies, though we allow them to be actually Excolor, in the Dark, yet retain a Capacity, whereby each one, upon the access and sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Light, may appear clad in this or that particular Colour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective to the determinate Ordination and Position of its superficial particles.</p>

A familiar <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi> atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof.</note>To inculcate this yet farther, we desire you to take a yard of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Cloth, and having extended it in an uniform light, observe most exactly the Colour, which in all parts it bears. Then extend one half thereof in a primary light, <hi>i. e.</hi> the immediately incident, or direct rayes of the Sun; and the other in a secondary, or once reflected light: and then, though perhaps, through the praeoccupation of your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you may apprehend it to be all of one colour; yet if you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a skilful Painter to pourtray it to the life, as it is then posited, He must represent the Directly illuminate half, with one Colour, viz. a bright and lightsome Red, and the Reflexly illuminate half, with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, i. e. with a Duskish or more obscure Red; or shamefully betray his ignorance of <hi>Albert Durers</hi> excellent Rules of shadowing, and fall much short of your Expectation. This done, gently move the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Cloth through various degrees of Light and shadow: and you shall confess the Colour thereof to be varied upon each remove; respondent to the degree of Light striking thereupon. Afterward, fold the Cloth, as Boyes do paper for Lanterns, or lay it in waves or pleights of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent magnitude; and you shall admire the variety of Colours apparent thereon: the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sables, as no colour drawn on a picture can counterfeit it to the life, but the deadest Black. Your <hi>Sense</hi> thus satisfied, be pleased to exercise your <hi>Reason</hi> a while with the same Example; and demand of your self, <hi>Whether any one of all those different Colours can be really inhaerent in the Cloth?</hi> If you pitch upon the Scarlet, as the most likely and proper; then must you either confess that Colour not to be really inhaerent, since it may, in less than a moment, be varied into sables, only by an interception of Light: or admit that all the other Colours exhibited, are aequally inhaerent; which is more, we praesume, then you will easily allow. And, therefore, you may attain more of satisfaction, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that indeed no one of all those Colours is really so inhaerent in the cloth, as to remain the same in the absence of Light; but, that the superficial particles of the Cloth have inhaerent in them (<hi>ratione Figurae, Coordinationis &amp; Positus</hi>) such a <hi>Disposition,</hi> as that in one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Light it must present to the eye such a particular colour; in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree, a second gradually different from that; in another, a third discriminate from both, until it arrive at perfect obscurity, or Black.</p>
                  <p>And, if your Assent hereto be obstructed by this DOUBT,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Why that Cloth doth most constantly appear Red,</hi> rather then Green, Blew, Willow, &amp;c. you may easily expede it, by admitting, that the Reason consisteth only herein, that the Cloth is tincted in a certain Liquor, whose minute Particles are, by reason of their Figure, Ordination and Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, comparate or adapted to Refract and Reflect the incident rayes of Light, in such a manner, temperation, or modification, as must present to the eye, the species of such a Colour, viz. Scarlet, rather then a Green, Blew, Willow, or any other. For, every man well knows, that in the Liquor, or Tincture, wherein the Cloth was dyed, there were several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients dissolved into minute p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, therefore of pure necessity it must be, that, according to the determinate Figures and Contexture of those adhaerent Granules, to the villous particles in the superfice of the Cloth, such a determinate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction and Reflection of the rayes of Light should be caused; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently such a determinate species of Colour, and no other, result there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>

To reason, therefore, is it consonant that all Bodies, whose natural Hew is <hi>Black,</hi> are composed of such insensible particles, whose surfaces are <hi>scabrous,</hi> rough, or craggy, and their Contexture so <hi>Rare,</hi> or loose, as that they rather <hi>imbibe,</hi> or swallow up the incident rayes of light, than reflect them outwardly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the eye of the Spectator.

Which may be evidenced even from hence, that Colors are not by Prismes appinged on bodies, but in their <hi>Margines</hi> or Extremes, there where is not only the general Commissure of Light and Shadows; but also an <hi>Inaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of superfice: which, by how much the more scabrous or rough, by so much the more are the Colours apparent thereon, ampliated in Latitude. For, since there is no superfice, however smooth and equal to the sense, devoid of many <hi>Extancies</hi> and <hi>Cavities</hi>; as we have more then once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly declared: it is of necessity, that betwixt the confronting sides of the Extancies, reflecting the rays of light hither and thither, there should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedent small shadows, in the interjacent Cavities, from which no light is reflected. And hence is it, that in an object speculated through a Prism, the Caerule colour appears so much the more Dense and lively, by how much the nearer to the limbus, or Extreme of the Object it is appinged; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, in that place, is the greater proportion of small shadows: and <hi>è contra,</hi> so much more Dilute and Pale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by how much farther it recedeth from the

Margin, insomuch that it degenerates, or dwindles at last into weak Sea-Green, or Willow, in its inmost part; because, in that place is the greater proportion of Light.

And what we affirm of Scarlet and Violet, may also, with no less Congruity, be accommodated to Yellow and Sea-Green; allowing the same proportion and modification of Light and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in them as in that part of the superfice of any other body, on which the Prism doth appinge them: and in like manner to all other Colorate objects, whose Tinctures bear any Affinity to either of these four specified, or arise from the Complexion of any two or more of them.</p>

The <hi>Solution</hi> of the <hi>Former:</hi> with a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conjecture of the Cause of the <hi>Blew,</hi> apparent in the Concave of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</note>Touching the Former, we shall adventure to desume the Solution thereof meerly from the <hi>Figure</hi> of the Prisme, and determine the Reason on this only; that the Rayes of Light arriving at the <hi>Base</hi> of the Triangle, are trajected through it by a longer tract or way, than those arriving at or nearer to the <hi>Top</hi> thereof: and therefore, the Glass being in that part most crass, there must be more impervious particles obsistent to the Rayes of Light; each one whereof reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing its raye back again into the medium from the Glass, causeth that the number of shadowes is multiplyed in that part of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which the Base of the Triangle directly respecteth; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently produceth a Caerule Tincture thereon. Such as that, not only by vulgar, but many transcendently learned Heads adscribed to the <hi>Firmament</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which yet belongs rather to that vast (many have said infinite) <hi>Space</hi> betwixt it and our Terrestrial Globe, being caused by the rayes of the Coelestial Lamps, from swarms of minute bodies interposed, thinly reflected toward our eyes: For, each of those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervious particles swarming in that immense space, must repercuse a ray of Light deradiated from above, and so by multiplying the number of shadows, make the Firmament (which otherwise, according to probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, would wear the mourning livery of Midnight) appear totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in an <hi>Azure</hi> mantle.</p>
                  <p>This, though meer Conjecture (and, indeed, the subject is too sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime to admit of other than conjecture, since St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath left us no observation concerning it, in his rapture up into the third Heaven, and the design of the <hi>Ganzaes</hi> is desperate) hath in it somewhat more of reason, then that confident conceipt of <hi>Athanas.

                     <q>that the Providence of the Creator chose this Azure Tincture to invest the Firmament withal, as the middle colour between the two Extreams, White and Black, that so our sight might not, when we speculate that universal Canopy, be either perstringed with the excessive lustre of the one, nor terminated by the absolute opacity of the other.</q>
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if the natural Colour of the Firmament were <hi>Azure,</hi> as He prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes; then would it, by reason of the vast Space betwixt it and our sight, and the repercussion of the greatest part of the rayes of Light, from our eye, by those Myriads of Myriads of Myriads of small bodies replenishing that intermediate Space, necessarily appear of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colour: the experience of Sea-men assuring, that all Colours, (White and that of pure Flame, retaining to Whiteness, only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) lose themselves in long trajection through the medium, and that even Land, which is but few degrees removed from Opacity, appears to the first discovery like a blewish Cloud lying level to the Horizon. It being certain, therefore, that by how much the farther any Colour recedeth from Whiteness, by so much the less way it is visible (which the Graecian intimates in the word, <gap reason="foreign">

dissonant to reason to conceive, that the natural Colour of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be Azure, since it so appears to us; and that it is rather Opace, because it appears Azure, when illustrate by the reflected Light of the Coelestial Luminaries.</p>
                  <p>Again, because the rayes of Light, incident on the <hi>Top</hi> of the Prism, are trajected through it by a shorter cut, or passage, than those incident on the Base; and so meet with fewer impervious and retundent particles, the Glass being in that part thinnest: therefore is the number of shadows much less in that part of the object, which respecteth the Cone or Top of the Triangle, than in that, which confronts the Base; and those few sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows which remain undiminisht, being commixt with a greater number of lines of light, are transformed into the species of a <hi>Vermillion Red.</hi> Such as that daily observed in the impure <hi>Flame</hi> of our Culinary Fires; which having many particles of Fuligenous Exhalations commixt with its pure luminous particles, that continuedly ascending, avert as many rayes of light from the eye of the Spectator, and so in some degree obnubulate it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: doth therefore put on the semblance of Redness.

                  <p>However this may be disputed, yet is it warrantable to conceive, that the superficial Particles of all Bodies, clad in either of these Liveries, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million and Caerule, may have in their Contexture obtained such a Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to reflect Light permixt with small shadows, in that definite Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, or Modification, in which it usually arrives at the eye, after its Trajection through a Prism; when it thereupon impresseth the sense of a Vermillion, or Caerule.</p>
                  <p>As for the Enodation of the <hi>Later Difficulty,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     </note> it is comprehended in the Reasons of the Former. For, it being certain, that the Vermillion projected by a Prisme, doth consist of a greater proportion of Light min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with a less of Shadows, and the Caerule, on the contrary, of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proportion of shadows interspersed among the lines of a less Light; and as certain, that the Vermillion appeareth on that side of the Prisme, where the Light is more copious, as therein meeting with fewer retundent impervious particles, in the substance of the Glass; and the Caerule in that part, where the Light is diminished, as meeting with more impervious particles, and being by them repercussed: it must inevitably follow thereupon, that, if an <hi>opacous</hi> body be posited within the bounds of this light, so that the light may fall on each side thereof, and as it were fringe it; a symptome quite contrary to the former shall evene, i. e. the Vermillion will appear on that side of the species, which is over against the Caerule, and the Caerule will be transposed to that side of the species, which confronteth the Vermillion. This is easily <hi>Experimented</hi> with a piece of narrow black Ribbon affixt longwise to either side of the Prisme. For, in that case, the light is bipartited into two Borders, or Fringes, the opace part veyled by the Ribbon on each side environed with light, and each border of light environed with two shadows; or, more plainly, between each border of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows conterminate to each extreme of Light, trajected through the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55028:115"/>
unopacate parts of the Glass: and, therefore, in the commissure of each of the two lights with each of the conterminous shadows, there must be Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million on one side, and Caerule on the other.</p>
                  <p>Now to drive this home to the head, the solution of the present Problem; the <hi>Reason</hi> why, when the light of a Candle is trajected through a Prism, on a White paper or Wall, posited at convenient distance beyond it, and there transformed into these two luminous Colours, Vermillion and Caerule, if you put your eye in that place of the Paper or Wall, whereon the Vermil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion shines, you shall perceive only the Caerule in the Glass, and <hi>è contra:</hi> we say, the Reason of this alteration of site in the Colours seems to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that the circumstant Aer about the flame of the Candle being opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, and so serving in stead of two Blacks to environ the borders of light, causeth that side of the Candle, which is seen through the thicker part of the Glass, to appear Blew; and that which is seen through the thinner, to appear Red; according to the constant Phaenomenon in Prismes. But, if the species be beheld by Reflection from any illustrate and repercussing Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, such as the paper, or wall, then must the series or method of the borders of light and shadow be inverted, for the reason immediately praecedent, and consequently, the situation of the Colours, emergent from their various contemperations, be also inverted.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55028:116"/>
through the aer; is only this, that the particles of Water first exsilient, upon the remove of the stopple or obstacle, are so closely and contiguously pursued by other particles immediately following, and those again by others indesinently emanant, that they are impelled forward and driven on with such rapidity, as overcomes their natural propensity to direct descent, by reason of their Gravity, and carries them in a tense line from the vent so long as their impulse is superior to that of their Gravity; which encreasing more and more in each degree of distance, doth at length become victor over the force of the Motion, and praecipitate them downright. And as this gradual Tensity, or Rigidity of a stream of Water ariseth to it only from the Pressure or impulse of the Antecedent particles by the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, in an uninterrupted succession: so may we conceeve, that a Ray of Light, or Wand (many of our Modern and most discovering Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call a stream of Light, <hi>Virgula Lucis</hi>; and that by an unstrained Metaphor.) consisting of many rayes seemingly united, such as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve shining in a room through some hole in the Window, or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; doth therefore become in a manner <hi>Tense,</hi> or <hi>Direct,</hi> only because the particles first emanant from the Lucid Fountain are so urged and prest on by the subsequent, and those again by others, with equal pernicity, that they cannot deflect from a direct line, or obey the inclination of their Gravity, until some solid Body, interposed, cut off the fluor, by interrupting the succession, and then the Tensity, or Pressure ceasing, the Particles become incontiguous and disappear: as is observable, upon closing the inlet, through which a stream of Light is admitted into an otherwise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not (as is vulgarly concluded) that a <hi>Reflex</hi> ray is less Tense, or the successive pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of its particles less violent or rapid, than those of a <hi>Direct</hi>; for, the motion of Light, however frequently reflected, is incomprehensibly swift: but, that every reflection doth much diminish it, some rayes being always diverted and scattered into other parts of the medium, by reason of the Asperity, or Inaequality of the particles in every superfice; and so there being no superfice that remits in a direct line the full number of rayes
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55028:117"/>
(some have adventured to say, scarce half so many as) it received, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the eye receiving fewer and fewer rayes successively from every Reflectent, must be more weakly affected and moved by the thin remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For, if all the rayes of the Sun directly incident on a Wall, were thence reflected on another wall situate at a right angle; the Second wall would be fully as luminous as the First; and consequently, the Secondary light would be as strong and resplendent as the Primary: but, since the superfice of the First Wall is unequal and scabrous, it must of necessity come to pass, that though many of the rayes incident thereon are from thence projected on the Second, yet as many are repercussed into other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Medium, some upward, others downward; some to the right hand, others to the left, &amp;c. according to the various faces, or sides of the small particles, with asperity contexed in the superfice of each stone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. So that one half, if not the major part of the directly incident rayes being diverted from the Second Wall, the Light thereon appearing must be proportionately less strong and fulgent, than that, which illuminates the First. By the same reason, if the Second Wall by reverberation derive the Light to a Third; it must likewise play the Publican, and remit but half so many rayes, as it received from the First: and so must the Third transmit a thinner stock of light to a Fourth, and a Fourth to a Fifth, &amp;c.</p>

For, notwithstanding the illusion of our sense persuades us, that all things in the aer about us, and within our houses, are calm and unmoved: yet doth that better Criterion, our Reason, assure that the Light diffused through the aer is in perpetual inquietude, and consisteth of nothing else but a most tenuious Contexture of innumerable rayes, swarming from and to all regions uncessantly, so long as the Lucidum ceaseth not to maintain the succession of fresh rayes, that may be reflected from all obvious bodies. So that in what ever part of the medium the eye is posited; it shall ever have some object or other praesented: and particularly that, from whence some rayes are more directly reflected into its Pupil. Not that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Light diffused through the whole aer to be Continued, or United in all points, as are the parts of Water in the Sea: but, that, as a Spiders Web appears to be one entire and united body, though it consist of distinct Filaments, variously intricate, and mutually decussating each other; so also is Light, <hi>Non unum quid Simplicissimum, sed Compositissimum,</hi> some one thing not most Simple or consisting of parts continuedly united, but most Compound, or consisting of parts so interwoven as to exclude all sensible

For as no reason can be given for the Debilitation of Light by Reflection; but the Attenuation or Dimmution of the number of its Rayes: so can none be assigned for the Corroboration of it by Refraction in a Convex Glass, or Vial filled with clear water; but the <hi>multiplication</hi> of its Rayes, in some part of the Medium. Nor is there, on the contrary, why we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Light to be made weaker by some Refraction, unless in this respect only; that if it had not fallen foul of a Refringent body, a greater number of rayes would have continued their direct progress in a closer order, or more united stream: and so their Debility depends meerly on their Disgregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not Diminution of Pernicity. Certainly, that Light which is corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated by refraction in a Convex Glass, would be yet more strong and energytical, if all those Rayes, that strike upon the obverted side of the Glass, were so refracted, as to permeate and unite in the aer beyond the averted side thereof: and those rayes which are trajected through the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of a Glass Vial filled with water, arrive at the eye so much the more Disgregate, by how much the more obliquely the eye is posited; because the water being in the bottom more copious, and so containing more retun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent particles, doth divert the greatest number of them into the ambient. And hence we inferr, that if the beams of the Sun be conceded more weak in the Morn and Evening than at Noon, only because of a greater Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by more vapours then interposed; that effect must chiefly arise from hence, that the Rayes come unto us obliquely, after their trajection through those swarms of denser vapours, and consequently more Dissipated, the major part of them being diverted into other regions of the Medium. Moreover, insomuch as all <hi>Masters in the Optiques</hi> clearly demonstrate that the Image of an illustrate object, speculated through water in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of a vessel indiaphanous, doth appear less lively to those, that look on it obliquely, than to those that behold it in direct lines respective to the tendency of the Light refracted by the Water; and that the superfice of every object hath so much the fewer parts discernable, by how much more obliquely it is speculated: therefore is it purely necessary, that the Image of an object appear more <hi>Contracted,</hi> when speculated by a <hi>Vertical</hi> line, than when exhibited to the eye in a <hi>direct,</hi> and Irrefracted one.<note place="margin">

Not that we deny the necessary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of many of the Luminous rayes proceeding from the Sun, by those myriads of myriads of particles floating in the Atmosphere; and so the remission of them back again toward their source, and the consequent diminution of the shadow invironing the same: but that we conceive the proportion of rayes so diverted, to be so small, as to be much below the observation of our sense. For, He that is in the bottom of a deep Mine, hath his sight so little advantaged by the Aer illuminated by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian beams of the Sun, that though he can clearly behold the Starrs in the Firmament, immensely beyond that vast tract of Aer then illustrate; yet can he hardly perceive his own hand, or ought else about him, since all the rayes of Light, which affect his eyes, are only those few that have escaped repercussion upward, by those many oblique refractions in the sides of the Mine. Thus also in the night are we no whit relieved by the aer, or Aether surrunding our Horizon, or more properly, our Hemisphere beyond that region, to which the Cone of the Earths shadow extends: though the Sun doth as freely and copiously diffuse its light through all that vast Ocean of Aer, or Aether beyond the extent of the Earths shadow, at our Midnight, or when it is Vertical to the Antipodes, as at our noon when it is Vertical to us: which could not be, if any sensible proportion of light were reflected toward us by the particles of the Aer, or Aether, replenishing the subcae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial space. Hence comes it, that what Light remains to our Hemisphere in the night, ought to be referred, not to any Reflection of the Suns rayes from the sublime aer, or Aether; but to the Stars, or Moon, or both. And this is also no contemptible argument, that the Concave of the Firmament is <hi>Opace,</hi> and not azure, as most suppose.</p>

In the <hi>First</hi> Respect, we may conceive it to be the <hi>Center,</hi> from which all its luminous Rayes are emitted by Diffusion <hi>Sphaerical,</hi> according to that esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht maxime of <hi>Alhazen, Omne punctum luminosum radiare sphaeralitèr:</hi> in the <hi>Second,</hi> we may understand it to emit rayes in a diffusion <hi>Pyramidal,</hi> the base whereof is in it self, and cone in the eye of the Spectator. For, particularizing in the Sun, which being both a Lucid Body and a Visible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, falls under each acceptation; we must admit the Rayes thereof illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating that vast ocean of Space circumscribed by the concave of the Heavens, to be deradiated from it sphaerically, as so many lines drawn from one common Centre; because they are diffused throughout a region far greater than the Sun it self: and those rayes, that Constitute the Visible Images of it, stream from it in Cones or pyramids; because they are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the pupil of the beholders eye, a body by almost infinite degrees
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55028:118"/>
less than it self. This is fully demonstrated by the Forms of Eclipses, which no man can describe but by assuming the Sun as the Base, from whose Extremes myriads of Rayes emanant, and in their progress circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly environing the Margin of the Earth, or Moon, pass on beyond them till they end in a perfect Cone; the Orbs of the Earth and Moon being by many degrees less in circumference, than that of the Sun. This confirms us, that those <hi>Optico-mathematicians</hi> are in the centre of truth, who teach, that the rayes of the Sun, and all other luminous Objects as they consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute its visible species, are darted only Pyramidally; insomuch as they are received in the eye of each Spectator, so much less than the Sun, or other Luminary: but that they progress in a sphaerical Diffusion, in respect of the circumambient Aer, in each point whereof the Luminary or Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidum is Visible. Since, should we allow the Concave of the Firmament to be as thickly set with eyes, as Joves vigilant Pandars head was imagined by Poets; we could not comprehend how the orb of the Sun could be discernable by them all, unless by conceding this sphaerical diffusion of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids to all parts of the same. And this doth as well illustrate as confirm a former <hi>Antiperipatetical Paradox</hi> of ours, that the visible Species of an object is neither total in the totall Space, nor total in every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but the General Image is in the whole Medium, and the Partial or Particular Images, whose Aggregate makes the General Image, in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular parts of the Medium: because no singular eye from any singular part of the Medium, can perceive the whole of the object, but those parts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which are directly obverted to that part of the Medium, in which the eye is posited. Which assertion we inferred from hence, that not only the whole, but also every sensible particle of an object doth emit certain most subtile rayes, constituting the species of it self, in a sphaerical diffusion, so that the various particles emit various rayes, that variously decussate and intersect each other, in all parts of the Medium: and as these rayes are emitted sphaerically, <hi>ex se</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to that maxime, <hi>Omne Visibile sui spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem effundere sphaeraliter</hi>; so do most of them, <hi>ex Accidente,</hi> convene in their progress, and so reciprocally intersect, as to fulfill the figure of a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid. Whence it naturally follows, that because some Rayes must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, in all parts of the Medium, in this manner; therefore are Pyramids of rayes made in all points of the Medium, from whence the object diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them is visible. Notwithstanding this, we shall so farr comply with the Vulgar doctrine, as to allow; that in respect even of <hi>one single eye,</hi> in whatever part of the Medium posited, the diffusion of rayes from an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may be affirmed to be <hi>Sphaerical</hi>: insomuch as no part in the object at considerable distance singly discernable, can be assigned, which is not less than the pupil of the Eye.</p>

For experience assureth, that Greater Bodies emit a Graver Sound, than smaller; that Concaves yeild a stronger and more lasting Sound, than Planes; that Hard things sound more Acutely than Soft;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55028:122"/>
strings distended yeild a sharper sound, than lax; Empty vessels than full, &amp;c. Hence is it, that Goldsmiths, and Coyners distinguish good mony from bad, pure Gold from that largely allayed with Copper; and Metallists judge of simple and compound Metals, only by their Ring or sound. And we have heard of Vintners, who could exactly distinguish the Kinds and Goodness of Wines, only by the sound of the Vessels that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them: and therefore used to choose them more by their Ear, than Palate. But, what we here say, that <hi>Harder Bodies emit a sound more Acute than softer</hi>; we desire may be understood only of the <hi>Plurality,</hi> not Generality of Bodies. For the examining <hi>Mersennus,</hi> having experimented the different sounds of Metalls, tells us (<hi>in praefat. ad Harmonic.</hi>) that He found a Cylindre of Iron to be Unisone to another of steel, equal in diametre and length; and both in acuteness to transcend a Cylindre of Brass of equal dimensions, by a whole Diatessaron: nay more, that a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre of Firr Wood yeilded, upon equal percussion, a sound more acute by a whole Ditone, than a Cylindre of Brass, which yet yeilds a sound more strong, lasting and grateful than any of the rest.

                  <p n="9">(9) And what most conduceth to our comprehension of the Nature of a Sound; For, as Light, so is a Sound capable of Locomotion, Exsilition, Impaction, Resilition, Disgregation, Congregation; all which are the proper
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55028:123"/>
and incommunicable Attributes of Corporiety. Only we must confess them discrepant in this, (1) That Sounds are delated from their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal not only in direct lines, but circular, elliptical, parabolical, and all others; for a sound heard on the other side of a high Wall, comes not to the ear in a direct line through the Wall, as <hi>Kircherus</hi> contends (<hi>in Musurgiae Universal. lib.</hi> 1.) with taedious arguments, but in an <hi>Arch,</hi> as the incomparable St. <hi>Alban</hi> hath firmly evinced (<hi>in Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>Natural. Hist.</hi>): whereas Light constantly progress through the Medium to the Eye, in Direct lines, whether primary, reflex, or refracted. (2) A Sound is diffused through it sphere of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in a longer space of time, by much, than Light, as is sensibly demonstrated by this, that the flash of a Cannon arrives much soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Eye, than the report at the Ear: and the immediate Reason hereof is the less velocity of motion in the sound, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of grosser particles than those of Light, must be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately slower in its Delation. For, a Sound seems to be nought but the Aer, at least the subtler or more aethereal part of aer, extrite and formed into many small (<hi>Moleculae</hi>) masses, or innumerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Contextures, exactly consimilar in Figure, and capable of affecting the Organ of Hearing in one and the same manner: which configurated small masses of aer fly off from bodies compulsed or knockt each against other, with some violence; and progress by Diffusion in round. For, because upon pressure they mutually recede, each particle going off in that point where it finds the freest egress: therefore must some tend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, others downward, some to the right, others to the left, some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, others transversly, &amp;c. but all more slowly than the particles of Light, whose Tenuity being far greater, causeth them not to be subject to retardment by the like tumultuous Convolution. But, as the greater Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poriety of Sounds makes them <hi>slower</hi> in their <hi>Diffusion</hi>; so doth it make them more <hi>impetuous</hi> and forcible in their <hi>Impaction,</hi> than the Species of Light: it being obvious to observation, that Violent Sounds, such as great Thunders, Volleys of Cannon shot, the breaking of Granades, &amp;c. usually shake the largest Buildings, and shiver Glass windows at a mile distance and more. And yet are Sounds far easilier impeded, perturbed, and flatted, than the rayes of Light; every man knowing that no sound can penetrate Glass, but in one case, or exigent of Nature, of which we shall particularly speak, in the last Section of this Chapter: and since Sounds are repercussed more slowly; they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Disgregated more hardly, and Congregated more faintly, than the rayes of Light. Lastly, the Proportion of Retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the diffusion of Sounds to the utmost of their sphere of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, is such even from Winds; that as <hi>Mersennus</hi> hath computed, the diameter of the sphere of a sound, heard against the wind, is by almost a third part less than the diameter of the sphere of the same sound, assisted by a favourable or secund Wind: but the Diameter of a Lucid Sphere is alwayes equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, which way soever and how violently soever the wind blows. (3) Bodies of narrow Dimensions make a sensible reflection of Light; as is manifest from a Burning-glass of an inch diameter: but a Body of far greater dimensions is required to the sensible Reflection of a Sound, i. e. to the production of an Eccho; though it is not to be doubted, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

by the meer Repercussion of the Sound from the particles of the Aer. For, notwithstanding we deny not, but the particles of the aer, within the sphere of the Sounds diffusion, encountring and arietating those particles of the sound, may in some small measure repercuss them: yet we think it unsafe, therefore to admit this aereal Repercussion to arise to Sensibility, or to be observable by the Creation of an Echo. And therefore we conceive, that whatever sensible Reflection or Multiplication of a Sound, seems to proceed from the Aer, is not caused really by the Aer, but some Dense and Hard Bodies, such as Rocks, Aedifices, Arches, &amp;c. whose Concavities reflect the particles of a Sound for the same reason, that Concaves Multiply Light.</p>

<q>Why a voice, which is aer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurate, and for the most part loseth its Figure, in its [long] transmissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth yet conserve it intire and unimpaired, when repercussed from a solid body, as in all Echoes?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor can it be rightly denied, but that Flux of minute aereal Bodies,<note place="margin">

And by the <hi>Capacity</hi> of the most subtle parts of the Aer.</note> or most aethereal parts of the aer, which are excussed in round by two bodies arietating, are easily <hi>Capable of Configuration:</hi> when as much is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indicated even by those sensible Vortices, or Whirlings and Eddies of Winds, which are frequent in summer. Under this title fall those words of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Hunc vero fluxum in frustula consimilis Figurae comminui:</hi> the full sense whereof seems to be this. That whem a Voyce is emitted from the mouth, or other sound from what body soever; the Contexture of the minute bodies effluent is so comprest, and confracted into smaller contextures, that of the Original are made swarms of Copies, or lesser mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses exactly consimular in their Formation: and that those are instantly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed sphaerically, or in round through the whole circumfused space, still conserving their similitude to the Original, or General voyce, or sound, till their arrival at the Eare; and so retaining the determinate signature of their Formation, are distinguisht accordingly by the sensory. By this it appears, that <hi>Epicurus,</hi> in this point, dissented inconciliably from <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi>; who conceived that all sounds were delated to the Ear by <hi>Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> i. e. that the sound being broken into myriads of small Fragments, each fragment did form the contiguous Aer into Contextures of the same Configuration with the Prototype, and those again formed the particles of aer next adjacent into the like, and so successively through all parts of the medium till they came home to the Organ of Hearing; not much unlike the dream of the <hi>Aristoteleans,</hi> concerning the Propagation of the species of Light in each point of the medium. Whereas the Conception of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> is this, that the Primitive Configuration of the most tenuious particles of the Aer, by the percussion or Collision, is broken into many small mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and each of those, at farther remove from the sonant into many smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and those again into smaller, all exactly respondent to the First in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: after the same manner, as we observe a spark of Fire exsilient from a Firebrand, to be broken into a multitude of less sparks, and each of those shivered again into many less, until their exility makes them totally disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

Especially, when the Analogy holds quite through. For, as the Drops of Water are so much both larger and denser, by how much neerer they are after exsufflation to the mouth of the Fuller: so also are the Vocal masses of aer so much more large and dense or agminous, by how much neerer they are to the mouth of the Speaker; and <hi>

But, the Motions of the Hand requisite to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of every Character, are observable by the sense: and those of the Tongue and Lipps requisite to the Formation of every word, together with the proportion of the Aers Elision in every Articulation, is deeply obscure: and therefore the Disparity being manifest, the <hi>Problem</hi> remains untoucht,<note place="margin">

And when you make the proportion of the short string exactly Sequialteral to that of the long; because the sounds resulting from them, both at once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed, make a <hi>Fifth,</hi> or <hi>Diapente</hi>: therefore will that Consonance also have a considerable degree of sweetness, though short of that of an Eight; insomuch as though two strokes pass insociated, yet doth the Union follow in every Third, and so the Unition is sufficiently frequent to please the sense, which is best delighted with that object, in which is the least difference of parts, according to that <hi>fourth Praecogn. of Des Cartes (in compend. Musicae, pag.</hi> 6.) <hi>Illud objectum facilius sensu percipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, in quo est minor differentia partium.</hi> Again, if you make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the short string Sesquitertial to that of the long; because a Fourth, or Diatessaron, doth result from the percussion of them together, therefore will that Consonance be likewise competently grateful: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that after three insociated strokes, the Coition falls in every fourth. To Contract; the same holds in proportion exactly true also in Sesquiquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Sesquiquintal proportions, from which arise Thirds major and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; and of superbiparting Thirds, and supertriparting Fifths, from which arise Sixths major and minor; and finally, in all Compound Consonances, such as Disdiapason, &amp;c. For, alwayes the Consonance is by so much more grateful, by how much more frequently the strokes unite in the Sensory: and <hi>è contra.</hi> Whence is generated the Dissonancy, or ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Sounds, when ever the strokes either too rarely, or never unite: because, in those cases, the sense is held in a kind of lasting distraction, and unless a restitution of the distracted parts of the Sensory be made by some Coalitions, and those sufficiently frequent (which are a kind of Balsam, to cure the gratings and dissolutions) the senso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry must be mis-affected with a kind of Laceration, and undergo that dolour unwittingly. This the skilful Musician foreknowing, endeavours to praevent, by making a Diapason, or perfect Consonance tread upon the heels of a Dissonance, for varieties sake usually inserted into Tunes: thereby with advantage consolidating the ulceration of the sensory caused by the praecedent Discord, and making the Harmony the more grateful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Health is most grateful immediately after sickness, and a Calme after a Tempest. And this is the reason, why an Eighth is by many repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a more pleasing Consonance, than an Alnison; <hi>viz.</hi> in respect of the Distraction, which succeeds alternately from the Dissociated strokes of one of two strings together percust: and not in respect of its Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all other Consonances, as <hi>Des Cartes</hi> seems to conclude (<hi>in cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Compend Music.</hi>)</p>

In what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical Sound, result<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Chord percus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is begun.</note> hath engaged us to touch upon that Quicksand, from which none the most adventurous Curiosity hath ever yet returned with full resolution; and that is that eminent PROBLEM, <hi>Quando sonus Harmonicus à nervo fieri incipiat? In what instant an Harmonical Sound, created by a Chord of an instrument percussed, or abduced from its directness, is begun?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the clear understanding of this <hi>Quaestion,</hi> we are first to advertise; that from the percussion of any Chord distended, there are made two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sounds: <hi>one</hi> arising from the allision of the Aer betwixt the finger, or plectrum, and the Chord; which is so far from being Concinnous, that it frequently diminisheth the integrity or sweetness of the Musick, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes makes a kind of Discord, where the unskilfull hand strikes too hard or foul; the other, from the Chord verberating the Aer in its Vibrations, which is the Concinnous, or Harmonical Sound, by the Graecians, for distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction sake, called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and in our language the <hi>Twang.</hi> And this is the subject of the praesent Enquiry. Secondly, we are to praemise this
<figure/>
Wherein AB denotes the Chord, in a streight line, either perpendicularly, or horizontally distended; ABC the same Chord abduced, or impelled from the direct line to C; and F the same in the extreme or term of its spontaneous Flexion, after some certain recurses. And lastly, we are to state the Quaestion, thus. Whether the Concinnous Sound beginns from the First Excurse, which is made by the Chord from E to C, when it is impelled by the force of the percussion; or, when it returns, by spontaneous reflection, from C to E; or, when it hath past beyond E to D; or, in its whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curse from D, by E, to C?</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) Some there are, who observing that, when a Chord is abduced from its direct line E to C, and returns it self from C to E, if a piece of wollen cloth, a mans finger, or ought else that may suppress its motion, be so set as to arrest it at E; then is no Harmonical sound created, either in its first Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curse from E to C, nor Recurse from C to E: have upon this Experience concluded, that the Concinnous Sound is begun in the first Recurse of the Chord from D to E; because they suppose, the Chord then to reverberate the Aer, which pursued it (<hi>à tergo</hi>) from C to D, and force it by contrary
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55028:131"/>
violence to fly back again from D to C by E: so that the Aer at E, being on both sides distrest by that moving violently from C to E<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on one hand, and that lastly impelled from D to E, on the other, must suffer the highest Condensation, or Compression, or Percussion of all the other aer within the space CD, and consequently be the original of the Sound.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) <hi>Others</hi> have affirmed the original of the Sound to be from C to E, the space of the first Recurse: and their inducement thereto is this Experience. If a Chord of 30 perches length be with sufficient force extended, and then abduced from its line of direction to the distance of 15 feet, more or less; it will yeild a kind of stridor, or grave sibilation, in its spontaneous Recurse from C to E: which sound would perhaps be Concinnous, if included in some Instrument of sufficient capacity. To which they add, that wands or rodds being switcht in the aer, and Gun-shot in their flight, emitt a singing noyse, though they are impelled only one way, and have no Recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or doublings in the aer. But, to this it may be <hi>Answered,</hi> (1) That all these Bodies may more justly be conceived to yeild a sound only in this respect; that the inaequalities in their superficies so distress the aer in their rapid Motion, and by frequent reciprocations in their small cavities variously agitate the same, that it suffers such Circumvolutions as are tantamont to their Recurses. (2) That no Bullet shot from a Gun would yeild any sound at all, if it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly sphaerical, polite, and hard, and flew directly without that Voluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Circumvolution, which the resistence and circular returns of the aer constantly impress upon it. (3) That the Sibilation or Hissing noise made by the long Chord, in its Recurse from the 15 feet abduction, is not, nor ever can be Concinnous: and therefore the Experience is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to this Problem.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) A Third sort there is, who opinion the Harmonical Sound then to begin, when the Chord is first impelled from E to C; so that the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ord should produce a Sound in the extremity or period of every Flexion, i. e. in C and D, at alternate Recurses: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that no sensible Sound is produced in any part of the whole intermediate space betwixt CD. And the Ground These stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the Experience of Cloth, which being violently shook in the aer, for the excussion of dust, doth only then emit a smart sound, or Rapp, when attaining the extremity of its Flexion, it percusseth the superior aer, and is in the manner of Sails, swelled up by the inferior aer. But, in this instance, and that consimilar one of Coach-whips, it is almost evident even to the eye, that the Rapp is made only by the Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Cloth, or Chord, at the end of their Flexion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not convinced, that the Concinnous Sound is then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, as these persuade, in either C or D the period of each Flexion; especially, when the Chord in C and D seems rather to quiesce, than move<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some quiet must intercede betwixt two contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the same thing.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nsomuch as all sounds are caused by the Motion of the Aer; and the Sound alwayes is loudest, where the Motion of the Aer is most rapid; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> the whole sonorous line, or space betwixt C and E, the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55028:131"/>
motion of the Aer intercluded is most swift, when the Chord returns from C to E: therefore doth <hi>Mersennus</hi> (to whose judgment we most incline, in this nicety) conclude; that the Harmonical sound is begun in the beginning of the first Recurse of the Chord from C to E: and that it is then of the same Acuteness, as are all the subsequent sounds made by the subsequent Recurses; because the reason of the First Recurse seems to be the same with that of all the consequent.</p>
                  <p>To this some have <hi>objected</hi>; that the sound of the First Recurse is too Expedite and short, to be perceived by the Ear: since even the Eye, incomparably more prompt in the discernment of visibles, cannot behold an object, whose Apparence, or Praesence exceeds not the Duration of the foresaid Recurse of the Chord from the extreme of its flexion C to E; which doth scarce endure the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>600 part of a minute. But this objection is soon <hi>dissolved</hi> by Experience, which testifieth, that if a quill, or other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment be placed some small space beyond E towards D, so that the Chord may complete its first Recurse from C to E, without interruption: then will a sound be created, and such as hath sufficient Acuteness; though it be scarce momentany in Duration, because the frequency of its Recurses is prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>

                     <head>SOLUT.</head>
                     <p>To solve this (by many accounted inexplicable) Aenigme, we need only to have recurse to our long since antecedent Distinction of a Vacuity <hi>Disseminate,</hi> and <hi>Coacervate</hi>: for, that once entered our judgment, we cannot indubitate that ingenious Experiment of <hi>Gaspar Berthius,</hi> laureat Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician at <hi>Rome</hi> (frequently, and alwayes with honourable Attributes, mentioned by Father <hi>Kircher,</hi> in sundry of his Physicomathematical discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) which sensibly demonstrateth the actual production of a Sound, in a Disseminate Vacuity.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Experiment</hi> is thus made. Having praepared a large Concave and almost sphaerical Glass, aemulating the figure of a Cucurbite or Cupping-glass; fix a small Bell, such as is usual in striking Watches of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55028:132"/>
the largest size, on one side of the concave thereof, and a moveable Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or striker, at fit distance, on the other, so as the Hammer being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated may fall upon the skirts of the Bell: and then lute or coement on the Glass, firmly and closely (that all sensible insinuation of the ambient aer be praevented) to one extreme of a Glass Tube, of about an inch diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre in bore, and 8 or 10 feet in length. Then, reversing the Tube, pour into it a sufficient quantity of Quicksilver, or Water, to fill both it and the Head exactly. This done, stop the other extreme of the Tube with your finger, or other stopple accommodate to the orifice; and after gentle inversion, immerge the same to a foot depth in a Vessel of Water, and withdraw your stopple, that so much of the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver contained in the Head and Tube, as is superior in Gravity to the Cylindre of Aer, from the summity of the Atmosphere incumbent on the surface of the Water in the subjacent Vessel may fall down, leaving a considerable void Space in the superior part of the Tube. Lastly, apply a vigorous Loadstone to the outside of the Glass Head, in the part respecting the moveable extreme of the Hammer; that so, by its Magnetical Effluxions transmitted through the incontiguities or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute pores of the Glass, and fastned on to its <hi>Ansulae</hi> or smal Holds, it may elevate the same: which upon the subduction of its Attrahent, or Elevator, will instantly relapse upon the Bell, and by that percussion produce a clear and shrill sound, not much weaker than that emitted from the same Bell and Hammer, in open aer.</p>
                     <p>Now, that there is a certain Vacuity in that space of the Head and Tube deserted by the delapsed Quicksilver, is sufficiently conspicuous even from hence; that the ambient Aer seems so excluded on all hands, that it cannot by its <hi>Periosis</hi> (to borrow <hi>Platoes</hi> word) or <hi>Circumpulsion,</hi> succeed into the room abandoned by the Quicksilver, and so redintegrate the soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Continuity, as in all other motions.</p>
                     <p>And that this Vacuity is not Total, or Coacervate, but only Gradual or <hi>Desseminate,</hi> may be warrantably inferred from hence; (1) That Nature is uncapable of so great a wound, as a Coacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Vacuity of such large dimensions, as we have argued in our Chapter of a <hi>Vacuum Praeternatural,</hi> in the First Book: (2) That a Sound is produced therein, for since a Sound is an Affection of the Aer, or rather, the Aer is the Material Cause of a Sound, were there no aer in the Desert space, there could be no Sound. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is most probable, that in this so great distress ingenious Nature doth relieve herself by the insensible transmission of the most aethereal or subtile particles of the Circumpulsed Aer, through the small and even with a microscope invisible Pores of the Glass, into the Desert Space; which replenish it to such a degree, as to praevent a Total though not a Dispersed Vacuity therein: and though the Grosser Parts of the extremly comprest Aer cannot likewise permeate the same slender or narrow Inlets; yet is that no impediment to the Creation of a Sound therein, because the most tenuious and aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real part of the aer, is not only a sufficient, but the sole material of a Sound, as we have more than intimated in the 15. <hi>Art.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect. of the present Chapter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:55028:132"/>The only Difficulty remaining, therefore, is only this; <hi>Why the sound made in the disseminate Vacuity should through the Glass-head pass so easily and imperturbed, as to be heard by any in the circumstant space; when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience certifieth, that the Report of a Cannon, at the distance of only a few yards, cannot be heard through a Glass window into a room void of all chinks or crannies?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor need any man despair of expeding it. For, whoso considers the extraordinary and inscrutable wayes to which Nature frequently recurrs, in cases of extreme Necessity; and that the Distress she undergoes in the introduction of this violent Vacuity (where her usual remedy the Peristal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick motion, or Circumpulsion of the Aer, is praevented by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of a Solid) is much more urgent than that she is put to in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the ambient aer by the explosion of Canons (where the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude of uninterrupted space affords freedome of range to the motion imprest) we say, whoso well considers these things, cannot doubt, but that it is much easier to Nature to admit the trajection of the Sound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Disseminate Vacuity, through the pores of the Glass-head, than the transmission of an External Sound into a close Chamber, through a Glass window, where is no Concavity for the Corroboration or Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Sound, and consequently where the impulse is far less (respective to the quantity of the aer percussed) and the resistence as much greater.</p>

That all odoriferous Druggs are Hot, and suffer a perpetual exhaustion or expence of their halituous substance: so that who so would conserve their Fragrancy, must embalm them in Oyl, or incorporate them with Gumms, or other substance not easily evaporable; according to the common practice of all Perfumers and Confectioners; or immure them in close conservatories, and that rather in great lumps, than small fragments, and in Cold rather than Hot rooms. Hence it is also, that all Botanicks hold it for an unquestionable Axiome, <hi>Omnia Odorata esse ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida</hi>; so that some have undertaken to distinguish of the degrees of Heat in Plants and other Simples, meerly by the vehemence or languor of their Odour: and that <hi>Aristotle (problem. sect.</hi> 12. <hi>quaest.</hi> 12.) affirms that all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorous seeds are Calefactive, because Heat is the Efficient of an Odour; to which <hi>Galen</hi> also subscribes (4 <hi>de simpl. medicament. facul. cap.</hi> 22.)</p>

Which Naturalists well understanding, have been forced to the cleanly shift of transferring the distinct names of <hi>sapours</hi> over to the specifical Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of <hi>Odours</hi>; there being some manifest symbolism betwixt the two senses, and no obscure Analogy betwixt the Conditions of their objects: as <hi>Aristotle</hi> insinuates in his Affirmation, <hi>Nullum corpus esse odoriferum, quod non pariter saporiferum existat (de sens &amp; sensil. cap.</hi> 5.) that all Odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous bodies are also saporiferous; and in his definition of an <hi>olfactile,</hi> or odorable object to be, <hi>Quod sapidae siccitatis diluendae ac diffundendae vim sortitur.</hi> Well may we, therefore, content our selves with the Discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of those kinds of Odours, that fall under the Cognizance of our sense; and those are <hi>Sweet, Sower, Austere, Acerb,</hi> and <hi>Fatt</hi> or <hi>Luscious</hi>: as for <hi>Putrid</hi> or Faeti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is also another Difference of smells, whereof <hi>one</hi> kind is either pleasant or unpleasant by Accident, or upon Circumstance; as the smell of Meats and Drinks is pleasant to the Hungry, but offensive to the Full-gordged, and this sort is in common as well to Beasts, as Men: the <hi>other</hi> is pleasant, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant of their own Nature, as the smells of Herbs, Flowers, Perfumes, &amp;c. which conduce neither to the Excitement, nor Abatement of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, unless they be admixt to meats or drinks; to which <hi>Stratis</hi> alluded, when taxing <hi>Uripides</hi> he said, <hi>Cum lens coquitur, unguenti nil infundito,</hi> and this Difference is proper only to man.

Whether his <hi>Reason</hi> be not praecarious, we need not determine: but it too nearly concerns us to affirm, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme slenderness of his doctrine, touching the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> of Sapours as well in General as Particular; erected on that common imaginary base of Immaterial Qualities, hath given us just occasion to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the solidity of his <hi>Inference</hi> or <hi>Conclusion</hi>; and left us cause to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that sentence, much more Canonical, <hi>That things most manifest to the Sense, often prove most obscure to the Understanding.</hi> For, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we have the demonstration of our sense, that, as He and all other Philosophers unanimously assert, the Object of the Tasting, in General, is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Aristotle,</hi> from whose Text all the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> have not receded insomuch as in a title, as to the particular under debate, fixeth the original of a Sapour, in a certain Contemperation of three prime <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Qualities</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. (1) <hi>Terrestrious Siccity.</hi> (2) <hi>Aqueous Humidity.</hi> (3) <hi>Heat.</hi> The two former as the <hi>Material</hi> Causes, the last as the <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> to which, according to his custome, He consigns the masculine and determinative Energy, as in this, so in all natural productions. The necessity or the Concurrence of these three First Qualities to the Generation of a Sapour in any Concretion, He inferrs chiefly from hence; that Water, being in the purity or simplicity of its es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, absolutely insipid, if percolated through <hi>Siccum terrestre,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dust Earth, doth alwayes acquire a Sapidity, or Savouriness, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to the intense, or remiss adustion of the terrestrious material dissolved by, and incorporated to it self: as is commonly observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Fountains, which become impraegnate or tincted with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of those veins of Earth, through whose Meanders and streights they have steered in their long subterraneous voyages; and in all Lixivial decoctions, or Lees, which obtain a manifest Saltness on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by transcolation through Ashes, the Earthy and adust reliques of compound bodies, dissolved by Fire. To which, He moreover addes, that because the Contemperature may be various, according to greater or lesser proportion of either of the three ingredients; and the Aqueous <hi>Humidum,</hi> united to the Earthy <hi>Siccum,</hi> hath its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence sometimes participant of Crassitude, sometime of Tenuity: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not all Sapours alike, but different according to the several Gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities of their respective and specifical Causes.

And the <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, with the particular Causes of each.</note>To progress to the brief survey of <hi>Particulars,</hi> it seems requisite that we observe; that <hi>Galen, Avicenna, Averrhoes,</hi> and most <hi>Physitians</hi> after them, have conceived this Theory of <hi>Aristotles</hi> so firm and impraegnable, as they have thereon founded one of their pillars for the invention of Remedies, and advanced rules for the Conjectural investigation of the manifest Faculties of Medicaments, by the Taste: to that end constituting <hi>Eight Differences,</hi> or Generical Distinctions of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">(1) <hi>Acer,</hi> which affects the mouth and chiefly the Tongue, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain acrimony and pungent ardor; such as is eminently conspicuous in <hi>Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Pellitory, Euphorbium, Cassea lignea, Winterian Bark,</hi> &amp;c. It ariseth from a Composition of tenuious, dry and hot parts, and cannot subsist in a subject of any other constitution.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) <hi>Acid,</hi> or <hi>Sharp,</hi> which likewise penetrateth and biteth the tongue, but with some constringency, and without any sense of heat: such as is deprehended in <hi>Vinegre,</hi> juice of <hi>Limons, Citrons, Woodsorrel, Berberies,</hi> and in some <hi>Malacotones</hi> and <hi>Quinces.</hi> It results from a Concretion of subtle and dry parts, either where the innate heat is resolved by some degree of putrefaction, as in Vinegre: or where the innate heat is so small as to be inferior to Cold, and that associated with extreme siccity; as in juice of Limons, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:55028:138"/>(3) <hi>Fat,</hi> or <hi>Luscious,</hi> which sollicites the Gusts neither with heat, nor acrimony; but furrs and daubs the mouth with an unctuous len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or viscidity. Such is remarkable in <hi>Oyle Olive, Oyle of sweet Almonds, Wallnuts,</hi> in <hi>Marrow, Butter,</hi> and the <hi>Fats</hi> of Beasts, which have no rancidity, either acquired by antiquity, or natural, such as is perceivable in the Fat of <hi>Lions, Wolves,</hi> and <hi>Tigers:</hi> and in all <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilaginous Plants,</hi> as in <hi>Althaea</hi> and <hi>White Lilly</hi> roots, &amp;c. This hath its production from a thin aereal matter, temperate in heat and cold.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) <hi>Salt,</hi> which doth not much calefie, but with a sharp and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netring siccity bite the tongue; as is observed in the degustation of Common <hi>Salt, Nitre,</hi> and among Vegetables chiefly in <hi>Rock Sampier.</hi> This Sapour is also sensible in all <hi>Chymical Salts,</hi> extracted from Bodies by the sequestrating activity of Fire, cinefying their dry and terrestrious remains: nor is there any Compound in Nature, from which pyrotechny may not extract the Calx or proper Salt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, discernable by the taste. And therefore it is manifest, that all salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness subsisteth in a matter, whose principal ingredients, Heat and Siccity are equal.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) <hi>Austere,</hi> which being moderately adstringent, doth with some asperity coarctate the particles of the tongue; and therefore according to the judgment of the pallate, it seems dry and cooling. This is more properly called the <hi>Crude</hi> Sapour, as being peculiar to all Fruits during their immaturity; as is generally noted in the juice of unripe <hi>Grapes, green Apricocks, Pears, Apples, Medlars, Porcellane, &amp;c.</hi> The substance wherein it consisteth, must be equally participant of Earth and Water, but where Cold hath the upper hand of Heat.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6) <hi>Sweet,</hi> which being not offensive by the unevenness or exupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any Quality, affects the sense with suavity or delight. Such eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man knows to be in <hi>Sugar, Honey, Liquorice, Iujubes, Dates, Figgs,</hi> and in most <hi>Fruits</hi> after their maturity: as also in <hi>Manna,</hi> and, in some degree, in <hi>Milk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">(7) <hi>Bitter,</hi> the Contrary to Sweet, which offending by the asperity and tenuity of its parts, doth in a manner corrade and divell the sensory. This superlatively discovers it self in <hi>Aloes, Coloquyntida, Rhubarb, Wormwood,</hi> the lesser <hi>Centaury, Bitter Almonds,</hi> and the <hi>Galls</hi> of Animals. The matter of it is crass and terrene, but adust by immoderate Heat; and hence that Galenical Axiome, <hi>Omne amarum est calidum &amp; siccum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">(8) <hi>Acerb,</hi> or <hi>Sower,</hi> which bordereth upon the Austere or Pontick Sapour, being distinguishable from it, only by a greater ingratefulness to the sense; for it more constringeth and exasperateth all parts of the mouth, and so seems more exsiccative and refrigerative. It is prodigally perceived in the <hi>rind</hi> of <hi>Pomegranates, Galls, Sumach, Cypress Nuts,</hi> the <hi>Bark</hi> of <hi>Oak,</hi> the <hi>Cups of Achorns, &amp;c.</hi> Its residence is alwayes in a Composition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally terrene and drye, whose languid heat is subdued to inactivity by the superior force of its antagonist, Cold.</p>

                     </gap>, the <hi>Fatuous</hi>; which affecting the sense with no impression, is indeed no Sapour, but rather the Privation of all Sapidity. To this Heteroclite are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly referred the several species of <hi>Bread Corn, Gourds, Citrals, Cucumbers,</hi> &amp;c. Whose materials though crass, are not yet terrene, dry and adstri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; but diluted with a plentiful portion of aqueous moisture, not exquisitely permixt, because of the small allowance of heat to their Composition.</p>

To which argument of <hi>Scaligers,</hi> we shall superadd this weighty exception of our own; that according to the Hypothesis of First Elemental Qualities, it is absolutely impossible to Explicate the Causes of that so great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Tasts not only among Animals of different species, but Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of the same species; of which we shall discourse more expresly in opportunity.</p>

                  <p>His <hi>First</hi> is of this importance; if the particles of Sapid Objects were Figurate, according to <hi>Democritus</hi> Assumption, then would the sight, as a Sense far more acute in perception, deprehend their various Figures rather than the Taste: but the Sight doth not discern them; <hi>Ergo.</hi>

Why therefore should we not write our names in the Catalogue of those, who conceive as great variety of <hi>Tastes,</hi> as there is of <hi>Sapid objects</hi> in Nature. Or, since the Experiments of Chymistry have made it probable, that all Sapours derive themselves from <hi>Salts,</hi> as from their <hi>Primary Cause</hi>; why may we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede so many several sorts of salts, and so many possible Commistions of them, as may suffice to the production of an incomprehensible variety of Sapours?</p>

                  <p>If in a Rare body there be admitted no <hi>Vacuola,</hi> or small emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty spaces, but it be assumed, that the particles of Matter are adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate both in Number and Dimensions to the particles of space, wherein it is contained; then must it necessarily follow, that in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation many particles of Matter must be reduced into one particle space, which before Condensation was adaequate onely to one particle of Matter: and, on the contrary; in Rarefaction, one and the same particle of matter must possess many of space, each whereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rarefaction, was in dimensions fully respondent thereto. For Example; in Aer condensed into Water, an hundred particles of Aer must be reduced into one particle of space: and in Water rarified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Aer, one particle of the matter of Water must possess an hundred particles of space. Again, according to the Assumption of no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, since in a Vessel replete with Aer, the parts of Aer must be equal in number and dimensions to the parts of space, thereby circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, none the least particle of space being admitted to be Inane; if you fill the same Vessel with Water, or Lead, or Gold, it must follow, that the parts of the matter of Aer, and the parts of the matter of Water, Lead, or Gold, shall be equal in number, because <hi>Quae sunt uni tertio aequalia; aequalia sunt etiam inter se:</hi> and if so, needs must Aer be aequally Dense with Water, Lead, or Gold, which all men allow to be the most dense and compact body in Nature in regard it transcends all others in weight and difficulty of Solution, or Division;</p>

When a <hi>Fleece,</hi> or <hi>Lock of Wool</hi> is deduced, or distended, we say, it is made more Rare; and when Compressed, more Dense: now the Rarity thereof consisteth only in this, that the Hairs, which were formerly more Consociate, United, or at closer Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der among themselves, are Dissociated, Dis-united, or reduced to more open Order, and the spaces betwixt them, become either more, or larger, in which no particle of Wool is contained: and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Density thereof consisteth onely in this, that the Particles or Hairs, which were before more Dissociated, or at open order, are by Compression brought to more Vicinity, or to closer order, and the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt them become fewer and lesser. And thus are we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how the same Matter, without Augmentation or Diminution of Quantity, may be now Rarified into Aer, and anon Condensed into Water; for, instead of the Hairs in the Fleece of Wool, we need only put the Particles of the matter, which in Rarifaction are Dissociated, in Condensation Coadunated. And this Conception may be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also to a Spunge, Flaxe, or any other Porous and Lax bodie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are capable of Expansion and Contraction onely in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, that the small spaces intercepted in the incontiguities or distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their particles, are now enlarged, now contracted. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, this similitude is not adaequate in all points, there being this <hi>Difference,</hi> that when a Fleece of Wool is expansed, the ambient Aer doth instantly insinuate into the small spaces intercepted betwixt the dissociated particles of it, and so possess them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing of Aer, or Aether, or other substance whatever doth insinuate it self into the small spaces intercepted betwixt the dissociated particles or Aer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Water, when either of them is Rarified: we say, notwithstanding this
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55028:145"/>
Disparity, yet doth it hold thus far good and quadrant, that as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Wool possesseth those spaces, which would therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main absolutely Empty, in case the sociable Aer did not instantly succeed in possession of them; so, since the parts of the matter of Water are Expansed or Dissociated after the same manner, as are the Hairs of Wool, and after the same manner Contracted or United; and certain small Loculaments are likewise intercepted betwixt the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of that matter, in which nothing of Water can be contained, during the state of Rarifaction, and which no other substance can be proved to possess; it must thence follow, that those deserted small spaces, or Loculaments remain absolutely Empty. And more than that, our similitude is not concerned to impart.</p>

Whether Aer be capable of Condensation to so high a rate as it is of Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: and the Apodictical <hi>solution</hi> thereof.</note>The Reasons of Rarity and Density thus evidently Commonstrated, the pleasantness of Contemplation would invite us to advance to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination <hi>of the several Proportions of Gravity and Levity among Bodies, respective to their particular Differences in Density and Rarity; the several ways of Rarifying and Condensing Aer and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the means of attaining the certain weights of each, in the several rates, or degrees of their Rarifaction and Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55028:145"/>
according to the evidence of Aerostatick and Hydrostatick Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments:</hi> but in regard these things are not directly pertinent to our present scope and institution, and that <hi>Galilaeus</hi> and <hi>Mersennus</hi> have enriched the World with excellent Disquisitions upon each of those sublime Theorems; we conceive ourselves more excusable for the Omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than we should have been for the Consideration of them, in this place. However, we ask leave to make a short Excursion upon that PROBLEM, of so great importance to those, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise their Ingenuity in either <hi>Hydraulick,</hi> or <hi>Pneumatick</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks: <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>Whether may Aer be Rarified as much as Condensed; or whether it be capable of Rarifaction and Condensation to the same rate, or in the same proportion?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That common Oracle, for the Solution of Problems of this abstruse nature, Experience hath assured, that Aer, may be Rarified to so great a height, in red-hot Aeolipiles, or Hermetical Bellows, that the 70 part of Aer formerly contained therein, before rarifaction, will totally fill an Aeolipile upon extreme Rarifaction thereof. For, <hi>Mersennus,</hi> using an Aeolipile, which being Cold, would receive exactly 13 ounces, one Drachm and an half; and when Hot, would suck in only 13 ounces: found, that the whole quantity of Aer ignified, and replenishing the same Aeolipile, when glowing Hot, being reduced to its natural state, did possess only the 70. part of the whole Capacity, which was due to the Drachm and half of Water. We say, upon <hi>Extreme</hi> Rarifaction; because this seems to be the highest rate, to which any Rarifaction can attain, in regard the Metal of the Aeolipile can endure no more violence of the Fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fusion.</p>
                  <p>As for the Tax, or Rate of its utmost <hi>Condensation</hi>; though many are persuaded, that Aer cannot be reduced, by Condensation, to more than a Third part of that Space, which it possesseth in its natural state; because they have observed, that Water infused into a Vessel of three He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae, doth not exceed two Heminae, in regard of the Aer remaining within: yet certain it is, that Aer may be Condensed to a far high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proportion. For, Experience also confirms, that into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Wind-Gun (of usual Dimensions) Aer may be intruded, to the weight of a Drachm, or sixty Grains: and that in that Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which contains only an ounce of Water, it may be so included, as that yet a greater proportion of Aer may be injected into it. Now, therefore, insomuch as the Aer in <hi>

                        </gap>ersennus</hi> his Aeolipile amounts to four Grains (at least) or sixe (at most) which number is ten times multiplied in sixty; and that the Concave of the Aeolipile is to the Concave of the Pipe of the Wind-Gun, in proportion sesquialteral: by Computation it appears, that the Aer condensed in the Chamber of the Wind-Gun must be sufficient to fill the Aeolipile ten times over, or the same Chamber 15 times over, if restored to its natural te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And hereupon we may safely Conclude, that Aer may be Compressed in a Wind-Gun, to such a rate, as to be contained in a space 15 times less, than what it possessed during its natural Laxity; and that by the force only of a Mans hand, ramming down the Embol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Charging Iron: which Force being capable of Quadruplication, the Aer may be reduced into a space subquadruple to the former. If so, the rate of the possible Condensation of Aer, will not come much short of that of its extreme Rarefaction: at least, if a Quadruple Force be sufficient to a Quadruple Condensation; and Aer be capable of a Quadruple Compressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: both which are Difficulties not easily determinable.</p>

And hence we inferr, that because the total Freedom of their Transmission depends only upon the total Inanity of the Space intermediate; and so the more or less of freedome trajective depends upon the more or less of Inanity in the Space intermediate: therefore must every Concretion be so much more Perspicuous, by how much the more, and more ample Inane Spaces it hath intercepted among its Component particles; which permit the Rayes freely to continue on their progress home to the Eye.</p>
                  <p>This we affirm not <hi>Universally,</hi> but under the due limitation of a <hi>Caeteris Paribus,</hi> as we have formerly hinted. Because, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing a piece of Lawn is more or less Perspicuous, according as the Contexture of its Threads is more or less Rare; and the Aer in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is more or less pellucid, according as it is perfused with more or fewer Vapours: yet do we not want Bodies, as <hi>Paper, Sponges, &amp;c.</hi> Which though more then meanly Rare, are nevertheless Indiaphanous; and on the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55028:146"/>
contrary, we see many Bodies, sufficiently Dense, as <hi>Horn, Muscovy-glass, common glass,</hi> &amp;c. which are yet considerably Diaphanous.</p>
                  <p>Now, that you may clearly comprehend the <hi>Cause</hi> of this <hi>Difference,</hi> be pleased to hold your right hand before your eye, with your fingers somewhat distant each from other; and then looking at some object, you may behold it through the chinks or intervals of your fingers:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Art.</hi> 4. Why <hi>Glass,</hi> though much more <hi>Dense,</hi> is yet much more <hi>Diaphanous,</hi> than <hi>Paper.</hi>
                     </note> this done, put your left hand also over your right, so as the fingers of it may be in the same position with the former; and then may you perceive the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, at least as many parts of it as before. But, if you dispose the fingers of your left hand so as to fill up the spaces or intervals betwixt those of your right; the object shall be wholly eclipsed. Thus also, if you look at an object through a Lawn, or Hair Sieve, and then put another Sieve over that, so as the holes or pores of the second be parallel to those of the first; you may as plainly discern it through both as one: but, if the twists of the second sieve be objected to the pores of the first, then shall you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no part of the object, at least so much the fewer parts, by how much greater a number of pores in the first are confronted by threads in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. And hence you cannot but acknowledge that the Liberty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection doth depend immediately and necessarily upon the Inanity of the pores; the Impediment of it upon the Bodies that hinder the trajection of the Rayes emitted from the Object: and yet that to <hi>Diaphanity</hi> is required a <hi>certain orderly and alternate Position of the Pores and Bodies, or Particles.</hi> This considered, it is manifest, that the Reason <hi>why Glass, though much more Dense, is yet much more perspicuous than Paper,</hi> is only this; that the Contexture of the small filaments, composing the substance of Paper, is so <hi>confused,</hi> as that the Pores that are open on one side or superfice thereof, are not continued through to the other, but variously intercepted with cross-running filaments: as is more sensible in the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Though this make the whole matter sufficiently intelligible, yet may it receive a degree more of illustration,<note place="margin">

                     </note> if we admit the same Conditions to be in the substance of Glass, that are in a <hi>Mist,</hi> or Cloud; through which we may behold and object, so long as the small passages or intervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the particles of the Vapours, through which the rayes of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble species may be trajected, remain unobstructed: but yet perceive the same so much the more obscurely, by how much the more remote it is; because, in that case, more impervious particles are variously opposed to those small thorow-fares, that obstruct them, and so impede the progress of most of the rayes. For, thus also Glass, if thin, doth hinder the sight of an object very little, or nothing at all; but if very thick, it wholly termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the progress of the species: and, by how much the thicker it is, by so much the more it obscures the object. And this, only because Glass, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of small solid Particles, or Granules, and insensible Pores alternately situate, hath many of its pores running on in direct lines through its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

                     </note>And this gives us an opportunity to refute that vulgar <hi>Error, That the substance of Glass is totally Diaphanous, or that all and every Ray of the the Visive Species is trajected through it, without impediment.</hi> To demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the contrary, therefore, we advise you to hold a piece of the finest and thinnest Venice Glass against the Sun, with two sheets of white paper, one betwixt the Sun and the Glass, the other betwixt the Glass and your Eye: for, then shall all the <hi>Trajected</hi> Rayes be received on the paper on this side of the glass, and the <hi>Reflected</hi> ones be received on that beyond it. Now, insomuch as that paper, which is betwixt your eye and the glass, doth receive the <hi>Trajected</hi> rayes, with a certain apparence of many small <hi>shadows</hi> intercepted among them; and that paper beyond the glass, doth receive the <hi>Reflected</hi> rayes with an apparence of many small <hi>lights</hi>: therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand (1) from whence can that species of small shadows arise, if not from the Defect of those rayes, that are not transmitted through the Glass, but averted from it? (2) Whence comes it, that in neither paper the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Splendour is so great, as when no Glass is interposed betwixt them; if not from hence, that the reflected rayes are wanting to the nearest, the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ones to the farthest? (3) Whence comes it that some rayes are refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, others trajected; if not from hence, that as a Lawn sieve transmits those rayes, which fall into its pores, and repercusseth others that fall upon its threads: so doth Glass permit those rayes to pass through, that fall into its pores; and reverberate those, that strike upon its solid particles? And what we here say of Glass, holds true also (in proportion) of <hi>Aer, Water, Horn, Vernish, Muscovy-glass,</hi> and all other <hi>Diaphanous</hi> Bodies.</p>

So must every Concretion be considered, as it stands possessed of its own compound Magnitude, or Quantity, without respect to any other Body, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison whereof it may be said to be Greater or Less.

                  <p>Moreover, this sufficiently instructs us to give a decisive Response to that so long debated Quaestion, <hi>An per Rarifactionem acquiratur, per Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densationem deperdatur Quantitas?</hi> Whether the Quantity of a Body is Augmented in Rarifaction, and Diminished in Condensation, or no? For, as nothing of Matter is conceived to be added to a body, while it is Rarified; nothing of Matter detracted from it while Condensed: so is it undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at least unrefutable, that nothing of Quantity is acquired by Rarifaction,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55028:148"/>
or amitted by Condensation; but only that those empty spaces are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or excluded, which being in a Rarified body conjoined to the small spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the particles of its matter possess, make it appear to be Greater, or to replenish a greater place, than before; and in a Condensed body, detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the small spaces, that the particles of its matter do possess, make it appear Less, or to fill a less place than before. If so, it may be cause of wonder even to the wisest and most charitable Consideration, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants of <hi>Aristotles</hi> doctrine of Quantity, have with so much labour and anxiety of mind betrayed themselves into sundry not only inextricable Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, but open Repugnances; while on the one side they affirm, that as well Quantity as Matter, is Ingenerable and Incorruptible: and on the other admit, that the same Matter may be one while Extended to the occupation of all and every part of a greater space; and another while again so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as to be wholly comprehended in the hundreth part of the former space (as in the Condensation of Aer into Water) than which no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can be or more open, or more irreconcileable. And yet we see those, who have easily swallowed it, and upon digestion become so transcendently exalted to sublimities, as to imagine the Quantity of a thing to be absolutely distinct from the matter, or substance of it: and thereupon to conclude, that Rarity and Density doe consist only in the several proportions, which substance hath to Quantity.</p>

Know we, therefore, that the Faculty or Power of Motion doth therefore seem to be one and the same thing with the coessential Mobility, now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; because every thing in Nature is judged to have just so much of Efficacy, or Activity, as it hath of Capacity to move either it self, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing.</p>

                     </note> that in Nature there is no Faculty (properly) but what is <hi>Active</hi>; because, though the motions of things be really the same with their Actions: yet must all motion have its beginning only from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or Agent. Nor can it avail to the contrary, that all Philosophers have allowed a Passive Faculty to be inhaerent in all Concretions; since, in the strict dialect of truth, that Passiveness is no other than a certain Impotency of Resistence, or the Privation of an Active Power, in defect whereof the subject is compelled to obey the Energy of another. If you suppose an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Contradiction in this our Assertion, and accordingly Object; that therefore there must be a Faculty of Resistence, in some proportion, and that that Resistence is Passive: we are provided of a satisfactory salvo, which is, that though the Active Virtue, which is in the Resistent, doth sometimes scarce discover it self, yet is it manifest, that there are very many things, which make resistence only by motion, which no man can deny to be an Active Faculty; as when we rowe against wind and tide, or strive with a Bowe in the drawing of it, for all these evidently oppose our force by contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. And, as for other things, which seem to quiesce, and yet make some resistence; such we may conceive to make that resistence by a kinde of motion, which Physicians denominate a Tonick motion; like that of the Eye of an Animal, when by the Contraction of all its muscles at once it is held in one fixt position. Thus not only the whole Globe of the Earth, but all its parts are held unmoved, and first by mutual cohaerence, and resist motions as they are parts of the whole: and thus also may all Concretions be conceived to be made Immote, not that the Principles of which they consist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are not in perpetual inquietude and motion; but, because their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

For, though the spirits are by vulgar Philosophers conceived to be only the Primary Organ, or immediate Instrument, which the Faculty residing in one part, occasionally transmits into another: yet, to those Worthies, who have with impartial and profound scrutiny searched into the mystery, hath it appeared more consentaneous, that the spirits are of the same nature with the Faculty, and not only movent, but Instrument; nor can it stand with right reason to admit more than this, that as water in the streams is all one specifically with that in the fountain, so is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, keeping its court or chief residence in one part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as it were the Fountain, or Original, from whence to all other parts, inservient to the same function, the diffusion of spirits is made, in certain exile rivolets, or (what more neerly attains the abstrusity) Rayes, like those emitted from the Sun, or other fountain of light.

Concerning this, therefore, we give you this solution, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence of various Faculties in one Concretion, doth depend upon (1) <hi>the variety of multiforme particles, of which the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion doth consist,</hi> (2) <hi>the variety of particles and special con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of its divers parts,</hi> (3) <hi>the variety of External Faculties, to which it happens that they are applied.</hi> To keep to our former Example, in an Apple, tis manifest, there are some particles, in which consisteth its faculty of affecting the smell, others in which consisteth its faculty of affecting the Tast; for, the Experiments of Chymistry demonstrate, that these different particles may be so sequestred each from other, as that the tast may be conserved, when the smell is lost,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55028:153"/>
and the smell conserved, when the taste is abolished. And in an Animal it is no less evident, that the organ of one sense hath one peculiar kind of contexture, the organ of another sense another: and finally, that when we shall referr the Faculties of Odour and Sapour, which are in an Apple, to the Faculties of smelling and tasting in Animals; they become subject to a further discrimination. Since the same particles, which move the smelling, shall create a sweet and grateful odour, in respect of one Animal, and an offensive or stinking, in respect of another: and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, those particles, which affect the Taste, shall yeild a most grateful and desireable Sapour, to one Animal, and as odious and detestable a one to another. Ought we, therefore, to account that Faculty of an Odour, which is in an Apple, either <hi>Single,</hi> or <hi>Multiplex?</hi> If we would speak strictly, it is <hi>Single Absolutely: Respectively, Multiplex.</hi> And thus, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, may we affirm, that in the General, or absolutely, an Apple is Odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Sapid: but Comparatively and in Special, that it is fragrant, or foetid; sweet or bitter.</p>
                  <p>As for that Appendix of a Faculty, which not only Philosophers,<note place="margin">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes use of, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of its proper Actions.</note> though it arise in some measure from the Power or Faculty it self, or the Spirits, as being accustomed to one certain motion: yet doth it chiefly depend upon the Disposition of the <hi>Organs,</hi> or instruments which the Faculty makes use of in the performance of its proper action. For, because the Organ is alwayes a Dissimilar or Compound Body, consisting of some parts that are crass and rigid; we are to conceive it to be at first somewhat stubborn, and not easily flexible to such various motions, as the Faculty requires to its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral operations: and therefore, as when we would have a Wand to be every way easily flexible, we are gently and frequently to bend it, that so the tenour of its fibres running longwise through it, may be here and there and every where made more lax, without any sensible divulsion; so if we desire to have our hands expedite for the performance of all those difficult motions that are necessary to the playing of a Lesson on the Lute, we must by degrees master that rigidity or clumsiness in the Nerves, Tendons, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scles and joints of our fingers, yea in the very skin and all other parts of our hands. Thus also Infants, while they stammer, and strive again and again to pronounce a word clearly and distinctly, do no more than by degrees master the stiffness and sluggishness of their tongues and other vocal organs, and so make them more flexible and voluble: and when by assuefaction they have made them easily flexible to all the motions required to the formation of that idiome, then at length come they to speak it plainly and perfectly. The same is also true, concerning the Brain, and those Organical parts therein, that are inservient to the act of Imagination, and by the imagination to the act of Discourse. For, though the Mind, when divorced from the the body, can operate most readily, and knows no difficulty or impediment in the act of Intellection; as being Immaterial, and so wanting no organs
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55028:154"/>
for the exercise of its reasoning Faculty: yet nevertheless, while it is adliged to the body and its material instruments, doth it remain subject to some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment in the execution of its functions; and because that impediment consisteth only in the less aptitude or inconformity of its proper organs, therefore the way to remove that impediment, is only by Assuefaction of it to study and ratiocination. And from this Assuefaction may the Mind be affirmed to acquire a certain Habit or Promptitude to perform its proper Actions; insomuch as by reason of that Habit, it operates more freely and expeditely: but, yet, in stricter Logick, that Habit ariseth chiefly to its Organs; as may be inferred only from hence, that the Organs are capable of increment and decrement, and to increase and decrease, is competent only to a thing that consisteth of parts; such as is the Organ, not the Mind.</p>

Lastly, when we, said <hi>Chiefly in Animals</hi>; we were unwilling totally to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Plants</hi>; because they also seem (at least Analogically) to acquire a kind of Habit: as is evident from their constant retaining of any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture or incurvation, which the hand of the Gardiner hath imposed upon them, while they were tender and flexible; as also that they may by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees be accustomed to forein soils, and (what is more admirable) if in their transplantation those parts of them, which at first respected the South or East, be converted to the North or West, they seldome thrive, never attain their due procerity.

His words are these; <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem existimo, Gravitatem non aliud esse, quàm Appetentiam quandam na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalem, partibus inditam à Divina Providentia Opificis Universorum; ut in unitatem integritatemque suam sese conferant, in formam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But, this opinion hath as weak a claim to our Assent, as either, of the former; as well because it cannot consist with the Encrease of Velocity in all Bodies descending perpendicularly, by how much nearer they approach the Earth, unless it can be demonstrated, that this encrease of Velocity in each degree of descent, ariseth only from the Encrease of Appetency of Union with the whole (which neither <hi>Copernicus</hi> himself, nor any other for Him, hath yet dared to assent): as in consideration of many other Defects, and some Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, which, that wonder of the Mathematicks, <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> hath demonstratively convicted it of (<hi>in Almegisti novi parte posteriori, lib.</hi> 9. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>de Systemate terrae motae.</hi>). Who, had He but as solidly determined all the Difficulties concerning the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Cause of this Affection in Bodies, called Gravity; as He hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed the Copernican Thesis of an Innate Appetency in the parts of the Earth to reunite themselves to the Whole: doubtless He had much encreased the obligations and gratitude of his Readers. But, making it his principal design to propugn the Physiology and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the Ancients, especially such Tenents as are admitted by the Schools, and allowed of by the Doctors of <hi>Rome,</hi> as most concordant to the

litteral sense of Sacred Writ: He waved that Province, seeming to adhaere to the common Doctrine of the <hi>Stagirite,</hi> formerly recited, and only occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally to defend it.</p>

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, this obscurity doth not imply a Nullity, i. e. it is high temerity to conclude that there is no External Cause of the stones Descent, because that External Cause is not equally manifest with that of its Ascent: unless any dare to affirm, that because He can perceive, when Iron is attracted to a Loadstone, no Externall Cause of that Attraction, therefore there can be none at all.

Which, indeed, seems well worthy our Doubt, because it is observable, that Walls, Pavements, and the like solid and immote Bodies, though they strongly resist the motion of bodies impinged against them; doe not yet impress any Contrary motion thereupon: the Rebound of a Ball or Bullet from a Wall, being the effect meerly of the same force imprest upon it by the Racket, or Gun-powder fired, which first moved it; as is evident even from hence, that the Resilition of them to greater or less di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, is according to the more or less of the Force imprest upon them. Which those Gunners well understand, who experiment the strength of their Powder, by the greatness of the bullets rebound from a Wall.</p>
                  <p>And to solve this Difficulty, we must <hi>distinguish</hi> betwixt Bodies, that are devoid of Motion, and which being distracted, have no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Restitution, whereby to recollect their dissociated particles, and so repair themselves; of which sort are Walls, Pavements, &amp;c: and such bodies that are actually in motion, and which by reason of a natural Elater, or Spring of Restitution, easily and speedily redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate themselves, and restore their severed parts to the same contexture and tenour, which they held before their violent distraction; to which classis the Aer doth principally belong. Now, concerning the <hi>First</hi> sort, what we object of the non-impression of any Contrary motion upon Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies impinged against them, is most certainly true: but not concerning the <hi>Latter.</hi> For, the Arm of a Tree, being inflected, doth not only resist the inflecting force, but with such a spring return to its natural site, as serveth to impel any body of competent weight, that shall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose its recurse, to great distance; as in the discharge of an Arrow from a Bow. Thus also the Aer, though otherwise unmoved, may be so distracted by a Body violently pervading it; as that the parts thereof, urged by their own native Confluxibility (the Cause of all Elaterical or Restorative Motion) must soon return to their natural te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and site, and not without a certain violence, and so replenish the

the force imprest upon it by the hand of Him, who projected it? And must it not thence follow, that the first imprest motion is so far from being decreased by the supposed Renitency of the superior Aer, that it is rather increased and promoted by the Circulation thereof: and upon conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the stone is carried upward twice as swiftly, as it falls down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, since it is impelled upward by two forces, but falls down again only by a single force? True it is, that while a stone is falling down, the distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted aer beneath seems to circulate into the place above deserted thereby: but, in case a stone be held up on high in the Aer by a mans hand, or other support, and that support be withdrawn so gently, as to cause no considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble commotion in the Aer; in this case there seems to be no reason, why the Aer should flow from above down upon it in the first moment of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse. Besides, when a stone projected upward, hath attained to the highest point of its ascent, at which there seems to be a short pause, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite from motion, caused by the aequilibration of the two Contrary Forces, the Movent and Resistent: why doth not the stone absolutely <hi>quiesce</hi> in that place, there being in the Aer no Cause, which should rather Depel it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These considerations, we ingenuously confess, are potent, and put us to the exigent of exploring some other External Principle, beside the motion of Restitution in the Aer; such as may <hi>Begin</hi> the Downward motion of the stone, when gently dropt off from some convenient supporter, or when it is at the zenith or highest point of its ascent, and and at the term of its Aequilibration overcome the Resistence of the subjacent Aer, that so it may not only yeeld to the stone in the first moment of its Descent; but by successive Circulations afterward promote and gradually accelerate its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion once begun.

Which that we may assert with more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity, let us suppose a stone to be placed in those Imaginary spaces which are the outside of the World, and in which God, had He so pleased,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55028:159"/>
might have created more worlds; and then examine, whether it be more reasonable, that that stone should rather move toward this our Earth, than remain absolutely immote in that part of the Ultramandan spaces wherein we suppose it posited. If you conceive, that it would tend toward the Earth; imagine not only the Earth, but also the whole machine of the world to be Annihilated, and that all those vast spaces, which the Universe now possesseth, were as absolutely Inane, as they were before the Creation: and then at least, because there could be no Centre, and all spaces must be alike indifferent, you will admit, that the stone would remain fixt in the same place, as having no Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, or Tendency to this part of those spaces, which the Earth now possesseth. Imagine the World to be then again restored, and the Earth to be resituate in the place as before its adnihilation; and then can you conceive that the stone would spontaneously tend toward it? If you suppose the <hi>Affirmative</hi>; you will be reduced to inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable difficulties, not to grant the Earth to affect the stone, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consequence, to transmit to it some certain Virtue, consisting in the substantial Emanations, not any simple and immaterial Quality, whereby to give it notice of its being restored to its pristine situation and condition. For, how otherwise can you suppose the stone should take cognizance of, and be moved toward the Earth. Now, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, what can follow, but that stones, and all other Bodies account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heavy, must tend toward the Earth, only because they are <hi>Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> to it, by rays or streams of Corporeal Emanations from it to them transmitted? Go to then, let us farther imagine, that some certain space in the Atmosphere, were, by Power supernatural, made so Empty, as that nothing could arrive thereat either from the Earth, or any other Orbe: can you then conceive, that a stone placed in that Inanity, would have any Tendency toward the Earth, or Affectation to be united to its Centre? Doubtless, no more, than if it were posited in the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundan spaces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because, having nothing of Communication therewith, or any other part of the Universe, the case would be all one with the stone, as if there were no Earth, no World, no Centre. Wherefore, since we observe a stone from the greatest heighth, to which any natural force can elevate the same, to tend in a direct or perpendicular line to the Earth; what can be more rational than for us to conceive, that the Cause of that Tendency in the stone is onely this, that it hath some communication with the Earth; and that not by any naked or Immaterial Quality, but some certain Corporeal, though most subtile Emanations from the Earth? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, since the Aer incumbent upon the stone, is not sufficient to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin its motion of Descent.</p>

                     </gap> such pernicity, should be attracted by such slender means, as our supposed magnetick Emanations: and therefore think it our duty to satisfie you concerning this Doubt. We Answer (1) That a very great quantity of Iron (proportionately) is easily and nimbly rusht into the arms of a Loadstone meerly by Rays of most subtle particles, such as can be discovered no way, but by their Effect. (2) That stones, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther massy Concretions have no such great ineptitude, or Resistence to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55028:159"/>
motion, as is commonly praesumed. For, if a stone of an hundred pound weight be suspended in the Aer, by a small wier, or chord: how small a force is required to the moving of it hither? Why therefore should a greater force be required to the Attraction of it downward. (3) When you lift up a stone or other body from the Earth, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but observe that it makes some Resistence to your Hand, more or less according to the bulk thereof; which Resistence ariseth from hence, that those many magnetique lines, deradiated to, and fastned upon it, by their several Deflexions and Decussations, hold it as it were fast chained down to the Earth, so that unless a greater force intervene, such as may master the Earth Retentive power, and break off the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netique lines, it could never be avelled and amoved from the Earth. And hence is it, that by how much the greater force is imprest upon a stone, at its projection upward; by so many more degrees of excess doth that imprest force transcend the force of the Retentive Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netique lines, and consequently to so much a greater Altitude is the stone mounted up in the Aer: and <hi>è contra.</hi> Which is also the Reason, why the Imprest Force, being most vigorous in the first degree of the stones ascent, doth carry it the most vehemently in the beginning; because it is not then Refracted: but afterward the stone moves slower and slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, because in every degree of ascention, it looseth a degree of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest Force, until at length the same be so diminished, as to come to an Aequipondium with the Contrary force of the magnetique Rays of the Earth detracting it Downward.</p>

                  <p>And the Reason of this Aequivelocity of Unequal weights, seems to be this; that of two Bullets, the one of only an ounce, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an hundred pounds weight, dropt from the battlements of an high tower, at the same instant, though the Greater Bullet be attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by more magnetique lines deradiate from the Earth, yet hath it more particles to be attracted, than the Lesser: so that there being a certain Commensuration betwixt the Force Attractive, and the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Matter Attracted; on either part the Force must be such, as sufficeth to the performance of the motion of either in the same space of time; and consequently, both the Bullets must descend with equal Velocity, and arrive at the surface of the Earth in one and the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

with the great body or Globe thereof; yet is it not Congregative of the whole Globe to any thing else, as if the Globe of the Earth were to be united to the Moon, or any other Orbe in the World. Nor can it be affirmed, that Gravity, or this Virtue to motion Direct, is conceded to the Terraqueous Orbe, to the end it should, at the Creation, carry it self to that place, which is Lowest in the Universe; or being there posited, constantly retain it self therein: since in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse is neither Highest, nor Lowest place, but only Respectively to the site of an Animal, and chiefly of Man, whose Head is accounted the Highest, and Feet the Lowest part; in the same manner as there is no Right, nor Left side in Nature, but comparatively to the site of the parts in mans body, and in reference to the Heavens. For, those Lateralities are not determined by any general and certain standard in Nature: but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously assigned according to our Imagination. The Hebrews, Chaldeans, and Persians, confronting the Sun at his arising in the East; place the Right side of the world in the South: as likewise did all the Roman South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers, when they took their Auguries. The Philosopher takes that to be the East, from whence the Heavens begin their Circumgyration: and so assigns also the right hand to the South. The Astronomer, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding chiefly the South and Meridian Sun, accounts that the Dextrous part of Heaven, which respecteth his right hand, and thats the West. And Poets, differing from all the rest, turn their faces to the West, and so assign the term of Right to the North: for otherwise <hi>Ovid</hi> must be guilty of a gross mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in that verse, <hi>Utque duae dextrá zonae, totidemque sinistrâ.</hi> Hence is it, that as the East cannot be the Right side of the World, unless to Him, who faceth the North: so is the Vertical point of the world not to be accounted the Highest part of the Universe, but onely as it respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Head of a man standing on any part of the Earth; because, if the same man travail to the Antipodes, that which was before the Highest, will then be the Lowest part of the World. This considered, we must praefer that solid opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> that in the World there is an Extreme, and a Middle Place, but no Highest and Lowest; to that meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly petitionary one of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that all Bodies tend toward the Centre of the Earth, as to the Lowest place in the Universe.</p>

When a man holds a plate of Iron of 6 or 7 ounces weight, in his hand, with a vigorous Loadstone placed at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient distance, underneath his hand; and finds the weight of the Iron to be encreased from ounces to pounds: If <hi>Aristotle</hi> on one side should tell him, that that great weight is a Quality essentially inhaerent in the Iron, and <hi>Kepler</hi> or <hi>Gilbert,</hi> on the other, affirm to him, that that weight is a quality meerly <hi>Adventitious,</hi> or imprest upon it by the Attractive influence of the Loadstone subjacent; 'tis easie to determine, to which of those so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary judgements he would incline his assent. If so, well may we conceive the Gravity of a stone, or other terrene body, to belong not so much to the Body it self, as to the Attraction of that Grand Magnet, the Terraqueous Globe lying underneath it. For, supposing that a Loadstone were, unknown to you, placed underneath your hand, when you lifted up a piece of Iron from the earth; though it might be pardonable for you to conclude, that the great weight, which you would observe therein, was a Quality essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially inhaerent in the Iron, when yet in truth it was only External and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractitious; because you were ignorant of the Loadstone subjacent; yet, if after you were informed that the Loadstone was placed underneath your hand, you should persever in the same opinion, the greatest Candor imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble could not but condemn you of inexcusable pertinacity in an Error. Thus also your ignorance of the Earths being one Great Loadstone may excuse your adhaerence to the erroneous position of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> concerning the formal Reason of Gravity; but, when you shall be convinced, that the Terrestial Globe is naturally endowed with a certain Attractive or Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Virtue, in order to the retention of all its parts in cohaerence to it self, and retraction of them when by violence distructed from it, and that gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is nothing but the effect of that virtue; you can have no Plea left for the palliation of your obstinacy, in case you recant not your former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion.</p>

of its Contexture, as in the Adamant, which as Naturalists affirm, no Fire can demolish or dissolve. (2.) That they ought to be <hi>Spherical in Figure,</hi> is probable, yea necessary from hence; that of all others they are most Agile, and evolve themselves <hi>quoquoversùm,</hi> on all parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, into which they are admitted. And Geometry teacheth, that no figure is so easily moved, as a Sphere, whether naturally, or violently. First, <hi>Naturally</hi>; because, by how much neerer to a Sphere the figure of any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid body approacheth, by so much the more speedily doth it descend, as is observed of globular stones in Water: and a round stone rowles it self far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and swifter downe hill, than a plane or angular one. Secondly, <hi>Violently,</hi> because a globular stone may be projected much farther, than one of any other figure. This is also evident in the Motion of Volutation; so that the line of direction to the Centre of the World (if any such there be) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the axis of the Globe, the motion of it is most hardly refracted and arrested. For, there are 3 points, thorowe which the direct imaginary line, in which alone a Globe can quiesce, must pass, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Centre of the World,</hi> the <hi>Centre of Gravity</hi> in the Globe, and the <hi>point of Contact</hi>: and if either of these 3 be without, or beside the line of quiet, a Globe once moved shall never rest, but be continually moved, until all the 3 points be in the line of direction. Furthermore, how easie it is to impel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a Globe, is demonstrable meerly from hence, that being posited upon a perfect plane, it can touch the same but only in one point; and so relying upon that point, may most easily be deturbed from that slender support; but in all other Figures the reason of innixion or Relying, is quite contrary. Lastly, as a sphere doth most easily admit an imprest motion; so doth it longest retain the same, most violently press upon other occurring bodies, and most equally dispence its conceived force; as hath been profoundly demonstrated by <hi>Magnenus (in theoricae militaris lib.</hi> 1. <hi>theorem.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5) (3) And that they must be also <hi>superlatively swift in motion,</hi> may be argued not only <hi>à posteriori,</hi> from the impetuous discussion and separation of the particles of bodies by them, and their uncessant aestuation among themselves arietating each other: but also <hi>à Priori,</hi> because, being spherical, they are most mobile. Thus much, at least in importance, we have from <hi>Philoponus (in</hi> 1 <hi>physic.</hi>) where he saith, <hi>Sphaericus Atomos, tanquàm facillimè mobiles, esse Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. the Exiquity of particles, and celerity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that the Patrons of Atoms praesuming the Calorifick Atoms to be extreamly Exile, <hi>i. e</hi> as small as <hi>Plato</hi> supposeth the points and angles of his Pyramids to be: we do not perceive any considerable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their opinion and his. But before we take off our pen from this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, we are to advertise; that indeed all Atoms, of their own nature, are inexcogitably swift; and so that our assertion of the superlative Velocity of Calorifick Atoms, doth appertain only to Atoms as they are in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, where their native Velocity and Agility is retarded and diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reciprocal cohaerence and revinction. And, therefore, seeing that all Atoms, agitated by their essential mobility, are in perpetual attempt to extricate themselves from Concretions, that so they may attain their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55028:165"/>
freedom of motion; that none can so soon extricate and disengage themselves; as those that are spherical; because such cannot be impeded by the small hooks, or angles of others. <hi>Cum enim sphaera <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We observe, therefore, that the Atoms of Fire, imprisoned in Concretions, have <hi>Two</hi> ways of attaining liberty. (1.) By <hi>Evocation,</hi> or the Assistance of other Atoms of the same nature; when such invading and insinuating themselves into the centrals of a body, do so dissociate its particles, as that dissolving the impediments or chains of the igneous Atoms therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, they not only give them an opportunity, but in a manner sollicite them to extricate themselves. And by this way do the Atoms of Fire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Wood, Wax, Turpentine, Oyle, and all other Inflammable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, extricate themselves, when they are set on fire; the sparks or flame, wherewith they are accensed, penetrating their contexture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the remoraes, which detained and impeded their internal Atoms of Fire, and exciting them to Emption: Which thereupon issue forth in swarms, and with the violence of their exsilition drive before them, in the apparence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> fuliginous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Exhalations or smoak, those dissimilar parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which supprest and incarcerated them, during the integrity of the Concretion. (2.) By <hi>Motion,</hi> or <hi>Concussion</hi>; and that either Intestine, or External. First, <hi>Intestine</hi>; when, after many evolutions, the igneous Atoms, included in a Body, do of themselves dissociate and discuss those heterogeneous masses, wherein they were imprisoned: Which they chiefly effect, when after some of them have by spontaneous motion attained their freedom, if any thing be circumstant, which hath the power of repelling them, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; for, in that case, returning again into the centrals of the body, from whence they came; and so associating with their fellows, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the discussion of the remaining impediments, and concur to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Emption. From this Motion ariseth that Heat, or Fire, which is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly ascribed to the <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> or <hi>Circumobsistence of Cold</hi>; as, for Example, when a heap of new Corn, or Mowe of green Hay, being kept too close, during the time of its fermentation, or sweating (as our Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For, if we strictly examine the ground of that common Assertion, we shall find it to consist only in a misinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our sense; <hi>i. e.</hi> though Springs, Wells, Caves, and all subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous places are really as Cold in Winter, as Summer; yet do we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them to be warm: because we suppose that we bring the organs of the sense of Touching alike disposed in Winter and Summer, not considering that the same thing doth appear Cold to a hot, and warm to a Cold hand, nor observing, that oyle will be conglaciated, in Winter, in subterraneous Cells, which yet appear warm to those, who enter them, but not in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when yet they appear Cold. Secondly, by Motion <hi>External,</hi> when a Sawe grows Hot, by continuall affriction against wood, or stone; or when fire is kindled by the long and hard affriction of 2 dry sticks, &amp;c. This is manifest even from hence, that unless the bodies agitated, or rubbed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst each other, are such as contain igneous Atoms in them; no motion, however lasting and violent, can excite the least degree of Heat in them. For, Water agitated most continently and violently, never conceives the lest warmth: because it is wholly destitute of Calorifick Atoms. Lastly, as for the Heat, excited in a body, upon the Motion of its <hi>Whole,</hi> whether it be moved by it self, or some External movent; of this sort is that Heat, of which motion is commonly affirmed to be the sole Cause: as when an Animal grows hot with running, &amp;c. and a Bullet acquires heat in flying, &amp;c. And thus much concerning the manner of Emancipation of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorifick Atoms.</p>

And hereupon we may safely conclude, that an Unctuous substance is as it were the chief, nay the sole <hi>Matrix</hi> or <hi>Seminary</hi> of Fire or Heat; and that such Bodies only, as are capable of incalescence and inflammation, must contain somewhat of Fatness and unctuo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes, we confess, it is observed, that Concretions, which have no such Unctuosity at all in them, as Water, are Hot, but yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow them to be properly said to wax Hot, but to be made Hot; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the principle of that their Heat is not Internal to them, but <hi>External</hi> or <hi>Ascititious.</hi> For instance; when Fire is put under a vessel of Water, the small bodies, or particles of Fire by degrees insinuate themselves tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the pores of the vessel into the substance of the Water, and diffuse themselves throughout the same; though not so totally, at first, as not to leave, the major part of the particles of the Water untoucht: to which

                     <hi>since, if our praecedent Assertion be true, the Heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Lime ought to be supprest so much the more, by how much the more Aqueous Humidity is admixt unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Difficulty is discussed by Answering; that the Aqueous Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Lime-stone is indeed wholly evaporated by fire in its calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but yet the Pingous, or Unctuous for the most part remains, so that its Atoms of Fire lye still blended and incarcerated therein: and when those expede themselves, and by degrees expire into the ambient aer, if they be impeded and repelled by water affused, they recoyle upon the grumous masses of the Lime, and by the Circumobsistence of the Humidity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more congregated; and so upon the uniting of their forces make way for the Exsilition of the other Atoms of Fire, which otherwise could not have attained their liberty but slowly and by succession one after another. So that all the Atoms of Fire contained in the Lime, issuing forth together, they break through the water, calefie it, and make it bubble or boyle up; the calefied parts thereof being yet cohaerent to the uncale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

Sol.</note>The Third Problem is, <hi>Why the Heat of Lime, kindled by Water is more intense than that of any Flame whatever?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Answer, that forasmuch as Flame is nothing but Fire Rarefied, or as it were an Explication, or Diffusion of those Atoms of Fire, which were lately ambuscadoed in some Unctuous matter; and that all Fire is so much more intense or vehement, by how much more Dense it is, <hi>i. e.</hi> by how much the more congregated the Atoms which constitute it are: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Heat of Lime unslaking more vehement than that of any Flame, in regard the smallest grains of Lime contain in them many Atoms of Fire, which are not so diffused or disgregated in a moment, as those in Flame. So that a mans hand being waved to and fro in Flame, is invaded by incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably fewer particles of Fire, than when it is dipt into, or waved through water at the unslaking of Lime thereby; the small granes of Lime adhaering unto, and insinuating into the pores of the hand, the many Atoms of fire invelloped in them, incontinently explicate themselves, violently penetrate and dilacerate the skin, and other sentient parts, and so produce that Pungent and Acute pain, which is felt in all Ambustions. From the same Reason also is it, that a glowing Coale burns more vehemently than Flame: and the Coals of more solid wood, as Juniper, Cedar, Guaiacum, Ebony, Oke, &amp;c. more vehemently than those of Looser wood, such as Willow, Elder, Pine tree, &amp;c. The like Disproportion is observable also in the Flames of divers Fewels; for in the flame of Juniper are contained far more Igneous Atoms, than in that of Willow: and consequently they burn so much more vehemently. True it is, that spirit of Wine enflamed, is so much more Ardent, by how much more refined and cohobated: yet this proceedeth from another Cause; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Atoms of Fire issuing from spirit of Wine of the first Extraction, have much of the Phletegme, or Aqueous moysture of the Wine intermixt among them; and so cannot be alleaged

                  </p>
                  <p>To which it is easily Answered; that Oyle, being of an Unctuous and Tenacious consistence, and so having its particles more firmly cohaerent, than Water, doth not permit the Atoms of Fire entered into it, so easily to transpire: so that being more agminous, or swarming in oyl, they must invade, and dilacerate the hand of a man, immersed into it, both more thickly and deeply, than those more Dispersed ones contained in boyling Water. Which is also the Reason, why Oyle made fervent is much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in cooling, than Water: and may be extended to the Solution of the</p>

                     <hi>when melted, or made glowing hot, burn more violently, than the Fire that melteth, or heateth them; especially, since no Atoms of Fire can justly be affirmed to be lodged in them, as in their proper seminary, and so not to be educed from them, upon their Liquation, or Ignition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, the Heat, wherewith they procure Ambustion, being not domestick, but only Adventitious to them from the Fire, wherein they are melted, or made red hot; the reason why they burn so extreamly, must be this, that they are exceedingly Compact in substance, and so their particles being more tenacious or reciprocally cohaerent, then those of wood, oyle, or any other body whatever, they more firmly keep together the Atoms of fire immitted into them: insomuch that a man cannot touch them with his finger, but instantly it is in all points invaded with whole swarms of igneous Atoms, and most fiercely compunged and dilacerated. And, as for the <hi>Derasion of the skin</hi> from any part of an Animal, immersed into melted metal; this ariseth partly from the total dissolution of the tenour of the skin by the dense, and on every side compungent Atoms of Fire; partly from the Compression and Resistence of the parts of the Metal, now made Fluid, which are both so great, that upon the withdrawing of the member immersed into the metal, the part which is immediately prest upon by the particles thereof, is detained behind, and that's the skin.

We say, if we begin from either of these weak Fires, and run through all the intermediate ones, to that of melted Gold, which all men acknowledge to be the Highest: we shall soon be convinced, that the Degrees of Fire are so various, as to arise even to innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merability.</p>

For, since the Igneous Atoms, exsilient from their involucrum, or seminary, and invading the extrems of a body objected to them, are subject to easy Repercussion, or (rather) Resilition from it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the Calefaction, Adustion, or Inflammation of a body, it is not sufficient, that the body be only moved along by, or over the Fire: but it must be held neer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in it, so long as till the first invading Igneous Atoms, which otherwise would recoyle from it, be impelled on, and driven into the pores of the same, by streams of other Igneous Atoms contiguously, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and pressing upon them. And, however the space of time, be almost in assignably short, in which the finger of a man, touching a glowing Coale, or melted metal, is burned; because, the Atoms of Fire are therein exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dense and Agminous, and so penetrate the skin, in all points: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless common observation assures, that in the General a certain space of time is necessary to the Effect of Calefaction or Ambustion; and that so much the Longer, by how much the Fewer, or more Disgregated the Igneous Atoms are, either in the Body Calefying, or the Aer contermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous thereto. And this (as formerly) to the end, that the Motion of the Igneous Atoms first assaulting the object may be continued, and a supply of fresh ones, promoting and impelling the former, be afforded from the Focus, or Seminary. Hence is it, that a mans hand may be frequently Waved to and fro in Flame, without burning; because the Atoms of Fire, which invade it, are repercussed, and not by a continued aflux of others driven foreward into its pores, the motion of his hand preventing the Continuity of their Fluor: but, if his hand be held still in the flame, though but a very short time, it must be burned; because the first invading Atoms of Fire are impelled on by others, and those again by others, in a continent fluor, so that their Motion is continued, and a constant supply maintained. Hence comes it also, that no Metal can be molten only by a Flash, or transient touch of the Fire (for, we are not yet fully satisfied of the verity of that vulgar tradition, of the instantaneous melting of money in a purse, or of a sword blade in its sheath, by Lightning: and if we were, yet could we assign that prodigious Effect to some more probable Cause; <hi>viz.</hi> the impetuosity of the motion, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Coarctation of those Atoms of Fire, of which that peculiar spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Lightning doth consist) but it must be so long held in, or over the Fire, as until the Igneous Atoms have totally pervaded its contexture, and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55028:168"/>
dissociated all its particles: and therefore, so much the longer stay in the fire doth every Metal require to its Fusion; by how much the more Compact and Tenacious its particles are.</p>

                  <p n="2">(2.) <hi>The more or less easie Attraction of its Pabulum, or Nourishment.</hi> For, Lamps, in which the Flame draweth the oyle from a greater distance, always burn much longer, than Candles, or Tapers, where the circumference of the fewel is but small; and the broader the surface of the Oyle, or Wax, wherein the Wiek is immersed, so much the longer doth the flame thereof endure; not only in regard of the greater Quantity of Nourishment, but of its slower Calefaction, and so of its longer Resistence to the absum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive faculty of the flame. Since it is observed, that the Coolness of the Nourishment, doth make it more slowly consumable: as in Candles float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in water. This was experimented in that service of our <hi>quondam</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Court, called <hi>All night</hi>; which was a large Cake of Wax, with the Wiek, set in the middest: so that the flame, being fed with nourishment less heated before hand, as coming far off, must of necessity last much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than any Wax Taper of a small circumference.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) <hi>Various Conditions of the same Materials.</hi> For, Old and Hard Candles, whether of Wax, or Tallowe, maintain flame much longer than New, or soft. Which good Houswives knowing, use no Candles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a year old, and such as have, for greater induration, been laid a good while in Bran, or Flower. And, from the same reason is it, that Wax, as being more firm and hard, admixt to Tallowe and made up into Candles, causeth them to be more lasting, then if they were praepared of Tallowe alone.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Different Conditions, and Tempers of the ambient Aer.</hi> For, the Quiet and Closeness of the Aer, wherein a Taper burneth, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to the prolongation of its flame: and contrariwise, the Agitation
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55028:169"/>
thereof, by winds, or fanning, conduceth as much to the shortning of it: insomuch as the motion of flame makes it more greedily attract, and more speedily devour its sustenance. Thus a Candle lasteth much longer in a Lanthorne, than at large in a spacious roome. Which also might be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as one Cause of the long Duration of those subterranean Lamps, such as have been found (if credit be due to the tradition of <hi>Bapt. Porta, (lib.</hi> 12. <hi>Magiae natural. cap. ultim.</hi>) <hi>Hermolaus Barbarus (in lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Dio cap.</hi> 11.) <hi>and Cedrenus Histor. Compend.</hi>) All which most confidently avouch it, upon authentique testimonies.) in the Urns of many Noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, many hundreds of years after their Funerals. Here should our Reader bid us stand, and deliver him our positive judgement, upon this stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Rarity, which hath been uged by some Laureat Antiquaries, as a cheif Argument of the transcendency of the Ancients Knowledge as in all Arts, so in the admirable secrets of Pyrotechny, above that of Later Ages; as we durst not be so uncharitable, to quaestion the Veracity of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Inventors, or Reporters of it: so should we not be so uncivil, as not to releive his Curiosity, at least with a short story, that may light Him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards farther satisfaction. A certain <hi>Chymist</hi> there was, not many years since, who having decocted Litharge of Gold, Tartar, Cinnaber, and Calx vive, in spirit of Vinegre, until the Vinegre was wholly evaporated; close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covering and luting up the earthen vessel, wherein the Decoction was made, buried it deeply in a dry Earth, for 7 moneths together (in order to more speedy maturation, expected from the Antiperistasis of Cold) came at length to observe what became of his Composition: and opening the vessel, observed a certain bright Flame to issue from thence, and that so vehement, as it fired the hair of his eyebrowes and head. Now, having furnished our Reader with this faithful Narrative; we leave it to his owne determination: Whether it be not more probable, that those Coruscati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Flashes of Light, perceived to issue from Vials of Earth, found in the demolisht sepulchres of the Great <hi>Olybius,</hi> and some eminent Romans, at the instant of their breaking up by the spade, or pickaxe; did proceed rather from some such Chymical Mixture, as this of our Chymist (who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Light by the hazard of Blindness) which is of that nature as to be in a moment kindled, and yield a shortlived flame, upon the intromission of Aer into the vessel, wherein it is contained; than from any Fewel, that is so slowly Absumable by Fire, as to maintain a constant Flame, for many hundred years together, without extinction, and that in so small a vial, as the Fume must needs recoyle and soon suffocate the Flame. But we return from our Digression, and directly pursue our embost Argument. It much importeth the greater and less Continuance of Flame, whether the Aer be <hi>Warm,</hi> or <hi>Cold, Dry</hi> or <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>st.</hi> For <hi>Cold</hi> Aer irritateth flame, by Circumobsistence, and causeth it burn more fiercely, and so less durably; as is manifest from hence, that Fire scorcheth in frosty wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but <hi>Warme</hi> Aer, by making flame more calm and gentle, and so more sparing of its nourishment, much helpeth the Continuance of it. If <hi>Moist,</hi> because it impedeth the motion of the igneous Atoms, and so in some degree quencheth flame, at least, makes it burn more dimly and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; it must of necessity advance the Duration of flame: and contrariwise, <hi>Drie</hi> Aer, meerly as drie, produceth Contrary Effect, though not in the same proportion; nay so little, that some Naturalists have concluded the Driness of Aer to be only indifferent, as to the Duration of Flame.</p>

To argue by the most familiar way of Instance; when Heat hath dissolved a piece of Ice, consisting of water, earth, and perhaps of gravel and many small Festucous bodies commixt; the Earth, Sand and other Terrene parts sink downe and convene together at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, the water returns to its native fluidity, and possesseth the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Continent, and the strawes swim on the surface of the water: not that it is essential to the Heat so to dispose them; but essential to them, being dissociated and so at liberty, each to take it proper place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the several degrees of their Gravity. Thus also, when a Mass of various Metals is melted by Fire, each metal, indeed, takes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per region in the Crucible, or fusory vessel: but yet the Congregation of the Homogeneous particles of each particular Metal, is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately caused, but only occasioned, <hi>i. e.</hi> Accidentally brought to pass by the Disgregation or praecedent separation of the particles of the whole Heterogeneous Concretion, by heat. Again, the Energy of every Cause in Nature ceaseth, upon the production of its perfect Effect; but the Effect of Heat ceaseth not, when the Homogenieties of the mass of Ice, or Metal, are Congregated, but continues the same after, as before, <hi>i. e.</hi> to Dissolve the compage of the Metal, or Ice, and Dissociate all the particles thereof: for, so long as the Heat is continued, so long do the Ice and Metal remain Dissolved and Fluid. This considered, what shall we say to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who makes it the Essential Attribute of Heat, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregare Homogenea,</hi> to Congregate Homogeneous Bodies. Truly, rather then openly convict so great a Votary to truth of so palpable an Error; we should gladly become his Compurgator, and palliate his mistake with an indulgent comment; that in his Definition of Heat, to be a Quality genuinely Congregative of Homogeneous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, He had his eye, not upon the General Effect of Heat (which He could not but observe, to Disgregate the particles of all things, aswel Homogeneous, as Heterogeneous.) but upon some special Effect of it upon some particular Concretions, such as are Compounded of parts of Divers natures, as Wood and all Combustible bodies Concerning which, indeed, His Assertion is thus far justifiable, that the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is so dissolved by fire, as that the Dissimilar parts of it are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sequestred each from other, and every one attains it proper place; the Aereal part ascending and associating with the Aer, the Aqueous evaporating, the Igneous discovering themselves in Flame, and the earthy remaining behind, in the forme of Ashes. But alas! this favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conjecture cannot excuse, nor gild over his Incogitancy; for, the Congregation of the Homogenous particles of a Body, dissolved by Fire, in the place most convenient to their particular Nature, ariseth immediately from their own Tendency thither, or (that we may speak more like our selves, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Disciples of <hi>Epicurus</hi>) from their respective proportions of Gravity, the more Heavy extruding and so impelling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the less heavy: and only Accidentally from Heat, or as it hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved the caement, and so the Continuity of the Concretion, wherein they were confusedly and promiscuously blended together. So that Truth will not dispense with our Connivence at so dangerous a Lapse, though in one of Her choicest Favorites; chiefly, because it hath already deluded

so many of Her seekers, under the glorious title of a Fundamental Axiome: but strictly enjoynes Us, to Conclude; that Heat, <hi>per se,</hi> or of its own nature, is alwayes a <hi>Disgregative Quality</hi>; and that it is of of meer Accident, that upon the sequestration of Heterogeneities, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous Natures are associated, rather than, <hi>è contra,</hi> that it is of meer Accident, that while Heat Congregates Homogeneous, it should Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate Heterogeneous Natures, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> most inconsiderately affirmed and taught.</p>

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Art.</hi> 2. That Cold is no <hi>Privation</hi> of Heat; but a <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Quality</hi>: demonstrated.</note>That Cold, therefore, is a <hi>Real Ens,</hi> and hath a <hi>Positive Nature</hi> of its own, may be thus demonstrated. (1.) Such are the proper Effects of Cold, as cannot, without open absurdity, be ascribed to a simple Privation; since a Privation is incapable of Action: for, Cold compingeth all Bodies, that are capable of its efficacy, and congealeth Water into Ice, which is more than ever any man durst assigne to a privation. And, when a man thrusts his hand into cold Water, the Cold He then feels, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sayd to be a meer privation of the Heat of his hand; since, his hand remains as Hot, if not hotter than before; the Calorifick Atoms of his hand being more united, by the circumobsistence of the Cold. (2.) All Heat doth Concentre and unite it self, upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiperistasis of Cold; not from fear of a privation, because Heat is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of a sense of its owne being, and so of fear to lose that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if not, yet Nothing can have no Contrariety, nor Activity: but, from Repulsion, as we have formerly delivered. (3.) Though many bodies are observed to become Cold, upon the absence, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of Heat: yet is it the intromission of the Quality contrary to Heat, that makes them so; for, if External Cold be not introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their pores, they cannot be so properly sayd, <hi>Frigescere,</hi> to wax Cold, as <hi>Decalescere,</hi> to wax less Hot. Thus a stone, which is not Hot, nor Cold, unless by Accident, being admoved to the fire, is made Hot; and removed from the fire, you cannot (unless the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Aer intromit its Cold into it) so justly say, that it growes Cold, as that it grows Less hot, or returnes to its native state of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency. (4.) When Water (vulgarly, though untruely praesumed to be naturally or essentially cold) is congealed into Ice by the Cold of the aer, it would be most shamefully absurd, to affirm, that the Cold of the Ice ariseth meerly from the Absence of Heat in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; because it is the essential part of the supposition, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had no Heat before. (5.) Privation knowes no Degrees; for the Word imports the totall Destitution, or Absence of somewhat
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55028:170"/>
formerly had, otherwise, in rigid truth, it can be no Privation (and therefore our common Distinction of a Partial, and Total privation, hath lived thus long meerly upon indulgence and tolleration.): but Cold hath its various Degrees, for Water is colder to the touch than Earth, Ice than Water, &amp;c. therefore Cold is no Privative, but <hi>a Positive Quality.</hi>
                  </p>

That as Heat hath its origine from Atoms most exile in magnitude, spherical in figure, and so most swift of motion: so must its Contrary, Cold, be derived from principles of Contrary proprieties, <hi>viz.</hi> Atoms not so exile in magnitude, of a Figure most opposite to a sphere, and so of most slow motion. (2.) That none but <hi>Tetrahedical</hi> Atoms can justly challenge to themselves these proprieties, that are requisite to the Essensification of Cold. For (1.) If we regard their <hi>Magnitude,</hi> a Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedical Atom may be Greater than a Spherical, by its whole Angles: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Sphere may be circumscribed within a Tetrahedon. (2.) If the <hi>Figure</hi> it self; none is more opposed to a Sphere, than a Tetrahedon: because it is Angular, and farthest recedeth from that infinity, or (rather) innumerability of small insensible sides, which a profound Geometrician may speculate in a Sphere. (3.) If their <hi>Mobility</hi>; no body can be more unapt for motion, than a Tetrahedical one: for, what vulgar Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians impute to a Cube, <hi>viz.</hi> that it challengeth the palme from all other Figures, for Ineptitude to motion, doth indeed more rightfully belong to a Tetrahedon; as will soon appear to any equitable consideration, upon the perpension of the reasons alleagable on both parts. But here we are to signifie, that this ineptitude to motion proper to Tetrahedical Atoms, is not meant of Atoms at liberty, and injoying freedom of motion, in the Inane space; since, in that state all Atoms are praesumed to be of equal velocity: but only of Atoms wanting that liberty, such as are included in Concretions, and by intestine evolutions continually attempt Emancipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Exsilition. (4.) It cannot impugne, at least, not stagger the reasonableness of this conjectural Assignation of a Tetrahedical figure to the Atoms of Cold, that <hi>Plato (in Timaeo)</hi> definitely adscribeth a <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midal Figure</hi> to Fire, not to the Aer, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Atoms of Heat, not to those of Cold: because, if any shall thereupon conceive, that a Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid is most capable of penetrating the skin of a man, and consequently of producing therein the sense of Heat, rather than Cold; He may be soon converted by considering a passage in our former section of this Chapter, that the Atoms of Heat may, though spherical, as well in respect of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Exility (which the point of no Pyramid can exceed) as of the veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Motion, prick as sharply, and penetrate as deeply, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the smallest Pyramid imaginable. To which may be conjoyned, that the Atoms of Cold, according to our supposition, are also capable of Pungency and Penetration; and consequently that a kind of Adustion is also assignable to great Cold; according to that expression of <hi>Virgil</hi> (1 <hi>Georg.</hi>) <hi>Boceae penetrabile frigus adurit.</hi> For, in fervent Frosts (to use the same Epithite, as the sweet-tongued <hi>Ovid,</hi> in the same case) when our hands are, as the English phrase is, Benumm'd with Cold; if we hold them to the fire, we instantly feel a sharp and pricking pain in them. Which ariseth from hence, that the Atoms of Heat, while by their agility and constant supplies they are dispelling those of Cold, which had entred and possessed the pores of our hands, do variously commove and invert them; they are hastily driven forth, and in their contention and egress, cut and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate the flesh and skin, as well with their small points, as edges lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their points, and so produce an acute and pungitive pain. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the sage <hi>Sennertus (de Atomis)</hi> grounds his advice, that in extreme cold weather, when our hands are so stupified, as that an Extinction of their vital heat may be feared; we either immerse them into cold water, or rub them in snow, that the Atoms of Cold, which have wedged each other
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55028:171"/>
into the pores, may be gently and gradually called forth, before we hold them to the fire: and this, least not only grievous pain be caused, but a Gangrene ensue, from the totall dissolution of the Contexture of our hands by the violent intrusion of the Cold Atoms, when they are forcibly impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and agitated by the igneous; as the sad experience of many in <hi>Ruscia, Groenland,</hi> the <hi>Alps</hi>

                  <p>To determine this Antique Dispute, therefore, we first observe; that it arose cheifly from a <hi>Petitionary</hi> Principle. For it appears, that all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who engaged therein, took it for granted, that the Quality of Heat was eminently inhaerent in Fire, the chief of the 4 Principal or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary substances; and thereupon inferred, that the Contrary Quality, Cold, ought in like manner to have its principal residence in one of the other 3: when, introth, they ought first to have proved, that there was such a thing as an Element of Fire in the Universe; which is more than any Logick
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55028:172"/>
can hope, since the Sphere of Fire, which they supposed to possess all that vast space between the convex of the Sphere of Aer, and the concave of that of the Moon, is a meer Chimaera, as we have formerly intimated, and <hi>Helmont</hi> hath clearly commonstrated (<hi>in cap. de Aere.</hi>) And Secondly we affirm, that as the Highest degree of Heat is not justly attributary to any one Body more than other, or by way of singular eminency (for, the Sphere of Fire failing, what other can be substituted in the room thereof?) but to sundry special Bodies, which are capable of Exciting or Conceiving Heat, in the superlative degree: so likewise, though we should concede, that there are 3 Principal Bodies in Nature, namely Aer, Water, Earth, in each whereof the Quality of Cold is sensibly harboured; yet <hi>is there no one of them, of its own nature more principally Cold than other, or which of it self contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Cold in the highest degree; but some special Bodies there are, composed of them, which are capable of Exciting and Conceiving Cold, in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner.</hi> But, in Generals is no Demonstration; and therefore we must advance to <hi>Particulars,</hi> and verify our Assertion, in each of the Three supposed Elements apart.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Earth</hi>: forasmuch as our sense certifieth that it is even Torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Heat, in some places, and Congealed with Cold in others, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the temperature of the ambient Aer in divers climats, or as the Aer, being calefied by the Sun, or frigified by frost, doth variously affect it, in it superficial or Exterior parts; and so it cannot be discerned, that its Extern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al parts are endowed with one of these opposite Qualities more than the other: and since we cannot but observe, that there are many great and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable subterraneous Fires burning in, and many fervid and sulphlureous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations frequently emitted, and more Hot Springs of Mineral Waters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually issuing from its Interior parts, or bowels; and so it is of necessity, that vast seminaries of Igneous Atoms be included in the Entrals thereof: We say, considering these things, we cannot deny, but that the Earth doth contain as many Particles of Heat, or Calorifick Atoms, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and within, as it doth of seeds of Cold, or Frigorifick Atoms, if not more; and upon consequence, that it cannot be <hi>Primum Frigidum,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> and all his <hi>Sectators</hi> have dreamt. What then; shall we conclude Antithetically, and conceive that the Globe of the Earth is therefore Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially rather Hot, than Cold? Truely, No; because experience demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strateth, that the Earth doth belch forth Cold Exhalations, and congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blasts, as well as Hot Fumes, and more frequently: witness the North-wind, which is so cold, that it refrigerates the Aer even in the middst of Summer, when the rivers are exhausted by the fervor of the Sun; to which <hi>Elihu,</hi> one of <hi>Iobs</hi> sorry Comforters, seems to have alluded, when He said, That <hi>Cold cometh out of the North, and the Whirlwind out of the South.</hi> All, therefore, we dare determine in this difficult argument (the decision whereof doth chiefly depend upon Experiments of vast labour and costs) is only thus much; that the Earth, which is now Hot, now Cold, in its extreme or superficial parts, may, as to its Internal or profound parts, be as reasonably accounted to contain various seminaries of Heat, as of Cold: and that the principal seeds of Cold, or such, as chiefly consist of Frigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick Atoms, do convene into <hi>Halinitre,</hi> and other Concretions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures retaining thereto. And our Reason is that <hi>Halinitre</hi> is no sooner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in Water, than it congealeth the same into perfect Ice, and strongly refrigerates all bodies, that it toucheth; insomuch that we may not only
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55028:172"/>
conclude, that of all Concretions in Nature, at least that we have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, none is so plentifully fraught with the Atoms, or seeds of Cold, as Halinitre; but also adventure to answer that Problem proposed to <hi>Iob, Out of whose womb came the Ice, and the Hoary Frost of heaven, who hath gendred it?</hi> by saying, that all our Freezing and extreme Cold winds seem to be only copious Exhalations of Halinitre dissolved in the bowels of the Earth; or consisting of such Frigorifick Atoms, as compose Halinitre; and this because of the identity of their Effects, for the Tramontane Wind (the coldest of all winds, as <hi>Fabricius Paduanus,</hi> in his exquisite Book <hi>de Ventis,</hi> copiously proveth) which the Italians call <hi>Chirocco,</hi> can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to no natural Effect, in which Halinitre may not justly rival it. Long might we dwell upon this not more rare than delightful subject: but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it deserves a profest Disquisition, apart by it self, our speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are limited, and may not, without indecency, either digress from their proper Theme, or transgress the strict Laws of Method. May it suffice, therefore, in praesent, that we have made it justifiable to conceive that the Earth containeth many such Particles, or Atoms (whether such as pertain to the Composition of Halinitre, or of any other kind whatever) upon the Exsilition of which the body containing them may be said to become Cold, or pass from Potential to Actual Cold: and upon the insinuation of which into Aer, Water, Earth, Stones, Wood, Flesh, or any other ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Concretion whatever, Cold is introduced into them, and they may be said to be Frigefied, or made Cold.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as for <hi>Water</hi>; that the praetext thereof to the praerogative of Essential Frigidity is also fraudulent, and inconsistent with the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of right Reason, may be discovered from these considerations. 1. When Water is frozen, the Ice always begins in it superfice, or upper parts, where the Aer immediately toucheth it: but, if it were Cold of its own Nature, as is generally praesumed, upon the auctority of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the Ice ought to begin in parts farthest situate from the Aer, that is in the middle, or bottom, rather than at the top; at least, it would not be more slowly conglaciated in the middle and bottom, than at the top. (2.) In all Frosts, the Cold of Water is encreased; which could not be, if it were the principal seat of Cold. For, how could the Aer which according to the vulgar supposition, that Water is the subject of inhaesion to extreme Cold, if less cold, infuse into water a greater cold, than what it had before of its owne? or, how could Nitre, dissolved in water, so much augment the Cold thereof, as to convert it into Ice, even in the heat of summer, or by the fires side; as is experimented in Artificial conglaciations: if Nitre were not endowed with greater cold than Water? (3.) If Water be formally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravidated with the seeds of Cold; why is not the sea, why are not all Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, nay, all Lakes and standing Pools (in which the excuse of continual motion is praevented) constantly congealed, and bound up in ribbs of Ice? Whence comes it, that Water doth constantly remain Fluid, unless in great frosts only, when the Atoms of Cold, wafted on the wings of the North-wind, and plentifully strawed on the waters, doe insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves among its particles, and introduce a Rigidity upon them? Certainly, it is not conform to the Laws of Nature, that any Body, much less so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and useful a one as Water, should for the most part remain alienated from its owne native constitution, and be reduced to it again only at some times, after long intervals, and then only for a day or two. (4.) Were
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55028:173"/>
Cold essentially competent to Water, it could not so easily, as is observed, admit the Contrary Quality, Heat, nor in so high a degree, without the destruction of its primitive form. For, no subject can be changed from the Extreme of one Quality inhaerent, to the extreme of a contrary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the total alteration of that Contexture of its particles, upon which the inhaerent quality depended; which done, it remains no longer the same: but Water still remains the same, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Humid Fluid substance, both at the time of, and after its Calefaction by fire, as before. And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that common saying, that <hi>Water heated doth reduce it self to its native Cold,</hi> though it be tollerable in the mouth of the people; yet He that would speak as a Philosopher, ought to change it into this, that <hi>Water after calefaction, returns to its primitive state of Indifferency to either Heat, or Cold:</hi> for, though after its remove from the fire, it gradually loseth the Heat acquired from thence, the Igneous Atoms spontaneously ascending and abandoning it one after another; yet would it never reduce it self to the least degree of cold, but is <hi>reduced</hi> to cold by Atoms of Cold from the circumstant Aer immitted into its pores. What then; shall we hence conclude, that Water is Essentially <hi>Hot?</hi> Neither; because then it could not so easily admit, nor so long retain the Contrary Quality, Cold, for Hot springs are never congelated. Wherein therefore can we acquiesce? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, only in this determination, that <hi>Water is Essentially Moist, and Fluid: but neither Hot, nor Cold, unless by Accident, or Acquisition, i. e.</hi> it is made Hot, upon the introduction of Calorifick, and Cold, upon the introduction of Frigorifick Atoms; contrary to the tenent of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, as for the <hi>Aer</hi>: insomuch as it is sometimes Hot, sometimes Cold, according to the temperature of the Climate, season of the year, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or absence of the Sun, and diversity of Winds: we can have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheless there is no necessity, that therefore Water must be Cold in as high a degree, as Fire is Hot: for, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth not extinguish Fire, as it is Cold (since boyling water doth as soon put out fire, as Cold) but as it is <hi>Humid,</hi> i. e. <hi>as it enters the pores of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed body, and hinders the Motion and Diffusion of the Atoms of Fire.</hi> Which may be confirmed from hence (1.) That Oyle, which no man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be Cold, it poured on in great quantity, doth also extinguish fire, by suffocation, which is nothing but a hindering the Motion of the igneous Atoms: (2.) That in case the Atoms of Fire issue from the accensed matter, with such pernicity and vehemence, and reciprocal arietations, and in such swarms, as that they repel the water affused, and permit it not to enter the pores of the fewel (as constantly happens in Wild-fire, where the ingredients are Unctuous, and consist of very tenacious particles.) in that case, Water is so far from extinguishing the flame, that it makes it more impetuous and raging. However, we shall acknowledg thus much, that if the Principality of Cold must be adscribed to one of the Three vulgar Elements; the <hi>Aer</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, hath the best title thereunto: because, being the most Lax and Porous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Three it doth most easily admit, and most plentifully harbour the seeds of Cold; and being also subtile and Fluid, it doth most easily immit, or carry them along with it self into the pores of other bodies, and so not only Infrigidate, but some times Congeal, and Conglaciate them; in case they be of such Contextures and such particles, as are susceptible of Congelation and Conglaciation.</p>

composition of one single drop of Water, many myriads of myriads of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible particles must be convened and united. So that Water contained in a Caldron, set on the fire and seething, doth differ from the Fume ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled from it, only in this respect; that the one is Water Condensed, the other Rarified: or, that Water is made Fume, when its particles are violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissociated, and the aer variously intercepted among them; and Fume is returned to Water, when the same particles are reduced to their natural close order, and the intercepted aer again excluded. Again, that the Fluidity of Water depends on the same Cause (proportionately) as that of an heap of Corne, may, according to the Lawe of Similitude, be justified by the parallel capacity of Water to the same Effects, <hi>viz.</hi> Diffusion, Division, and Accommodation to the figure of the Recipient, or Terminant: For, the result hereof is, that it hath no Continuity or mutual Cohaerence of its particles, which should hinder their easy Dissociation. Nor is it a valid Argument to the contrary, that Water appears to be a <hi>Continued</hi> body, but an heap of Corne, a Discontinued; for, that is only according to <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> caused from hence, that by how much smaller the component parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of a Concretion are, by so much smaller must the inane spaces be, which are intercepted among them, where they are incontiguous, and upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, so much the less interrupted, or more continued must the mass or Aggregate appear: as may be most familiarly understood, if we compare an heap of Corne, with one of the finest <hi>Callis</hi> sand; that with an heap of the most volatile or impalpable Powder, that the Chymist or Apothecary can make; and so gradually less and less in the dimensions of Granules, till we arrive at the smallest imaginable. So that we cannot wonder, that the substance of Water should be apprehended by the dull sense, as wholly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, though really it be only less interrupted than an heap of sand: when the Grains, whereof Water is amassed, are incomparably smaller, than those of the finest sand, and intercept among them inane spaces incomparably smaller such as are by many degrees belowe the discernment of the acutest sight, though advantaged by the best Microscope.</p>

This may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from hence; that whenever the Cheese, or Butter made of the Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, is held to the fire, they recover their former Fluidity: because the tenacious particles of the Acid are disentangled and interrupted by the sphaerical and superlatively agile Atoms of fire. (3.) <hi>The Exclusion of introduced Atoms,</hi> such as by their exility, roundness and motion, did, during their admistion, interturbe the mutual Cohaesion and Quiet of domestique ones, which compose a Concretion. Thus, in the decale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence of melted metals, and Glass, when the Atoms of fire, which had dissociated the particles thereof and made them Fluid, do abandon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and so cease to agitate and dissociate the particles thereof: then do the domestique Atoms returne to a closer order, mutually implicate each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so make the whole mass Compact and Firme, as before. Thus also when the Atoms of Water, Wine, or any other dissolvent, which had insinuated into the body of Salt, Alume, Nitre, or other Concretion retaining to the same tribe; and dissolving the continuity of its particles, metamorphosed it from a solid into a fluid body, so that the sight appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it to be one simple and uniforme substance with the Liquor: we say, when these dissociating Atoms are evaporated by heat, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Salt instantly fall together again, become readunated, and so make up the mass compact and solid, as before, such as no man, but an eye-witness of the Experiment, could persuade himself to have been so lately diffused, concorporated, and lost in the fluid body of Water.</p>

the Aqueous doth consist, are more laevigated or smooth in their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and so having no hooks, or clawes, whereby to cohaere among themselves, or adhaere to the concretion, are soon disgregated; but those, which compose the Oleaginous, being entangled as well among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as with the particles of the body, to which they are admixt, by their Hamous angles, are not to be expeded and disengaged, without great and long agitation; and after many unsuccessfull attempts of evolution. Thus Wood is sooner reduced to Ashes, than a stone: because that is compacted by much of Aqueous Humidity; this by much of Unctuous. For the same reason is it likewise, that a clodd of Earth, or peice of Cloth, which hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed Water, is far more easily resiccated, than that Earth or Cloth, which hath been dippt in oyle, or melted fat.

The <hi>special</hi> manners of the Mollification of Hard: and Induration of Soft bodies.</note>But if we wind up our curiosity one note higher, and enquire the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Manner</hi> of Mollifying Hard bodies; we shall find it to rest upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Heat,</hi> or <hi>Moisture.</hi> Upon <hi>Heat,</hi> when the Atoms of fire, subingressing into the pores of a Hard Concretion doe so commove and exagitate the insensible particles thereof, that they become incontiguous in more points, than before, and so the whole mass being made more lax and rare, upon the interception of many new inane spaces among its particles, puts on a capacity of yeelding to any thing that presseth it, and of receding from it superfice toward its interiors, according to the property of soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Thus Iron made red hot, is mollefied, and hard Wax liquefied by heat. Upon <hi>Moisture,</hi> when the particles of an Humor so insinuate themselves among the closely cohaerent particles of a Hard body, that dissociating them in some measure, they intermix among them, and so (themselves being sufficiently yeelding upon pressure) cause the bodie to become yeelding and recessive from it superfice inwards. Thus Leather is softned by lying in Water, or Oyle; and Clay assumes so much the more of softness, by how much the more of water it hath imbibed.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, if we pursue the <hi>Induration</hi> of <hi>Soft</hi> bodies up to its <hi>Special</hi> Manner, we shall secure it either in <hi>Cold,</hi> or <hi>Siccity.</hi> In <hi>Cold,</hi> whether we understand it to be a simple expulsion of Calorifick Atoms, lately contained in the bodie; as in the growing hard of Metals after fusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or the introduction of Frigorifick Atoms into the bodie, naturally void of them; as in the induration of Water into Ice. In <hi>Siccity,</hi> whether we conceive it to be a meer expulsion of the particles of moisture from a Concretion; as when Earth is baked into Bricks: or a superinduction of drie particles upon a moist concretion; as in the composition of Pills, which for the most part consist of Drie Powders and Syrupe, or some other viscid moisture.</p>

imprisoned in the small incontiguities, or inane spaces, which otherwise would have been empty, make the body of the iron somewhat more solid or hard than otherwise it would have been.

                     </gap>s requires no taedious indagation, for from the Praemises it may easily be collected; that a soft body doth then yeild, when its particles immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pressed in the superfice, do sink down and subingress into the pores immediately beneath them, and then press down the next subjacent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles into pores immediately beneath them; and those likewise press down the next inferior rank of particles into void spaces below them; an those again press down others successively until (the number of pores or void spaces successively in each subingression decreasing) there be no more room to receive the last pressed particles, and then the subingression ceaseth. If this seem not sufficient to make the yeildingness of Soft bodies clearly intelligible; we must remit our Reader to our praecedent Discourse concerning the incapacity of Aer to be Condensed or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, in a Wind-gun, beyond a certain proportion, or determinate rate. Farther, because a soft body cannot be squeezed, unless it rest upon or against something that is hard, at least, less soft than it selfe; so that, though the lower superfice thereof, relying upon the support, is so bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it hath no liberty of space, whether to recede <hi>Versùs profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi>; yet hath it full liberty of space <hi>Versus latera</hi>: therefore comes it to pass, that the subingression of particles into pores, and the Compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of others, is made not only <hi>Versus profundum,</hi> in that part of the soft body, which directly confronteth the hard, whereupon it resteth; but also <hi>Versus latera,</hi> toward the sides, or circumambient.

Two <hi>Axioms,</hi> concerning &amp; illustrating the nature of Softness.</note>For the illustration of this, it is observable (1) That to the yielding of every soft body, when pressed, it is necessary, that it have <hi>freedom of space on its sides</hi>: because, if the lateral particles, when pressed by the intermedia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> ones, have not room whether to recede, they cannot yield at all; and so the Compression must be very small. This may most sensibly be Exemplified in a tube filled with Water; for, if you attempt to compress the Water therein contained, with a R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a very small and almost insensible progress therein. (2) <hi>That no superfice of what contexture soever, can be depressed</hi> versus profundum, <hi>or be any way dilated, but it must suffer some Diffraction or Solution of Continuity</hi>; more or less. For, insomuch as each particle of the superfice doth possess a peculiar part of space proportionate to its dimensions; and though upon the Dilatation of the superfice, <hi>i. e.</hi> the remove of its particles to a more lax order, greater spaces are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted among them, yet are not the particles multiplied in number, nor magnified in dimensions, and so cannot possess more or greater spaces than before: therefore is it necessary, that the superfice be variously crackt, and the continuity thereof infringed in many places. The Necessity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth farther evidence it self in the Flexion of a Twig, Cane, or other [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] <hi>Flexile</hi> body; for, when a Twigg is bended, as the Concave superfice becomes Contracted and Corrugated, the particles thereof being not able to penetrate each other, nor crowd themselves into few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er places: So at the same time, is the Convex Dilated, and suffers many small breaches or cracks, the particles thereof being uncapable either to multiply themselves, or possess more spaces, than before. The same likewise is easily intelligible in a <hi>Tractile</hi> body, such as (<hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> names <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) a Nerve, or Lutestring: for allbeit the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Continuity be not so manifest to the sense in a Tractile as in a Flexile body: yet may we observe, that when a <hi>Tractile</hi> body is extended or drawn out in length, it is extenuated or diminished in thickness. And, what, think you, becomes of those interior particles, which compose its Crassitude or thickness? Certainly, they must come
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:55028:182"/>
sorth into the superfice, that so they may interpose themselves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mong the Dissociated particles thereof, possess the void spaces left betwixt them, and with their small clawes or hooks on each hand cohaering to them, make the superfice apparently continued. Would you observe the Interruption of Continuity among the superficial particles of a Tractile body, and the issuing forth and intermistion of interior particles among them; be pleased to paint over a Lutestring with some oyled Colour, and afterward vernish it over with oyle of Turpentine: then strain it hard upon the Lute, and you shall plainly perceive the superfice of it to crack and become full of small clefts or chinks, and new par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles (not tincted with the colour) to issue forth from the entralls of the string, and interpose themselves among those small breaches. Lastly, the same is also discoverable by the sight in a <hi>Ductile</hi> body [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] such as every Metal; for, no metal, when pressed or hammerd, is dilated or expanded on all sides, for any other reason but this, that it is as much attenuated in thickness, and the particles in the superfice are so dissoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, as that the interior particles rise up, possess the deserted spaces, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haere to the discontinued exterior particles, as may be more plainly discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if the superfice of the Metal be tincted with some colour.</p>

                  <p>The Reason of this Faculty of <hi>Restitution,</hi> we conceive (with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal <hi>Gassendus</hi>) to be this; that the Recurse or Resilition of a flexile body is a certain Reflex motion, which is continued with a Direct moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as we shall have opportunity professedly to demonstrate, in our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Enquiry into the nature of Motion. In the mean while, it may suffice to stay the stomach of Curiosity, that we evidence the cause of it to be the same with that of the Rebound of a ball, impelled by a racket, from a Wall: for, as the force, which makes the ball rebound from the wall, is the very same which first impelled it against the Wall; so is the force, which reflecteth a bowe, after bending, the very same which bended it. To <hi>Exemplifie</hi>; when a man layes a staff transversly
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:55028:183"/>
upon a beam, and strikes the end that is toward him, downward; the end that is from him, must rise, as much upward: as well because of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of the beam (which here performs the office of an <hi>Hypomochlion,</hi> or middle Fulciment) as of the continuity and compactness of the staff it self; and so the same cause, the hand of the man, which impelled the one extreme of the staff downward, is also the cause of the rising of its other extreme upward. Again, let the staff have liberty of play between two beams, the one above, the other beneath it; and upon the Depulsion of one end, the other shall rise up, and be impinged against the upper beam, and from thence rebound back again upon the lower, and thence again to the higher, and thence again to the lower, and so alternately be reflected from one to the other, till the force of resistence in the 2 beams hath wholly overcome that of the first percussion or impulse: yet still doth the last Rebound, no less than the first, owe it self to the same Cause, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the first motion upon the staff, which was the hand of the man, who impelled it. To approach one degree neerer; set up a staff perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in some hole in the floore or pavement, so that it may have some liberty of motion to each hand: and then, if you impel or inflect the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per extreme to the right hand, the part of the lower extreme, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth the upper part of the right side of the hole, will press upon the same, and the other side of the lower extream, where it toucheth the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the left side of the hole, shall be at the same time impinged like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise against the left side; and that so forcibly, that it shall rebound from thence to the opposite side, and at the same time, the upper part, which you inflected, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hall rebound from the right to the left: and thus shall the staff be agitated from side to side, by alternate resilitions, till the resistence of the hole h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>h wholly overcome the force thereupon imprest, by your hand. This laid down, we infer, that the cause of Returne in the staff, is the same with that of the Self-restorative motion in bodies Flexile; for, that you may be able to inflect one end of the staff, it is necessary, that some part of it be held fast in your hand, some hole, chink, or other hold, that so you may distinguish the <hi>Hypomochlion,</hi> or point of Rest, from the part inflected.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it ought available to the contrary, to <hi>Object</hi> (1) that the staff is not bent with one single stroke,<note place="margin">

So that while the bottome of the staff, and its Hypomochlion alternately performe their offices, the one reflecting this, the other the contrary way, so many more Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Reflexions, or Excurses and Recurses are made, by how much greater the Rigidity of the staff, and firme fixation in its hold, are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>

                     </hi> insomuch as the parts of the Concave su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfice are so compressed, in order, one after another, from the Deflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Extrem to the Fixt, that suffering mutual resistence, they are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to start back in the same order, one after another; and the parts of the Convex superfice, from the Fixt Extreme to the Deflected, are so retracted in order one after another, that they return in order to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural site; and some parts thus conspiring with others, reduce the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected bodie to its natural situation and figure.</p>
                  <p>Finally, because every Reflex Motion is alwaies (though, perhaps,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Art.</hi> 4. Why <hi>Flexile</hi> bodies grow weak, by over-much, and over frequent Bending.</note> not sensibly) weaker, than the Direct; therefore is it, that in every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, both to the Concave superfice, some particles subingress to the interiors of the Flexile bodie, which cannot returne forth again to the superfice; and to the Convex, other particles egress to the superfice, which cannot returne in again to the interiors: Whereupon it comes to pass, that by how much the longer the Inflexion is continued, or how much the more frequently repeated; by so much the more Contracted is the Concave superfice made, and so continues, and so much more Deduced or Dilated is the Convex superfice made, and so continues; and consequently both the Inflexion and Reduction become as so much the weaker, so as much the smaller. Nay, where the Deflexion is so great, as that some parts of either superfice are wholly Diffracted and Dissociated, and so can no longer maintain that mutual cohaerence and continuity, which is necessary to the series of Reflexion and Retraction: there doth no Reduction at all followe, after Inflexion, at most only so much, as is made by the parts, which yet remain cohaerent, in which also we must allowe the distinction of Concavity and Convexity. Thus, when a Twigg is broken half off in the middle, by overmuch bending; it makes no more Reflexion, than what depends only upon the half which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken.</p>

                  <p>And this may be soon solved, by <hi>Answering</hi>; that the Cause of this Tremulation or Vibrations of a Tractile thing, distended and percussed, or abduced, seems to be the same with that of the Reflexion of a Flexile, newly rendred. For (1.) A chord distended, is nothing but a Flexile body; and so much the more apt for Reflection, by how much more it is Distended: because Tension is a kind of Rigidity. (2.) A chord distended hath the reason not only of one simple Flexile bodie, but also of two conjoyned; insomuch as it hath 2 Extrems, in each of which we may distinguish the Hypomochlion, or fixt part, from the Reflectent; and in the middle, or that part, which is percussed or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the plectrum or finger, there are as it were 2 other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes

                  <p>This stupendious Phaenomenon may be thus Demonstrated. Let F. G. (in the second diagram) be the Chord horizontally distended; which, being distracted from its direct situation, F. G. to A. makes its several Diadroms, A.B. B.C. C.E. and E.D. Now we say, that All these Diadroms, though greatly disproportionate in point of space, are yet exactly proportionate in point of Time, <hi>i. e.</hi> the first Diadrom, A.

D.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, since the Violence or impetus, whereby the Chord is abduced from the line F. G. to the point A. is so much the greater, by how much the longer the line of the Epidrom is, the Chord must pervade it space so much the more speedily, by how much the space is greater, compared to that of the subsequent ones: it necessarily followes, that all the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diadroms must be Aequidiurnal, because look how much is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the Longitude, Magnitude, and Impetus of the subsequent Diadroms exactly so much accedeth to the Brevity of the space, which they are to percurr; and so the longitude of the posterior Epidrom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inverted in proportion to the Time, and its Brevity of space com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensateth the decay of that Impetus, which was in the Prior Diadrom. For Example; Let the Chord, which makes an hundred Diadroms, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

G.</p>
                  <p>More plainly; the First Diadrom, A. B. as it is the Greatest, so is it the most Violent; and as it is the most Violent, so must the Velocity, whereby it pervades the whole space betwixt A.B. be also the Greatest: and the Second Diadrom, B. C. how much it comes short, in violence of tension, and Celerity of motion, of the First, so much doth it come short of the Magnitude also thereof; so that though the space of the former, A. B. be much larger than that of the second, B.C. yet doe they both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade their several spaces in the same proportion of Time, because, as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Diadrom, B.

Why doth a Chord of a duple length, perform its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adroms in a proportion of time duple, to a Chord of a single length; both being distended by equal force; &amp; yet, if the Chord of the duple length be distended by a duple fore or weight, it doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droms, in a proportion of time duple to that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Force or weight di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stending it, be quadruple to the First sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: and its SOLUT.</note>But yet the Lees of the PROBLEM remain behind; for it is worthy farther Enquiry: <hi>Why a Chord of a Duple length, v.g. of</hi> 4 <hi>foot, doth performe its Diadroms in a Duple proportion of Time, to a Chord of a single length, v. g. of</hi> 2 <hi>foot; when both are distend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by equal Force, or Weight: and yet, if the Chord of</hi> 4 <hi>foot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stended by doubly as great a Force or Weight as that of only</hi> 2 <hi>foot, it doth not performe its Diadroms with Velocity Duple thereunto; but only if the force of its Distension be Quadruple to the force first sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to exhaust them, though somewhat rough and crabbed, we ANSWER, As in a <hi>Pensile</hi> bodie, or Chord vertically distended by a weight, the time of each single Excurse, is equal to that time, in which the same weight would, if permitted, be falling from such an Altitude, as is commeasurable by the diametre of the Circle, whereof Arches are described by the Excurses of the Pensile body abduced from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular: So in a <hi>Tensile</hi> body, such as a Chord strained upon a Lute, All the times, in which a part of the Chord accepted exactly in the middle, excurreth from one side, are equal to one time, in which one of its Extrems, if cut off, would directly pervade the whole length, and come into the place of the other, toward which the force, being still the same behind, would draw it. For, the same Force, certainly, is alwaies able to produce the same Effect: and if the lateral spaces of the Diadroms doe continually decrease; the Velocity of the motion must also continually decrease. And the cause of that continual Decrement, can be no other but the Force Drawing or distending the Chord, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually refracteth the contrary Force, by the plectrum or finger impressed thereupon. Now, since All the Excurses of a Chord, of whatever length, are exaequated to one and the same direct Trajection thereof, as we said even now; in the <hi>Former</hi> Case, the Trajection cannot but be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a duple proportion of Time, as a Duple proportion of Space is assumed to be trajected or pervaded, by the same Motive or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Force: but in the <hi>Latter</hi> not, because Three Equal things being supposed, <hi>viz.</hi> Time, Space, and the Weight or Attractive Force, it is of pure necessity, that the same space remaining, look how much of Time is diminished, so much is the motive Force en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and what is the proportion of space to Time, the same is the proportion of the Motive Force to Space. And hence comes it, that the proportion of space to Time being as that of 2 to 1; the Motive Force must have to space the proportion of 4 to 2: and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Time, not as 2 to 1, but as 4 to 1.</p>

                     </note> little remains Additional to what we have formerly said, concerning the Formal Reason thereof, but the Solution of that notable PROBLEM, about the admirably vast <hi>Extensibility</hi> of that King not only of Metals, but of the whole Earth, <hi>Gold.</hi> And, indeed, since we have it upon the testimony of our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that one Ounce of pure Gold may be, by Malleation, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to such an amplitude, as to cover ten Acres of Land; and that one Grain thereof may be Wier drawne into a thread of such incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fineness, as to commensurate 400 foot; and consequently, that one Ounce of Gold is capable of deduction into a thread, whose length may fufill the measure of two hundred and thirty thousand, and four hundred feet, of six inches apiece: we say, this being avouched by those Mechaniques, who deale in Beating of Gold into Leaves, and Drawing it out into Wier, it seems well worthy our Enquiry, upon what Cause this stupendious Praerogative of Gold doth chiefly depend. In a word, therefore, we conceive this superlative EXTENSIBILITY of Gold, to be warrantably referrible to a <hi>Threefold Cause, viz.</hi> the unparalleld Compactness of it substance, the great Tenuity of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent particles, and the Multitude of small Hooks or Clawes, whereby those particles reciprocally implicate each other, and maintain the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of the whole Mass. For (1) the <hi>exceeding Compactness of its Contexture</hi> doth afford parts sufficient to so great Extension, <hi>i. e.</hi> such an abundance of them, as upon the Decrement of the Mass in Profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, may rise up into the superfice and enlarge the Latitude, or Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: (2) The <hi>Tenuity of its component particles</hi> maketh the mass ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Diminution in profundity, and so of Augmentation in super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, even to an incredible proportion: and (3) The <hi>Multitude of small Hooks,</hi> whereby those Exile particles reciprocally cohaere, sufficeth to the constant Continuity; for, while the mass is suffering under the Hammer, no sooner can the stroke thereof dissociate one particle from its neighbour, but instantly it layes hold of and fastneth upon another, and as firmely cohaereth thereunto, as to its former hold: So that the mutual Cohaesion is maintained even above the highest degree of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension or Attenuation, which any imaginable Art can promise. Nay, so sufficient a Cause of incredible Ductility doth this last seem to be, that <hi>Mersennus</hi> regarded no other: as may be collected from these his words: <hi>Sunt autem Corpora maximè Ductilia, quae habent Atomos un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dique Hamatas, ut Aurum; cujus Atomi non ita possunt evolui, ut sese deserant in inferioribus, aut superioribus partibus, quin laterales succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, quibus usque ad insignem tenuitatem perveniant; (Harmon. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>propos.</hi> 22. <hi>Corollario de Atomis.)</hi> This apprehended, the Chymist needs not longer to perplex himself about the Cause of the <hi>Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> and <hi>incapacity of Volatilization</hi> in Gold: and if his so promising Art can attain to the investment of any Metal with these Proprieties; let other men dispute, whether it be Gold or no, for our parts, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige our selves so to accept it.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Cause,</hi> certainly, must be this; that the Weight or drawing force doth alwayes first act upon the parts of the string, which are neerest to it, and successively upon those, which are farthest off, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Middle: so that the string suffering the greatest stress neer

Wherefore, whenever a Bowstring breaks in or neer the middle; it may safely be concluded, that the string was weakest in that place. To which we may add this also, that Experienced Archers, to praevent the frequent breaking of their strings, and the danger of breaking the Bow thereby; injoyn their String-makers, to add a Link of Flax, or Twist more at the Ends of each string, than in any other parts of it: and that they call the <hi>Forcing,</hi> because Experience hath taught them, that the Force of the Bow is most violently discharged upon those parts of the string, which are neerest to the Horns.</p>

Wherein we use the scarce perfect Dialect of the Schools; who too boldly praesuming, that all those Qualities of Concretions, which belong to the jurisdiction of the senses, are dependent upon Known Causes, and deprehended by Known Faculties, have therefore termed them <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest</hi>: and as incircumspectly concluding, that all those Proprieties of Bodies, which fall not under the Cognizance of either of the Senses, are derived from obscure and undiscoverable Causes, and perceived by Unknown Faculties; have accordingly determined them to be <hi>Immanifest</hi> or <hi>Occult.</hi> Not that we dare be guilty of such unpardonable Vanity and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, as not most willingly to confess, that <hi>to Ourselves all the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Nature are meer Secrets</hi>; that in all her ample catalogue of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, we have not met with so much as one, which is not really Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifest and Abstruse, when we convert our thoughts either upon its Genuine and Proxime Causes, or upon the Reason and Manner of its perception by that Sense, whose proper Object it is: and consequently, that as the <hi>Sensibility</hi> of a thing doth noe way praesuppose its <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibility,</hi> but that many things, which are most obvious and open to the Sense, as to their <hi>Effects,</hi> may yet be remote and in the dark to

We deny not, that most, if not All of those Admired Effects of Nature, which even the Gravest Heads have too long thought suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Excuses of their Despair of Cognition, do arise from some <hi>Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> or <hi>Antipathy</hi> betwixt the Agent and Patient: but yet for all that, have we no reason to concede, that Nature doth institute or Cause that sympathy or Antipathy, or the Effect resulting from either, by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lawes, or Means, but what she hath ordained and constantly useth, to the production of all other Common and familiar Effects. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlddge also, that <hi>Sympathy</hi> is a certain <hi>Consent,</hi> and <hi>Antipathy</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Dissent</hi> betwixt Two Natures, from one, or both of which there usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariseth some such Effect, as may seem to deserve our limited Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but is it therefore reasonable for us to infer, that those Natures are not subject unto, nor regulated by the General and Ordinary Rules of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Passion, whereto Nature hath fitmely obliged Herself in the rest of Her Operations?</p>

That every Effect must have its Cause; (2) That no Cause can act but by Motion; (3) That Nothing can act upon a Distant subject, or upon such whereunto it is not actually Praesent, either by it self, or by some instrument, and that either Conjunct, or Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and consequently, that no body can move another, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact Mediate, or Immediate, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the mediation of some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Organ, and that a Corporeal one too, or by it self alone. Which considered, it will be very hard not to allowe it necessary, that when two things are said either to <hi>Attract</hi> and <hi>Embrace</hi> one the other by mutual <hi>Sympathy,</hi> or to <hi>Repell</hi> and <hi>Avoid</hi> one the other, by mutual <hi>Antipathy</hi>; this is performed by the same wayes and means, whereby we observe one Body to Attract and hold fast another, or one Body to Repell and Avoid conjunction with another, in all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and Mechanique Operations. This small Difference only allowed,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:55028:189"/>
that in Gross and <hi>Mechanique</hi> operations, the Attraction, or Repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is performed by <hi>Sensible</hi> Instruments: but, in those finer performances of Nature, called <hi>Sympathies</hi> and <hi>Antipathies,</hi> the Attraction or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion is made by Subtle and <hi>Insensible.</hi> The means used in every common and Sensible Attraction and Complection of one Bodie by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, every man observes to be Hooks, Lines, or some such intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Instrument continued from the Attrahent to the Attracted; and in every Repulsion or Disjunction of one Bodie from another, there is used some Pole, Lever, or other Organ intercedent, or somewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded or discharged from the Impellent to the Impulsed. Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should we not conceive, that in every Curious and Insensible Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of one bodie by another, Nature makes use of certain slender Hooks, Lines, Chains, or the like intercedent Instruments, continued from the Attrahent to the Attracted, and likewise that in every Secret Repulsion or Sejunction, she useth certain small Goads, Poles, Levers, or the like protruding Instruments, continued from the Repellent to the Repulsed bodie? Because, albeit those Her Instruments be invisible and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible; yet are we not therefore to conclude, that there are none such at all. We every day behold Spiders letting themselves down from high roofs, and as nimbly winding themselves up again at pleasure, by such slender threads of their own occasionall and extemporary spinning, as tis not every common eye that can discern them. Nay, in a Mask at Court, we have seen a whole Chorus of Gods descend into the theatre, as from the clouds, only by Wires and other lines, so fine and slender, as that all the light of the tapers burning therein was not sufficient to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them to the sight of the Spectators: and vast and ponderous Scenes so suddenly and dextrously shifted, by the almost inobservable motions of Skrews, Elevators, Pulleys, and the like Archimedean Engines and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, that the common Beholders, judging only by the Apparence, or (rather) Non-apparence, have thought those great machines to have been Automatous, or to have moved themselves, and at last to vanish into nothing. And shall we not then allowe the incomparably more Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mechaniques of Natures, the Exemplar of Art, to be wrought by Instruments of Subtility incomparably greater: and that many of those small Engines, whereby she usually moves and susteins bodies of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bulk and weight, are Corporeal, though by incomputable excesses below the perception of our acutest sense? Certainly, for us to affirm, that nothing Material is emitted from the Loadstone to Iron, which by continuity may Attract it; only because our sense doth deprehend nothing intercedent betwixt them: is an Argument of equal weight with that of the Blind man, who denied the Being of Light and Colours, because He could perceive none. In a word, if there be any validity in what we have so plainly asserted, and frequently inculcated, touching the <hi>Hebetude</hi> or Grossness of our <hi>Senses,</hi> on one part, and the great <hi>Exility</hi> of all <hi>Aporraea</hi>'s or Effuxes streaming from Bodies, on the other; and if tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ascribe to Hidden Sympathies and Antipathies, are brought about by the same ways and means, which Nature and Art use in the Causation of the like Ordinary and Sensible Effects; and that the Instruments of <hi>Natural</hi> Attraction, Complectence, Repulsion, Sejunction, are <hi>Corporeal,</hi> and hold a neer Analogie to those of <hi>Artificial</hi>; only these are <hi>Gross</hi> and <hi>Perceptible,</hi> those <hi>Subtile</hi> and <hi>Imperceptible.</hi>

If we attentively ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a <hi>Chamaeleon</hi> catching Gnats and other small Flyes in the Aer, for his food; we shall see him dart out a long and slender tongue, with a small recurvation at the tip, and birdlimed with a certain tenacious and inviscating moisture, wherewith, in a trice, laying hold of a Fly, at some distance from his mouth, he conveys the same into it with such cleanly speed, as exceeds the Legerdemane of our cunningst Juglers, and may have been the cheif occasion of that popular Error, <hi>that he lives meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Aer.</hi> And when we see a peice of Amber, Jet, hard Wax, or other Electrique, after sufficient friction, to attract straws, shavings of wood, quils, and other festucous bodies of the same lightness, object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the orbe of their Alliciency; and that with a cleanly and quick motion: Why should we not conceive, that this Electricity or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction may hold a very neer Analogy to that attraction of Gnats, by the exserted and nimbly retracted tongue of a Chamaeleon. For (1) it is not improbable, that the Attraction of all Electriques is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the mediation of swarms of subtle Emanations, or Continued Rayes of exile particles, comparative to so many Chamaeleons Tongues; which through the whole Sphere of their Virtue, in various points mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually intersecting, or decussating, and more especially toward their Extreams, doe not only insinuate themselves into the pores of those small and light festucous bodies occurrent, but lay hold upon several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible Asperities in their superfices, and then returning (by way of <hi>Retraction</hi>) back to their Original or Source, bring them along in their twined arms, and so long hold them fast in their Complicate em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, as the warmth and radial Diffusion, excited by affriction, lasteth. (2) All the Disparity, that can be objected, seems to consist onely in the Manner of their Return, or Retraction; the Tongue of the Chamaeleon being both darted forth, and retracted by help of certain Muscles, wherewith Nature, by a peculiar provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, hath accommodated that otherwise Helpless Animal: but, Electriques are destitute of any such organs, either for the Exser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Reduction of their Rayes. And this is not so great, but it may be solved, by supposing, that as if the Chamaeleons Tongue were drawn forth at length by a mans hand, and not extruded by the instruments of Voluntary Motion, it would again Contract and Reduce it self spontaneously, after the same manner as Nerves and Lutestrings retract and curle up themselves, after violent Distensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so may the Rayes, which stream from an Electrique, being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from their fountains, not spontaneously, but by the force of praecedent Affriction, be conceived to Reduce and Retract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, after the manner of Sinews and Lutestrings violently extended.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:55028:190"/>
(3) That such tenacious Rayes are abduced from Amber and other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctriques, is easily convincible (besides the experiment of their Attraction of convenient objects) from hence; that all Electriques are <hi>Unc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, however this may be contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and the Way of all Electrique Attractions variously explicated, according to the various Conceptions of men; the Itch of Phancy being soonest allayed by the liberty of ones singular Conjecture, in such curi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous Theorems: yet still is it firme and indubitable, that though the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of straws by Amber, be in some sort Admirable, yet is it not <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous,</hi> as is implied in that opinion, which would have it to be by some <hi>Immaterial</hi> (i e. <hi>Supernatural</hi>) Virtue; and that it is effected by some <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal,</hi> though both impalpable and invisible Organs continued from the Attrahent to the Attracted.</p>

                     </note>On the Other side, as for the <hi>Abaction,</hi> or <hi>Repulsion</hi> of one thing by another, in respect whereunto Vulgar Philosophers have thought and taught, that the Abacted or Repulsed doth (if an Animal) voluntarily (if Inanimate) spontaneously Flie from and avoid Conjunction with the Abacting, or Repellent, by reason of some hidden <hi>Enmity</hi> or <hi>Antipathy</hi> betwixt their Forms: though the Reasons and Manner of such <hi>Fugation,</hi> so far forth as concerns Animals, may be collected from our former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of the Gratefulness and Offensiveness of Sensible Objects; yet shall we here f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rther illustrate the same by certain <hi>Analogies</hi> and <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</hi> When a <hi>Nettle</hi> is objected to a mans Hand, why doth He with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it from the same? Not upon the account of any Antipathy in his hand to the Nettle; because being bruised, or withered, no Childe but will boldly handle it: but, because the Nettle is pallizado'd with millions of small stings, or prickles, which like so many Darts, wounding the the skin, cause a pain therein, and so the man, for avoidance of harm, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his hand from it, as an injurious object. Why likewise doth the <hi>Nose</hi> abominate and avoid <hi>stinking Odours,</hi> whenever they are brought neer it? Is it not because such Foelid and Offensive Odours consist, for the most part, of such sharp and pungent Particles, as holding no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence to the pores and contexture of the Odoratory Nerves, are no sooner admitted, but they in a manner scratch, wound and dilacerate the Sensory? And may we not conceive those disproportionate Particles of the ungrateful Odour to be as so many small <hi>Lances</hi> or <hi>Darts,</hi> which offer the same injury to the Mammillary Processes of the brain, that the Prickles of a Nettle offer to the skin? Certainly, as the Nettle strikes its Darts into the skin, and not into the Nayles of a mans hand; because those are of too close and firm a Contexture to admit them: so doth an offensive Odour immit its painted and angular Particles into the tender smelling Nerves, and not into the skin, because its Contexture is more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, than to be capable of Puncture or Dilaceration thereby. Lastly, Why doth the <hi>Eye</hi> abhor and turne from <hi>Ugly and Odious Objects</hi>? Is it not only because the Visible Species emitted from such Bodies, doth consist of Particles of such Configurations and Contexture, as carry no
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:55028:190"/>
proportion to the particles and contexture of the Optique Nerves, but striking upon the <hi>Retina Tunica,</hi> instantly wound and exasperate the slender and tender filaments thereof, and so cause the Eye, for fear of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther injury, to close, or avert it self? And are not those Acute and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate Particles, composing the visible Species, worthily resembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to so many small Prickles or Lancets, which though too subtile to wound the Skin, Nostrils, or other parts of the body, whose Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is less delicate, do yet instantly mis-affect and pain the Optique Nerves, whose singular Contexture doth appropriate to them the Capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sensible of that compunction? Now, putting all these Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the scale together, and ponderating them with an equal hand; we shall find their weight amount to no less than this: that <hi>as every Sympathy is displayd by certain Corporeal, though Invisible Organs, comparated to Attraction and Amplectence; so is every Antipathy, by the like invisible Organs, comparated to Repulsion and Sejunction</hi>; which is what we As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.</p>

For, every mans observation may certifie him, that all Marygolds, Tulippa's, Pimpernell, Wartwoort, Mallow Flowers, and indeed most other Flowers, so long as they are in their Vigour and Pride, use to Open and Dilate toward noon and somewhat Close and recontract themselves after Sun set. And the <hi>Cause</hi> (surely) is only the Warmth of the Suns Rayes, which discussing the Cold and Moisture of the praecedent Night (whereby the Leaves were loaden towards the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or in the bowle of the Flower, and so made to rise more upright and conjoyn their tops) and somewhat Exsiccating the Flower, make the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destalls of its leaves more flaccid, so that they seem to expand and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold themselves, and incline more outwards, meerly by reason of their want of strength to sustain themselves in an erect and concentrical posture: for alwayes the hotter the Day, the greater is the Expansion.

And yet, in all likelihood the <hi>Salt</hi> dissolved in those Corrosive Waters, must be the Sole Cause of that strange Effect. For, the Salts which are plentifully dissolved in those Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, by a kind of mutual Cohaesion of their insensible particles support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other from the bottom to the top of the Glass, or other contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vessel; doe sustain and bear up the Granules of the Metals which they have Corroded and Embraced. And this seems the more probable from hence; that if common Water, impraegnate with a few dropps of Oyle of Tartar (that Great instrument of Separation) be superinfused upon those Tinctures, the Granules of the dissolved Metals suddainly disengage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the arms of the Corroding Salts, and sink to the bottom: the fresh Water yet father dissolving those Salts, and giving them fuller Flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; so that becoming more Attenuate, they lose their mutual Cohaesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so their power of supporting; and tis well known, that Salt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will beare up such bodies, as will hardly swim in fresh. And this we take to be the General Reason of all sorrs of Praecipitation, practised either by Chymists, or common Refiners of Metals: the Oyle of Tartar thereto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing no otherwise, than meerly as it serves to the farther Attenuation of the Salt Armoniack and other Corrosive Salts formerly dissolved in the strong Waters.</p>

                     </note> Philosophers usually place the <hi>Attraction of Water by a Spunge</hi>; wherein they are as much mistaken as in either of the two last. For, the Ascention of Water into the pores of a spunge, so placed as to touch only the superfice of it, comes not from any Appetite of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or Suction inhaerent in the Spunge, as is generally praesumed and affirmed; but onely from the <hi>Depression, or downward impulse of the water by the swelling and sensibly dilating spunge</hi>; and the manner of that series of motions is thus. The skirts or lowest parts of the spunge, touching the superfice of the Water, immediately imbibe some parts of it into its pores, and becoming thereby dilated and tumid, press down the subjacent Water to such a proportion as responds to the quantity of their owne expansion; so that as they are more and more dilated by the admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of more and more parts of Water into their Cells or Receptaries, it must be, that the Water being more and more depressed toward the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, must rise higher and higher on the sides of the Spunge, and insinuate it self into other and other pores successively, till the whole spunge be filled. Manifest it is by Experience, that if Water or any other Liquor, when it is though never so gently pressed in the superfice, find any the smallest <hi>Chinks</hi> in the body pressing it; it doth instantly rise up in round, and insinuate it self into those pores or Chinks, the sides thereof in a manner sustaining it, and so praeventing its relapse or efflux. This we cannot but observe, when we dip the nose of our Pen into ink; the small <hi>Cleft</hi> or slit in the lowest part of the Quill, assisting the Assent of the ink into the hollow thereof, and carrying up so much of it, as the mutual Coherence of its parts will permit: for, if we dipp the point of a Pen, which hath no slit, into a standish, we shall observe no such plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Assent of ink; there being no support or fastnings for it on each side of the nose, and so no obstacles to its relapse and sudden efflux. And, as for the Reason, Why <hi>Water Ascends, when it meets with any body, that is Dry, Filamentous or Fibrous, and full of pores or Chinks, such as a Spunge, Cloth, Pen, &amp;c.</hi> it may be most fully explained by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a <hi>Syphon,</hi> or Pump.</p>

Of this the <hi>Cause</hi> is only, that as your Cheeks are inflated and distended by the Aer, which upon exsuction comes rushing into your mouth, doe strongly move and impell the ambient aer; so doth that, receding, move and impell the neighbouring aer, and that again moves and impels the next, till the impulse be propagated to the surface of the Water in the Cistern: and the Water being thus depressed in the superfice, riseth up into the Cavity of the pipe, which the extracted Aer had newly deserted and left unpossessed; nor doth it thenceforth cease
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:55028:195"/>
to ascend and flow in a continued stream through the pipe, until all be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted. Because, how much of Water flows through the pipe, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so much of Aer is, by impulsion, Circulated into the place thereof; the last round of aer wanting any other place to receive it, but what it provides for its self in the Cistern, by depressing the water yet remaining therein: and thus the Circulation once begun, is continued, till all the Water hath past through the pipe.</p>

The reason of the <hi>Percolation</hi> of <hi>Liquors,</hi> by a <hi>cloth</hi> whose one end lieth in the liquor, and other hangs over the brim of the vessel, that contains it.</note>Upon the same Cause, or some other so like it, as tis no ease matter to discriminate them, doth that kind of <hi>Percolation</hi> of Liquors, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Aqua Calcis,</hi> depend, which is made by a long piece of <hi>Woollen Cloth,</hi> whose one end lies in the Liquor, and other hangs over the brim of the vessel that contains it. For, the Liquor gently ascends and creeps along the filaments of the Cloth, because, being though but very lightly prest in it superfice by the same, it doth proportionately ascend in round, to deliver it self from that pressure; and by that motion impelling the incumbent Aer upwards, it causeth the same to Circulate and depress the surface of the Liquor, and so makes it rise by insensible degrees higher and higher along the hairs and threads of the Cloth, till at length it arrive at the highest part thereof resting upon the margin of the vessel; and thence it slides down the decline or propendent half of the Cloth, and falls down into the Recipient, by dropps. And this Motion is Continued till all the Liquor hath passed the Percolatory, leaving the faeces adhaerent to the fibres of the same: each drop impelling the Ambient Aer, and driving it in round, or by a <hi>Periosis,</hi> upon the surface of the Water, so long as any remains in the vessel. And this, we conceive, may suffice to any mans Comprehension of the Reason of the Repletion of a Spunge, by Water <hi>Ascending</hi> (not Attracted) into its Cavities or Pores.</p>

The like also will be, if the Diapason or Eighth to that string be percussed, either in the same Lute or Vial, or other lying by: but, in none of these, the Consent is discernable by any report of sound, but meerly by motion. And yet the Cause of this Sympathy is not so very obscure, but the dullest Pythagorean might soon have discovered it to be only this; that the percussed string doth suffer a certain number of Diadroms, or Vibrations, and impress the like determinate motions upon the Aer: which lighting upon another string of equal Contexture and Extension with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer percussed, doth impress the same motions thereupon, and impell and repell it so correspondently, as to make it suffer an equal number
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:55028:195"/>
of Diadroms. Nor doth the Aer hinder it in its several Reciprocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or alternate excurses and recurses; because the percussed string makes all its alternate excurses and recurses, at and in the same time, as the untoucht string doth, and so impels the Aer alternately to the contrary side thereof. But, that agitated Aer which falls upon a string of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degree of extension, and so necessarily of a different tone; though it impress various insensible strokes thereupon, yet are those impressed strokes such as mutually check and oppose each other, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curses hinder the Recurses: and therefore the string remains unmoved, at least as to the sense. Likewise, the Consent of another string, which makes that Consonance, which Musicians call a <hi>Diapason</hi> or <hi>Eighth,</hi> to that which is percussed by the hand, ariseth only from hence; that the Excurses and Recurses of the string percussed by the hand, do not at all clash with, nor perturb and confound the Excurses and Recurses of the string moved immediately only by the Aer, but are Coincident and Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronical to them, and observe the same periods; and so both agree in their certain and frequent intervals: more particularly, in an Eight, every single Diadrom of the longer and more lax string, is coincident to every second, fourth, sixth, &amp;c. Diadrom of the shorter or more tense string. Nay farther, if the two strings be Consonous though but in the less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Consonance of a <hi>Fifth</hi>; yet shall the sympathy hold, and manifest it self (which is not commonly observed) by the tremulation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched string, that is tuned to a Fifth: because their Diadroms are not wholly confused, each single diadrom of the longer or lower string, being coincident to every third, sixth, ninth, &amp;c. diadrom of the shorter or more tense string. But if the two strings be <hi>Dissonous,</hi> the sympathy fails; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Excurses and Recurses agree not in any of their Intervals or Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, but perturb and confound each other; as may be more fully understood from our praecedent Discourse of the <hi>Reason of Consonances and Dissonances Musical.</hi>

                     </note> disparity of Longitude and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, or Non-coincidence of the Vibrations in their several periods, that alone make Two strings Discordant; for, if we admit the common tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Naturalists, where <hi>an Instrument is strung with some strings made of Sheeps, and others of Woolfs Guts intermixed, the best hand in the World shall never make it yeeld a perfect Consonance, much less play an harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tune thereupon.</hi> And the <hi>Cause,</hi> doubtless, is no other than this; that the strings made of a Woolfs Guts are of a <hi>different Contexture</hi> from those made of a Sheeps; so that however equally both are strained and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed, yet still shall the Aer be unequally percussed and impelled by them, and consequently the sounds created by one sort, confound and drown the sounds resulting from the other. To leave you in the less uncertainty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, it is commonly observed, that from one and the same string, when it is not of an Uniforme Contexture throughout, but more close, even, and firme in some parts than in others (all such our Musicians call <hi>False</hi> strings) there doe alwayes result various and unequal sounds: the close, even and firm parts yeelding a smart and equal sound, the lax and uneven yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dull, flat and harsh; which two different sounds at the same time created, confound and drown each other, and consequently where such a string is playd upon in Consort, it disturbs the whole Concent or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. It is further observed also, that the Musick of an Harp
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:55028:196"/>
doth infect the musick of a Lute, and other softer and milder instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with a kind of Asperity and Indistinction of Notes: which Asperity seems to arise from a certain kind of Tremor, peculiar only to the Chords of that Instrument. The like also hath been reported of other scarce Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sortive Instruments, such as the Virginalls and Lute, the Welsh Harp and Irish, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But you'll Object, perhaps, that the Discordance of Woolves and Sheeps Gutlings seemeth to arise rather from some Formal <hi>Enmity,</hi> or inhaerent <hi>Antipathy</hi> betwixt the Woolf and Sheep: because it hath been affirmed by many of the Ancients, and questioned by very few of the Moderns, <hi>that a Drum bottomed with a Woolfs skin, and headed with a Sheeps, will yeeld scarce any sound at all</hi>; nay more, that a <hi>Wolfs skin will in short time prey upon and consume a Sheeps skin,</hi> if they be layed neer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And against this we need no other Defense than a downright ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to <hi>Experience,</hi> whether both those Traditions deserve not to be listed among Popular Errors; and as well the Promoters, as Authors of them to be exiled the society of Philosophers: these as Traitors to truth by the plotting of manifest falsehoods; those as Ideots, for beleiving and admiring such fopperies, as smell of nothing but the Fable; and lye open to the contradiction of an easy and cheap Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

The tradition of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming of all Feathers of Foul, by those of the Eagle</hi>; exploded.</note>(9) Nor can we put a greater value upon the <hi>Devouring of all other Birds Feathers by those of the Eagle commixt with them</hi>; though the Author of <hi>Trinum Magicum</hi> hath bin pleased to tell us a very formall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident story thereof: because we have no Reason to convince us, that the Eagle preys upon other Fowls, out of an Antipathy or Hatred, but rather out of Love and Convenience of Aliment; and though there were an Enmity betwixt the Eagle and all his feathered subjects, during life, yet is there no necessity that Enmity should survive in the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered peices of his Carcass, especially in the Feathers (that are but one degree on this side Excrements) which is praesumed to consist cheifly in the Forme; since those Proprieties which are Formal, in Animals, must of necessity vanish upon the destruction of the Forme, from whence they result. Thus Glow-worms project no lustre after death; and the Torpedo, which stupefies at distance, while alive, produceth no such effect though topically applied, after death: for there are many Actions of Sensible Creatures, that are mixt, and depend upon their vital form, as well as that of mistion: and though they seem to retain unto the Body, doe yet immediately depart upon its Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union.</p>

Why some certain <hi>Plants</hi> befriend, and advance the growth and fruitfulness of others, that are their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> the First that expects our Consideration, is the so frequently mentioned and generally conceded <hi>Sympathy, or mutually beneficial Friendship betwixt some certain Plants,</hi> as betwixt <hi>Rew,</hi> and the <hi>Figg-tree,</hi> the <hi>Rose</hi> and <hi>Garlick,</hi> the <hi>Wild Poppy</hi> and <hi>Wheat</hi>; all which are observed to delight and flourish most in the neighbourhood of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and our skilful Gardners use to advance the growth and fructifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one, by planting its favourite neer it. Concerning this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we advertise; that men are mistaken not only in the Cause, but
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:55028:196"/>
Denomination also of this Effect: supposing a secret Friendship where is none, and imputing that to a certain Cognation, or Sympathy, which seems to proceed from a manifest Dissimilitude and Antipathy betwixt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Natures. For, wherever two Plants are set together, whereof the one, as being of a far Different, if not quite Contrary Nature, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a different kind of nourishment, doth substract and assimilate to its self such a juice of the earth, as would otherwise flow to the other, and deprave its nourishment, and consequently give an evil tincture to its Fruit and Flowers: in this case, Both Plants are reciprocally the remote Cause of the Prosperity each of other. And thus Rew, growing neer the roots of the Figg-tree, and attracting to its self the Rank and Bitter moisture of the earth, as most agreeable to its owne nature; leaveth the Milder and Sweeter for the aliment of the Fig tree, and by that means both assisteth the procerity of the Tree, and Meliorateth the Fruit thereof. Thus also Garlick, set neer to a Rose tree, by consuming the Foetid juice of the ground, and leaving the more Odorate and benigne to pass into the roots of the Rose tree; doth both farther the Growth and Germination thereof, and encrease the Sweetness of it Flowers. But, as for the Amity betwixt the <hi>Wild Poppy</hi> and Wheat, we should refer it to another Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the Qualification of the ground by the tincture of the Wheat, so as to prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it for the Generation and growth of the Wild Poppy; not by substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Disagreeing moisture, but by Enriching the Soyle, or impraeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating it with a fertility, determinate to the production of some sorts of weeds, and chiefly of that. For, most certain it is, that there are certain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, the truth is, all Plants, that are great Depraedators of the moisture of the earth, defraud others that grow neer them, of their requisite nourishment, and so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees impoverishing, at length destroy them. So the Colewoort, is an enemy not only to the Vine, but any other Plant dwelling neer it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a very succulent and rank Plant, and so exhausts the fattest and most prolifical juice of the ground. And if it be true, that the Vine will avoid the Society of the Colewoort, by Averting its trunck and branches from it; this may well be only in respect of its finding less nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on that side: for, as the <hi>Lord St. Alban</hi> hath well observed, though the root continue still in the same place and position, yet will the Trunk alwayes bend to that side, on which it nourisheth most. So likewise the Oke and Olive, being large trees of many roots, and great spenders of moisture, doe never thrive well together: because, the stronger in Attraction of juice, deceives and starves the weaker. Thus Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock is a dangerous neighbour to Rew; because, being the Ranker Plant of the two, and living upon the like juice, it defrauds it of sufficient
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:55028:197"/>
sustenance, and makes it pine away for penury. And the like of the rest.</p>

And this may be inferred from hence; that when the season of those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lowers is past, and the smelling organ unoccupied; the Waters smell as fragrant as ever. For, as to the <hi>Assuefaction</hi> of the sense of smelling, to particular odours, good or bad, we need not say much of that: since Experience doth daily confirme, that the sense is scarce moved and affected by the same odour, though closely praesented, after Custom hath once strongly imbued it with the same.</p>

For, common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience demonstrateth, that in men of temperate Diet and euchymical bodies, very deep and large wounds are many times soon healed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; i. e. meerly by the goodness of Nature it self, which being vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and of our own provision furnished with convenient means, wholesom and assimilable Blood, doth every moment freshly apply it to the part that hath suffered solution of Continuity, and thereby redintegrate the same: especially when those Impurities generated by putrefaction in the wound, which might otherwise be impediments to Natures work of Assimilation and Consolidation, are removed by the Detersive and Adstrictive Faculty of the Salt in the Urine, wherewith the wound is daily to be washed, according to the praescript of our Sympathetical Chirons. Nor is this more than what Dogs commonly do, when by licking their wounds clean, and moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them with the saltish Humidity of their tongues; they easily and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily prove their own Chirurgeons. (3) The Basis or Foundation of Hoplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrism is meerly Imaginary and Ridiculous; for, the Assertors thereof ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally dream of a certain <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> or Common Soul in the World, which being diffused through all parts of the Universe, doth constantly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the Vulnerary Virtue of the Unguent, &amp; Vitriol, from the Extravenated blood adhaering to the weapon or cloth, to the wound, at any distance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and imbuing it therewith, strongly assist Nature in the Consolidation of the Disunion.

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:55028:209"/>
                     <hi>Epicurus,</hi> founds his Discourse upon these Four Pillars, or <hi>Praeconsiderables</hi>; (1) <hi>That all Concretions do continually emit subtile Effluvia's, or Apor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea's:</hi> (2) <hi>That the contexture of no Concretion is so compact, as not to have many small Vacuities, or insensible Pores, variously intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among its solid and component particles:</hi> (3) <hi>That the Effluvia's stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Concretions, are not equally Congruous or Accommodate to all Bodies they meet with in the sphere of their Diffusion:</hi> (4) <hi>That the small Pores, or insensible Inanities intercepted among the particles of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, are not all of one and the same Circumscription, or Figure; and so not indifferently accommodable or proportionate to all sorts of Effluvia s issuing from other bodies, but only to such, as are symmetrical or Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them in Figure and Magnitude.</hi> And then <hi>He</hi> proceeds to erect this superstructure thereupon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Attractive Virtue of the Loadstone, being determinate only to Iron and Steel (which is Purified Iron) seems to consist in this; that both from the Loadstone and Iron there perpetually issue forth continued streams of insensible particles, or bodies, which more or less, according to their number and force of diffusion, commove and impel the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Aer: and because the streams which flow from the Loadstone are both more numerous and more potent, than those which are emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Iron; therefore is the ambient Aer alwayes more strongly discussed and impelled about the Loadstone, than about the Iron; and so there are many more Inane Spaces therein created about the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, than about the Iron. That forasmuch as, when the Iron is placed within the sphere of the Aer Discussed by the Effluxions of the Loadstone, there cannot but be much of Inanity intercepted (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand insensible Inanity) betwixt it and the Loadstone; thence it comes, that the Aporrhaeaes of the Iron tend more freely or uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptedly toward that part, which faceth the Loadstone, and so are carried quite home unto it: and because they cannot tend thither in such swarms, and with such freedome, but they must impell the Particles of the Iron that are yet cohaerent together; therefore must they also move and impel the whole mass of Iron, consisting of those recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Cohaerent Particles, and so carry it quite home to the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. That, when a Loadstone Attracteth Iron, not only through the Aer, but also through divers compact and firm bodies, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly through Marble; we are to conceive that there are more and more capacious Inanities made in that part of such interposed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which respecteth the Loadstone, than in that part of them, which confronteth the Iron. That the reason, why other things, as Straw, Wood, Gold, &amp;c. being situate within the sphere of the Aer Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed by the Effluxes of the Loadstone, do not in like manner emit their subtile particles in such numerous and potent streams, as carrying along their Cohaerent Particles with them, should move and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel their whole masses to a Conjunction with it: is only this, that the Particles emitted from the Iron are alone Commensurable to the Inane Spaces in the Loadstone. That, because Iron tendeth to the Loadstone indiscriminately, i. e. either upward or downward, transversly or obliquely, according to the region of its Application; this indifferency could not be, but in respect of the introduced Vacuities, into which the particles (otherwise prolabent only downward)
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:55028:210"/>
are carried without Distinction of region. And, lastly, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iron towards the Loadstone, is assisted and promoted by the Aer, by reason of its continual Motion and Agitation; and first by the <hi>Exterior Aer,</hi> which being alwayes most urgent on that part, where it is most Copious, cannot but impel the Iron toward that part where it is less Copious, or more full of Inanities, i. e. toward the Loadstone: and afterward by the <hi>Interior Aer,</hi> which being likewise alwayes commoved and agitated, cannot but cause the stronger motion toward that part, where the Space is rendred more Inane.</q> And this we conceive to be the summary of <hi>Lucretius</hi> Exposition of <hi>Epicurus</hi> Opinion touching the Reason of the Loadstones <hi>Iron-attractive</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>

                     </note>And <hi>Galen (in loco citato)</hi> impugning the Magnetick Theory of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> first makes a contracted, but plain recital thereof, in these words: <hi>A lapide quidem Herculeo ferrum, à succino verò paleus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahi, &amp;c. quippe effluentes Atomos ex lapide illo ita figuris congruere cum illis, quae ex ferro effluunt, ut in amplexus facile veniant; quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obrem impactas utrinque (nempe in ipsa tum lapidis, quam ferri corpora concreta) &amp; resilientes deinde in medium, circumplicari in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicem, &amp; ferrum simul pertrahi, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein, besides his usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fidelity in the Recitation even of such opinions of other men, as he thought good to endeavour to refute, we have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe, that <hi>Galen</hi> came as near as possible to the true and genuine sense of <hi>Epicurus</hi>: forasmuch as those Four Praecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderables alledged by <hi>Lucretius</hi> for the support of his exposition of the Cause and Manner of the Coition of the Loadstone and Iron, may be with equal Congruity accommodated also to this latter Epicurean Solution of the same problem, according to this praesent interpretation and abridgement of <hi>Galen.</hi> For, according to the tenour thereof, both the Loadstone and Iron are praesumed to consist of particles exactly alike in configuration, and to have the like Inane Spaces, or insensible pores intercepted among those particles: and this upon no slender ground, seeing that the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone and Iron are perfect Twinns, being both generated not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the same Matrix, but of the same Materials, one the same Mineral Vein of the Earth. And, therefore, it is the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the particles or Atoms issuing in continued streams from the Loadstone, and invading Iron situate within the Orb of their activity, should easily and deeply insinuate themselves into the pores of the Iron; and there meeting with streams of other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms so exactly consimilar to themselves, engage them to reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Cohaerence, and being partly repercussed or rebounded from thence toward their Source, abduce those Atoms along with them, to which they cohaere, and by the impulse of other cohaerent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, abduce also the whole and entire mass: especially since it is part of the supposition, that the Atoms transmitted from the Iron to the Loadstone, do reciprocally move, engage, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the particles thereof, after the same manner; it being almost necessary that the Atoms on both sides, in good part rebounding or resilient, toward their sources, and mutually implicated, should flow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the medium, and so doing, that the whole bodies or masses
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:55028:210"/>
of the iron and Loadstone should be brought to a Conjunction in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, because of the Cohaesion of both sorts of the flowing Atoms, with those, of which the whole masses are contexed. For, notwithstanding it be vulgarly apprehended and affirmed, that the Iron doth come to the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, rather then the Loadstone to the Iron; that the streams of Atoms emanant from the Loadstone, are both more numerous and much more potent; and found by Experiment that pieces of Iron do not only meet Loadstones half way, but come quite home to them, where the Loadstones are either much greater and weightier, or so held fast in a mans hand, or otherwise, as that they cannot exercise their reciprocal tendency: yet, as <hi>Gilbert</hi> speaks (<hi>de Magnet. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.) <hi>Mutuis viribus fit Concursus ad unitionem,</hi> the Coition is not from one single Attraction, but from a <hi>Double,</hi>

                     </gap>, or <hi>Conactus.</hi> And, as for the reason, why other things do not apply themselves to the Loadstone, as well as Iron; it may be said, that the streams of Atoms flowing from the Loadstone, and encountring those that are emitted from other bodies, do either pass uninterruptedly along by them, or are not, in respect of their Dissimilitude in Figures, so implicated or Complected with them, as in their resilition to flow together and concurr in the medium.</p>

                     </note> by the opposition of some Arguments, and especially of these <hi>Three Quaeries.</hi> (1) <hi>How such minute and insensible bodies, as those of which the Magnetick Aporrhaeas are supposed to consist, can be able to Attract [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] so great a weight as that of a mass of Iron?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it may be Answered, in behalf of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that the Magnetick Effluxes are not supposed to be so potent, as to draw any mass of Iron of what weight soever, but only such a one, whose bulk or weight carrieth some proportion to the force of the Attrahent, or Loadstone. Again, He might have considered, that the motions of the Grossest and Heaviest Animals are performed by their spirits, that are bodies as exile and imperceptible as the Magnetick Effluviaes: that Winds, which also consist of insensible particles, do usually overturn trees and vast aedifices, by the impetuosity of their impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and that subterraneous Vapours are frequently the Causes of Earthquakes. And, as for the reason, How the Magnetick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porrhaea's can <hi>Deduce, Apprehend,</hi> and <hi>Detain</hi> a mass of Iron; He might have remembred, that the Atoms of the Magnet are conceived to have certain small <hi>Hooks,</hi> or <hi>Clawes,</hi> by which they may lay hold upon the <hi>Ansulae,</hi> or Fastnings in the Iron; to have a violent <hi>Motion,</hi> which is the Cause both of their Impaction against, and Resilition from the Iron, and to have a perpetual <hi>Supply</hi> of the like Atoms continually streaming from the same fountain, by which they are assisted in their Retraction, whereupon the Attraction may ensue, and that so much the more forcible, by how much nearer the Iron is praesented, in regard of the more copious Efflux, or Density of the Magnetical rayes. (2) How comes it, <hi>That a piece, or ring of Iron, being it self Attracted by a Loadstone, and on one part ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerent unto it, should at the same time attract and suspend another ring on the contrary part; that second ring likewise attract and suspend a third,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:55028:211"/>
that third a fourth, that fourth a fifth, &amp;c.</hi> To this we may apply that Response of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which <hi>Galen</hi> himself commemorates; <hi>An dicemus, effluentium ex lapide particularum nonnullas quidem, ubi ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro occu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>as its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Mistress, Iron, seems to be endowed with a Faculty, that holds some Analogy to the sense of Animals</hi>; and that principally in respect of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</hi> For (1) as an Animal, having its sensory invaded and affected by the species of a grateful object, doth instantly desire, and is according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried, by the instruments of Voluntary motion, to the same: so likewise so soon as a lesser or weaker Loadstone, or piece of Iron, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded and percelled with the species of a greater or more potent one; it is not only invited, but rapt on toward the same, by a kind of nimble Appetite, or impetuous tendency.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) As sensible objects do not diffuse their species of Colour, Odour, Sound, &amp;c. to an Animal at any distance whatever, but have the spheres of their Diffusion or transmission limitted: so neither doth the Loadstone, nor Iron transmit their Species or Emanations each to other, at any distance whatever, but only through a determinate interval of space, beyond which they remain wholly insensible each of others virtue.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) As a sensible object, that is convenient and grateful, doth by its species immitted into the sensory of an Animal, convert, dispose, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Soul of the Animal; and its soul being thus converted disposed and attracted toward that object, doth by its Virtue or Power, carry the body, though gross and ponderous, along to the same: exactly so doth the Loadstone seem, by its species transfused, to convert, dispose and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract towards it the (as it were) soul, or spiritual substance of Iron; which doth instantly by its power or vertue, move and carry the whole mass, or grosser parts of it along to an union with the same. Certainly, it would not easily be believed, that a thing so exile and tenuious, as is the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Soul of an Animal (which is only <hi>Flos substantiae,</hi> the purer and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tler part of its matter) should be sufficiently potent to move and from place to place transfer so ponderous and unweildy a mass, as that of the Body; unless our sense did demonstrate it unto us, and therefore, why should we not believe, that in Iron there is somewhat, which though it be not perfectly a Soul, is yet in some respects Analogous to a Soul; that doth though most exile and tenuious in substance, move, and transferr the rest of the mass of Iron, though ponderous, gross and of it self very unfit for motion? All the Difficulty, therefore, which remains, being only about the Manner, How the Sentient Soul of an Animal is affected by and attracted toward a Grateful Object, let us conceive, that the sensible species, being it self Corporeal, and a certain Contexture of small particles effluxed from the object, such as do gently and pleasantly commove and affect the Organ of Sense, being once immitted into the Sensory, doth instantly move the part of the Soul, (which is also Corporeal, and a certain Contexture of small particles) inhaerent or resident in that Organ, and evolving the particles of the Soul converted (perchance) another way, and turning them about toward that part, from whence themselves are derived, i. e. toward the object, it doth impress a kind of impulse upon them, and so determine and attract the soul, and consequently the whole Animal, toward the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For, admitting this Conception, we may complete the Parallelism intended, thus; as the particles of a sensible species, transmitted from a grateful object, and subingressing through the organ into the contexture of the Soul, or Sentient part thereof, do so sollicite it, as that it becomes
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:55028:212"/>
converted toward, and is carried unto that particular object, not without a certain impulse of appetite: so do the particles of the Magnetical spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, subingressing into the Soul of the Iron, so evolve its insensible particles, and turn them toward the Loadstone, as being thus sollicited, it conceives a certain appetite or impetus toward the same, and which is more, forthwith resalutes it, by diffusing the like species toward it. For, as if the Iron were before asleep and unactive, it is awakened and excited by this exstimulation of the Magnetical Species; and being as it were admonished, what is the propriety of its nature, it sets it self nimbly to work, and owns the Cognation. But, by what other way soever it shall be explicated, How an Animal is affected by, and rapt toward a sensible object: by the same way may it still be conceived, how Iron is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by, and rapt toward a Loadstone. For, albeit as to divers other things, there be no Analogy betwixt the Nature and Conditions of an Animal, and those of Iron: yet cannot that Disparity destroy the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy betwixt them in point of <hi>Alliciency</hi> or <hi>Attraction,</hi> here supposed. Which well considered, <hi>Scaliger</hi> had no reason to charge <hi>Thales Milesius</hi> with ridiculous Madness, for conceding the Loadstone and Iron to have <hi>Souls:</hi> as Dr. <hi>Gilbert (lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Magnet. cap.</hi> 4.) hath observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>

For, having conceded this Geometrical Distinction of parts to a <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella,</hi> or Spherical Magnet; we shall reap this advantage thereby, that we shall easily comprehend and describe the several reasons of Laws and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments Magnetical. To particularize; insomuch as the Magnetique Rayes are diffused from the Centre of the Loadstone to all points of it superfice, and beyond it to the bounds of their Orb of Activity; that ray, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth through either of its Poles, doth attract only by the force of the Axis; and that, which passeth through the Aequator, draws only by the force of the Diametre of the Aequator; and the other rayes, which like Meridians, pass through the other parts, draw by a Compound or Complicated force, insomuch as they are alwayes intermediate betwixt one ray, which proceeds directly from the Axis, and is parallel to the Aequator, and another which comes directly from the Diametre of the Aequator, and is parallel to the Axis. And, because the Aequator is aequidistant from either Pole; thence is it, that an Iron Obelus, or Needle, being praesented thereunto, shall be drawn parallel to the Axis, and in a direct line to the Diametre of the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: because all the rayes expiring from the Axis, as they are the longest and strongest of all others, so are they also on each hand Equal, and equally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive of the Extremes of the Needle; so that when it cannot incline to one Pole more than to the other, as being aequilibrated by two equal rivals, it must consist in the middle betwixt them both. Again, if the Needle be praesented to any part of the Terrella, beyond the Aequator, toward either Pole, in this case, because the ray issuing from the Diametre of the Aequator doth then display its virtue to the height, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ay which is derived
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:55028:213"/>
from the Axis, is not of so much power as another longer one passing through, or near to the Aequator: therefore shall the extreme of the Needle, toward the nearest Pole, feeling that stronger virtue, be somewhat inclined; as if affecting to be conformed to that ray, which is direct to the Diametre of the Aequator; and it shall be alwayes inclined so much the more, by how much longer that ray is, and the other, pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The same is to be understood of the Austrine Pole of one Loadstone, in respect of the Austrine Pole of another; and also of either Cuspis of a Needle excited as well in respect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Needle invigorated, as of a Loadstone.

But, since what is here supposed, is wholly repugnant to the Experience of all, who have or shall attempt so to aequilibrate an Iron in the Aer betwixt two Loadstones, as that it shall not feel the Attractive Virtue of one more strong than that of the other: we need not long study what to think of the suspension of Mahomets Iron Chest.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it less impossible, that an Iron should be held up, at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in the Aer, by the Virtue of a Loadstone placed above it: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as that force, which at first is sufficient to overcome the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of the Irons Gravity, and elevate it from the ground, must, as the Iron approacheth nearer, be still more potent to attract it; and so that cannot oppose the Attractive Energy of the Loadstone, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of it sphere, which was forced to submit and conform unto it, in the Extremes. This we may soon experiment, with a Needle by a thread chained to a table, and elevated perpendicularly in the aer, by the pole of a Loadstone: for, the Needle will nimbly spring up to meet the Loadstone, so farr as the thread will give it scope; and if the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon as we may assure our selves, that <hi>Dinocrates,</hi> that famous Architect, who, as <hi>Pliny</hi> relates (<hi>lib.</hi> 34. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.) began to Arch the Temple of <hi>Arsinoe</hi> in Alexandria, with Loadstones, that so Her Iron Statue might remain Pendulous in the aer, to excite wonder and Veneration in the Spectators; but was interrupted in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his Work both by his own death, and that of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> Arsinoes Brother, who expired not long before him; died most opportunely in respect of his Reputation, because He must have failed of the chief Design, though he had lived to finish his structure: so also can it be no longer doubted, that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his story, of the Iron Chariot in the Temple of <hi>Serapis,</hi> and <hi>Beda's</hi> of the Iron Horse of <hi>Beller<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(1) In its <hi>Native Purity</hi>; for, if no Dross or Heterogeneous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance be admixt to the Magnetick Vein in the earth, from which a Magnet is extracted; then is that Loadstone superlatively potent and energetical in Attraction: and among Loadstones of this sincere and homogeneous Constitution, there are found no degrees of Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but what the Difference of their several Bulks doth necessarily create. But, in case any Heterogeneous matter be commixt with the Magnetick seeds or particles of a Loadstone, at its Concretion; as it for the most part falls out: then must the Attractive Energy of that stone be weaker, according to the proportion of that spurious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter admixed thereunto. This may be confirmed from hence; that some very small Loadstones are more potent than very Great ones; of which sort shall we account that of which <hi>Mersennus (de Magnete)</hi> affirms, that weighing but 7 Gr. in all, it would nimbly attract and elevate a mass of Iron 17 times higher than it self: and from hence, that some stones that were dull and languid before, after the secretion of their Drossy and Impure parts, become very active and potent. Thus, when any Heterogeneous substance hath been, like a Cortex or shell circumobduced about a Loadstone, in its concretion; if the same be pared or filed away, and the remaining Kernel be polished; its Virtue shall be augmented to a very great proportion. (2) <hi>In its Artificial Tersness or Politeness</hi>; for, by how much smoother a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone is, in it superfice, with so many the more rayes of Virtue, both Attrahent and Amplectent or Connectent, doth it touch Iron oblated unto it; and <hi>è contra.</hi> Likewise, as for the more or less <hi>praedisposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>is thereby so much Corroborated, that it will take up a farr greater weight of Iron or Steel, than while it remained naked or unarmed.</hi> For, <hi>Mersennus</hi> had a Loadstone, which, (as himself avoucheth) being naked, could elevate no more than half an ounce of Iron; but when he had armed it with pure and polisht steel, it would easily suspend 320 times a greater weight, i. e. ten pounds of Iron: a proportion not credible, but upon the certificate of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. Now, the <hi>Cause</hi> of this admirable Corroboration of the Loadstones Attractive Virtue, by a plate of polisht Steel, can be no
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55028:215"/>
other than this; that the Loadstone being of such a rough contexture, as that in respect of the particles of some heterogeneous matter concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated unto it, it is uncapable of that exquisite smoothness in the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, which may be obtained by steel; therefore can it not touch Iron so exquisitely, or in so many points, as Steel may: and consequently not invade it with so many Direct and united rayes. But, Steel being of a more simple substance, and close contexture; may in all its substance be imbued with the Magnetique Virtue: and being polisht, touch an Iron, to which it is admoved, with more parts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it with more dense and united rayes.

We say, <hi>To Iron Admoved</hi>; For, though the <hi>Retentive</hi> Virtue of a Loadstone Armed with Steel, be by many degrees stronger; yet is its <hi>Attractive</hi> Virtue by some degrees weaker than that of an unarmed Loadstone: i. e. it doth not diffuse its Attractive virtue half so farr, and a sheet of the finest Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice paper interposed betwixt an Armed stone and Iron, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede its Attraction; a manifest argument, that the Fortification is determined only to contact. This we confess <hi>Mersennus</hi> flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and upon his own observation: but till our Reader shall meet with such a stone, as <hi>Mersennus</hi> used, we advise him not to desert the common Experience of the impediment of the Attraction of Iron by an Armed Loadstone, by paper interposed, since <hi>Grandamicus,</hi> whose chief business was the exact observation of all Magnetique Apparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, expresly saith; <hi>vix fit adhaesio ferri ad lapidem armatum, si vel Charta, vel aliud tenuissimum Corpus interponatur.</hi> It hath, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, observed, that if a Magnet be perforated along its Axis, and a rod of polisht Steel, exactly accommodated to the perforation, be thrust thorow it; its orb of Attraction shall be much enlarged, and its Energy fortified to an incredible rate. <hi>Consule Iacob.

Which is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable from hence, that if the Needle be so long, that its extremes reach beyond the orb of the Great Loadstones activity; then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not a less or less potent one remove it away and elevate it: and in case one of the extremes be somewhat too near to either Pole of

And, as the Globe of the Earth hath an <hi>Aequator, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels</hi> and <hi>Meridians</hi>; so hath the Loadstone: as may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to the eye, by applying a small Steel Needle thereunto; for, at either of its Poles, the Needle shall be erected perpendicularly, and lye in the same line with its Axis; but at any of the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Spaces, or Parallels, it shall be neither plainly erected, nor plainly lye along, but observe an oblique situation, and more or less ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, according to the variety of the Parallels; and at the middle interstice, or Aequator, it shall dispose it self in conformity to the ductus of the Meridian, and fix in a position parallel to the Axis of the Loadstone. That a Loadstone doth accommodate it self exactly to the Earth, as a Needle doth accommodate it self to the Loadstone; is evinced from this easie Experiment. If you suspend a Loadstone (whose Poles you have formerly discovered, and noted with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, <hi>N. S.</hi>) in calme aer, or set it floating at liberty in a vessel of Quicksilver, or a small Skiff of Cork swimming upon Water, that so it may freely perform the office of its nature; you shall observe it continually to move it self from side to side, and suffer alternate Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations or accesses and recesses, till it hath so disposed it self ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Meridian, as that one of its Poles, viz. that marked with <hi>N.</hi> shall point to the North, and the other, upon which <hi>S.</hi> is inscribed, to the South. Nor that only, but, forasmuch as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is situate near the North of the Earth, and so hath the North pole somewhat demersed or depressed below the horizon, nearer than the South Pole of the Earth: therefore doth not the Loadstone keep up both its Poles in a level or perfectly horizontal position, but depresseth that pole which affects the N, somewhat below the plane of the horizon, as much as it can, directing the same to the <hi>N.</hi> pole of the Earth. Farther, being it is commonly observed, that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression (some call it the DECLINATION, others the IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLINATION) of the <hi>N.</hi> pole of the Loadstone, or point of an excited Needle, is so much the greater, by how much nearer the stone or needle is brought to the Boreal part of the Earth; so much less, by how much nearer to the Aequator: therefore may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:55028:217"/>
that a Loadstone, being removed, in the same position of freedome, from the Aequator by degrees to each of the Earths poles, would more and more depress or decline its Boreal pole, by how much it should come nearer and nearer to the Boreal pole of the Earth; and on the otherside of the Aequator, more and more decline its Austral pole to the Austral pole of the Earth, by how much near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it did approach the same; nor could it lye with both poles above the horizon at once, in any part of the Earth, but upon the Aequator, and at either of the Poles of the Earth, the Axis of the stone would make one with the Axis of the Earth.<note place="margin">

                  <p>The THIRD; That Iron acquireth a Verticity not only from the touch or affriction of a Loadstone, but also from its meer situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in, upon, or above the Earth, in conformity to the poles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For, all Iron barrs, that have long remained in Windows, Grates, &amp;c. in a position polary, or North and South; if you suspend them in aequilibrio by lines in the aer, so as they may move themselves freely, according to the inclination of their Virtue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Earth, will make several diadroms hither and thither, and rest not untill they have converted to the North that extreme, which in their former diuturne position regarded the North, and that to the South, which formerly respected the South: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recovered this their Cognation, they shall fixe in a Meridional posture as exactly as the Loadstone it self, or a Magnetified Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
                  <p>To experiment this, the most easie way is to offer, at convenient distance, a Magnetick Dial, or Marriners Compass, to the extrems of an Iron barr, that hath long layn <hi>N</hi> and <hi>S</hi>: for, then may you soon observe the Needle or Versory freely equilibrated therein to be drawn in that point, which respecteth the North, by that extreme of the barr, which is Australized, and, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the South point of the Needle to be drawn by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of the barr, which is Borealized. This Vertical impraegna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iron meerly by the Earth, is also evidenced from hence; that Iron barrs made red hot, and then set to cool in a Meridional position, do acquire the like polary Cognation, and being either at liberty of conversion suspended by small Chords in the aer, or set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This being most manifest, why may not our Marriners, in defect of a Loadstone, make a Needle or Fly for their Chard, of simple Iron alone; since, if it hath layn in a Meridional situation above the earth, or been extinguished according to the same lawes of position, it will bear and demonstrate as strong an affection to the poles of the Earth, as a Needle invigorated by a Loadstone, nor shall the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression or Declination of the one, in each degree of remove from the Aequator toward either pole, be less or greater than that of the other.</p>

And, when we observe a rod of Iron, freshly infected with the Polary virtue of the Earth, to put on a certain spontaneous inclination in its extremes, and convert it self exactly according to the meridian, and with a kind of humble homage salute that pole of its late inspirer, from whence it received the strongest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence: how can we more reasonably explain the reason of that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than by conceaving, that upon the immi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When a red hot barr of Iron is cooled, not in a meridian position to the poles of the Earth, but transversly or equinoctionally; why doth it not contract to it self the like verticall disposition? doubtless, the best reason that can be given for it, is this; that the insensible particles of it are
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:55028:218"/>
not converted, nor their situation varied so much in the one posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole mass, as in the other: the magneticall Rayes of the Earth invading the substance of the Iron in indirect and so less potent lines. Likewise, if the same barr of Iron, after it hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed a Verticity, be again heated and coold in a contrary position; what reason can be assigned to the change of the Southern Verticity into a Northern, and its Northern into a Southern, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary obversion of its ends: unless this, that the particles of the Iron doe thereby suffer a fresh conversion, and quite contrary disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; no otherwise than those of a piece of wood, when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curvated by the fire according as this or that side is obverted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</p>
                  <p>The SIXTH; forasmuch as Iron doth derive the same Verticity or Direction from its Affriction against a Loadstone;<note place="margin">

The strength of this our conception consisteth chiefly in this; that after a rod or needle of Iron hath contracted a sprightly Verticity from a Loadstone, by being rubbed thereupon from the middle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ends, it doth instantly lose it again, if it be rubbed upon the same, or any other Loadstone, the opposite way, or from either end toward the middle. For, how can it be imagined, that a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand stroak of a knife upon a Loadstone should destroy that polary Faculty, which it had obtained from a left-hand stroak upon the same; unless from hence, that the insensible particles of the blade of the knife, were turned one way by the former affriction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced again t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It seems to be the same, in proportion, as when the ears of Corn in a field are blown toward the South by the North wind, and suddainly blown from the South toward the North by the South wind. Nor doth Iron, after its excitement retain any of the magneticall Atoms im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into it either from the Earth, or a Magnet; but, suffers only an immutation of its insensible particles, which sufficeth to its polary respect a long time after: for, a Needle is no whit heavier after its invigoration by a Loadstone, than before, as <hi>Mersennus</hi> and <hi>Gassendus</hi> together experimented, in such a <hi>Zygostata</hi> or Ballance, wherewith Jewellers are to weigh Pearles and Diamonds; which is so exact, that the ninety-sixth part above four thousand of a grain, will turn it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>

which introduce upon the particles of Iron the same Disposition, and Local respect, as themselves have.</p>
                  <p>For (1) That an Immutation is caused in the particles of Iron, as well by the influence, or Magnetical rayes of the Loadstone (which doth also invigorate Iron, at some distance, though not so powerfully, as by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate contact, or affriction) as of those transmitted from the Earth; we have already declared to be not only verisimilous, but absolutely necessary: &amp; that nothing should yet be derived unto the Iron from them; as the Instrument of that Immutation; is openly repugnant to the Fundamental Laws of all Physical activity, since nothing can act upon a distant subject but by some Instrument, either continued or transmitted.</p>

<q>makes out the cause of the Magnets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direction,

or Variation, thus. If the Needle be placed in the middle betwixt two vast Continents, as in the Azores, which have Europe to the East, and America to the West; it suffers no sensible Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to either part: but, if it be brought nearer to the Continent of Europe and Asia, it must be invited and deflected toward the East; and nearer to the Continent of America, it shall deviate as much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the West. For the same Cause also, upon the Western coast of Africa the Declination is toward the East; and on the Orientall, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the West: and betwixt them both, as at the Cape of Good-hope none at all.</q>
And yet this subtle Theory of <hi>Dr. Gilbert</hi> is more the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> suspected of Imperfection. For, since that, on the Western coast of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, and of Goa, the Declination of the Needle is Westward; and not onely on the Orientall side of the Meridionall America, and chiefly about the streights of Megellan, but also on the Orientall side of the Septentrionall America, as at Virginia, the Declination teaseth not to be, in the same manner, toward the East; absolutely contrary to <hi>His</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis: therefore hath the incomparable Father, <hi>Kircher,</hi> to his own immortall honour, and our greater satisfaction, advised us, to leave the Attraction of adjacent Continents, and have recourse onely to the divers Positions of the interior Magneticall Fibres of the Earth, over which the Magnet, or Needle stands; considering that they have their situation sometimes exquisitely Meridionall, sometimes more and less oblique, and tend in some places in longer, in others in shorter tracts. For, it is no difficult conception, the Virtue of the Earth is impressed upon the Needle from the magneticall Fibres and Veins, that are nearest, i. e. directly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent thereunto; and disposed thereby into a situation respective to the Ductus of those perpendicularly subjacent Fibres: so that whatever be the Direction of the Needle; i. e. either without all Declination, or with some, more or less, in one part toward the East, in another toward the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary pole of the heavens; still may we suppose it to be exactly respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Ductus, or Direction of the Fibres of the Earth, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly lye underneath it. Nor is this meerly Petitionary, or exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated onely for the solution of this grand Magneticall Problem, as the Former of <hi>Gilbert</hi> seems to have been; but founded upon a Parallel <hi>Experiment</hi>: for, if you place severall Barrs of Iron excited, upon the ground, so that one may lye exactly according to the Meridian, and all the rest in severall degrees of obliquity, untill you come almost to make an Aequinoctionall line with one; and then gently and at requisite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, move an invigorated Needle, equilibrated upon a pin, over them; you shall observe the Direction of it to be varied to more and less obliquity from the Meridian Barr, respectively to the situation of each of the other Barrs, over which it is directly held. Now, if you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Magnetique Fibres of the Earth to have the same Virtue upon the Needle, as, if not much more than the subjacent Iron Barrs have: you have attained the bottome of the Mystery, and that one of the greatest in Nature.</p>

we acknowledge, have attempted most laudably, in supposing the Magneticall Fibres, that lye more distant from the Axis of the Earth, or neerer to the superfice thereof, not to be so firmely cohaerent each to other, but that they may be emoved, evolved, and separated, by some subterraneous Cause or other, and so exchange their more oblique, for a less oblique, and at length for an absolutely direct or truely meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dionall situation; as the Fibres of the Muscles of Animalls are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved sometimes to suffer a certain Revulsion, or change of situation, under the skin, for severall Causes: and that this Locomotion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of obliquity of the superficiall magnetick Fibres of the Earth, may be the sole Cause of the like Decrement of obliquity, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Needle, in one and the same place, in divers years.

                  <p>Concerning this, therefore, we say; that in every Loadstone there are two, and but <hi>two true</hi> and <hi>Legitimate</hi> Poles: and that all others apparent in them, either at the Aequator, or betwixt it and either of the Genuine Poles, are spurious or Illegitimate; arising either from some <hi>Node</hi> or Knot growing laterally on to a Magnet (such as is commonly observed to interrupt the direct progress of the Fibres, or Grain of Trees, and of stones) or from an <hi>irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> and <hi>horned Figure</hi> of the stone it self, in respect of either of which the Magnetick Virtue cannot be commodiously united at the two Genuine and directly opposite Poles, but is distracted oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that Prominent Node, or Horn-like Protuberancy.

But, <hi>Others</hi> though they concede, that Generation, indeed, consisteth in the Accession of a Form to Matter; yet will they not allow that Form ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in the Catalogue of Philosophers of this persuasion, <hi>Aristotle</hi> nominateth as Principalls, <hi>Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and <hi>Leucippus</hi>; all which He sharply taxeth of Confounding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration with Alteration, and of inferring, that aswell Generation as Corruption ariseth, not from the <hi>Transmutation</hi> of Principles, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their [<gap reason="foreign">

For, having supposed for a Groundwork, that the Four Elements are not the First Principles; it could not stand with his advantage, not to have assumed also, that the Elements may be so Transmuted, as that the more Generall and Common Matter doth still remaine: and that the same, upon the perdition of the Elementary Forms, may put on a New Forme, that is substantiall; and that very thing, by which the resulting or Generated Body is specified, and entituled to such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination. But, as for <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and the rest enumerated (to whom we may add also <hi>Epicurus</hi>) 'tis well known that notwithstanding they all admitted the Four Vulgar Elements, as readily as <hi>Aristotle</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet would they by no means hear of their <hi>Transmutability</hi> either as to <hi>substance,</hi> or <hi>Qualities</hi>: unanimously decreeing, that in their Commistion each of them is divided into particles most minute, which yet retain the very same substance and qualities, that they had before, as that every particle of Fire doth still retain the substance and quality of Fire, namely Heat; and that every particle of Water doth

For the Text will endure no third interpretation. If the <hi>Latter</hi>; then do not either of the things mixed Remain, and so there can be no Mistion: expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to His own Assumption, and the tenour of that Common Notion, for the praeservation whereof He excogitated and designed this Subterfuge. If the <hi>Former,</hi> as seems most genuinely inferrible from the Adjectives, <hi>Medium</hi> and <hi>Commune</hi>; then our Enquiry is, How, and in what respect, that Middle and Common thing comes to be participant of the Extremes of each Mistile? In the Wine (that we may retain his own Instance) there was Matter, there was Forme, there were Qualities; and likewise in the Water: shall we therefore conceive, that the Middle and Common thing produced, is participant of all, i. e.

                  <p n="1">(1) For the <hi>Matter</hi>; He cannot deny, that the Mistum containes the whole Matter of Both: because neither the Matter of the one, nor of the other can be destroyed.

Now, you cannot expect that each single molecula, or seed of silver should appear to the sense, so as to distinguish it self, by its proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour from the small masses of Gold: because each molecula of silver is sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with, and immersed among 1000 particles or small masses of Gold. Nor can you believe, that the silver is wholly unsilvered, or Changed into Gold; as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmed, that a drop of Wine, infused into a great quantity of Water, is changed into Water: because the skilful Metallist will soon contradict you in that, by an ocular demonstration. For, by Aqua Fortis poured upon the whole mass, He will so separate the silver from that so excessive proportion of Gold, as that there shall not be left inhaerent therein so much as one the smallest particle thereof; and in the superfice you may plainly discern multitudes of very small holes, (like punctures in wax, made by the point of the smallest needle) in which the moleculae or small masses of the silver were resident, before its sequestration from Gold. Why therefore, according to the same reason, should it not be equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the seeds, or particles of Fire are so scatteringly diffused through the substance of wood, as that being surrounded and overwhelmed with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads of particles of other sorrts, they cannot therefore put on the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence proper to their nature, and discover themselves to be what really they are, until being by the force of the external fire invading and dissolving the compage of the wood, set at liberty, and disengaged from their former op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, they issue forth in swarms, and by their coemergency and consimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in bulk figure and motion being again congregated, they display them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the sense in the illustrious Forme of Fire and Flame, and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately diminish the quantity of the wood; which thereupon is first redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Coals, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And would you be, beyond all pretext of doubt, convinced, that they yet retain their proper nature, amidst such multitudes of other particles; be pleased only to make this easie Experiment.

For, though Atoms of the same figure and magnitude may, by their various transposition, adjection, ablation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> compose things of various forms or natures: yet are they not all indifferently disposed to the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of all things, nor can they be connected after one and the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in divers things. Because, to the composition of every thing in specie, is required such a special disposition in the Atoms, which compose it, as that they must appose to themselves such other Atoms, as are congruous and suitable to them, and as it were refuse the society and combination of others that are not. And hence is it, that in the Dissolution of every Concretion, the consimular or like Atoms always consociate together, and expede them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Dissimilar and incongruous.</p>

                  <p n="3">(3) That there is a certain sort (He adds, Admirable) of motion, to which the importance of Epicurus Definition doth not extend; which is thus made.

But, this so admirable Difficulty lies open to a double solution: for it may be <hi>Answered.</hi> (1) That in this case, the Thighs, Leggs, and feet of the man walking upon the deck of the ship, must be alternately moved into new places; because, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as each of his feet is referred from the Anterior to the Posterior part thereof, it must be moved twice as swiftly, as the ship is moved from the Posterior toward the Anterior: since it is absolutely necessary, that the double velocity of one foot should compensate that space of time, in which the other foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er, He declares, that whatever is moved <hi>per se,</hi> is moved <hi>juxta Naturam,</hi> according to Nature; such as he affirms that only to be, which is endowed with a soul: yet will He not admit, that what is moved by Another, should always be moved <hi>Praeter Naturam,</hi> Praeternaturally; but sometimes Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally (as a stone, when it is thrown upward) and sometimes Naturally (as a stone, when it falls Down again.) Now, if you hereupon Demand of Him, What that is, which makes a stone fall Down again; He shall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that what moves it Downward, <hi>per se,</hi> is the Generant it self, or that which first Produced the stone: and that which moves it downward, <hi>per Accidens,</hi> is that which removes the impediment or obstacle to its descent, as the hand of a man, or other thing supporting the stone. And, if you again enquire of him, What is the Difference betwixt the Upward and Downward motion of a stone, how one should be Violent, and the other Natural, since, according to his own Assertion, both are Caused by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: His Return will be, that the Difference lies in this, that the stone is not carried upward, of its own Nature, but Downward; as having the Principle of its Descent, inhaerent in it self, but not that of its Ascent. If you urge Him yet farther; since the stone hath in it self the Principle of its Motion, why therefore is it not moved only by it self, but wants Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or <hi>External Motor?</hi> His Answer will be: that there is a Twofold principle of motion, the one <hi>Active,</hi> the other <hi>Passive</hi>; and in the stone is only the Principle Passive, but in the External Motor is the Active. When yet it may be farther pressed; that since according to his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Passive principle is the <hi>matter,</hi> and the Active the <hi>Forme:</hi> as to the matter, that cannot be the principle of its motion Downward, no more than of its motion upward; and as for the Forme, if that be neither the Active principle, nor the Passive (as he will by no means admit) certainly there can be none. Which for Him to allow, were plainly to destroy his own great Definition of <hi>Nature,</hi> wherein He acknowledgeth it to be the <hi>Principle of Motion.</hi> But, alas! these are but light and venial Mistakes, in comparison of those gross Incongruities that follow.</p>

and plausible to our first thought: but insatisfactory to our second. For, if it were so, then ought the Celerity of the stones motion, in one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom neer the Earth, to be the same whether the stone be let fall from the altitude of only one fathom, or from that of 10, 20, an 100 fathoms, when we exactly measure the spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It may be farther observed, that, whether a stone be let fall from a small, or a great altitude, the motion thereof for the first fathom of its descent, is always of equal velocity, i. e. it is not more nor less swift for the first fathom of its descent from the altitude of an 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> fathoms, than from the altitude of only two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms: when yet it ought to be more swift for the first fathom of the two, than for the first of the hundred, if the Attraction of the Earth be more vehement neer at hand, than far off; in a sensible proportion. We say, in a <hi>sensible</hi> proportion; because, forasmuch as the magnetique rays emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it, are diffused in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound from all parts of the superfice thereof, and so must be so much the more dense, and consequently more potent, by how much less they are removed from it: therefore must the Attraction be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more potent at little than at very great distance; but yet there is no tower or praecipice so high, as to accommodate us with convenience to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, whether the power of the Earths magnetique rayes is Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to a sensible proportion, in a very low place, than in a very high.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithstanding, nothing seems more reasonable than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that since the magnetique Attraction of the Earth is the true Cause of a stones Downward motion, therefore it should be also the <hi>true Cause of the continual Increment of its Velocity, during that motion.</hi> But how it should be so; there's the Knot. Which that we may undo, let us first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume our former supposition (<hi>in the</hi> 2. <hi>Sect. of our chap. of Gravity and Levity.</hi>) that a stone were situate in any of the Imaginary spaces; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that in that case it could not of it self be moved at all: because, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Communion with the World (which you may suppose also to be Annihilated) there could be, in respect thereof, no inferior place or region, whereto it might be imagined to tend or fall; nor could it have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to motion, because there would be no superior region, to which it might be conceived to aspire or mount. Then let us suppose it to be moved by simple Impulsion, or Attraction, toward any other part of the Empty, or Imaginary spaces; and without all doubt, it would be moved thitherward, with a motion altogether Equal or Uniform in all its parts: because there could be no Reason, why it should be more slow in some parts of its motion and more swift in others, there being no Centre, to which it might approach, or from which it might be removed. Suppose farther, that, as the stone is in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t motion, another Impulse, equal in force to the former, whereby it was first moved, were impressed upon it; then, assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, would the stone be moved forward more swiftly than before, not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of any Affection to tend to any Centre, but because the force of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> impulse persevering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the force of the second impulse is superadded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and the accession of that force must so corroborate the former, as to augment the Velocity of the stones motion. And hence comes it, that to move forward a bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>of. Imagine moreover, that a third impulse were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:55028:244"/>
more swift than before; the Encrease of Velocity of necessity still respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the multiplicity of Impulses made upon the body moved. This may be familiar to our conceptions, from the Example of a Globe set upon a plane; which may be emoved from its place with a very gentle impulse, and if many of those Impulses be repeated thickly upon it, as it moves, the motion thereof will be so accelerated, as at length to become superlatively rapid. Which also seems to be the Reason, why a clay Bullet is discharged by the breath of a man, from a Trunck, with so great force, as to kill a Pidgeon at 20, or 30 yards distance: the Impetus or force impelling the bullet, growing still greater and greater, because in the whole length of the trunck there is no one point, in which some of the particles of the mans breath successively flowing, do not impress fresh strokes, or impulses upon the hinder part of the bullet. The same also may be given, as the most probable Cause, why Long Guns carry or shot, or bullet farther than short; though yet there be a certain determinate proportion to be observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the diametre of the bore, and the length of the barrel or tube, as well in Truncks, as Guns: experience assuring, that a Gun of five foot, musket bore, will do as good execution upon Fowl, with shot, and kill as far, as one of ten foot, and the same bore; and consequently that those Gunners are mistaken, who desire to use Fowling pieces of above 5, or 6 foot long; These considerations premised, we may conceive, that when a stone first begins to move downward, it then hath newly received the first impulse of the magnetique rays emitted from the Earth: and that if after the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that first impulse, the Attraction of the Earth should instantly cease, and no nevv force be superadded thereunto from any Cause vvhate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; in all probability, the stone vvould be carried on tovvard the Earth vvith a very slovv, but constantly equal and Uniform pace. But, because the Attraction of the Earth ceaseth not, but is renevved in the second mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by an impulse of equal force to that first, vvhich began the stones mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is again renevved in the third moment, in the 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. as it vvas in the second, therefore is it necessary, that because the former impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, impressed are not destroyed by the subsequent, but so united as still to corroborate the first, and all combining together to make one great force; vve say, therefore is it necessary, that the motion of the stone, from the repeated impulses, and so continually multiplied Impetus or Force, should be more swift in the second moment, than in the first; in the third, than in the second; in the fourth, than the third, and so in the rest succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively; and consequently, that the Celerity should be Augmented in one and the same tenour, or rate, from the beginning to the end of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">

hence it is manifest, that the Aggregate spaces carry the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, <figure/> as the Quadrates of Times: when, the Triangle <hi>ADE</hi> (or space <hi>PR.</hi>) is one, as the Quadrate of <hi>AE,</hi> that is of one Time, is one: and the Aggregate <hi>AFG</hi> (or <hi>PS</hi>) is four: as the Quadrate <hi>AG,</hi> of two, is fower: and the Aggregate <hi>AHI</hi> (or <hi>PT</hi>) is nine: as the Quadrate <hi>AI</hi> of three, is nine; and the Aggregate <hi>AKL</hi> (or <hi>PQ.</hi>) is sixteen, as the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate <hi>AL</hi> of four, is sixteen.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may account the Line <hi>DE</hi> for the first degree of Velocity acquired in the end of the first time; insomuch, as the first time <hi>AE</hi> is not individual, but may be divided into so many instants, or shorter times, as there are points, or particles in the line <hi>AE</hi> (or <hi>AD</hi>) so neither is the degree of Velocity indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, or wholly acquired in one instant; but from the beginning encreaseth through the whole first time, and may be repraesented by so many Lines, as may be drawn parallel to the Line <hi>DE,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the points of the Lines <hi>AD</hi> and <hi>AE</hi>: so that, as those Lines do continually encrease from the point <hi>A</hi> to the Line <hi>DE</hi>; so likewise doth the Velocity continually encrease from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the motion, and being represented what it is in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted instants of the first time, by the intercepted Lines, it may be represented what it is in the last instant of the same first time, by the Line <hi>DE</hi> drawn betwixt the two last points of the Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>ADE.</hi> And because the Velocity, thenceforward conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing its Encrease, may be again signified, by Greater and Greater Lines continently drawn betwixt all the succeeding points of the remaining Lines, <hi>DB</hi> and <hi>EC</hi>; hence comes it, that the Line <hi>FG,</hi> doth represent the degree of Velocity acquired, in the end of the second moment: the Line <hi>HI.</hi> the Velocity acquired in the end of the third moment; and the Line <hi>KL.</hi> the velocity acquired in the end of the fourth moment. And evident it is from hence, how the velocities respond in proportions to the Times; since, by reason of the Triangles of a common angle, and parallel bases, it is well known, that as <hi>DE</hi> are to <hi>EA,</hi> so <hi>FG</hi> to <hi>GA: HI</hi> to <hi>IA,</hi> and <hi>KL</hi> to <hi>LA.</hi> Thus, keeping your eye upon the Figure, and your mind upon the Analogy; you shall fully comprehend, that in the first moment of Time, the falling stone doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire one degree of Velocity, and pervades one degree of space; that in the second moment of Time, it acquires another degree of Velocity, which being conjoynd to the former, makes two, and in the mean while three spaces are pervaded; that in the third moment, it acquires another degree of Velocity, which conjoyned to the two former makes three, and in the mean while seven parts of space are pervaded; and so forward. You shall fully comprehend also, that the Celerities obtain the same Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the moments of Time: and that the spaces pervaded from the beginning to the end of the motion, have the same Ration, as the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drates of the moments of Time; which we assumed to Demonstrate, out of <hi>Gassendus.</hi> But still it concerns you to remember, that we here dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of that Motion, which is Equally, or Uniformly Accelerated; or whose velocity doth continually and uniformly encrease, nor is there any moment of the consequent time, in which the motion is not more swift, than it was in every antecedent moment, and in which it is not accelerated

The <hi>Physical</hi> Reason of that Proportion.</note>And this kindly conducts us to the <hi>Physical</hi> Reason of this Proportion, in which the velocity of bodies Descending is observed to encrease. For wholly excluding the supposition of the Aers assistance of the Downward motion of a stone, by recurring above, and so impelling it downward; and admitting the Magnetick Attraction of the Earth to be the sole Cause of its Descent; unto both which the considerations formerly alleadged seem to oblige us: it is familiar for us to conceive, that the Increment of its Celerity, according to the proportion assigned, ariseth from hence. While in the first moment, the earth attracts the stone, one degree of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity is acquired, and one degree of space is pervaded. In the second moment, the attraction of the Earth continuing, another degree of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity is acquired, and three equal spaces are pervaded: one by reason of the degree of celerity in the mean while acquired, and two by reason of the degree of celerity formerly acquired, and still persevering, as that which is doubly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then, according to the same Ration, in the third moment another degree of celerity is acquired, and five spaces (equal) are pervaded; one by reason of the new degree of celerity in the mean while acquired, and fower by reason of the two former persever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, i. e. two in each moment praecedent, or one of a duplicate aequivalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the new one not yet complete.

For, this admirable Effect seems to have no other Cause but this; that the Lesser body, as it containeth fewer parts, so doth it require the Impulses or strokes of fewer Magnetical rays, by which the attraction is made: and such is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the two forces, as that each moveable being considered with what Resistence you please, still is the force in the movent equally suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to overcome that resistence, and a few magnetique rays suffice to the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:55028:247"/>
attraction of a few parts, as well as many to the attraction of many parts. So that the space being equal, which both are to pervade; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that it must be pervaded by both, in equal or the same time. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided always, that the two bodies assumed, be of the same matter; for, in case they be of divers matters, as the one of Wood, the other of Iron or Lead, that may cause some small Difference in their Velocity. We say, some small Difference; because, if we take two Globes of different materials and weights, but of the same or equal diameters, as (V. G.) one of Lead, the other of Wax: we shall be very far from finding, that the Heavier will be carried down more swiftly than the Lighter, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the excess of its Gravity. For, if one be ten times heavier than the other; yet shall not the Heavier therefore, both being turned off, in the same instant, arrive at the ground ten times sooner than the Lighter: but, at the same time as the heavier, arrives at the ground, from the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 10 Fathoms; the lighter shall come within a foot of the earth; so far short doth the lighter come of being nine fathoms behind the Heavier. And the Cause, why the Lighter Globe of Wax, is carried so swiftly, is the same with that, why a bullet of Lead of only an ounce weight, is carried down as swiftly as another bullet of 100 pound. And, what though the Globe of Wax be as great in circumference, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lead, and somewhat greater; yet seeing still it hath fewer parts to be attracted, it therefore requires fewer magnetical rays to its attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with equal velocity to the heavier. But, the Cause why it is carried som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, though very little, slower than the heavier; is to be derived chiefly from the Aer resisting it underneath, the Aer being more copious in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the virtue Attrahent, in respect of the greatness of its Ambite, or Circumference: and thence is it, that Cork, Pith of Elder, straws, feathers, and the like less compact, and so more light bodies, fall down much more slowly.</p>

Thus, assuming two Bullets, the one of an ounce, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of 100 pound, Simple Gravity, according to the Scales; the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectitious Gravity of the Lesser bullet, acquired by the increment of its velocity during its descent, must be less proportionably to its simple gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, than the Adjectitious gravity of the Greater bullet, acquired by the increment of its Velocity during its Descent, in the same time, and from the same altitude: because, the space and time of the descent of both being equal, the proportion of the acquired gravity of each must be respondent to the proportion of the simple gravity of each. So that if in the end of the fall of the Lesser bullet of an ounce weight, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectitious Gravity of it shall amount to 10 ounces: the Adjectitious gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Greater of 100 pound weight, shall, in the end of its fall, amount to a thousand pound; nor can the Acquired Gravity of the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser ever equal that of the Greater, unless it fall from a far greater Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>

Of this, therefore, we say in short; (1) That, in this case, Mathematicians are wont to suppose, that there are the same Causes of Gravity and Velocity in those sublime places, as are observed here with us below, or neer the surface of the Earth: and if they be not, certainly our Description and Computation must be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vain and fruitless. For, if the Cause of Gravity, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Velocity be the Attraction made by the magnetique rays trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from the Earth; forasmuch as those magnetique rays must become more Rare, and fewer of them arrive at a body, by how much farther it is removed from the Earth: though, perchance, a bullet might be attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted down from the region of the Moon (and if so, the motion of the bullet would be very slow, for a good while, in respect of the very few magnetique rays, that could arrive to that great height) yet from that far greater height of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(2) But, supposing that the magnetique Virtue of the Earth did extend thither; and that a bullet, from whence soever falling, should begin its motion with that speed, and proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the same degrees of Acceleration, which we observe in a stone, or bullet falling from a very high tower: then must it of necessity acquire that incredible Velocity, which our Mathematicians describe. To Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; conceding the Distances or Intervals betwixt the Earth and each of those Caelestial Orbs, which our modern and best Astronomers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally assign; a bullet would fall from the body, or rather the Limbus of the Moon, to the Earth, in two hours and an half; from the Limbus of the Sun, in eleven hours and a quarter: from the region of the Fixt stars, in 39 hours and a quarter. And so, if we imagine the Earth to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated to the Centre, since a bullet would fall from the superfice thereof down to the Centre, in 20 minutes, or the third part of an hour: the same bullet coming from the moon, would pervade the same space from the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfice of the Earth to the Centre of it, in one minute and twenty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, or the third part of a minute: coming from the Sun, it would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the same semidiametral space of the Earth, in seventeen seconds: and coming from the region of the Fixt stars, it would percur the same semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diametral space of the Earth, in five seconds. So incredibly great would be the Velocity of a bullet falling from such vast Altitudes.

The Aer (say they) which is first moved by the Projicient, together with the moveable, doth, at the same time, both propel the moveable, and impel the Aer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately beyond it, which being likewise moved, doth in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner propel the moveable, and impel the aer immediately beyond it; and that aer being thus moved, doth again impel both the moveable and the aer next beyond it: and so consequently the next aer impels both the moveable and the next aer beyond it, until the propulsion and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being gradually debilitated, and at length wholly overcome, partly by the Gravity of the thing moved, partly by the Resistence of the occurring Aer, the motion wholly ceaseth, and the thing projected attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth quiet.</p>

                     </gap> each of these weak Opinions, against which the Reason of every man is ready to object many great absurdities, especially such as the praecedent theory will soon advertise him of: let us praesently recur to the more solid speculations of our master <hi>Gassendus</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles (<hi>de motu impresso a motore translato</hi>) and praesenting you the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary thereof, without further delay satisfie your Curiosity, and our own Debt of assisting it.</p>
                  <p>First we are to determine, <hi>that nothing, remaining it self unmoved, can move another.</hi> For, since our Discourse concerns not the First Cause of all motion, <hi>God,</hi> whose Power is infinite, who is in all places, who can, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the force of his Will, create, move, and destroy all things; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest it is, that nothing <hi>Finite,</hi> especially <hi>Corporeal</hi> (and such only hath

an interest in our praesent consideration) can move another thing, unless it self be also moved at the same time: as <hi>Plato</hi> well observed in his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Neque est Dissicile modo, sed etiam plane impossibile, ut quidpiam mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum imprimere, sine quapiam sui commotione, valeat: (in Timaeo.)</hi> And the Reason is this; whatever doth move, doth act; and <hi>e converso,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth act, doth move; Action and Passion (as Aristotle, 3. physic. 3) being the same with motion. Again, the movent and Moveable ought to be together, or to touch each other, because, whether the movent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, attract, carry, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though it doth touch it, yet if it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge no force of motion upon it, i. e. remain unmoved it self: there shall be only a meer Contact reciprocal, but no motion, and as the one, so shall the other remain unmoved. Therefore, that the one may move the other: it ought to have that vigour or motion first in it self, which it doth impress upon the other: since if it have none, it can give none. Even sense demonstrates, that by how much more vehement motion the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it self is in, at the instant it toucheth the moveable, by so much the farther doth it always propel the same: and thence our Reason may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily infer, that the movent must it self be in some small motion, in the same instant it gives a small motion to another.

                     </gap>ssary, that the movent be moved, not only in a point,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:55028:249"/>
or so far as that point of space, in which it first toucheth the moveable: but also that a while cohaering unto the moveable, it be <hi>moved along with it:</hi> so as we may well conceive them to be made, by that Cohaesion, as it were one and the same body, or one entire moveable, pro tempore; and consequently, that the motion of both the movent and moveable is one intire motion. For, what motion is in the moveable, so long as it remains conjoyned to the movent, is in a manner a certain Tyrocinium, in which the moveable is as it were taught to progress foreward in that way, which the movent hath begun, upward, downward, transverse, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, circular, and that either slowly, or swiftly, and according as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent shall guide and direct it, before its manumission or dismission.</p>
                  <p>Thus, when a man throws a stone with his hand, you may plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how the motion thereof begins together with that of his hand: and after it is discharged from his hand, you cannot say, that a new moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is impressed upon the stone, but only that the same motion begun in the hand is continued. And, therefore, it seems also very unnecessary to require the impression of any new and distinct Force upon the stone projected, by the projicient, which should be the Cause of its motion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its Dismission: seeing nothing else is impressed, but the very motion to be continued through a certain space; so that we are not to enquire, what motive Virtue that is, which makes the Persevering motion, but what hath made the motion, that is to persever. In the moveable, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, there is none but a Passive Force to motion; nor can the Active Force be required in any thing but the movent: and should we, with the Vulgar, say, that there is an Imprest Force remaining, for some time, in the thing moved, or projected; we could thereby understand no other than the Impetus, or motion it self.</p>
                  <p>Here might we opportunely insist upon this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Art.</hi> 2. The <hi>Manner</hi> of the Impression of that Force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> that motion is impressed upon a thing moved, only in respect, that the thing moved hath less force of Resistence, than the movent hath of Impulsion: so that the movent, forcing it self into the place of the moveable, compels it to recede, or give way, and go into another place. But it is more material for us to observe; that when a thing projected is impelled, it is first touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the projicient only in those parts, which are in its superfice or outside and that those outward parts, being pressed by the impulse, do drive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or press upon the parts next to them; and those again impel the parts next to them, and those again the next to them; till the impulse be by succession propagated quite through the body of the thing projected, to the superficial parts in the opposite side, and then begins the motion of the whole, the parts reciprocally cohaering: as hath been formerly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the example of a long pole, or beam of wood. Which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed, but with a very gentle or softly stroke, that one end hath all its parts so commoved successively, as that the stroke may be plainly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a man, that lays his ear close to the other end: which could not be if the impulse were not propagated from parts to parts successively, through the whole substance of the beam. To which it is requisite, that we superad this observable also; that by reason of the force made by Contact, and that short Cohaesion of the moveable to the movent, there is created a certain <hi>Tension,</hi> or stress of all the parts of it, towards the opposite region: and of that by that means, all the parts of the thing
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:55028:250"/>
projected, are disposed or conformed as it were into certain <hi>Fibers,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Files</hi>; of all which the most strong and powerful is that, which being trajected through the Centre of Gravity in the thing projected, becomes as it were the <hi>Axis</hi> to all the circumstant ones. Our eys ascertain, that unless the Centre of Gravity be in the middle of the thing projected, or directly obverted to the mark, at which the thing is thrown; the thing instantly turns it self about, and that part, wherein the Centre of Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, always goes foremost, and as it were carries the rest of the parts, as that which is the most Direct and most Tense of all the Fibres. And this cannot be effected, but with some (more or less) <hi>Deflection</hi> from the mark, at which the force, according to the Centre and Axis of Gravity, was directed; forasmuch as the Centre of Gravity, wherein many Fibres concur, makes some Resistence, and detorting the Fibres, inflecteth them another way, and so a new Axis is made <hi>pro tempore,</hi> according to which the Direction of all the parts in their motion afterward is determined. Hence is it, that, if you would hit a mark, either with a sling, or stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, you must choose a stone, or bullet of an uniform matter and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: or, at least, turn the heavier part of the body to be thrown, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; because otherwise, it will Deflect more or less, to one side or other according to the position and inclination of its Centre of Gravity. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, whether soever the thing projected doth tend, all the Fibers constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the Direction of the Axis, or are made parallels thereunto; so that as often as the Centre is changed, so often doth the Axis, so often do all the Fibres change their position, and follow the Centre. Which we insert chiefly in respect of the motion of Convolution, or Turning of a thing projected immediately after its Dismission; and of the Curvity of that Line, which is thereby described, whether ascending, or descending. But these are onely Transient Touches, or Hints; that we might easily intimate, why a motion once imprest, is continued rather this way, than that: and why Feathers, Sponges, and the like Light and Porous bodies, are incapable of having quick and vehement motions imprest upon them; because they consist of interrupted Fibres, and such as are not Dirigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the Centre of Gravity.</p>

That all Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a free or <hi>Empty</hi> space, must be <hi>Vniform,</hi> and <hi>Perpetual</hi>: and that the chief Cause of the <hi>Inequality</hi> and <hi>Brevity</hi> of the motion of things project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> is the magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Earth.</note>Here we ask leave, once more to have recourse to that useful suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a stone situate in the immensity of the Imaginary spaces. We lately said, as you may remember, that if a stone placed in the empty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramundane spaces, should be impelled any way, the motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would be continued the same way, and that uniformly or equally, and with tardity or celerity proportionate to the smartness or gentleness of the Impulse, and perpetually in the same line; because in those empty spaces it could meet with no cause, which by Diversion might either accelerate, or retard its motion. Nor ought it to be Objected, that <hi>nothing Violent can be Perpetual</hi>; because, in this case, there could be no Repugnancy or Resistence, but a pure indifferency in the stone to all regions, there being no Centre, in relation whereunto it may be conceived to be Heavy or Light. And, therefore, the condition of the stone would be the very same, as to Uniformity and Perpetuity of motion, with that of the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Orbs; which being obnoxious to no Retardation, or Acceleration, but free from all Repugnancy internal, and Resistence External, constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="467" facs="tcp:55028:250"/>
and that toward one part, rather than any other. Let us now far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consider; seeing that if upon some large horizontal plane you should place a smooth Globe, and then gently impel it; you would observe it to be moved therupon equally and indefinently, till it came to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: why may you not lawfully conjecture, that if the Terrestrial Globe were of a superfice exquisitely polite, or smooth as the finest Venice Glass; and another small Globe as polite were placed in any part of its superfice, and but gently impelled any way, it would be moved with constant Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity quite round the Earth, according to the line of its first direction; and having rowled once round the Earth, it would, without intermission again begin, or rather continue another Circuit, and so maintain a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Circulation upon the surface of the Earth? Especially, since there is no Difficulty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> discourage that conjecture; forasmuch as look how many parts of the small Globe, during the motion thereof, tend toward the Centre of the Earth, just so many are, at the same time, elevated from it: so that a full Compensation being made in all points of the motion, the same cannot but perpetually continue, and in the same equal tenour, there being no Declivity, whereby it should be Accelerated, no Acclivity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it should be Retarded, no Cavity, whereby after many accurses and recurses, or reciprocations, it should be brought at length to acquiesce. Moreover, in order to our grand scope, let us suppose, that the space, through which a stone should be Projected, were absolute Inane, or such as the Imaginary spaces; and then we must acknowledge, that it would be carried in a direct and invariate line, through the same space, and with an Uniforme and Perpetual motion, until it should meet with some other space, full of magnetique rayes, Aer, or some other resisting sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. But, here with us, in the Atmosphere, because no space is Inane (sensibly) but replete as well with Aer, as with millions of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netique rayes transmitted from the Earth; and so a stone Projected must encounter them in every point of space through which it moves: therefore is it, that it cannot be moved either in a direct Line, or equally, or long. For, since multitudes of magnetique Rayes must necessarily invade and attach it, as soon as it is discharged from the Projicient; though at first setting forth it break through them, and so is scarce at all Deflected: yet because more and more magnetique rayes freshly lay hold of it in every part of space, renew the Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and so more and more infringe and weaken the force of its motion; hence comes it, that in the progress it doth by little and little Deflect from the Line of Direction, moves slower and slower, and at length sinking down to the Earth, thereon attains its quiet. Hereupon, when men shall Demand, <hi>what is that Cause, which weakens and at last quite destroys the Virtue Impressed upon a thing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi>; rightly understanding, by the Virtue Imprest, the motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by the Projicient, and continued by the Projectum: the Answer is manifest; <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the <hi>Attraction of the Earth,</hi> which first op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, after gradually refracteth, and in fine wholly overcometh the motion imprest, and so determineth the Projectum to Quiet. Hence also may we learn, that <hi>All motion once impressed, is of it self Indelible,</hi> and cannot be Diminished, or Determined, but by some External Cause, that is of power to repress it.</p>

                        </gap> its proper scope.</note> The <hi>One</hi> is, that <hi>though there be two divers Forces or motions impressed upon the Ball, at the same time: the one from the Vibration of your Arm, the other from the horizontal Translation of the ship: yet doth neither destroy the other, but each attains its proper scope as fully, as if they were impressed apart.</hi> For, the Ball ascends as high, when the ship is moved forward, as when it stands still: and whether it describe a Direct, or a semiparabolical: and again, it is as much promoved Horizontally, when you divert it upward by projection, as when you hold it still in your hand and so it be carried onely by the motion of the ship: and consequently whether the motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of describe a Direct line, or a whole Parabola. Onely this you are to note: that a greater Force is required to the projection of a Ball from the foot to the top of the Mast, when the ship moves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than when it lies at anchor: because that semiparabolical line, which the Ball must describe in the former case, is shorter than that perpendicular one, which it must describe in the latter: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the vibration or swing of your arme may seem to you to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in both cases, yet is that vibration or force, whereby the ball is carried upward to the top of the Mast, when the ship is in motion, really greater than that, whereby the same ball is carried to the same height, when the ship lies quiet: because, in the former case, there is superadded to the force of your arme, the force which is impressed both upon you and your arme (without your apprehension) by the motion of the ship. This you shall plainly perceive, if you onely drop down a ball from the top of the Mast, without any swing or motion of your arme at all. For, seeing that the ball doth always fall at the foot of the mast, in the same distance from it, as it was in the instant of its dimission from the top; whether the ship be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or quiet: necessary it is, that some force be imprest upon
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:55028:252"/>
the ball by the motion of the ship, or the the same motion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both the Mast it self, and your hand are affected, at the instant of its dimission; since it must describe a semiparabolical line, longer than that Direct one, which it would describe, if it fell down the ship being quiet. And hence comes it, that if you project a ball from the Poop to the Fore Castle of a ship, under sayl, and back again from the Fore-Castl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though the ball be carried over equal spaces of the Deck of the ship, in both cases: yet shall it not be carried through equal spaces in the Aer.</p>

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:55028:252"/>
paces, or an hundred foot of horizontal space: the ball shall be horizontally (i. e. toward that region, to which the ship tends) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, not more swiftly or slowly in one pace or foot, than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but equally in all: for, otherwise, it could not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imminent over the same part of the ship neer the Mast: nor therefore consist in the same line, or distance from the Mast: which yet it constantly observes. But this easily deceives, that at the end of the balls ascent, or beginning of its descent, the motion is slowest: but then are we to observe, that the Devexity, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of it to the Horizon is the Greater, as when it comes low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, where the motion is more rapid, the Devexity is less, and its conformity to the Perpendicular greater: so that the whole <hi>Inaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> doth consist in the Assent and Descent, or <hi>Perpendicular</hi> moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ball: while in the mean time there is a perfect <hi>Aequability</hi> in its <hi>Horizontal</hi> advance, or promotion. From hence we collect: that since a thing Projected is moved unequally, insomuch as it tends upward or downward: and not as it progresseth parallel to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, or Ambite of the Earth: therefore is it, that <hi>the upward and downward motions are both to be accounted Violent: but the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal, or Circular, Natural</hi>: Equality, or Uniformity being the inseparable Character of Natural, and Inequality of Violent motion.</p>
                  <p>Thus far have we treated of that Returning or Reflex motion of Bodies, whereby, being violently projected upward,<note place="margin">

Concerning this Theorem, therefore, be pleased to know, that among all Reflexions, by way of Rebound or Resilition, that is the <hi>Chiefest,</hi> when a body projected, and impinged against another body, is returned from thence <hi>directly,</hi> or in the same line toward the place, from whence it was projected: which always happens, when the Projection is made to right Angles, or in regular line, such as that in which a Heavy body descends upon an horizontal plane. And all other Reflections are in dignity inferior thereunto, as such whereby the thing projected doth not rebound in a direct line toward the same point from whence it was projected, but to some other region by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lines: according as it is projected in lines more or less oblique. Because, with what inclination a body falls upon a plane, with the very same inclination doth it rebound from the plane (especially a Globe, and such as is of an uniform matter, and consequently hath the Centre of magnitude and that of Gravity coincident in the same point) so that by how much the more oblique the projection is, and how much the less is the Angle made of its line with the line of the plane, (called the Angle of <hi>Incidence</hi>) so much the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique is the reflexion made, and so much the less the Angle made of its line, with the line of the plane continued (called the Angle of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion</hi>)
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:55028:253"/>

Attraction of the Earth: so in a Globe, or Ball Projected, we are to regard onely that Impetus or Force, which being imprest upon it by the Projicient, supplies the place of Gravity, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect whereof the Centre of its Gravity may be conceived to be one with that of its magnitude. Let a Ball, therefore, be projected Directly or to right Angles, upon a plane; and, because, in that case, that Fibre must be the Axis of its Gravity, whose extreme going foremost is impinged against the plane: thence is it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that the Repression must be made, in a direct line, along that Axis; the parallel Fibres in equal number on each part invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roning that Axis, and so not swaying or diverting the ball more to one part than to another, by reason of any the least dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of quantity on either side. Then, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is a greater quantity of matter, and consequently a greater force imprest, than on the side neerer to the plane; therefore doth the begun motion persever, as praevailing upon the repression and renitency of the Fibre impinged against the plane, and since it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be continued in a direct line, because of the impediment arise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the parts cohaerent, it is continued by that way it can, i. e. by the open and free obliquity of the plane. But, this, of necessity, must be done with some certain Evolution of the Ball, and with the contact of the Fibres posited in order both toward the Axis and beyond it; and while this is in doing, every Fibre strives to give back, but, because the farther part doth yet praevail over the neerer, therefore doth the neerer part still follow the sway, and conform to the inclination and conduct of the farther, and all the toucht Fibres change their situation, nor are they any longer capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of returning by the same way they came, because they no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er respect that part from whence they came. We say, with the Contact of the plane by the Fibres posited toward the Axis and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it; because, since in that Evolution or Turn of the Ball, the extream of the Axis toucheth the plane, yet nevertheless no Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, or Rebound is therefore caused, in that instant; and if there were a resilition, at that time, it would be to a perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as well the Axis, as all the circumstant Fibres being erected perpendicularly upon the face of the plane: but the Resilition there must be beyond it, because the force of the farther part of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres doth yet praevail over that of the neerer. For, the Force of
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:55028:254"/>
the farther part doth yet continue direct and intire; but, that of the neerer is reflected, and by the repression somewhat debilitated: and therefore, the Resilition cannot be made, until so much of Repression and Debilitation be made in the further part, as was made at first in the neerer. And that must of necessity be done, so soon as ever the plane is touched by some one Fibre, which is distant from the Axis as much beyond, as that Fibre, which first touched the plane, is distant from the Axis on this side: for, then do the two forces become equal, and so one part of the Fibres having no reason any longer to praevail over the other, by counter inclination, the Ball instantly ceaseth to touch the plane, and flies off from it, toward that region, to which the Axis and all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstant Fibres are then, i. e. after the Evolution, directed. Now, because the Ball is, after this manner, reflected from the plane, with the same inclination, or obliquity, with which it was impin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against it; it is an evident consequence, that the Angle of its Reflexion must be commensurable by the Angle of its Incidence: and that each of them must be so much the more <hi>Obtuse,</hi> by how much less the line of projection doth recede from a perpendicular; and contrariwise, so much the more Acute, by how much more the line of projection doth recede from a perpendicular, or how much neerer it approacheth to a parallel with the plane.</p>
