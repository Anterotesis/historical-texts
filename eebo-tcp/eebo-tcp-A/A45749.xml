            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Theſe following relate to the exceeding great advantage of Huſbandry.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Imprim'</hi> A Seed to be ſown without manuring in the courſeſt, barren, ſandy, and heathy Grounds, which will be very much improved thereby, that will afford three crops a yeer, and will cauſe Kine to give milk three times a day conſtantly, with full veſſels, and to become fat withall, and to feed all other Cattell fat ſuddenly, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Calves, Lambes, and Swine, without either hay, graſſe or corn, or any thing in relation to corn; and likewiſe to preſerve and feed all ſorts of poultry and foul fat in a very ſhort time, as Geeſe, Turkies, Pheſants, &amp;c. and to make them lay and breed extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and to continue all ſort of Cattel and Foul exceedingly healthfull, and all without any conſiderable charge, one Acre of wheat being moſt commonly worth but five or ſix <hi rend="sup">lib</hi> with the charge, and an Acre of this but one crop in three worth 12<hi rend="sup">l</hi> and upwards, and in a manner without
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58435:2"/>
any charge. This (beſides what is ſpecified before) may be ſo diſpoſed of, that it might advantage every houſekeeper throughout <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>per</hi> week conſtantly, and the better ſort, a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, treble, and a quadruple proportion, and upwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item.</hi> Another kind of ſeed to be had, which will likewiſe afford three crops a year, and two loads and half in one Acre, one load there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being worth two loads of ordinary Hay, beſides an excellent winter paſture, till March, it will cauſe Kine to give milk as before, and will feed and preſerve all ſorts of four footed beaſts, and cauſe them to become fat in a very ſhort time, without any other Graſſe or paſture, and the ſeeds thereof will feed all ſort of poultry fat, and make them lay as before, and this may be performed in barren, ſandy, and heathy grounds, and muſt be ſowen but once, and will continue ſo four or five years, and then this Graſſe will ſo improve the ground, for four or five years more, without manuring, that it will afford excellent crops of wheat and barly, and after you may ſow the ground with the ſame ſeed again, which will hold on that courſe both for Graſſe and Corn conſtantly, and an Acre of this Graſſe will keep three Cowes winter and ſummer, in the higheſt condition, and the ſeed of one Acre may be juſtifiably worth about 70 <hi rend="sup">lib</hi>. beſides the winter paſture, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven loads and half of hay, which no man will part with under 5 <hi rend="sup">lib</hi>. the load, that rightly underſtands the benefit thereof: You may keep your ſwine conſtantly in a yard, or in an orchard, which will migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily advantage the fruit trees, and by giving them only a liqour to drink made of what is before ſpecified, with a little of this hay, they will become fat in a very ſhort time, and with this liquor only you may keep as many ſwine as you pleaſe: and as for your Kine, you need not turne them into any Graſſe at all, but keep them in a yard or ſome little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of ground, ſo you may ſave all your Muck, and they will thrive the better, being kept from the flies, which cauſeth them to waſte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Milk, and in ſome grounds to ſpoil as much graſſe as they eat, by running about. I know a Gent' that keeps them tied up all ſummer as they do in winter, and finds greater benefit thereby, and in that manner likewiſe, he keeps his feeding cattell all the ſummer, and feeds them off preſently, without any conſiderable trouble and with very little charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> A moſt excellent diſcovery with one ſlight plowing and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, or but raiſing the ground in the leaſt kind, to enjoy ſix crops in one year, proportionable to the fruitfulleſt graſſe, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58435:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
every year, without any further trouble or charge at all, which is ſo wonderfully fruitfull for milch kine, that beſides the double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of milk, and better by far then any other milk, it will afford two skimmings of excellent cream, ſuch and ſo good, that the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of, this exceeds all other food for cheeſe; and when all the cream is taken off, the milk will be as good again as any other in that kind, this ſeed will coſt nothing, and will ſow it ſelfe, after the firſt year, and will afford in ſeed above 1000 for one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> Another ſeed, that when grounds are laid down, and quite out of heart, the graſſe thereon will maintain the greateſt ſheep very luſty, and fit for ſlaughter, and yet there hardly appeares any thing they can eat: This ſeed being provided and ſowen upon meadowes and paſture, would mightily advantage the graſſe to very great perfection, with the application of the way for growthſomeneſſe, but newly devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> Another ſeed to be had, the graſſe thereof cauſeth cattle to give milk in abundance: you may ſow your dry, heathy and barren grounds therewith; and ſuch land as you intend to let lie, being out of heart, and not in a place convenient for muck, and ſowing but once with this ſeed, it will laſt good ſeven years, without any further trouble. The ordinary burthen is a load and a halfe <hi>per</hi> acre, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeven years, you may break it up, and ſow it with corne, without manuring, till it be out of heart, and then ſow it with the ſame ſeed as formerly; for it doth very much fatten the ground, and inrich it, and will thrive extraordinary well upon dry land, where nothing elſe will grow, and when the graſſe and plants are deſtroyed with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching heat of the Sunne, this flouriſheth very much, and after ſeven years (if not with corn) you may ſow the land againe with the ſame ſeed, and all with little charge. The truth is, it will laſt 10, or 15 years. Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> ſaith, it will be cut ſeven or eight times in a Summer, but then the rich and fat grounds are beſt, and thoſe that are high and dry.</p>
               <p>Another ſeed to be ſown without manuring upon good land, but ſomewhat looſe and light, not very dry, nor over moiſt, one buſhel to ſix corn will ſerve, its to be cut twice a year, and affords excellent winter paſture till March, and it is exceeding good for all kind of cattel, as wel young as old, and exceedingly fatneth all ſorts of cattel, and lean beaſts eſpecially, and horſes will grow fat therewith in eight or ten days, and to milch kine it procureth exceeding great ſtore of milk; after once
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58435:3"/>
ſowen, it wil laſt neer fifteen years, and the hay will continue good three years.</p>
               <p>To diſcover a graſſe growing here in <hi>England,</hi> in its naturall ſoile, that being orderly husbanded, will tranſcend glover graſſe, Saint <hi>Foine, Lucerne,</hi> or any other outlandiſh graſſes whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> A root ordinarily to be had, which will increaſe wonderfully with little charge or trouble, it will feed all kind of cattel, horſes and ſwine eſpecially, very fat, as thoſe formerly, without either graſſe or corn; and will feed poultrey likewiſe, as before; it will make very good bread, cakes, paſte, pies, and both cruſt without and food with in, and will hardly be deſtroyed once planted, but will conſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of themſelves, they will likewiſe grow, being cut in flices, and ſo put into the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> A ſeed which may likewiſe be diſpoſed of without ploughing, upon very poor ground, deemed uncapable of any fertility at all, which will advantage the ground very much, and afford at leaſt 30<hi rend="sup">l</hi> an acre <hi>per annum,</hi> or perform what was profeſſ'd before, for all ſorts of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, poultrey, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> Another ſeed, the fruit thereof upon the ſame ſort of ground, though very mean, will feed all kind of cattel, eſpecially milch kine; increaſing their milk exceedingly, as before, and will afford two crops a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> Another ſeed that being tilled but once, will laſt without any further labour, trouble, or charge four years, and will mightily inrich improve and fatten the ground for goodly corn four years after, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manuring, and is excellent for horſes, hunting-dogs, poultry and ſwine, and may be very well rated at a 100<hi rend="sup">lib</hi>. <hi>per annum,</hi> and upwards, the benefit and great increaſe thereof truly conſidered.</p>
               <p>
