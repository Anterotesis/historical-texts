            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This being ended, this prayer following was made by the Administrator: <hi>Lord Iesus Christ, euerlasting King of Kings, and only Sauiour of all that doe beleeue in thee, our Mediator and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which cals men out of all Nations to thy Kingdome, which set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test godly Kings in thy Church, and commandest we should pray for them.

That it will please thee to gouerne him through thy holy spirit, and to extend thy blessing ouer this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempnity: the which we (with calling on thy name, before and after</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21916:7"/>
               <hi>his Crownation). shall accomplish.

After the Musicke, the <hi>Admonistrator</hi> and <hi>Elder</hi> comming to the Royall Chayre, led the Kings Maiestie to the <hi>Altar:</hi> to whom the <hi>Burgraue</hi> spake on this manner: <hi>Most illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Prince, King of</hi> BOHEMIA, <hi>and gracious Lord, before we set the Crowne vpon thy head, thou shalt sweare in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to the States of this Kingdome this Oath.</hi> Then read the <hi>Burgraue</hi> the Oath before the King, and the King did say it after him.</p>
            <p>After the oath was done, the <hi>Administrator</hi> sayd this prayer following. <hi>Almightie God, euerlasting Lord, as thou art faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all thy promises, so thy will is that all men should be faithfull: namely those whom it is thy pleasure to make Rulers ouer thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well in Temporall as Ecclesiasticall Offices, and callings, grauut that our chosen King iustly ruling vs and we humble, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and constantly obeying him (both thee our Euerlasting King) may accomplish our promises, according to thy holy word through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And the <hi>Chorus</hi> or Assembly answered Amen. This prayer being ended, all kind of instruments were playd on, with sweete melodious and musicall voyces. Which ceassing, the <hi>Administrator</hi> tooke the Kings Robes from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and gaue them to the King: But first was the annoynting done on the tope of his head: and the <hi>Administrator</hi> spake to the King in this manner following.
<q>Most gracious King, seeing that also in the Church of old, Kings were annoynted (which annoynting, was a signe of Gods lawfull calling, wherewith God hath sealed the godly and faithfull Kings, to the life which is prepared for vs in Christ Iesus) so the same God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt thee with his holy spirit, that thou as a true annoynted of God, mayst accomplish his holy will, and councell, through Iesus Christ our
<pb facs="tcp:21916:7"/>
                  <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </q> 
The <hi>Chorus</hi> or Assembly answered <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, giuing him the Sword, he spake thus vnto him: 
<q>Receiue this Sword, O King Elect of God, for thou art the scruant of God, called hereunto by God, that thou maist not carie that sword in vaine, but therewith defending the good, and punishing the euill, thou doest accomplish his will: through Iesus Christ our Lord.</q>
The Chorus or Assembly answered Amen.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Ring, 
<q>Receiue the Ring as a signe and Gods earnest pennie of thy Kingly calling, and the faithfulnes which thou must shew vnto God. The Holy Ghost seale thee, which is the Gods penny of the heauenly inheritance, through our Lord Iesus Christ.</q> 
The <hi>Chorus</hi> or Assembly answered <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly the Scepter. 
<q>Most gracious Prince, like as thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Sword. so receiue also the Scepter: for it is not seemely the King Maiestie should be garnished with the sword and armes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but must also be armed with the Scepter of the Lawes, that he may in both the times, as well in peace as warre, duely rule and be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, defending the godly and faithfull, and affrighting, and punishing the vngodly and vnfaithfull: offring the hand to those that are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and to rayse vp the humble: but the proud to abase through Iesus Christ.</q>
The <hi>Chous</hi> or Assembly answered Amen.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the Golden Apple: saying. 
<q>Receiue the <hi>Apple,</hi> the which as it doth signifie the power of the Kings of this world: so also it doth signifie vnto vs the ficklenes of Kingdomes, and Empyers. Therefore also all Kings of the world are admonished to seeke after that vnchaungable kingdome: through our Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
And the Chorus or assemblie answered amen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly the <hi>Royall Crowne,</hi> which the two cheife Princes of the Realme, standing on the right hand of the King, and the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrator</hi> with the <hi>Elder</hi> on the left, setting it vpon the Kings head, spake these words: 
<q>Receiue the Crowne of the kingdome <hi>(O King Elect)</hi> which is set vpon thy head in the name of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: and out of the free consent of the States, and cheife of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, throughthe prouidence of God. The which vndoubtedly is a
<pb facs="tcp:21916:8"/>
sure signe of the fauour of God towards thee: signifiyng that thou hauing power ouer the people, art made Partaker of Gods Highnes: for that thou being obedient vnto his holy will, in the end, with all Gods elect, art to receiue the crowne of euerlasting saluation, which our Sauiour Iesus Christ shall giue vnto all his faithfull ones, which doe looke for his glorious comming. vnto him be prayse and thanks, for euer and euer.</q>
The <hi>Chorus</hi> or Assembly answered <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When as now the Crowne was set vpon his head, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie was led vnto his royall Chayre, and the <hi>Burgraue</hi> spake in the country Language these words: 
<q>Seeing that your King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawfully chosen, and crowned, hath giuen his oath vnto vs, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, and vphold your freedomes; so it becommeth you also, to sware vnto your <hi>King.</hi> Therefore all you that can come neare vnto the Royall Chayre, lay two fingers on the <hi>Kings</hi> Crowne, and the rest put vp your fingers.</q>
Instantly there was seene all the chiefe of the kingdome, with an excessiue ioy thronging to touch the Kings Crowne (as before ordered) and the rest of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they put vp their fingers, in token of a willing, obedient, and faithfull oath. After this, followed presently melodious Musicke, and singing. All which being ended; the <hi>Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> concluded this solempnity of the Coronation with this prayer following.
<q>O Lord our God, looke heere in thy presence stands <hi>Frederick</hi> our lawfull, chosen, and crowned <hi>King.</hi> Wee haue accomplished the solempnitie of his Coronation with calling vpon thy name: most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly praying thee, that thou wilt heare and accomplish our prayers, which for him we haue powred out in thy presence.
