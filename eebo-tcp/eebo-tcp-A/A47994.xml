         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT has pleas'd that Almighty Power which Rules the
Hearts of Princes, to enlighten and adorn His Preſent
Gracious Majeſty, with ſuch peculiar Beams of Mercy
and Clemency, thoſe truly Royal Virtues, that render
Him the neareſt Pourtraict of that Deity whoſe Vicegerent
He is. To win therefore the Univerſal Love of his People,
a Conqueſt worthy of, and indeed reſerved for His Great
Self, He has ſet up the Standard of <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> reſolving to
recover the alienated Affections of thoſe of His Subjects,
whom the Adminiſtration of His Predeceſſors may have any
ways rendred uneaſie.</p>
            <p>There are but Two things in the World dear to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
Religion and Property. The laſt of theſe, I confeſs,
in the moſt moderate Diſtribution of Common Right, has
all along had its free courſe in the true Channels of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
only the firſt has been a little reſtrain'd; for <hi>Conſcience</hi>
has ſometimes been ſhackled.</p>
            <p>The Sighs therefore and Groans that have lately breathed
from that Reſtraint, have moved him to that Sacred Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration,
that He is reſolved to break the Fetters that
extort them, The <hi>Penal Laws.</hi> Which to effect, He has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97643:3"/>
declared His Determination for that choice of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
in Authority under Him, that in His Princely Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
He thinks will be moſt Hearty in contributing their
beſt and ableſt Endeavours for that Great End.</p>
            <p>To carry on this Pious Work, 'tis not at all to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but the Suffering Party on all ſides, who are aggrieved
by thoſe Laws, by the meer dictates of Self-preſervation,
will be no ways wanting to throw off a Yoke they have ſo
long ſo unquietly born. And if all their Helps, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
(as in Reaſon may be expected) is ſo well ſecure of,
there remain only the Concurrence of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
which, if obtain'd, His Kingdom would reap the
Fruit, and Himſelf the Honour of being the Founder of
thoſe laſting Bleſſings, ſo much in themſelves the more
Glorious, as that all Hands, and all Hearts, are aſſiſtant to
their Creation.</p>
            <p>But ſince the late Refuſal of Reading His Majeſties moſt
Gracious Declaration ſeems to intimate the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
Averſion (or at leaſt their <hi>Leading Endeavours</hi> to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
that Averſion) to the Repeal of the Penal Laws and

examine the ſtreſs and tendency of thoſe Laws, and truly
to Reaſon and Argue with our Pious Mother the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> why the Preſervation of thoſe Laws, either is,
or ought to be, any part of her Care; and indeed, how far
thoſe Statutes, her ſometimes Darlings, are in themſelves
either Juſt, Equitable, or conſiſtent with Chriſtianity it
ſelf; and how far ſhe is <hi>equally,</hi> if not <hi>more,</hi> than the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
obliged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to aboliſh them. Nor ſhall I endeavour to
urge her Conſent from any <hi>Reſignation</hi> or <hi>Compliance</hi> (thoſe
fainter motives of meer Generoſity) to the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and
<hi>Will</hi> of the King, that deſires to have it ſo; but enforce
the Argument from the Bonds and Tyes of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97643:3"/>
               <hi>Juſtice</hi> that require her Aſſiſtance to their Diſſolution; and
hereby illuſtrate the <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Propoſal, and prove the Work it ſelf no more than
the incumbent Duty of every Chriſtian Subject to labour to
perfect. For inquiry therefore firſt into the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi>
I ſhall make bold to trace the Grounds of their Riſe and
Original.</p>
            <p>After the Death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> her Proteſtant Siſter
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being ſeated on the Throne, under ſo fair a Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of eſtabliſhing her Religion, as having the <hi>Half,</hi> if not
the Majority of the Nation of Her Perſwaſion, all Hands
were ſet at Work for ſo glorious an Enterprize. But the
main Engine was, That the Reformers having before their
Eyes the late ſeverity of her Siſters Reign, the Proteſtant
Church either truly, or rather <hi>ſeemingly</hi> aſhamed (as time
will ſhew) of the Romiſh Cruelty, the Popular out-crys
againſt <hi>Smithfield</hi> Fires, was conſcious that ſhe had no
means ſo proper to recommend her ſelf to the Peoples
Eſteem as the avoiding all thoſe occaſions of <hi>Odium,</hi> which
had render'd the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> ſo much the Object of their
Averſion; and therefore the Change muſt be wrought
and Affections won, by the oppoſite Extremes of <hi>Mercy</hi>
and <hi>Moderation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Meaſures for a while ſeem'd terrible; but, alas!
in few years <hi>Indulgence</hi> appeared a too ſlow-pac'd Progreſs
of Reformation; for ſtill notwithſtanding the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Proteſtant Queen, and the Eſtabliſhment of our
Church, the Eccleſiaſtick Advances went on too leiſurely,
and Converſions not faſt enough, to ſatisfie either the
Churches Itch of <hi>Power,</hi> or Warmth of Zeal, under the
looſer Reins of Toleration. For whilſt the Popiſh party
were connived at, and permitted any Liberty of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
their Church, though falling, could not want ſome
few unſhaken Members at leaſt that would ſtill follow even
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97643:4"/>
its very Ruines; and perhaps the Romiſh Prieſts, though
thrown out of Church Preferment, could not, or would
not forbear, to confirm and encourage their thin and
ſcatter'd Party, and poſſibly through an indiſpenſable (as
they thought) Duty to that Communion, in which invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
perſwaded, they only expected Salvation, they might
not omit either Arguments or Induſtry (as Opinion wants
neither) to render their Religion nevertheleſs lovely for
the Cloud it wore; which indeed, is but natural to all
Religions, whilſt they think their own either the <hi>only,</hi> or
at leaſt the <hi>neareſt</hi> way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Theſe Remora's, how ſmall ſtops ſoever to her advancing
Glory, the Church of <hi>England</hi> beholdiug with Impatience,
and repining even at her ſmalleſt Favours to the Romiſh
Party, whilſt but the leaſt Impediments to her yet unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
Ambition, (for to be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ppermoſt</hi> was not enough,
unleſs ſhe could be <hi>All</hi> too) began to think of ſome more
expeditious way for the weeding out of Popery, and to
look out for a ſharper Pruning Hook than meer <hi>Teaching</hi>
and <hi>Preaching</hi> to do the Work of Reformation; ſet agog
therefore upon Diſpatch and Execution, ſhe felt the Itch
of her Forefathers, and if <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> could be
ſafe, ſhe ſhould not ſcruple at a little of the old-faſhion'd
Shamble-work to gain her Point. But conſidering that to
puniſh Diſſent in Religion, and barefac'd too with Death,
would carry too much the looks of Old <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and ſo
beſtain her own long boaſted Gentleneſs and Innocence;
ſhe is therefore put to no little Study and Invention to
over-leap this Difficulty, and accompliſh her Projection;
till at laſt ſhe lights upon this incomparable Stratagem to
Mask her Deſigns, and ſmooth All, <hi>viz.</hi> to puniſh <hi>Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancy</hi>
with <hi>DEATH,</hi> under the black and diſmal Brand of
<hi>HIGH-TREASON.</hi> The Meaſures and Gradations uſed
and made towards raiſing this Artful Superſtructure, take
in ſhort as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97643:4"/>
In the firſt year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſhe aſſerts her <hi>Spiritual
and Eccleſiaſtick Supremacy in all Things and Cauſes whatever;</hi>
and creates an Oath to be tendered her Subjects for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of that Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the fifth of her Reign, grown warmer in that</hi> Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
ſhe impoſes the Oath upon all her Miniſters and Officers of
the Government, even to Lawyers, Atturneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to be taken by ever Member of Parliament: And the
ſecond Refuſal of taking it, after a firſt tender of it three
Months before, is made High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the 13th of Her Reign.</hi> All perſons taking upon them
by Colour of any Bull, Writing, or Authority whatever to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
or reconcile any perſons, or grant or promiſe to any perſon
or perſons within Her Majeſties Dominions any ſuch Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Reconciliation by any Speech, Preaching, Teaching,
Writing, or any other open deed; and if any perſon or perſons
ſhall willingly take or receive ſuch Abſolution or Reconciliation
ſhall ſuffer pains of Death; And alſo loſe and forefeit all their
Lands, Tenements, Goods and Chattels, as in Caſes of <hi>High
Treaſon. [A very ſoure ſort of Grape to ſet their Childrens
Teeth an Edge with.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the 23d of</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>This Act is explain'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
and in fine the</hi> Perſon reconciling or reconciled to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Prieſt or Lay-man, are Equally declared Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
<hi>and ſo onwards till</hi> the very taking of Orders from
<hi>Rome</hi> is High Treaſon and doomed to ſuffer as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Ay, God knows a very juſt ſentence if the Indictment be
but true. But I deſire to know by what Legerdemain is
this Reconciliation made High Treaſon! Is either the Life
or Dignity of the King or the Government, ſtruck at by
my being a Member of This or That Communion! by my
believing This or That the Way to Heaven? Can Faith in
God be Treaſon againſt Man! For that's the Reſult of the
point. Can a Chriſtians beſt Endeavour to ſave his own or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97643:5"/>
his Brothers Soul be a Machination to deſtroy his Prince or
his Country; or can my praying or not praying to a <hi>Saint,</hi>
my adoring or not adoring the <hi>Eucharist</hi> render me a true
or not true Leige-man. If Errours in Faith can amount to
High Treaſon, and the Government is in Conſcience ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to treat 'em as ſuch, Lord have mercy upon us, how
came the <hi>Jews</hi> to live with that Impunity in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
that inſtead of misbelieving in points of Doctrine,
believe not ſo much as in the Goſpel or Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>No, no, the Sophiſtry of the matter lyes not there; 'tis
not the Doctrine of a Romaniſt as to Godwards makes him
a Traytor, but his belief of the Popes being <hi>Head of the
Church</hi> in Derogation to the Eccleſiaſtick Supremacy inherent
to, and Lodg'd in the Crown, and ſo religiouſly aſſerted
and maintained by the Proteſtant Laws of the Kingdom.
<hi>Hinc Illae Lacrymae?</hi> There lyes the Apoſtacy, the hideous
yawning Gulph that ſwallows all, Faith, Duty, Honour,
Loyalty, and conſequently calls for Axes, Halters, Gibbets,
and what not.</p>
            <p>Is this the Treaſon then; 'tis well we have fixt it there;
tho' upon true Inſpection, the Impeachment will be found
full as feeble here as before. For this is but meer matter of
Faith ſtill all this while, nor carries in it the leaſt ſhadow
of a Breach of the Subjects Duty to the Soveraign. For
Inſtance, when this Law was made, ſuppoſe a poor <hi>Roman
Catholick</hi> of thoſe Days by an Invincible power of perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
rooted and grounded in him by an Article of Faith
(how rightfully is not the matter) received from Age to
Age, and Generation to Generation in favour of the Pope,
cou'd not poſſibly believe her then <hi>She</hi> Majeſty by her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to the Crown to be inſtantly the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Head of the
Church in all matters and Cauſes whatever, that otherwiſe
before was utterly incapable even of ſo much as a Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſhip
in a Country Pariſh, and if St. <hi>Paul</hi> may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97643:5"/>
not ſo much as qualified for ſpeaking in a Religious
Aſſembly; yet nevertheleſs this <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> lived under
her Government with all the Allegiance and Fealty, in all
Reſpects of Obedience, and believed himſelf in conſcience
ſo obliged to do, as much as any other of her more belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Proteſtant Subjects, would it not be a little ſevere to
adjudge him a Traytor.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Opinion that the Spiritual Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
lyes not in the Temporal Prince, is meer matter of
Faith, is demonſtrable from the very Soveraign Power
it ſelf, when ſo many ſucceſſive Kings never believed they
had that Supremacy themſelves. For <hi>Prerogative</hi> is of its
nature ſo jealous that tho' never ſo conſiderable a Jewel in a
Crown had they had Faith to have challenged it theirs,
they would have had wit enough to have worne it too.</p>
            <p>What if our Proteſtant Kings and their Parliments for
them believe that Supremacy wholy lodged in the Crown;
muſt their <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Subjects be Traytors, becauſe
they cannot be of their Belief? If the Princes Belief muſt be
the ſtandart of the peoples Loyalty, by the ſame Equity
the Catholick Kings might have made it High-Treaſon
in their Reign to aſſert that Supremacy in the Crown
Then; as the Proteſtant Kings do to deny it there now;
and conſequently the Proteſtants then, (if ſuch there had
been) might by Equal Juſtice have been Traytors too.
If Crown'd Heads muſt neceſſarily be believed the Spiritual
Heads of the Churches under their Obedience, I wonder
what ſtrange ſtretch of Faith thoſe Thouſands of Chriſtians
muſt have that are born and bred Subjects to the <hi>Mahometan
Grand Signior.</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97643:6"/>
and that their aſſerting of that Spiritual Supremacy in their
Pope does not any ways threaten either the Crown or the
publick peace; That wiſe and prudent Monarch King <hi>James</hi>
the Firſt ſhall be their Compurgator. For as many Laws
as that Prince made for the Defence of the Eſtabliſht

ſo zealous a Proteſtant King thought it no Diminution to
his own or his Churches Dignity to be of that Opinion, and
to grant the Pope that Prerogative; what mortal High
Treaſon againſt the Crown of <hi>England</hi> do the Members of

to fancy any ſuch things as Principles of Loyalty in a Romiſh

            <p>I ſhall not endeavour to confute this uncharitable Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
by the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Heroick Examples, of that Parties
Loyalty in the Battels of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt; ſo truly may I

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> that upon Petitions made to <hi>Cromwell</hi> for
his Clemency to the Roman Catholicks, he was obſerved
to challenge them to prove ſo much as one Man of that
Religion that had ever fought for him or ſerved him. But
to wave that Plea, How are we ſure that the Romaniſts
are guilty of Traytorous Principles! Do's any man of
them own any ſuch Principles! <hi>No, ſure they have more
Wit than to talk Treaſon, and be Hang'd for it. If they are ſo
hardy as to do that, we have other Laws to nooſe 'em without
the help of Penal Statutes.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97643:6"/>
               <hi>Do they then commit any open Act of Treaſon!</hi> Let
'em do that if they dare. If we once catch them 'em at that
Game the Government has 'em faſt enough by the Heels and the
Necks too. Nor is that the Treaſon, that theſe Statutes
pretend to arraign. Who ever heard of any <hi>Overt act</hi> of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
indicted by the 13th or 23d of <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, if neither <hi>Speaking</hi> nor <hi>Acting</hi> of Treaſon be the
Capital Guilt theſe Statutes are levell'd at; then <hi>Thinking</hi> of
Treaſon muſt be the Crime. A Roman Catholick then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
is ſuch an offender, that by the very Affections of his
Soul cannot be Loyal to the Crown; and to prove all this
mortal Accuſation infallibly true, the Proteſtant Wiſdom
has by <hi>Divine Inſpiration</hi> form'd a Law to arraign and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the very <hi>Thoughts of the Heart,</hi> of which God only
can be Judge.</p>
            <p>In fine, if the Government can make matter of Faith, nay
even thoughts Themſelves High Treaſon, when their Hand
was in they might e'ne as Lawfully have made it High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>eat</hi> too. For if the firm Belief in God, and the
zealous Worſhip of him by the Beſt Light of a Chriſtian
Conſcience, be either the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> or at leaſt the
means to get it, as we are ſo taught, the ſame Legality
that can condemn the one may exclude the other too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this they'll ſay,</hi> 'Tis true indeed a Lay Romaniſt is a more
excuſable, and that part of the Statute that affects him is a
little hard; however 'tis very ſtrong, and nothing but High
Juſtice, againſt the Romiſh Prieſt; for here are viſible Overt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts
of Treaſon: As taking of Orders from <hi>Rome,</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
little leſs than Damnable and Diabolical, and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
Antichriſtian, as received from the Papal See, the very

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97643:7"/>
the Commands of the Law; All which outragious Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
are but reaſonably declared High Treaſon, and juſtly
expoſed to the ſevereſt of puniſhments under the Legality of
that Denomination.</p>
            <p>To this Thundering Charge, as big as it ſounds, I ſhall
only make this ſhort Reply.</p>
            <p>If the Church of <hi>England</hi> has and always does admit a
<hi>Convert</hi> Romiſh Prieſt into the Proteſtant Clergy, without
any <hi>Reordination</hi> to capacitate him for that Admiſſion, as
we need look no further than to the conſtant practice of
the Church, (without ſo much as one example to the
contrary) from the very beginning of the Reformation,
how unjuſtly are taking Orders from <hi>Rome</hi> charged with
High-Treaſon! If the Orders from <hi>Rome</hi> be in themſelves
<hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Sacred,</hi> how are they Damnable, or Anti-chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?
And how the taking of them High-Treaſon? If not
Holy nor Sacred (as if High Treaſon in the very receiving
of them they cannot be) does the Church of <hi>England</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
Paſtors into her Miniſterial Function unconſecrated
for the Divine Service of God? God forbid! No, the very
Practice and Conceſſion of the Church in this Caſe does ſo
confront the palpable Injuſtice of this Statute, as nothing
can be plainer. And how Black, how Capital, or Trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſoever the <hi>Popular Calumny,</hi> or the <hi>Proteſtant Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
had occaſion to make theſe Romiſh Orders, under all
their loads of Guilt, they ſtood upright enough not to
want the Crutch of an Act of Parliament, as ſome others
have done (as much <hi>more Sacred</hi> as they are) for their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and Confirmation. And if ſuch are the Romiſh Orders,
and the free choice of our Belief in God, and the Church
we hope to be ſaved in, be in our own Election (for our
own Souls are anſwerable for it) by the ſame Liberty of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97643:7"/>
choice why may not a man be either a Member or Paſtor
of the Flock he chooſes, as his Abilities to ſerve God in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtation ſhall dictate to him. And if no ſuch Holy
Orders be to be had and received at home, why is it Death
to ſeek for them abroad? And why are men baniſht and
excluded from their Native Right in the Kingdom in which
they are born, for only endeavouring to ſecure themſelves,
their no leſs Native Right in that of Heaven?</p>
            <p>One obſervation in the Statute of the Fifth of her Reign
I had almoſt forgotten, not a little worthy Remark. In
this Statute where the <hi>Incapacity</hi> of taking the Oath of the
Queens Spiritual Supremacy (for a Refuſal of an Oath in
that Caſe is only a <hi>Conſcientious Incapacity</hi> of taking it) is
made High-Treaſon, in one Clauſe of it the Queen is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to tell us, <hi>ſhe is ſo ſufficiently aſſured of the Faith and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of her Temporal Lords, that this Act, nor any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in it, ſhall not extend to her Barons, nor the Oath to be
impoſed upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What Contradictions and Cobweb Laws are here! A
Commoner, belike, for his Incapacity of taking that Oath,
is guilty of H<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gh-Treaſon: But a Baron ſo incapacitated is
a very <hi>faithful and Loyal Gentleman;</hi> as if they were not
both of them <hi>equally Subjects</hi> to the Crown, and equally
Criminal in any Tranſgreſſion againſt it. 'Tis true, had
the particular Favour and Indulgence of the Government
reſolved to exempt a Peer from the <hi>Penalty</hi> of this Law, it
had been ſomething; but to diſcharge him <hi>eo nomine</hi> from
the <hi>Guilt</hi> too, makes the whole Statute ſuch an <hi>Arbitrary</hi>
Declaration of Treaſon, that both the Compilers of ſuch
Laws, and the Defenders of them, ought to bluſh at. But
as whole as the Barons kept their Scutcheons in this Statute,
they came in for a ſnack in the 13th of her Reign, being
in that Statute Indictable for Delinquency againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:97643:8"/>
What <hi>Rubbiſh</hi> is here put together to build the great
<hi>Fence</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> with! But our Church has at leaſt this
Apology, that it does not pretend to <hi>Infallibility.</hi> And
who knows but the Jargon of theſe, and the reſt of her
<hi>Penal Laws</hi> might be <hi>wilful Overſights</hi> on purpoſe to make
out her Aſſertion to the World, and prove her <hi>Fallibility</hi>
true.</p>
            <p>But to come to the full Reſult of all: Here's the <hi>Church
of England</hi> ſo <hi>poorly prevaricating,</hi> as to follow thoſe very
ſteps, which with all her higheſt Noiſe and Exclamations
ſhe pretends, are her greateſt Deteſtation and Abhorrence.
And whilſt the more frank and generous Romaniſt Enacts
and Executes his Capital Laws againſt <hi>Hereſy</hi> from <hi>his</hi>
Church, under the downright Name of <hi>Hereſy;</hi> our poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſpirited Proteſtant Law-makers, are for puniſhing <hi>Hereſy</hi>
from <hi>their</hi> Church under <hi>Maſque</hi> and <hi>Diſguiſe,</hi> obtruding
their Penal Laws upon the World under the meaneſt of
<hi>Hypocriſy</hi> and <hi>Impoſture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to be plain with our later Proteſtant Law-makers,
the <hi>Shamm</hi> paſt ſo current then, that it has been practiſed
ever ſince. Is there any one Law made againſt our later
Nonconformiſts whoſe preamble does not run upon this
Topick, the Breach of the Peace, and the undermining the
very Foundations of the Government; and all for deſerting
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and meeting in their own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Aſſemblies, to offer up their Prayers and Devotions
to God according to their Conſciences. Was there ever a
late Conventicle diſturb'd with any other Warrant than as
<hi>Riotouſly and Routouſly aſſembled,</hi> and thereupon puniſht
with Fines, Impriſonments, and Sequeſtrations; ſometimes
even to the Ruines of whole Families. Does not the ſame
<hi>Maſquerade</hi> run through <hi>all</hi> the Penal Laws? And the very
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97643:8"/>
meer meeting to Worſhip God charged with no leſs than
<hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Tumult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But wherein lyes the Sedition and Tumult? Was it in
their ſo meeting? No, ſure. For as the Intention makes
the Guilt, the Intention was only a <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> and
not a <hi>State-diſturbance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was the Sedition then in the <hi>Doctrines</hi> they Preach'd?
If ſo, why was it not proved againſt them? Their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe
Doors ſtood open, and their Enemies were both
potent and numerous enough to hear and detect any Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Deſign or Doctrines againſt the Crown or State. And
the Law was furniſht both with Rods and Axes, to puniſh
any Crime of that kind according to its Demerit, before
the Penal Laws were ſo much as thought on.</p>
            <p>No, tho' that was the <hi>Pretence,</hi> it pincht not there
The Diſſenters grew too numerous, and the Church of
<hi>England</hi> began to ſee her Grandeur ſhrink, and her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
leſſen, and therefore her <hi>Old Arts</hi> muſt once more
be her Refuge. The Nonconformiſts muſt be cruſht and
ſuppreſt, and to avoid all imputations of <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and
<hi>Cruelty, Sedition</hi> and <hi>Riots</hi> muſt be the charge againſt
them, and the Law <hi>gilded</hi> over with that fair <hi>Title</hi> to
make it <hi>ſwallowable.</hi> 'Tis true, indeed, the Law here did
not reach to Death, however it took care to make their
Purſes, if not their Veins, bleed for it, and that too ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with ſo total a Drein, that whole Families have
been reduced to the condition of ſtarving, which is the
very next door to it. And all things conſider'd, Liberty
next to Life is ſo dear, that whole years of noyſome Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
have been very little the eaſier puniſhment.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97643:9"/>
Having given you this true Pourtraict of our Penal
Laws, I ſhall only add ſome few Lineaments more, and ſo
finiſh the piece. And to make a farther Ballance betwixt
our ſelves and <hi>Rome</hi> in that point, how <hi>unchriſtian</hi> or <hi>unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable</hi>
ſoever all ſuch Penal Inflictions for meer Conſcience
may be, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has, or at leaſt fancies ſhe
has ſome little Pretext for ſuch Laws. For under her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Tenent of <hi>Extra Eccleſiam nulla ſalus,</hi> and her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
of Salvation only within her own Boundaries,
ſhe may have ſometimes conſented to the Practice of now
and then cutting off a <hi>ſtray Sheep,</hi> to terrifie the reſt of the
Flock from leaping the Fold, as imagining to her ſelf in ſo
doing, and in now and then Sacrificing one or two <hi>loſt</hi>
Sons of <hi>Perdition</hi> (for ſuch ſhe accounts them) and thereby
lopping off ſome corrupt Member already paſt hope
of Redemption, ſhe only ſecures poſſibly the whole
Body, as ſhe thinks, from <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> and <hi>Damnation.</hi>
And conſequently ſuch exemplary Acts, though of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Rigour, are only intended as abſolutely neceſſary for that
Great End, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Salvation.</hi> But, alas! our more
<hi>Charitable</hi> Church that pretends not to bound the Grace of
God, but by a larger latitude and more extended Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Equally</hi> allows Salvation to true
Zeal and Piety in <hi>both</hi> Churches, and indeed in all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Profeſſions: Under all this Conceſſion, I ſay, our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Church utterly wants this Loop-hole, and upon true
Examination will be found wholly <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> if not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable.</hi>
For in executing of her Sanguinary Laws in
puniſhment of meer matter of Conſcience, ſhe cuts off, not
like <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſuppoſed Members of <hi>Perdition;</hi> but even
thoſe Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, which by her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
may be equally with her ſelf the <hi>Sons of Grace, and
Coheirs of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97643:9"/>
Nay, I'le venture to add one <hi>bold Word</hi> more, becauſe
a <hi>true</hi> one. The Church of <hi>England</hi> in her <hi>once executing</hi>
of her ſanguinary Laws, is undoubtedly guilty of more Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
than the ten Primitive <hi>Heathen Perſecutions.</hi> For in
all caſes of Suffering for Religion, 'tis an undeniable Maxim,
That <hi>He that makes the Martyr leaſt thinks he makes him.</hi>
The bloodieſt <hi>Pagan Tyrants</hi> in all their ſtudied Arts of
Blood and Chriſtian Maſſacre, did not believe that they
butchered the then only Profeſſors of <hi>Truth</hi> and Heirs of
<hi>Heaven:</hi> But on the contrary, in Devotion to their own <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
true</hi> Deities, they thought they only executed <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
Blaſphemers</hi> and <hi>Infidels;</hi> for ſuch they accounted the
Chriſtians as profeſt Deſerters of their Heathen Gods and
Sacrifices: Nor is the forementioned <hi>Romiſh</hi> Caſe much
different, as lying under the unhappy Belief of Hereticks ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable
State of <hi>Damnation.</hi> But all this while our Church
of <hi>England</hi> (I am ſorry to her Shame it muſt be ſpoken) out-do's
the very <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves, in enacting and execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Penal Laws, by which ſhe cuts off thoſe very Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſtianity, who (if true Zealots in their Profeſſion)
ſhe owns are in the number of the <hi>Elect of God:</hi> And if any
true Zealots amongſt them, thoſe certainly that have <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
and <hi>Conſtancy</hi> to <hi>DIE</hi> for their Religion, are not the
<hi>leaſt</hi> of them; and conſequently ſhe cannot deny, but in
executing thoſe Laws, <hi>ſhe both makes the Martyr, and knows
ſhe makes him too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if ſhe's ſo blameable in her Severity againſt the
<hi>Romaniſts,</hi> much more criminal muſt her Rigour againſt
the Diſſenters be, whom ſhe owns to differ from her ſelf
in little more than <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Punctilio</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97643:10"/>
Nay, the Ferment has ſometimes boyl'd ſo high, that our
Proteſtant Church has put her Zeal upon the ſtretch to find
means to vent her Indignation, when ſome of thoſe very
Laws againſt <hi>Recuſancy</hi> have been extended againſt the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Diſſenters,</hi> and the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of their Sufferings
received from the Laſh of thoſe Laws. I ſhall not pretend
to dive ſo far, as to aſcertain whether that <hi>Comprehenſion</hi>
was originally <hi>deſign'd</hi> by thoſe Laws, or otherwiſe an <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Superſtructure</hi> to ſerve a <hi>State turn;</hi> but either way
the ſeverity of thoſe Laws is not a little notorious, where
ſo trivial Matters of Diſſent in Religion, as has been
ſaid before, have been ſo cruelly treated.</p>
            <p>But if our Proteſtant Church cannot poſſibly be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and therefore theſe Laws
were her Weapons againſt it, her more generous way, at
leaſt more agreeable to a Chriſtian Profeſſion, had been firſt
fairly to have overthrown it by <hi>Dint of Argument,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe had made uſe of <hi>Dint of Steel</hi> to do it by: And
for that purpoſe, I wonder how that famous Biſhop <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>
has paſt for ſo great a Doctor of the Church all this
while, and his Treatiſe upon that ſubject call'd <hi>Liberty
of Prophecying</hi> not yet anſwer'd; or at leaſt the Author
under no ſmall <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Fulminations</hi> (if no other way
to anſwer it) for ſo terrible a Blow againſt the Churches
long main Favourite Bulwark, her <hi>Penal Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis true, ſome People will object,</hi> What are all theſe
Laws to the <hi>CHURCH,</hi> when enacted only by the Civil
Power as an Expedient for its own Security and Defence,
and therefore warrantable and lawful; nor in any reſpect
are chargeable upon the Eccleſiaſticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:97643:10"/>
Alas! this is ſuch a feeble Objection, that 'tis ſcarce
to be named without Bluſhing: As if the Clergy did not
act in Parliament by their <hi>Repreſentatives;</hi> nay, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Biſhops ſitting there in <hi>Perſon,</hi> aſſenting to, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
little leſs than <hi>Original Founders</hi> of thoſe Laws.
But grant it, as they ſay, the meer Eſtabliſhment of the
Civil Power: The Clergy by owning the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of ſuch Laws for Defence of their
Church, the Lay-Power in this Caſe is little more than
the Cats Paw to rake out the Cheſnut. Nor are the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Rulers and Temporal Power of a Chriſtian Government
any ways more authoriſed to outgo the Goſpel Moderation
and Clemency for any Politick Conſideration whatever,
than the more immediate Oracles of Truth the Preachers
themſelves.</p>
            <p>And this the great Legiſlators of thoſe Penal Statutes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well knew, and therefore as I told you before, they
<hi>cunningly converted</hi> Recuſancy into <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity

hold of; and ſo <hi>boulſter'd</hi> up their Penal Statutes to make
them able to <hi>walk upright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'le only put this one Queſtion to all the Doctors of our
Church: With what <hi>Conſcience</hi> can a Church that owns
it ſelf <hi>Fallible,</hi> eſtabliſh Laws to puniſh Diſſenters in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
when by her own Conceſſion of <hi>Fallibility,</hi> ſhe neither
<hi>has</hi> nor <hi>CAN</hi> have any Certainty or Aſſurance (how ſtrong
ſoever ſhe <hi>thinks</hi> or <hi>hopes</hi> her own Foundation) but that ſhe
puniſhes thoſe that poſſibly may be <hi>more</hi> in the Right than
her ſelf; more eſpecially, in thoſe Profeſſions that found
their Diſſenting Doctrins on her own <hi>Baſis</hi> the Scripture?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:97643:11"/>
I cannot tell what Equity wiſer Heads may find out for
the Ordination of Penal Laws; but truly in my Opinion,
the Great <hi>Prince of Peace</hi> that reprimanded the Drawing of
that Sword that cut off but the Ear of the High Prieſts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
tho in his own immediate Cauſe, very little intended
the raiſing his <hi>Church,</hi> or the propagation of his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by
either <hi>Axes</hi> or <hi>Gibbets,</hi> or <hi>Gaols</hi> or <hi>Dungeons.</hi> And He that
left us the Standard of Chriſtianity in the <hi>Innocence</hi> of Doves,
never commiſſion'd us the <hi>Rapine</hi> of Vultures; and though
we are conceded the <hi>Subtilty</hi> of Serpents, I know no warrant
that he gave us either for the <hi>Stings</hi> or the <hi>Poyſon</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>And tho my Zeal for Truth makes me thus plain in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
the only Shame and Frailty of the Reform'd Church,
I hope ſhe has Goodneſs enough to forgive the Boldneſs of
a Bluſhing Son, who is no otherwiſe ſolicitous than for
her covering her own <hi>Nakedneſs.</hi> And that I may truly
term it ſuch, the Reformation that otherwiſe may boaſt
her Purity and Principles only founded on <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> and
all the reſt of her Doctrins and Practices derived from thoſe
ſacred Oracles, will be only found tripping <hi>here;</hi> and in all
her ſupport of Scriptural Records in all other Points, I am
afraid muſt have recourſe even to the exploded Authority
of <hi>TRADITION</hi> only for her <hi>Penal Laws.</hi> For I ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuſpect that <hi>Lollards Towers</hi> and <hi>Inquiſition Houſes</hi> (let
her mince it as ſhe will) will be found the <hi>only Precedents</hi>
for the Eſtates ſhe has confiſcated, the Families ſhe has beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar'd
the Gaols ſhe has fill'd, beſides her ſometimes load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gibbets, and ripping up the Bowels even of her own
Co-Diſciples, becauſe <hi>Diſſenting</hi> Profeſſors of Chriſt, and
all by her Penal Laws.</p>
            <p>Nor will it ſuffice for an Excuſe to inſinuate that the
Eſtabliſhment of Religion and Conformity of Worſhip on
one ſide, and the Preſervation of Peace and Tranquillity of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97643:11"/>
the State on the other ſide, exact the neceſſity of ſuch rigid
Laws. [Though by the by, the Peace of States is rather
<hi>deſtroy'd</hi> then <hi>upheld</hi> by ſuch Laws; for what Civil War in
almoſt all the Chriſtian World, that directly or indirectly has
not had the Oppreſſion of ſome Religious Party, its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
if not only <hi>Incendiary?</hi>]</p>
            <p>No; to gain the firſt of theſe great Ends, let the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Profeſſors of our Eſtabliſh'd Church live up to the
heighth of their Profeſſion, and re-call the Wanderers, and
reduce the Strays into the Fold by their own convincing
Examples of Chriſtian Piety; a much more commendable
way of making Proſelytes than the foremention'd rigid Arts
of Converſion. And for the ſecond great End, <hi>the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Security,</hi> if her Temporal Fences are not ſtrong enough,
let her make ſtronger; and if any of her Diſſenters are the
diſturbers of her Peace, let her ſingle out the <hi>Guilty</hi> from
the <hi>Innocent,</hi> and wreak her juſt Vengeance where 'tis <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;</hi>
and not puniſh the Diſſent it ſelf (which as being
meer matter of Religion, is wholly uncapable of ſuch Crime)
for the ſake of any corrupted Members, that either <hi>are of,</hi>
or <hi>Herd under</hi> the Covert of ſuch or ſuch a Congregation
of Chriſtians. For to do that work by the undiſtinguiſhing
mercileſs Hand of her Penal Statutes, is ſo little conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Evangelical Precepts, that I am afraid the doing
ſuch <hi>notorious Ills</hi> that <hi>Good</hi> may come of it, whatever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Security, or Goſpel Propagation may be intended
by them; theſe <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> I ſay, that can ſwallow the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
Fortunes, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> of their weaker Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and fellow Chriſtians, inſtead of being either <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
or <hi>Juſt,</hi> or any ways related to 'em, will at laſt appear
much nearer of kin to that famous Rover that wanders
round the World to ſeek whom he may devour, inſomuch
that their Ordination will be found little leſs than borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Engines from <hi>Hell</hi> to help to ſet up <hi>Heaven!</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:97643:12"/>
Now to the Caſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if theſe are
her Penal Laws (for I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
recital of the ſeveral Statutes of that nature, as being all
but <hi>Scions</hi> from the ſame <hi>Root</hi>) I ſhould gladly know what
Beauties or rather <hi>inviſible</hi> Charms the Church of <hi>England</hi>
can find in theſe Statutes to be in the leaſt ſolicitous for their
preſervation. For, alas! maugre all her Volumes written
upon the Unreaſonableneſs of <hi>Separation</hi> from her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and her Juſtification of her zealous Indeavours for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi>
unleſs the Means and Methods uſed to obtain it
(as theſe Laws were intended for ſuch) be <hi>equally</hi> Juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
her whole Pretenſions fall to the Ground.</p>
            <p>Nor will it excuſe her to ſay, that they were chieſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
<hi>in Terrorem,</hi> as being but ſeldom put in execution;
as if a ſtudied ill Deed were therefore more excuſable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
committed, ſuppoſe but once in an Age; when a foul
Act for that very Cauſe, ſhould rather appear the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
as 'tis the Rarity that makes the Monſter.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had that Plea to make; for what were
206 Proteſtants even by <hi>Foxes</hi> Muſter-Roll, burnt for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in her five years Reign, to the ſome millions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
in thoſe days, when half the Kingdom was of that
Perſuaſion? an infinite larger number to cull out ſo many
Sufferers from, than all the Popiſh Prieſts that <hi>Rome</hi> has
ſent over theſe 130 Years paſt, or ſhall do in as many more
to come.</p>
            <p>To return therefore to His Majeſties Propoſal of Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
theſe Laws, 'tis a <hi>greater</hi> Duty upon the Church of
<hi>England</hi> to aboliſh 'em than in the Diſſenters themſelves;
for as 'tis a Yoke impoſed upon their weaker Brethren, in
it ſelf wholly unjuſt, the <hi>Sufferer</hi> under that Yoke in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97643:12"/>
to break it, only acts by the Motives of <hi>Self-defence,</hi>
the common Principle of Nature: But the <hi>Impoſer</hi> of that
Yoke is tyed by the Obligations of <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, to repeal
and repent his own <hi>Act of Injuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, if all Arguments of Conſcience cannot prevail;
and <hi>Policy,</hi> not <hi>Equity</hi> (though Heaven forbid ſo unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
a Thought) is our Churches Guide; yet, even then
too, What do's ſhe yield up in aboliſhing thoſe Laws? Why,
truly nothing. For whilſt the Government continues in the
Hands of a Prince of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, thoſe Statutes
will utterly lye dead; for the <hi>Royal Indulgence,</hi> a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in the Crown, will never put them in execution: And
if aboliſht, however the next Proteſtant Prince has the
power of <hi>Reſumption,</hi> if his Conſcience ſhall think fit to
give them a Reſurrection. What reaſon therefore has the
Church of <hi>England</hi> for her Nonconcurrence to a Propoſal
ſo equitable, when ſhe has not ſo much as the leaſt Pretext
even of meer Intereſt it ſelf for her Refuſal?</p>
            <p>But this I am ſure, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> can have
no ſolid Reaſons to oppoſe their Repeal, the <hi>State</hi> has very
ſubſtantial ones to inforce it. For as <hi>TRADE</hi> is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſupport and ſtrength of a Kingdom, I know no Politicks
ſo conducing to the Commerce and Wealth of a Nation
as <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> What greater Encouragement to
<hi>Naturalization?</hi> And <hi>England</hi> that is not overloaded with
People, can have no fairer Inlet to bring in whole Families
and Eſtates, and indeed the Wealth of the World (beſides
the opening that Current of Commerce even amongſt our
preſent Natives, which the late Reſtraint of Worſhip had
ſo much ſhut up) than <hi>Liberty of Religion.</hi> Nor can I bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inſtance the Effects of this Policy than in the growth of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97643:13"/>
the <hi>Dutch Greatneſs,</hi> and the decay of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> from their
different Extreams of National Conduct in that Point.</p>
            <p>I am certain His Majeſty reſolves to eternize his Glory,
by being the trueſt <hi>Pater Patriae</hi> of all the Crown'd Heads
ſince the Conqueſt; nor has He a fairer Proſpect of making
His Kingdom a true <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of <hi>PEACE</hi> and <hi>PLENTY,</hi>
but by taking this Pattern at leaſt from the <hi>firſt Paradiſe,</hi>
that is, by making the Lyon and Lamb lye down in Peace
together; our long Diſunions being no otherways to be
reconciled, and our Enmities huſht but by this only <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Pacification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only add this laſt Conſideration. The execution
of our Penal Laws and the reſtraint of Conſcience, has been
the greateſt Blow that ever was given to the <hi>Hereditary
Right</hi> of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> their natural <hi>Properties</hi>
and <hi>Immunities</hi> given and ſealed to them by <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
it ſelf. For who can call his Liberty or Eſtate his own, whilſt
a <hi>Superiour Opinion</hi> in <hi>POWER</hi> ſhall ſeize our <hi>Perſons</hi> and
confiſcate our <hi>Eſtates,</hi> for no other cauſe but difference of
<hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> and neither Perſon, Eſtate or Liberty,
redeemable under a leſs Compoſition than <hi>renouncing of
God;</hi> for Conformity of Worſhip abſolutely againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is little elſe. And all this Capital Offence ſo <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt</hi>
and ſo <hi>undeterminable</hi> a ſort of Tranſgreſſion, that a Man
has only a meer Lottery to be in the <hi>Right</hi> or the <hi>Wrong:</hi>
For the blackeſt Criminal in <hi>one</hi> Reign has been the whiteſt
Saint in the <hi>next,</hi> and ſo <hi>vice verſâ</hi> over again, witneſs the
Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
where the Proteſtants were the Devils one while and
the Papiſts another: Nay, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,
both Papiſt and Proteſtant were at <hi>one time</hi> in the wrong:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97643:13"/>
For 'twas remarkable in his Reign, that in the ſame day
have Papiſts been hanged for <hi>Traytors,</hi> for diſowning his
<hi>Church Supremacy;</hi> and Proteſtants burnt for <hi>Hereticks</hi> for
denying of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Thus in their turns have all
Religions and Opinions lain under the Scourge of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt
of Laws, and all for want of that Obedience to <hi>a Law,</hi>
which Humanity it ſelf is utterly unable to pay. For though
our Breach or not Breach of all other Laws, either Humane
or Divine, lyes in our own free will and choice: To conform
or not conform to this or that Belief, is wholly above the
power of Man; <hi>Faith only being Irreſiſtible.</hi> And if our
worldly Well-being, and all we enjoy in this Life, depends
upon ſuch <hi>caprichious Decrees</hi> of Law, certainly the Great
Charter of our Liberties and Eſtates that confirm'd 'em
both under no ſuch <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>Reſtriction,</hi> is not a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
by the Penalties of ſuch Laws: And I cannot tell
what greater or more glorious Deſign His Gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
can undertake, than by repairing ſo deep a Breach
wrought through the very <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of his Peoples <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Freedom</hi> and <hi>Birthrights:</hi> Nor is there, or has been
a greater <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Patron</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> than
His preſent Majeſty, who himſelf <hi>alone</hi> tenders Her the
Means and Opportunity to waſh off thoſe long <hi>Stains</hi> and
<hi>Blots,</hi> which either the <hi>petulance</hi> or <hi>remiſsneſs</hi> of Her Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>Defenders of Her Faith,</hi> through theſe Penal Statutes
have caſt or left upon Her, and ſo to reſtore Her to <hi>Whiteneſs</hi>
and <hi>Innocence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having made this fair Inqueſt into the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> I
ſhall take a little Search too into the <hi>TEST,</hi> and lay
down thoſe Reaſons that equally oblige us to concur with
His Majeſty in a Repeal of that too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:97643:14"/>
               <hi>In order to which, it behoves us firſt to ſum up all the
great and popular Arguments (if I may ſo call 'em, tho in
reality rather the Language of</hi> Fears <hi>and</hi> Jealouſies <hi>than the
Voice of</hi> right Reaſon) <hi>daily urged for the Preſervation of
the</hi> Teſt, viz. That the whole Defence of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
relyes on that Baſis. If the Teſt were once abrogated,
the Church of <hi>England</hi> would ſoon be blown up, when all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, and all Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
both in Church and State ſhall be lodged in <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Hands; and what not?</p>
            <p>To anſwer which hideous and formidable Outcry, we'll
begin firſt with the pretended Dangers threaten'd the
<hi>Church of England</hi> by Repeal of the <hi>Teſt.</hi> Not to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
His Majeſties reiterated <hi>WORD</hi> and <hi>HONO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R,</hi> His
inviolable Engagements to maintain the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
as now by Law eſtabliſht, in her uninterrupted Rights
and Priviledges, all her Churches and Church-livings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thereunto belonging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in it ſelf alone no little Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
But waving that Plea, the Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the Church of <hi>England</hi> neither <hi>are,</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> be
ſhaken or toucht by the Abrogation of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> the <hi>Teſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed no part of her Defence. For firſt, the very taking
of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> is no part of the Qualification of any of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of <hi>England,</hi> nor was ever ſo much as mention'd or thought
upon to be impoſed or tender'd to the Clergy: No; as jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as the Founders of that <hi>Teſt</hi> were (or <hi>pretended</hi> to be)
of the Danger of Popery, and as zealous as they <hi>could</hi> be
for the Security of the Proteſtant Religion, they very well
knew the Church of <hi>England</hi> had two <hi>impregnable Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks,</hi>
the two great Acts of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NIFORMITY</hi> that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
alone ſufficiently eſtabliſht, guarded, and preſerved
the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all Points without any Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97643:14"/>
from the <hi>Teſt;</hi> nor indeed was the <hi>Teſt</hi> wanted in the
Eccleſiaſtick Adminiſtration, thoſe very Statutes being a
<hi>greater</hi> and <hi>ſtronger</hi> Teſt before: For by thoſe Statutes
is the whole Liturgy, the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments,
and indeed all the Canons and Articles of the Church ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported:
For by the Fence of thoſe Laws, firſt, no <hi>Romaniſt</hi>
can poſſibly be admitted into the Clergy unleſs under the
moſt damnable <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> (which no Human <hi>Teſt</hi> can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
an <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> too no ways beneficial to the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Cauſe whilſt tyed up to the Divine Service as now by <hi>Law</hi>
eſtabliſht. Secondly, No other Divine Service, as the <hi>Maſs,</hi>
or the like, can be introduced into our Churches already
conſtituted or aſſigned for the Divine Service of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtrength of theſe two Laws His Majeſty very well
knows, and is ſo far even from the <hi>Thought</hi> of hurting or
infringing the leaſt Particle of either of thoſe Laws, or
the Security our Church <hi>has, do's,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> receive from them,
by abrogating any Penal Laws or Teſts whatever, that on
the contrary there is not undoubtedly that farther <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
of thoſe Laws, and the <hi>Religious Obſervance</hi> of them,
or any thing <hi>conducing</hi> thereunto, that may or ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to His Majeſty in Parliament, that His Majeſty ſhall
not <hi>readily aſſent</hi> to, and as <hi>inviolably maintain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Her Adminiſtration and
Government (as 'tis plain) ſtand of themſelves alone ſecure
and firm, without any borrow'd <hi>Prop</hi> or <hi>Support</hi> from the
<hi>Teſt</hi> whatever; the <hi>Teſt</hi> therefore is only a <hi>Buttrice</hi> (or at leaſt
ſo intended) to the Civil Magiſtracy; as firſt, <hi>Excluding all</hi>
Roman Catholicks <hi>from all Offices of Truſt in the State.</hi>
Secondly, <hi>From all Domeſtick Services near the Perſon of the
King.</hi> And Thirdly, <hi>From all Right to Seſſion in Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97643:15"/>
Theſe three Incapacities are by the <hi>Teſt</hi> thrown upon the
<hi>Romaniſts.</hi> And for confuting all Suſpicions and Jealouſies,
let us examine how the looſening of all theſe three Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
can <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end to the Subverſion of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as now by Law eſtabliſht.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, as to the Civil Government: What Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in the State can a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> hold, any ways em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering
him to prejudice the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
even in the <hi>Courts of Judicature</hi> (for if any Apparition
of any ſuch Power, 'tis there;) Were <hi>Romaniſts</hi> (imagine)
in all thoſe Offices? Why may not a Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> be
as honeſt as a <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice Hales,</hi> and execute his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
with as great <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice?</hi> Why not Men of
equal Abilities be of equal Uprightneſs in all Religions?
Beſides, the Diſtribution of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> (more eſpecially
when Liberty of Conſcience ſhall be paſt into a perpetual <hi>Law,</hi>
and all Penal Inflictions for matter of Religion thrown out
of their Juriſdictions) will then be the whole Buſineſs that
lyes before them; and wherein is a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Judge
any more incapacitated for the adminiſtring of Juſtice than
another Man? Moreover, in a Kingdom where their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is ſo truly inconſiderable, as ſcarce the Two hundredth
Man in the Nation, if they have hopes of making any <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi>
or any Indeavours that way, it can only be done by
holding the Scale of Juſtice upright, and in all Poſts of
Truſt by keeping up the ſteddieſt Standard of Right and
Equity, as the only means thereby to recommend and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear
themſelves to the World, and wipe off thoſe Blemiſhes
that the <hi>miſtaken Jealouſies</hi> and <hi>Popular Miſapprehenſions</hi>
have ſo long ſo unkindly caſt upon them. And This, and
This <hi>only</hi> they are very ſenſible is their Chart to ſteer by;
and their Great <hi>Pilot,</hi> their Royal Maſter, the beſt read Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97643:15"/>
in the Arts of Empire that poſſibly ever graced a
Throne, equally knows to be His only Courſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
as ſacredly reſolves to make it ſo. And if the
Judges of the Land ſuppoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion (beſides
their Oaths that bind 'em, and His Majeſties Honour that
ſhall influence them to it) have theſe Obligations more and
above even of <hi>INTEREST</hi> to their very Religion it
ſelf, to move in ſo regular a Sphear of Juſtice, where
lyes our Danger? And if this higher Station will be ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive,
what can the poorer Juſtices of the Peace, or the
inferiour Subminiſtration of the Government ſignifie, in
Popiſh or not Popiſh Hands?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in this Caſe I have heard ſome People ſay:</hi> Alas!
What ſtretch of the Laws will not ſuch Judges make? Perhaps
for inſtance, pick a hole in the Abby-Lands, and ſtart ſome
dormient Title or other to revert them to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
a Patrimony that will not a little enrich the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and
advance their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>This idle Objection was ſcarce worth naming; as if the
ſtretching of our Laws in that Point was not as notorious
and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> as a <hi>total</hi> Violation of the Subjects <hi>Right,</hi>
and rending the whole Frame of the Laws in ſunder. But
to check this idle Surmize; If a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Parliament it ſelf
in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> with the very Reſtoration of
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion and <hi>Papal Supremacy</hi> into the Saddle,
never ſo much as <hi>attempted</hi> to revert thoſe Lands: Nay, on
the contrary, their whole Title was confirm'd to the preſent
Poſſeſſours by a <hi>Decretal</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, as was then ſo
ſolemnly done by Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> the then Popes Legate:
How groundleſs muſt the Fear be of any Thought or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of reverting them now? Or why muſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:97643:16"/>
Judges in any kind ſubvert or undermine the Laws, contrary
to all their beſt Politiques in the preſent State of <hi>England,</hi>
to no true advantage either to themſelves or their Church,
and poſſibly to be anſwerable for it with their Heads, if
they live to the next Proteſtant Prince.</p>
            <p>To come next <hi>to the Officers of his Majeſties Houſhold,</hi> &amp;c.
To have thoſe Poſts too barricado'd with Teſts, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Dignity ſo ſhackled, as to be debarr'd the Choice of its
own <hi>Menials;</hi> nay, even of its <hi>Converſation</hi> it ſelf, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
put upon Majeſty, as had been scarce tolerable from
an Ordinance of Forty eight, much leſs an Act of Parliament.
But for our leſs Wonder at it, we are to conſider 'twas
Hatch'd in the ſame <hi>Republick Neſt:</hi> for no leſs than the
great old Patriot of <hi>Three Names</hi> ſate for the brooding of it.</p>
            <p>I think I need not raiſe Arguments to prove how little
thoſe Gentlemen of Honour, the Courtiers I mean, of any
Religion whatſoever, in that innocent Station are, or can be
concerned in ſhaking either <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> It is enough
to ſay that greater Indignity under the Sanction of a Law,
was never impos'd upon a Crown'd Head. The meaneſt
Gentleman in <hi>England,</hi> whilſt this Teſt keeps Footing, has
a Prerogative above the King. For the choice of his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
Bayliff, Attorney, or Solicitor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in his own free
Election: But theſe were Priviledges thought too large for
a King; and therefore he is Stinted and Bounded to ſuch
Elections, as the more Imperial Wiſdom of His <hi>Great
Maſters</hi> in Parliament judge fitteſt for him.</p>
            <p>Monarchical Rule is ſaid to be like that of Heaven, where
the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> acts altogether by <hi>inferior Sphears,</hi>
and <hi>ſecond Cauſes.</hi> And ſo Majeſty by its Officers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
as ſo many Vehicles, by which the Influences of the
Royal Power are Convey'd, to ſet the Great <hi>Machine</hi> a
moving: But truly this Aſcendancy the late Law-makers,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97643:16"/>
judged too great for the King of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore they
found an Expedient to render the Monarchy little more than
<hi>precarious,</hi> making the whole Miniſters of the State the
Creatures of the Teſt, and not of the King.</p>
            <p>Now I deſire to know how in Reaſon we can imagine,
that a King, in himſelf the Fountain of <hi>Honour,</hi> and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of <hi>Power;</hi> though in his Nature, the Mildeſt and beſt
Temper'd of Princes; though without the leaſt <hi>Thought</hi> of
Unhinging the Frame of the Government, or Diſturbing the
Settled Church of his Kingdom; to blaſt his own Glory,
and loſe his Subjects Hearts; (for that would be all the
Crop 'twould yield him;) I wonder I ſay how we can
imagine, that the Beſt and moſt Gracious of Princes, tho
without the foremention'd Deſigns, could nevertheleſs
brook ſo <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprincely a Yoke</hi> as the Teſt.—And truly to juſtifie
his Majeſties heartieſt Endeavours againſt both Penal Laws
and Teſt, in not labouring to abrogate the firſt, as they
ſtand in Force againſt the Lives and Liberties, (and how <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly</hi>
has been proved before) of the Members of his own
Communion, he would be the moſt <hi>unnatural</hi> of Men; and
in not labouring to repeal the laſt, as ſtanding ſo egregiouſly
in force againſt the Right and Prerogative of His Crown,
and indeed originally forged in Affront to himſelf, he ſhould
be the moſt <hi>Diſhonourable</hi> of Princes: Nor will it ſerve to
object, that His late Majeſty (whatever diminution to the
Prerogative it might be) by paſſing it into a <hi>Law,</hi> has <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated</hi>
that Power from the Crown. For to anſwer that
Argument, we are aſſured, that whatever Alienations of
that kind the Eaſineſs of the preſent Poſſeſſour of the Crown,
or any other Reaſons may induce him to make, are no
ways truly binding to the Succeſſor.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the laſt Point, the Qualification of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in Parliament by the <hi>Teſt:</hi> And firſt, I ſhall not ſo much
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97643:17"/>
inſiſt upon the notorious Invaſion of the Birthright of the
<hi>Peers</hi> by this Excluſion from Parliament, as being a Point al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſo well handled by better Pens, and never yet anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
nor ſhall I ſo much inſiſt upon the <hi>Illegality</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs</hi>
of Teſts in general of any kind, as was once argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Parliament by the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> in oppoſition to a
Teſt propoſed by the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> a Teſt, which (though
not thought legal to be impoſed as ſuch) contain'd no other
than the higheſt Obligations of Loyalty that every Subject
owes to his Prince. But if the making of Teſts in Parliament,
which with the Sovereign Conſent (as Kings are but Men,
and ſometimes the Exigence of Affairs, may extort the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Fiat</hi>) lyes in the Majority ſo to do: Suppoſe the Forgers
of this <hi>Teſt</hi> (for by the by they were none of the beſt Friends
of the Church as now by Law eſtabliſht) had follow'd their
Blow, and form'd a ſecond <hi>Teſt</hi> to deny Epiſcopacy to be
<hi>Jure divino;</hi> a Diſpute much bandyed in thoſe days: Here
had the Biſhops been thrown out of the Parliament, if not
the whole <hi>Hierarchy</hi> out of the Kingdom. And ſo by Teſts
<hi>ad Infinitum,</hi> how might the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the whole Government
been overturned, and the very Houſes of Parliament dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
at laſt, to the ſcandalous Dimenſions of the old faſhion'd
<hi>Rump.</hi> For if one <hi>Teſt</hi> to exclude a <hi>Score,</hi> why not another
to lop off a <hi>hundred?</hi> And indeed, how are our preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
the <hi>comprehenſive Body</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Peers, not there by <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> are ſhut out?
Nay, how much is the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the Laws they make, and
the very <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of our later Parliaments themſelves
impair'd and leſſen'd by ſuch an Excluſion?</p>
            <p>But to come to the main Buſineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> to obviate the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and terribleſt Clamour of Fear and Jealouſie againſt the
Repeal of the Teſt, <hi>viz. If the Teſt were deſtroy'd, who knows
but Parliaments may be ſo managed as to turn out the Church of</hi>
England, <hi>and ſet up Popery even by Law it ſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:97643:17"/>
This indeed is the <hi>Gorgon,</hi> that frights half Man-kind
out of their little Senſes. But where, or how is this
Popiſh Parliament to be gotten, (for a Proteſtant one will
hardly be ſo Complaiſant:) But to ſearch out every
Cranny that this imaginary Danger is ſuppoſed to creep
in at, Let us examine the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> and try their
Inclinations that way.</p>
            <p>If the Teſt were laid aſide, and the excluded Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored;
what would their Number ſignifie! At out laſt
Parliament, the Proteſtant Peers amounted to 160, and the
excluded Romiſh Barons (nor are they much increaſed
ſince) were not a Tenth of their Number. So that
here's an abſolute want of a Prodigious Creation of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
<hi>Barons</hi> to riſe to a Majority; Nay, and of ſo many
<hi>Eſtates</hi> too, to ſupport the Grandure, as poſſibly would
ſtagger imagination it ſelf to find a Treaſure, enough to
purchaſe: for ſo many <hi>New Dignifications,</hi> eſpecially of
<hi>Gentry,</hi> or <hi>Landed Men</hi> to ſtart up <hi>Lords,</hi> among ſo thin
ſown a Party, would put 'em damnable hard to it. But
for once, grant ſuch an Extravagant Donation of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and ſuch <hi>Goldeu Mines</hi> to maintain it, might form
a Houſe of Lords capable of over-ballancing on the Popiſh
ſide; where ſhall the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> be had? for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>both</hi> they do nothing! They would go nigh to find
ſuch a <hi>Dead Weight</hi> in the Lower Houſe, as all the <hi>Tuggs</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> would never be able to ſtirr; and this ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Parliamentary Subverſion of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
a <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> only in <hi>Nubibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Popiſh Houſe of Commons too! <hi>Alas, they'll tell you,</hi>
very eaſily. Has not the King for inſtance, got a new way
of Regulating Corporations, Nay, has he not (or will do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
next Seſſions) already Modell'd all their Charters, and
undoubtedly left few or none, either Citizens, Burghers or
Free-men, in whom the Election lies, but ſuch as are his
Friends and Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97643:18"/>
Very Well: Suppoſe he has, or will take Care, to the
beſt of his <hi>Endeavour</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> to Eſtabliſh Corporation
to his own <hi>Hearts liking:</hi> After all, where ſhall there be
<hi>One</hi> Roman Catholique in all the next Election; and
what ſhall theſe <hi>Creatures,</hi> (if you'll have 'em ſo) do
more than Chooſe every <hi>Numerical</hi> Member a <hi>Proteſtant:</hi>
For till the Teſt be Legally diſſolved, they muſt <hi>all</hi> be ſo.
And truly what if this next, tho' Proteſtant Parliament,
out of an Abhorrence of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian Barbarity</hi> of the
<hi>Penall Laws,</hi> ſhall do themſelves, their <hi>Poſterity,</hi> their
<hi>Country,</hi> and His <hi>Majeſtie</hi> Juſtice in diſſolving them?
And what if likewiſe their true Senſe of the moſt ſervile
<hi>Impoſition</hi> that Imperial Dignity ever bore, their Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for His Majeſties <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Prerogative,</hi> together
with their Gratitude, for the <hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> His Reign
has Bleſs'd them with, ſhall incline them alſo, to break
thoſe Fetters of the Crown, the <hi>Teſt;</hi> and all no more
than <hi>High-Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Right Reaſon</hi> ſhall oblige them to;
Muſt it therefore follow, that they ſhall do themſelves,
their Families, their yet unborn Heirs, and their no leſs
Concern their Country that Wrong, as to give up their
tendereſt and neareſt Care, their <hi>Religion;</hi> or any thing
tending to it!</p>
            <p>Well, <hi>but ſay they,</hi> if this next Parliament will not do
the Work; when the Teſt is once gon; 'tis but calling new
Popiſh ones that will.</p>
            <p>I, but who ſhall chooſe them? The Electors are all the
ſame: For the Corporations are, or will be ſettled to his
own Model: and Teſt or no Teſt in Being, their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
will be all the ſame; and upon any New Choice,
beyond all Diſpute, the <hi>Majoritie</hi> of the <hi>Old Members</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
again; and if any <hi>New Ones</hi> amongſt them, thoſe
too as far from leaning towards <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Popular
Frantick Jealouſies are from <hi>Common Senſe.</hi>

            <p>

Upon the upſhot, I defie all Mankind to form one <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi>
Projection, or indeed, <hi>imaginary</hi> poſſibility of ſuch
a Popiſh Parliament. For inſtance we muſt run into
endleſs <hi>Labyrinths</hi> and <hi>Chimaeras,</hi> for the meer <hi>Shadow</hi> of
ſuch a Danger. For firſt the King muſt diſſolve all his
late Charters again; no matter whether forfeited or not;
and ſo throw Dirt in the Face of his own yeſterdays
Royal Acts and Grants: For all the <hi>Free-men, Burggers,</hi>
or <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and whatever the preſent Electors, and
conſequently all the <hi>Trading Part</hi> of the Nation, muſt be
diſplaced and caſhierd, (a very Violent Reform, and an
ingratitude, which His Majeſties Nature abhors, to thoſe
very Men, that by reſcinding the <hi>Penall Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſt</hi> ſhall
have Duty fully given him all he could ask:) And a new
ſet of Romans planted in their Rooms; or otherwiſe, if
the preſent Electors continue in their Poſts, a Majority
of Papiſts muſt be crowded in to over Vote them: But
where to be had, let <hi>Machiavil</hi> himſelf inform us. For

For how many Corporations are there in <hi>England,</hi> that

Nay, take ſome parts of <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Weſt</hi> for

—But perhaps, after all, there may be more in it

and more than probably ſo affect the <hi>Frightned</hi>

            <p>But to conclude. As the fore-mentioned are all our
Dangers from their Repeal, wherein are His Majeſties
Demands <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> in asking the Repeal of the <hi>Penal
Laws,</hi> in which almoſt the whole <hi>Vox populi,</hi> Witneſs the
late Numerous <hi>Adreſſes,</hi> joyns with him, and the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Nature, Humanity</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> plead for him. Or
in asking the Repeale of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> for the aſſerting of his
own <hi>Honour,</hi> and the Recovering the <hi>Birth-Right of a
King,</hi> by endeavouring to ſhake off the moſt ſhameful
<hi>Vaſſalage</hi> that Monarch ever truckled under. And why
muſt his Endeavours of doing his People ſo much <hi>Right</hi>
in the firſt; and <hi>Himſelf</hi> ſo much <hi>Right</hi> in the laſt, be ſo
poorly miſ-interpreted, by the unnatural Surmiſes of his

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful</hi> People. But let us Bluſh and mend, and by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
up theſe Laws, do <hi>Equity</hi> in Return of <hi>Clemenoie</hi> and
<hi>MERCY.</hi>
