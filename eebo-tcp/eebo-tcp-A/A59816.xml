            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am conscious to my self of so honest a design in writing this Discourse, that I am very very well armed against those various censures, which are the usual reward of such Attempts; for there is no such Sanctuary against the rudest clamours, and the most unjust reproaches, as a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I was heartily grieved to see so many well-disposed Persons abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with words and phrases, which either signifie nothing, or have a very ambiguous and doubtful, or a very bad sense; when I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that great zeal, which some men have for the Worship of God, I have often thought, what great
<pb facs="tcp:100660:3"/>
Instruments they might be of Gods glory, were their zeal directed and governed with Knowledge and Iudgment; and when I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how innocently and vertuously some of those men live, who have espoused such Principles, as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tend to make them bad, I have thought, what excellent Persons they might prove, did they rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand so excellent a Religion, as is published to the World in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Christ; such thoughts as these at first engaged me in this Work, to rectifie those mistakes, which will either make men bad, or hinder and retard their progress in true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is so pious and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a design, as may at least plead my excuse, though it should appear to be a mistaken zeal.</p>
            <p>In the management of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course I have carefully avoided all personal reflexions, have not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:100660:3"/>
with the lives and actions of men, which I am so charitable as to hope, may be more orthodox than their judgments: I have represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their opinions in their own words, and am not conscious to my self, that I have put any other sense up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their words, than they intended, and I cannot see, what reason any man hath to take it ill; that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat that, which he himself thought fit to publish: where they pretend to argue gravely, I have examined their Arguments with all possible gravity and solemnity; where they plainly toy and trifle, I have so far complied with their humour, as to smile sometimes, though as modestly as any man can desire: I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care, not only to unteach men, what was amiss, but to explain and consirm the true notions of Religion, lest any man should suspect, that under a pretence of rectifying mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
<pb facs="tcp:100660:4"/>
I designed to expose all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: what men will account severe, I cannot tell, because the gentlest Arguments will appear severe to any man, who is pinch't by them; but I have given no hard words, and have sometimes called things by softer names, than they deserve, on purpose to avoid the imputation of severity, which is now the common artifice to teach men to despise and reproach, what they cannot answer: and if after all this I cannot escape without some hard names and hard censures, I must be contented with my portion; and indeed no man ought to expect better usage, who considers, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself, who hath deserved so well for his pious labours, could not escape, when he touch't upon their Darling No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>And now, Christian Reader, I shall beg no more of thee, than to
<pb facs="tcp:100660:4"/>
read this Discourse with an honest and unprejudiced mind, and as I did not compose it without imploring the guidance and direction of God, so I recommend it to thee with my hearty prayers, that it may prove as useful, as my intentions were honest and charitable.</p>

            <head>THE CONTENTS.</head>
            <list>
               <item>THE Introduction concerning the various significations of the Name <hi>Christ</hi> in Scripture, that it originally is the name of an Office, but is used also to signifie the Person invested with this Office, and the Gospel of Christ, and the Church of Christ. <hi>Pag. 1.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Of what use the consideration of Christs Person is in the Christian Religion. 14</item>
               <item>As first the greatness of his Person is a plain demonstration of Gods love to Mankind, in that he gave his own Son for us. 15</item>
               <item>2. It gives great Reverence and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to his Gospel. 17</item>
               <item>3. It gives great Authority to his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 18</item>
               <item>4. This assures us of the infinite value of his Sacrifice, and of the power of his Intercession. 19</item>
               <item>5. The Person of Christ is of no other consideration in the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than as it hath an influence upon the great Ends of his Undertaking. 21</item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:100660:6"/>Of the knowledge of Christ, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways whereby God hath manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to the World. 25</item>
               <item>Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Notion of an acquaintance with Christs Person considered. 38</item>
               <item>How the Nature and Attributes of God may be learn't from an acquaintance with the Person of Christ. 42. And how we learn the knowledge of our selves with respect to sin. 49. And to Righteousness. 53. And our wisdom to walk with God. 55</item>
               <item>A new Scheme of Religion deduced from this acquaintance with Christs Person. 57</item>
               <item>How unsafe it is to found Religion on a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended acquaintance with Christs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which at most amounts to no more than uncertain conjectures or ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and doubtful Reasonings. 76</item>
               <item>This way will serve other men, as well as themselves, and another Scheme of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from an acquaintance with Christ. 80</item>
               <item>Of expounding Scripture by the sound of words. 102</item>
               <item>And by the Analogie of Faith. 118</item>
               <item>What is meant by our Union to Christ. 142</item>
               <item>Those Metaphors, which describe the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:100660:6"/>

               <item>In what sense Christ is called a Shepherd, Head, and Husband. 157. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of these Metaphors. 159</item>
               <item>This political Union is either only exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and visible, or true and real, and what this external Union is. 168</item>
               <item>Wherein the real Union consists, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the subjection of our Souls and Spirits to Christ. 171</item>
               <item>We are united to Christ by a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Nature. 172. And by a mutual and reciprocal Love. 174</item>

               <p>ALL errour hath some appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of truth; it being impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to believe a plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disguised falshood: but yet most men are so easie and credulous, so impatient of severe inquiries, or by assed by so many corrupt passions and interests, that they are too often imposed on by very slight appearances: And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the first and fundamental mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake is in a confusion of names, in a doubtful and ambiguous use of words, especially in matters of Religion, which depend upon Revelation, and must be judged by the publick and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Records of inspired men: for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100660:9"/>
it happens too often in this Case, that men consider nothing but the sound of words, and from thence form such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth <hi>Idaeas</hi> of Religion, as are fitted to the meanness of their understandings, or gratifie their natural Genius and disposition, or are calculated to serve an interest: And thus the Gospel of our Saviour is defaced and obscured by affected Mysteries, and Paradoxes, and senseless propositions; and Christ himself, who was the brightness of his Fathers glory, and the express image of his Person, who in the most plain and perspicuous manner declared the will of God to us, is represented with a thicker Vail upon his Face than <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and the glory of the second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is much more obscured with a mist of words, than the first was with Types and Figures.</p>
               <p>This will appear to any man, who shall observe, what strange interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are commonly made of those Texts of Scripture, especially in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, wherein Christ is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, what absurd propositions are built on them, what pernicious conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences drawn from them, to defeat the great ends of Christs appearing in the flesh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100660:9"/>I always took it for granted, that Christ and his Religion were very well agreed, but, if we believe some men, there is as irreconcileable a difference between the Religion of <hi>Christs Person,</hi> and of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> as between the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Grace:</hi> For the <hi>Gospel</hi> of Christ is as severe a despensation as the Law, which dooms all men to Eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, who live not very innocent and vertuous Lives; but the Person of Christ is all Grace, a meer refuge and Sanctuary for the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</p>
               <p>Surely here must be a mistake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; for I am still of the mind, that the Person of Christ is not at odds with his Gospel; and that the Person of Christ will save none whom his Gospel condemns; or if Christ would save those, whom his Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, <hi>viz.</hi> impenitent and incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sinners, I cannot imagine how men should know this without a particular Revelation, and I hope, they do not mean this by the private testimony of the Spirit to work assurance in them; And yet we can think of no other way, since the Gospel is so silent in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But it is easie to observe, where
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100660:10"/>
the mistake lies: for some men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they meet with the word <hi>Christ</hi> in Scripture, always understand by it the Person of Christ, and thus Faith in Christ, and hope in Christ, and the like Phrases, are expounded of a sidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial relyance and recumbency on the Person of Christ for Salvation in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-distinction to obedience to his Laws, which sets up a <hi>Religion of the Person of Christ</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Religion of his Gospel.</hi> And therefore the best way of rectifying this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, which sets the Person and the Gospel of Christ at such odds, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the various significations of this name Christ in Scripture, which shall serve as an Introduction to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>And first <hi>Christ</hi> is originally the name of an Office, which the Jews call the Messias or one anointed by God: for under the Law, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Priests, and Kings, were invested in their several Offices by the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of anointing them with Oyl, which was typical of that divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the Holy Jesus received at his Baptism, when the Spirit of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended on him like a Dove. All those
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100660:10"/>
legal Unctions were accomplisht in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom God anointed with the Holy Ghost, and with power, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>Verse,</hi> 38. which was his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration to the Mediatory Function, and vertually contained all those Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Prophet, Priest, and King, which are not properly distinct Offices in Christ, but the several parts, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent administrations of his Mediatory Kingdom.</p>
               <p>His Preaching the Gospel (which we commonly call his Prophetical Office) was the exercise of his Regal Power and Authority, in publishing his Laws, and the conditions of Eternal Life. Hence the Gospel is so often called the Kingdom of Heaven, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tells <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he was born to be a King, and the principal exercise of his Kingly Power in this World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in bearing witness to the truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 37. that is, it was an Act of his Regal Power to Conquer errour and ignorance, to destroy the Kingdom of darkness by the brightness of his appearing, and to erect his Throne in the hearts and Consciences of men, by the power and evidence of truth; which is a true spiritual Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100660:11"/>And he was a Kingly Priest, a Priest after the order of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> who was King of <hi>Salem,</hi> (the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which comes down from Heaven) and Priest of the most high God. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. <hi>Verse</hi> 1. when he offered himself a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for sin, he acted like a King. No man took his life from him, but he had power to lay it down, and he had power to take it again, in the <hi>10th</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, and 18. <hi>Verse.</hi> Herein he differ'd from other Kings, that he laid the Foundation of his Kingdom in his own blood, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd and redeem'd his Subjects by the Sacrifice of himself.</p>
               <p>And that, to which we commonly appropriate the name of Regal Power, that authority he is invested with, to Govern his Church, to send his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to forgive sins, to dispense his Grace, and supernatural assistances, to answer Prayers, to raise the dead, and judge the World, and bestow immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life on all his sincere Disciples, all this is the reward of his death and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and is therefore called his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, because like the intercession of the high Priest under the Law, it is founded on his expiation and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100660:11"/>
                  <hi>With his own blood he entred once into the holy place, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal redemption for us. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> 9. <hi>Verse</hi> 12. so that <hi>intercession</hi> signifies the Administration of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory Kingdom: the Power of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Priest to expiate and forgive sins.</p>
               <p>This is a true account of the nature of Christs Kingdom, and the method whereby it is erected. He first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers the minds of men by the power of his Word and Spirit; and reduces them into subjection to God; and then he pardons their sins, and raiseth them into an immortal life by the expiation of his Sacrifice, and that Power and Authority, which is founded on it.</p>
               <p>And this is the interpretation of the name Christ, which signifies a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory King, immediately appointed by God to that Office, and consecrated to it by a Divine and Supernatural Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And thus the name <hi>Christ</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies in those places of Scripture, where <hi>Iesus</hi> is said to be the <hi>Christ, i. e.</hi> that Messias, whom God promised to send; Which are so many and so obvious, that I need not name them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though Christ is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100660:12"/>
the name of an Office, yet it is used in Scripture to signifie the Person, who is invested with this Office: for the use of names being for distinction, and the Office of a Mediator, which is the first signification of the name Christ, being appropriate to Him, it might well serve for a proper name, when once it was known, who was <hi>the Christ.</hi> And therefore though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his designation to this Office was publickly owned, he was only called <hi>Iesus,</hi> the name given him by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, before he was born; yet, when by his resurrection from the dead, He was declared with power to be the Son and the <hi>Christ</hi> of God, <hi>Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as much his proper name, as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> was before. In the Gospels, which contain the History of his Life and Death, He is always called <hi>Iesus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all this time it was disputed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were the <hi>Christ</hi> or not; but in the Epistles, which are directed to the Christian Churches, which were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on this Faith, that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Christ,</hi> he is as familiarly called <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>Iesus,</hi> and oftentimes by both, <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> For there can be no mistake in the Person, by what name soever
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100660:12"/>
he be called, whether it belong to his Office, or Nature, or circumstances of his Life and Fortune, if there be but <hi>One,</hi> to whom that name belongs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ signifies the Gospel, and Religion of Christ, as <hi>Moses</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Writings, and Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, the Writings or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Prophets; in the 16. Ch. of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel, 29. <hi>Verse, They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them;</hi> and in the 31. Verse, <hi>If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be perswaded, though one rise from the dead.</hi> And there is nothing more usual in common speech, than to call any Laws, or Religion, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, by the name of the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: Thus in the 6. Chapter to the <hi>Galathians</hi> 15. <hi>Verse.</hi> In <hi>Christ Iesus neither Circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new Creature:</hi> that is, in the Gospel, and Religion of Christ, nothing is of any value to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend us to the favour of God, but a new Nature, a holy and vertuous life: The Law preferr'd Circumcision before Uncircumcision, but the Gospel of Christ makes no such distinction; but instead of those external signs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100660:13"/>
the inward purity of heart. Thus in the second Chapter of the <hi>Ep. to Coll.</hi> 8. <hi>Verse; Beware lest men spoil you through Philosophy, and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the World, and not after Christ.</hi> Where <hi>after Christ</hi> is opposed to the <hi>traditions of men,</hi> and the <hi>Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World,</hi> and therefore must signifie not the <hi>Person,</hi> but the <hi>Religion or Gospel</hi> of Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> have a care, lest you be corrupted with the foolish opinions and superstitions of men, which are inconsistent with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Philosophy, a plain contradiction to the Doctrine and Religion of Christ. And in the 6. Verse, <hi>As you have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received Christ Iesus the Lord, so walk in him. i. e.</hi> obey the Doctrine of Christ, as you have been taught it by us, for so in the next Verse he calls it, <hi>Being established in the Faith, as you have been taught.</hi> The like we may see in the 4. Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> 20, 21. <hi>Verses, But you have not so learned Christ, if so be, you have heard him, and been taught by him, as the truth is in Iesus.</hi> Now what can <hi>learning Christ</hi> signifie? but learning the Gospel of Christ. And how could
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100660:13"/>
the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> who never saw Christ in the flesh, be said to <hi>hear him,</hi> in any other sense, than as they heard his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preacht to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in him, as the truth is in Iesus</hi> (for so <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies, not, as our Translators render it, being taught by him, but instructed in him) must be expounded of his Religion, in its genuine and primitive simplicity, so as Christ taught it his Disciples, without the mixture of such corrupt and impure Doctrines, as the Gnostick Hereticks had taught under the name of Christianity. These I take to be very convincing allegations of the use of the name Christ, for his Doctrine and Religion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is acknowledg'd by all, that <hi>Christ</hi> sometimes signifies the Church of Christ, <hi>which is his body, the fullness of him, that filleth all in all:</hi> And thus we must understand those Phrases of being <hi>in Christ, engrafted</hi> into Christ, and <hi>united</hi> to Christ, which signifie no more than to be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, One, who belongs to that Society, whereof Christ is the Head and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour: thus it is used in the 12. Chapter of the <hi>Ep.</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> 5.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100660:14"/>
                  <hi>Verse. We being many are One Body in Christ, i. e.</hi> we are all but one Christian Society, which is the One Body of Christ. Thus <hi>Brethren in Christ, i. e.</hi> Christian Brethren, 1 <hi>Colossians.</hi> 2. <hi>Verse.</hi> And, <hi>if any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature:</hi> 2. <hi>Ep.</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 5. Chapter 17. <hi>v. i. e.</hi> every sincere Christian is a new Creature, or, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever professeth the Faith of Christ, and lives in Society with the Christian Church, hath obliged himself to live a new life: but of this more in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>
               <p>Thus variously is the name <hi>Christ</hi> used in the Writings of the Apostles, which hath occasioned very great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes in some mens Divinity, who are very zealous to advance Christs <hi>Person</hi> to the prejudice and reproach of his <hi>Religion.</hi> Who, instead of those substantial duties of the love of God, and men, and an universal holiness of life, have introduced a fanciful <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of Christ to our selves, and <hi>Union</hi> to him, set off with all those choice Phrases of <hi>closing with Christ, and embracing Christ, and getting into Christ, and getting an interest in Christ, and trusting, and relying, and rowling</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100660:14"/>
                  <hi>our Souls on Christ:</hi> And instead of obedience to the Gospel, and the Laws of Christ, have advanced a kind of Amorous and Enthusiastick devotion, which consists in a passionate love to the Person of Christ, in admiring his <hi>Personal excellencies, and perfections, fulness, beauty, loveliness, riches, &amp;c.</hi> The Foundation of all which Riddles, and Mysteries, is, that these men make the Person of Christ almost the sole object of the Christian Religion, and whatever is spoken of Christ with res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to his Offices, his Laws, and his Religion, they understand of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and personal excellencies. And therefore the design of this discourse is to reconcile the Person of Christ with his Religion, that men may not abuse themselves with a pretended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to our Saviour, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn his Laws, and purposely defeat the great end of his coming into the World. And to that end I shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on these following Arguments.</p>
               <p>First, Of what use the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs person is in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion; Secondly, What the Knowledge of Christ is; Thirdly, Wherein our Union to Christ, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100660:15"/>
Communion with him consists; Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Christs love to us, and our love to Christ.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of what use the consideration of Christs Person is in the Christian Religion.</head>
               <p>THE first thing to be stated is, of what use the consideration of Christs <hi>Person</hi> is in the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: For those men, who talk so much of the <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Personal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies</hi> of Christ frequently without any sense, and generally without any just ground from Reason or Scripture, are very clamorous, and alarm the World with strange jealousies and fears; as if there were a party of men started up, who design to make <hi>Christ useless,</hi> and to reduce Religion to its first Natural State, which knew no Priest, nor Sacrifice, nor Mediator. A design, which, I profess, I am wholly a stranger to, as I believe all those are, who are so much charged
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100660:15"/>
with it; The Foundation of <hi>my</hi> hope is that, which is the Foundation of the <hi>Christian Religion, the Sacrifice and Intercession of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> But I doubt not, it will appear in the Sequel, what the ground of these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies are, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>we are charged with making Christ useless, only because we dare not make his Laws and Religion so:</hi> And to prevent such scandals for the future, I shall lay the Foundation of all in this inquiry; of what use the consideration of Christs Person is in the Christian Religion.</p>
               <p>By the Person of Christ I mean, what all men ought to mean, who talk of Christs Person, <hi>viz. Christ himself,</hi> as every mans Person is himself: and the only proper consideration here is the greatness of his <hi>Person,</hi> who is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>God man,</hi> the Son of <hi>God,</hi> in whom his Soul was well pleased, who left the glories of an Eternal Throne to undertake the work of mans redemption; and this suggests many useful considerations, which have a great influence upon Religion.</p>
               <p>As first, This is a plain demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods love to Mankind, that he sent so <hi>great</hi> and so <hi>dear</hi> a Person,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100660:16"/>
as his only begotten Son, into the World to save Sinners. All Religion is founded on a belief of Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>He that cometh to God must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he is, and that he is a rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them, that diligently seek him. Hebr.</hi> 11. 6. that is, must believe his Being and his Providence, that he loves, and takes care of good men; for no man will serve God, who does not hope to be the better by it. And therefore every Religion had its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per demonstrations of Gods Goodness: Natural Religion was founded on those natural evidences of the Divine boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and goodness in making and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the World; the Mosaick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion on those miraculous deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, God wrought for <hi>Israel,</hi> and that particular providence, which watched over them: the Christian Religion, on the Incarnation, Death, and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Son of God; a work of such stupendious love, that it is the wonder of Angels, and the astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as praise of men. No man can doubt of Gods good will to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who sees the Son of God cloathed with our flesh, and dying as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for our sins; this gives relief to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100660:16"/>
our guilty fears, and does encourage us to retrieve our past follies by new obedience, that we have so great an assurance of God's goodness; for he had nothing greater to bestow on us, than his Son; And <hi>he that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</hi> 8 Rom. 32.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This gives great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and authority to the Gospel, that it was preached by so great a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as the Son of God. Laws always partake of the fate and condition of the Law-giver; the greater opinion we have of his Wisdom, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for his Person, the more sacred regard have we for his Laws; and therefore <hi>Numa</hi> pretended, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Laws from the Goddess <hi>Aegeria,</hi> to procure a greater venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them; which was imitated by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and other Law-givers: thus <hi>God, who at sundry times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners, spake in time past to the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed Heir of all things, by whom also he made the Worlds.</hi> 1 Hebr. 1. 2. And his greatness and Authority gives
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100660:17"/>
an inviolable sanction and just reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Laws. <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip; for if the word spoken by Angels was stedfast, and every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward, how shall we escape, if we neglect so great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which at first began to be spoken by the Lord,</hi> 2. Hebr. 1. 2, 3. To the same purpose is that Parable in <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The greatness of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son gives great authority to his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He came to be our Prophet and our guide, to teach us by his Precepts and his life; now we love to imitate great Persons, and none so great as he, who was the brightness of his Fathers Glory, and the express image of his Person. His example secures the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation of vertue, and gives us an evident demonstration, wherein the perfection of our nature consists; for he lived up to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of humane nature, and the only way to be perfect is to live, as he lived. Nay the greatness of his Person makes all the expressions of his love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100660:17"/>
the more wonderful. That the Son of God should become man, that when he was rich, for our sakes he should become poor, that the great Lord of the Creation should become a Minister and Servant, that the Lord of life and glory should suffer and die: These are such expressions of love and goodness, as we can never fully imitate, because we can never be so great, as he was, but yet they pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully convince us, how reasonable it is for us to stoop to the meanest offices of kindness, since we can never stoop so low, as the Son of God did, when he came down from Heaven, and took up his Lodging in the grave.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This assures us of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value of his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the power of his <hi>intercession:</hi> He was a Priest of a higher order than that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his Sacrifice of a greater value than the bloud of Bulls and Goats: God cannot but be pleased, when his own Son undertakes to be a ransom, and to make atonement for Sinners, which is so great a vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Dominion and Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of the authority of his Laws, and the Wisdom and Justice of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100660:18"/>
that he may securely pardon humble and penitent Sinners without reproaching any of his Attributes. And we can reasonably desire no greater security for the performance of this Gospel Covenant, than that it was sealed with the bloud of the Son of God, which is such a confirmation of God's Covenant and Promise, as the World never had before; Christ is the surety of a better Testament, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one who undertakes for the performance of it, and the security he gives us depends on thè vertue of his Priesthood and Sacrifice, and the power of his Intercession; for so in <hi>Verse</hi> 21. the Apostle tells us, that God had confirmed the Priesthood of Christ by Oath, <hi>The Lord hath sworn and will not repent, Thou art a Priest for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Order of</hi> Melchisedec: And whereas other Priests died, and left their Priesthood to their Successors, <hi>He continueth for ever, and therefore hath an unchangeable Priesthood, and is able to save them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. Verse</hi> 23, 24, 25. And who can desire a more powerful Mediator than the Son of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100660:18"/>
God, to whom God hath given such signal demonstrations of his favour and acceptance by a voice from Heaven, and by the glory of his Miracles, and his Resurrection from the Dead?</p>
               <p>And that the vertue of Christs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Intercession depends very much on the greatness of his Person is plain from the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> the design of which is to show, how much the Priesthood and Sacrifice of Christ excels that of the Law, and the Foundation of all is laid in the first Chapter, where the Apostle discourses of his greatness and excellency, that he was the brightness of his Fathers glory, and the express Image of his Person; the Heir of all things by whom he made the Worlds, exalted above all Angels, who hath an everlasting Throne and Scepter, and shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, when all other things moulder and vanish away.</p>
               <p>But Fifthly, The Person of Christ is of no other consideration in the Christian Religion, than as it hath an influence upon the great ends of his undertaking, <hi>i. e.</hi> we must expect no more from Christ upon account of his Personal excellencies and perfections,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100660:19"/>
than what he hath promised in his Gospel: He hath told us there, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he intends to do for us, and hath charged us to expect no more from him. <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Not every one, that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father, which is in Heaven.</hi> That is, you must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that I will be better to you than my word, and receive you into the Kingdom of Heaven upon easier terms, than I have promised, I shall be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with none of your flattering speeches, but how good and kind so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may fancy me, unless you obey those Laws I publish in my Fathers name, I declare before hand, that I will disown you, when I come to judgment.</p>
               <p>For indeed should he absolve and justifie those men, whom the Gospel condemns, that is, wilful and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Sinners, this were to disanul that Covenant which he had sealed with his bloud: Christ is the object of our Faith and Hope, only as he is our Saviour, and he is our Saviour in no other sense, than as he is our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and he mediates for us as our Priest, that is in vertue of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100660:19"/>
which he hath sealed with his bloud, and therefore we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to expect any thing from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, which is not contained in his Covenant, much less which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts it, for that would be in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>to renounce his Mediation, and to trust to the goodness of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> And let any man judg, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not to set up a new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which hath no Covenant, and no Promise; for whatever we can expect from Christ by vertue of a Promise, is contained in the Gospel, and if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any thing else from him upon his Personal account, it is without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: which at best reduces us to the same state, in which the World was, before God had made an express re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his will, when all their hopes were founded on that natural perswasion they had of the divine Goodness, that Faith, which is the Foundation of <hi>Natural Religion, that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Hebr.</hi> 11. 6. thus these men trust in the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ without any Promise, nay (which makes the case much worse) in contradiction to the terms of that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100660:20"/>
Covenant, which he sealed with his bloud: <hi>they quit his Promise and his Covenant, to rely and rowl upon his Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is so very absurd at first sight, that I know no man will be so sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as to owne it <hi>in so many words,</hi> nor do I charge any man with it; but I say, this is the natural interpretation of trusting in the Person of Christ, in his blood, and merits, and satisfaction, fulness, and alsufficiency, and of rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rowling the Soul on Christ for Salvation, and the like Phrases of a late date, in which some men place the whole mystery of the Gospel; if they understand any thing more by them, than expecting to be saved according to the terms of the Gospel Covenant, that is, by believing and obeying the Gospel of Christ; And certainly they must mean something more than this, or else they raise a great noise and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the World, and confound mens minds with obscure and unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural phrases to no purpose: as will appear more in what follows.</p>

                  <p>THE happiness of Mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the Knowledge and Love of God, who is the greatest and the best Being, and therefore our good God, who is never wanting to his own glory, and the happiness of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hath taken care in all Ages by one means or other to make known himself and his will to the World.</p>
                  <p>In the first Creation of all things he left such visible impresses of his own Divine Wisdom and Power on the works of Nature, and planted in the mind of man such a natural knowledge of himself, that it was as easie to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the first Author of all things, as it is now for a well disposed eye to see the Sun, when it shines; And while man preserved his innocence, God himself did not disdain to converse with him, and to give him very present and sensible demonstrations of his Power and Providence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:100660:21"/>In after Ages as Mankind grew more corrupt, and declined to Idolatry, God afforded good men the frequent apparitions of Angels, who were the great Ministers of his Providence; and to instruct the more degenerate part of Mankind, he raised up some great examples and Preachers of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, such as <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham;</hi> and gave such plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable proofs of his acceptance of these men, as might reasonably incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others to imitate their examples. He translated <hi>Enoch</hi> immediately to Heaven, and preserved <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family in the Ark, when he destroyed the rest of the World by a deluge of Waters, which was a signal warning to that corrupt Generation, while the Ark was preparing and a great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Posterity; he sent <hi>Lot</hi> out of the ruins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and made <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of a great Nation, which was a convincing argument, how dear these good men were to God, and what others might expect from him, who would worship and fear him, as they did.</p>
                  <p>But when the World would not be reformed by these single Examples, God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100660:21"/>
chose the Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be a publick and constant demonstration of his Power and Providence, and care of good men. For when God chose the Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his peculiar people, he did not design to exclude the rest of the World from his care and providence, and all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible means of Salvation, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle argues in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>Is he the God of the Iews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes of the Gentiles also:</hi> which argument, if it have any force in it, must prove Gods respect to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles before the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as well as since, because it is founded on that natural relation God owns to all Mankind, as their merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator and Governour, which gives the Gentiles as well as Jews an intrest in his care and providence. This plainly evinces, that all those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular favours, which God bestowed on <hi>Israel,</hi> were not owing to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fondness and respect to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the design of all was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the whole World to worship the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> who gave so many demonstrations of his power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. For this reason God brought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100660:22"/>
                     <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with great signs and wonders and a mighty hand, (when he could have done it with less noise and observation) that he might the more gloriously triumph over the numerous Gods of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and all their enchantments and divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that he might be honoured on <hi>Pharoah</hi> and all his Host. For this reason he maintained them in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness at the constant expence of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, fought all their Battles for them, and many times by weak and contemptible means overthrew great and puissant Armies, drove out the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and gave them possession of that good land. I say one great and principal design of all this was to convince the World of the Majesty and Power of the God of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that they might renounce their foolish Idolatries and Country Gods, and consent in the worship of that One God, who alone doth wondrous things; this account the Psalmist gives of it; that God wrought such visible and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous deliverances for <hi>Israel,</hi> to make his glory and his power known among the Heathen; <hi>The Lord hath made known his Salvation, his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100660:22"/>
                     <hi>hath he openly shewed in the sight of the Heathen.</hi> Psalm 98. 2. <hi>That the Heathen might fear the name of the Lord, and all the Kings of the Earth his glory, i. e.</hi> that all Nations might wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God, and all Kings submit their Crowns and Scepters to him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 15. that by this means they might be instructed in that important truth, <hi>That the Lord is great and greatly to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that he is to be feared above all Gods; for all the Gods of the Nations are Idols, but he made the Heavens. Psal.</hi> 96. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>And as God set up the people of <hi>Israel</hi> as a visible demonstration to all the World of his power and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, so he committed his Laws and Oracles to them, from whence the rest of the World, when they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, might fetch the best rules of life, and the most certain notices of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will.</p>
                  <p>In such ways God instructed the World in former Ages, by the light of Nature, and the examples of good men, and the Sermons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the publick example of a whole Nation, which God chose for that very purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100660:23"/>But when long and sad experience had proved all these ways ineffectual to reform the World, at last God sent his own Son into the World, to make a full and perfect Declaration of his will, to give the best rules of life, and to encourage our obedience by the most express promises of a blessed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. This was one great design of Christ's appearing in the World, to reveal and declare God to us. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 18. <hi>No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him:</hi> and in Math. 11. 27. <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no man knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father, but the Son, and he, to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Son will reveal him.</hi> That is, God hath now committed unto Christ all the secret purposes of his Counsel concerning the Salvation of Mankind, which were concealed from Ages. None of the Prophets, which lived before, did so fully understand it, nor have we any other certain way of knowing this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the Revelation Christ hath made to us.</p>
                  <p>Thus in <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 6, 7. <hi>Iesus saith</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100660:23"/>
                     <hi>unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me; if you had known me, you should have known my Father also, and henceforth you have known him, and have seen him.</hi> That is, I alone declare the true way to life and happiness, and no man can thoroughly understand the will of God but by learning of me, and therefore whoever knows me, <hi>i. e.</hi> whoever is acquainted with the Doctrine and Religion I preach, knows my Father also, that is, is thoroughly instructed in God's mind and will, as he proves in the following Verses. So that <hi>to know God,</hi> is to understand the will of God concerning the Salvation of Mankind, and <hi>to know Christ,</hi> is to understand that Declaration he hath made of Gods will to the World, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Gospel, which he Preached, which is therefore called, <hi>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Iesus Christ.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. That is, that glorious manifestation God hath made of himself to the World by Christ: for the <hi>face of Christ,</hi> signifies all that, whereby he made himself known, as a man is known by his face, that is, his Laws, and Religion, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100660:24"/>
Miracles, whereby it appeared, that he was the Son of God, the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Saviour of the World; by all this the glory of God was manifested; in which the Apostle alludes to that shining glory, which appeared on the face of <hi>Moses,</hi> when he came down from the Mount; which was but typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of that bright and glorious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation, God would make of himself by Christ. God was seen in Christ, <hi>he that hath seen me hath seen my Father,</hi> that is in plain words, the will of God was fully declared to the World by Christ: upon which account too (as well as with respect to his divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) he is called <hi>the brightness of his Fathers glory, and the express image of his Person. Hebr.</hi> 1. 1. those discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Christ hath made of God, being a bright and glorious reflexion of the Nature and Attributes of God, of his Eternal Wisdom, and truth, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as true a representation of the divine nature and will, as any Picture is of the person it represents. It is plain, that in this sense Christ is called the image of God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the image of God, should shine</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:100660:24"/>
                     <hi>unto them.</hi> Where Christ's being the Image of God comes in very abruptly, unless we understand it in this sense, that he is the Image of God with res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the glorious Revelations of the Gospel, which contain a true and faithful account of God's Nature and Will.</p>
                  <p>The result of all is this, that God is the last and highest object of Religious and saving Knowledge, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the only Knowledge necessary to the purposes of Religion, is such a knowledge of God's Nature and Will, as is sufficient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our actions, and encourage our obedience: and whereas God was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly known by the light of nature, and the works of Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and those partial and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional revelations of his will, which he made to the World; now the only true medium of knowing God is the Knowledge of Christ, who came into the World to declare God to us.</p>
                  <p>He knows God best, who is best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with those Revelations Christ hath made of God's will: <hi>i. e.</hi> who understands the Gospel in its full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and latitude. This is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that expression in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 3.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100660:25"/>
                     <hi>This is life Eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Iesus Christ, whom thou hast sent, i. e.</hi> the only way to Eternal Life is to know the nature and will of God, and the only certain way of attaining to the knowledg of God is by knowing Christ, whom God sent into the World to publish the Everlasting Gospel, who hath made more perfect revelations of Gods will, than ever the World had before, and who alone hath brought life and immortality to light; so that to know Christ is not meerly to know his Person, which we can have no other knowledge of, than what he hath been pleased to reveal to us, but to be acquainted with the whole Doctrine of the Gospel in its native simplicity, as he published it to the World, which I observed before. The Apostle calls this <hi>learning Christ,</hi> and being instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in him, as the truth is in Iesus.</hi> For<note place="margin">See Ch. 1. concerning the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. of the name Christ.</note> when we speak of the Knowledge of Christ, we must consider him as our Prophet, and so to know Christ signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to know his Gospel; and to preach Christ is to preach his Gospel, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound all those rules of life and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, which are contained in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100660:25"/>
it; whether they are concerning the nature of God, or a future State, or his own Nature and Office, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Thus <hi>Philip</hi> preached Christ to the <hi>Samaritanes, Acts</hi> 8. 5. which in <hi>Verse</hi> 12. is called <hi>preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God, and the name of Iesus Christ.</hi> That is the whole Doctrine of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>This should make all considering men ashamed of those unreasonable and groundless clamours, that Christ is not preached, unless he be named in every sentence, whether the argument require it or not; as if <hi>preaching Christ</hi> were to be understood in a literal sense of preaching nothing, but <hi>the name of Christ:</hi> those preach Christ most, who are careful to confirm men in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Gospel, and of that great promise of immortal life, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his Laws, and the true nature and design of his Mediation; for every part of the Gospel is part of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, and his Laws as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal a part as any, because the design of the whole Gospel is to make us obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to these Eternal Rules of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, whereby we are transformed into the nature and Image of God,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100660:26"/>
and qualified for the happiness of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>There is indeed a larger notion of the Knowledge of God and Christ, which includes the vertue and efficacy of this knowledge: for the design of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious knowledge being the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our lives and actions, how true soever our speculations are, the Scripture brands all those as ignorant of God, who do not love, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and obey him: and though we be acquainted with the whole Doctrine of the Gospel, unless we heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and obey all those Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Christ hath made, we know him not: <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>Hereby we know, that we know him, if we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> And <hi>Verse</hi> 4. <hi>He that saith, I know him and keepeth not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> And 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not, whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.</hi> Not but that bad men may have as true a speculative knowledge of the nature and design of the Gospel, as good men have, but the meaning is, that this is a knowledge, which serves no end, which wants life and sense, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100660:26"/>
makes men no better, than if they were perfectly ignorant; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is of no other account with God, than ignorance, unless it be to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their sins, and their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>AFter this plain account wherein the Knowledge of Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, the sum of which is, that to know Christ is to understand his Gospel, which contains all those revelations he made of God's will, it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to examine another notion of the Knowledge of Christ very distinct from this, which contains a greater secret, than at first one would imagine, and that is an <hi>acquaintance with the Person of Christ,</hi> which if we will believe some men, is the only fountain of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge.</p>

those greater, deeper, and more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mysteries of the Gospel, which Christ hath not expresly revealed to us: for so he adds soon after, <hi>that these properties of God</hi> (his pardoning mercy, <hi>&amp;c.) Christ hath revealed in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in that revelation he hath made of God and his will, but the life of this knowledge lies in an acquaintance with his Person, wherein the express image and beams of this glory of his Father doth shine forth:</hi> that is, that these things <hi>are clearly, eminently, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, only to be discovered in Iesus Christ;</hi> as he explains himself. So that it seems, the Gospel of Christ makes a very imperfect and obscure disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the nature, and Attributes, and will of God, and the methods of our recovery; we may thoroughly understand whatever is revealed in the Gospel, and yet not have a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>saving knowledge</hi> of these things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we gain a more intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the <hi>Person of Christ.</hi> This indeed advances the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> very much, but is no great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Gospel, and prophetick office: It sets up a new rule of Faith

                  <p>But to let that pass, I shall begin with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100660:29"/>
the knowledge of God, his nature and properties; and I shall not particularly examine every thing, he says, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally take notice of those peculiar discoveries of the nature of God, which the World was ignorant of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and of which Revelation is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly silent, but are now <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly</hi> learnt from an <hi>Acquaintance with Christ's Person.</hi>

                  <p>The light of nature and the works of Creation and Providence, and those manifold Revelations God hath made of himself to the World, especially that last and most perfect Revelation by <hi>Iesus Christ our Lord;</hi> assure us, that God is infinite in all perfections; that he is so powerful, that he can do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleases; so wise, that he knows how to order every thing for the best; so good, that he desires and designs the happiness of all his Creatures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacity of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; so holy, that he hath a natural love for all good men, and will not fail to reward them; but hates all sin and wickedness, and will as certainly punish all obstinate and incorrigible Sinners; but yet that he is very patient and long-suffering towards the worst

of men, and uses various methods of kindness and severity to reclaim them, and is as ready to pardon them, when they return to their duty, as a kind Father is to receive an humble and penitent Prodigal: These properties of God are plainly revealed in the Scripture without any further acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Person of Christ; And had Christ never appeared in the World, yet we had reason to believe, that God is thus wise, and good, and holy, and merciful, because not only the works of Nature and Providence, but the word of God, assure us, that he is so: the Appearance of Christ did not first discover the nature of God to us, but only gave us a greater expression of God's goodness, than ever we had before: confirms us in the belief of what we had learnt before from nature, and Revelation, just as his Resurrection, which is an ocular demonstration of another life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms us in the belief of that blessed Immortality, he had promised; and yet we could not have learnt this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Person of Christ, had he not told us, for what ends he came into the World, as will appear more anon.</p>

                     <hi>and his pardoning mercy could never have entred into the heart of man but by Christ;</hi> when the experience of the whole World confutes him; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of his new Theories, both Jews and Heathens (who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood nothing at all of what Christ was to do in order to our recovery) did believe God to be gracious and merciful to Sinners, and had reason to do so, because God himself had assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Jews, <hi>that he was a gracious and merciful God, pardoning iniquitiy, transgressions and sins.</hi> And those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural notions the Heathens had of God, and all those discoveries God had made of himself in the works of Creation and Providence, did assure them, that God is very good, and it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to understand what goodness is without pardoning Grace.</p>
                  <p>But yet the truth is, considering what these men mean by the love and pardoning Grace, and Justice, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Long-suffering of God, I must acknowledge, that these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties could never have been discovered but by a too familiar acquaintance
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100660:30"/>
with Christ's Person; for Nature and Revelation say nothing of them;</p>
                  <p>As for Instance, he tells us, that in Christ (that is in his death and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings<note place="margin">Digr. 2. p. 93.</note> for our sins) <hi>God hath manifested the naturalness of this Righteousness (i. e.</hi> vindictive justice in punishing sin) <hi>unto him, in that it was impossible, that it should be diverted from Sinners without the interposing of a propitiation.</hi> That is, that God is so just and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that he cannot pardon sin without satisfaction to his justice: now this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is such a notion of justice, as is perfectly new, which neither Scripture nor nature acquaints us with: for all mankind have accounted it an Act of goodness (without the least suspition of injustice in it) to remit injuries and offences, without exacting any punishment: And that <hi>he</hi> is so far from being just, that he is cruel and savage, who will remit no offence, till he hath satisfied his revenge. That part of justice, which consists in punishing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, was always lookt on as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the exacting or remitting punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was referred to the wisdom of Governours, who might spare, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100660:31"/>
as they saw reason for it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being unjust in either, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had not one who pretends to so great and personal an Acquaintance with Christ said so, I should rather have thought, that God's requiring such a Sacrifice, as the death of Christ, for the expiation of our sins was not, because he could not do otherwise, but because his Infinite Wisdom judged this the best and most effectual way of dispencing his Grace:</p>
                  <p>But though this be a very terrible discovery of the naturalness of Gods righteousness or vindictive justice, yet he makes some amends for it in that comfortable discovery of his patience and long-suffering towards Sinners; for<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 95.</note> now in Christ <hi>the very nature of God is discovered to be love and kindness:</hi> a happy change this from all justice to all love! but how comes this to pass? why the account of that is very plain: because the justice of God hath glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted its self with revenge on sin in the death of Christ, and so hence forward we may be sure he will be very kind, as a revengful man is when his passion is over; for so he speaks very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of God, <hi>whatever discoveries were</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100660:31"/>
                     <hi>made of the Patience and lenity of God unto us, yet if it were not withal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, that the other properties of God, as his Iustice and Revenge for sin, had their actings also assigned them to the full, there could be little consolation ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the former.</hi> That is, he would not believe God himself, though he should make never so many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of being good and gracious to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, unless he were sure, that he had first satisfied his revenge, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is such a Character of the Love and Patience of God, as we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have understood, but from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate acquaintance with the Person of Christ. The sum of which is, that God is all love and Patience, when he hath taken his fill of revenge, as others use to say, <hi>that the Devil is very good, when he is pleased.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however sinners have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to rejoice in it, when they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature and end of God's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and forbearance towards them, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>it is Gods taking a course in his infinite wisdom and goodness, that we should not be destroyed notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ib. p. 97.</note> 
                     <hi>our sins.</hi> That as before the least sin could not escape without a just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100660:32"/>
justice being so natural to God, that he cannot forgive without punishing; so the justice of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now satisfied by the death of Christ, the greatest sins can do us no hurt; but we shall escape with a <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our sins.</hi> This it seems we learn from an acquaintance with the Person of Christ, though his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel instructs us otherwise, that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holiness no man shall see God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Wisdom of God</hi> (which is another property he instanceth in) no doubt, but the Gospel of Christ makes great and glorious discoveries of it, but then this is not very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with those other discoveries of the nature of God: for if justice be so natural to God, that nothing could satisfie him but the death of his own Son, the redemption of the World by Christ may discover his justice, or his goodness, but not his Wisdom; for Wisdom consists in the choice of the best and fittest means to attain an end, when there are more ways, than one of doing it.</p>
                  <p>But it requires no great Wisdom to chuse, when there is but one possible way: and whatever Wisdom there is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100660:32"/>
in Gods redeeming the World by his own Son, the knowledge of it is wholly owing to the Revelations of the Gospel, not to such a fanciful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Christ as these men talk of:</p>
                  <p>Thus you see what excellent disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the Nature of God are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an acquaintance with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ; And the second thing we learn from hence is the knowledge of our selves, and that in respect of Sin, and in respect of Righteousness:</p>
                  <p>As for sin, the Gospel assures us, that God is an irreconcileable Enemy to all wickedness, it being so contrary to his own most holy Nature, that if he have any love for himself, and any esteem and value for his own perfections, and works, he must hate sin, which is so unlike himself, and which destroys the beauty and perfection of his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship. For this end he sent his Son into the World to destroy the works of the Devil, and to reduce Mankind to their obedience, to their great Creator, to restore them to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness and integrity of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and thereby to a state of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God: This was the end of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100660:33"/>
his holy Laws and precious Promises, and exemplary Life, and meritorious Death, and glorious Resurrection, and powerful Intercession for us, to deliver us from the Power and Dominion of Sin, to make us first holy, as God is, and then to receive us into that Blessed place, where God dwells.</p>
                  <p>But now acquaintance with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ makes just such a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of sin, as it did of the natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God's Justice to him; <hi>i. e.</hi> that the desert and demerit of sin is such, that it is impossible to make any atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or satisfaction to the justice and wrath of God, but only by the Death of Christ, otherwise Christ had died in vain: that is, that God could not forgive it without full satisfaction, which nothing but the Death of Christ could make.</p>
                  <p>Thus we learn <hi>our disability to ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 110.</note> 
                     <hi>the mind and will of God in all or any of the obedience he requireth:</hi> that is, that it is impossible for us to do any thing that is good, but we must be acted like Machines by an external force, by the irresistable power of the Grace and Spirit of God; this I am sure is a new discovery; we learn no
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100660:33"/>
such thing from the Gospel, and I do not see, how he proves it from an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Christ.</p>
                  <p>But still there is a more glorious discovery than this behind, and that is, <hi>the glorious end whereunto sin is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ordained</hi> (I suppose he means by God) <hi>is discovered in Christ, viz.</hi> for the <hi>demonstration of Gods vindictive</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 112.</note> 
                     <hi>justice in measuring out to it a meet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward, and for the praise of God's glorious grace in the pardon and forgiveness of it.</hi> That is, it could not be known, how just and severe God is, but by punishing sin, nor how good and gracious God is, but by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning it, and therefore lest his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and mercy should never be known to the World, he appoints and ordains sin to this end, that is Decrees, that men shall sin, that he may make some of them the Vessels of his wrath, and the examples of his fierce vengeance and displeasure, and others the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of his mercy to the praise and glory of his free Grace in Christ: this indeed is such a discovery, as nature and revelation could not make. For nature would teach us, that so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a glorious Being, as God is, needs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100660:34"/>
not sin and misery to recommend his glory and perfections, and that so holy a God, who so perfectly hates every thing, that is wicked; would not truckle and barter with Sin and the Devil for his glory. And that so good a God had much rather be glorious in the happiness, and perfection, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his Creatures, than in their sin and misery: and Revelation tells us the same thing, that as much as sin is for the glory of his vindictive justice, yet God takes no pleasure in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, delights not in the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and live: that is, he had rather there were no occasion for punishing, than be made glorious by such acts of vengeance: and therefore though God be so holy as to punish incorrigible Sinners, and so merciful, as to forgive all true Penitents through our Lord Jesus Christ, yet he did not ordain, and appoint, and decree sin to this end: for vindictive justice and pardoning mercy are but secondary Attributes of the Divine Nature, and therefore God cannot primarily design the glorifying of them; for that cannot be without primarily designing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100660:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the sin and misery of his Creatures, which would be inconsistent with the goodness and holiness of his Nature. Thus Nature and Revelation teaches, though these men pretend to have learn't otherwise from an acquaintance with Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the knowledge of our selves with respect to sin, <hi>which is hid only in the Lord Iesus.</hi> But then we learn what our righteousness is, wherewith we must appear before God from an acquaintance with Christ. We have already learnt, how unable we are to make atonement for our sins, without which they can never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and how unable we are to do any thing that is good: and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can deliver us from the justice and wrath of God, but a full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for our sins, and nothing can give us a title to a reward, but a perfect and unsinning righteousness; what shall we do in this Case? how shall we escape Hell, or get to Heaven, when we can neither expiate for our past sins, nor do any good for the time to come? why here we are relieved again by an acquaintance with Christ: his Death expiates former iniquities, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100660:35"/>
removes the whole guilt of sin: but <hi>this is not enough, that we are not guilty; we must also be actually righteous; not only all sin is to be answered for, but all righteousness is to be fulfilled.</hi> Now this righteousness we find only in Christ, <hi>We are reconciled to God by his Death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 117.</note> 
                     <hi>and saved by his life, that actual obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he yielded to the whole law of God, is that righteousness, whereby we are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> we are innocent by vertue of his Sacrifice and expiation, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with his righteousness.</p>
                  <p>Now this is a mighty comfortable discovery, how we may be righteous without doing any thing that is good, or righteous. And I confess we could never have known this but by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with his Person; for his Gospel makes a different representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; tells us expresly, that he is righteous, who doth righteousness, that without holiness no man shall see God: that the only way to obtain the pardon of our sins is to repent of them, and forsake them; and the only thing that gives a right to the promises of future glory, is to obey the Laws, and imitate the example of our Saviour, and to be transformed into the nature
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100660:35"/>
and likeness of God: and though our obedience be not in every thing exact and perfect, if it be sincere, we shall be accepted for the sake of Christ, and by vertue of that Covenant of Grace, which he hath sealed with his blood, which admits of an Evangelical, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a strict legal perfection: such different discoveries doth an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Gospel, and with the Person of Christ, make.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third part of our Wisdom is to</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Digr. 2. p. 119.</note> 
                     <hi>walk with God,</hi> and to that is required <hi>Agreement, acquaintance, a way, strength, boldness, and aiming at the same end: and all these with the Wisdom of them are hid in the Lord Iesus.</hi> The sum of which in short is this, that Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving expiated our sins, and fulfilled all righteousness for us, though we have no personal righteousness of our own, but are as contrary to God, as dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to light, and death to life, and an universal pollution and defilement to an universal and glorious holiness, and hatred to love; yet the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ is a sufficient, nay the only foundation of our agreement, and upon that, of our walking with God: though St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, <hi>If we say we</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:100660:36"/>
                     <hi>have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness we lye, and do not the truth, but if we walk in the light, as God is in the light, then have we fellowship one with another, and</hi> (then) <hi>the blood of Iesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sins. Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. And our only acquaintance with God and knowledge of him is hid in Christ, which his word and works could not discover, as you heard above. And he is the only way, wherein we must walk with God, and we receive all our strength from him; and he makes us bold and confident too, having removed the guilt of sin, that now we may look Justice in the face, and <hi>whet our Knife at the Counter door,</hi> all our Debts being discharged by Christ, as these bold acquaintance and familiars of Christ use to speak. And in Christ we design the same end that God doth, which is the <hi>advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own glory:</hi> that is, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, by trusting to the expiation and righteousness of Christ for Salvation, without doing any thing our selves, we take care that God shall not be robbed of the glory of his free Grace by a competition of any merits and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts of our own:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:100660:36"/>These are those great <hi>Gospel Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Soul-saving truths,</hi> which are learnt from an acquaintance with Christ's Person, which his Gospel is so silent in, or speaks so darkly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly of, that it was impossible to understand them, without being first acquainted with his Person. And that you may the better understand the whole design and contrivance of it, I shall put every thing into its just and natural order;</p>
                  <p>God then from the beginning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to glorifie his justice, and his mercy, and because there had been no occasion either to punish or pardon, unless man had sinned, he <hi>appointed and ordained sin for the glory of his vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive justice and pardoning Grace:</hi> and accordingly (since nothing can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Decrees and appointments of God) it pleaseth God that Man should sin; but when he hath sinned he is extreamly displeased with it, and now his Justice must be satisfied; for it is impossible for God to forgive the the least sin without a compleat and perfect satisfaction; this falls hard upon those miserable wretches, whose ill fortune it was, without any faults of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100660:37"/>
theirs, to be left out of the Roll of Election, and who have no way to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Divine Justice, but by their Eternal Torments; by this it appears, how rigorously just God is, that he will never pardon the least sin, when he can serve his own glory by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and confusion of Sinners:</p>
                  <p>But this is but one part of the glory of God, to be just in punishing sin, the other is to shew mercy in sparing and rewarding the Sinner; now here was the great difficulty, how God should be just, and merciful too, when Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice requires a full satisfaction, and mercy excludes all desert. For the demerit of sin being infinite, no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can expiate sin, but by enduring infinite, that is endless Torments; and those who must be always miserable, can never be the subjects of God's mercy.</p>
                  <p>To unite these two extreams, and reconcile such contradictions, was a work of infinite Wisdom, as well as goodness; And it was effected thus. God sends his only begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ into the World to fulfil all righteousness in his life, and to make a full satisfaction for sin by his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100660:37"/>
Death. For his blood being of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite value (as being the blood of the Son of God) could expiate an infinite guilt, and so make a compleat satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Justice; which is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the Death of Christ, than by the Eternal miseries of all the Sinners in the World, because it discovers the naturalness of Justice to God (which is the <hi>Position</hi> to be maintain'd) that he could not pardon without full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that is, that he is so just, that he hath not one dram of goodness in him, till his rage and vengeance be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; which is I confess a glorious kind of Justice:</p>
                  <p>But now <hi>the Iustice and vengeance of God having their actings assigned them to the full,</hi> being glutted and satiated with the blood of Christ; God may pardon as many and great sins, as he pleases, without fear of the least im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of injustice: and now a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and more comfortable Scene of mercy begins to appear; now God em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces Sinners, as a kind Father, and accounts them perfectly innocent in vertue of that satisfaction Christ hath made for their sins; but this is not enough, the law of God must be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100660:38"/>
as well as his justice satisfied, we must be righteous, as well as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, otherwise we may escape punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but can expect no reward (though I confess, I should have thought, that Christ had satisfied for sins of omission, together with sins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: and as by his satisfaction for our doing, what we ought not to do, we are reputed by God as having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done any thing amiss, so by his satisfaction for our neglecting what we ought to have done, we might by the same reason be reputed by God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous, to have done all, that we ought, to have kept the whole Law, but it seems this was not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) and therefore as the satisfaction of Christ is imputed to us for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of sins, so the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us to make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous; and this makes the Grace of God perfectly free with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any suspition of merit or desert in us.</p>
                  <p>And now God and Sinners may agree very well and walk comfortably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for though <hi>they</hi> have guilt enough, and <hi>he</hi> Justice enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy a World, yet there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100660:38"/>
since Christ hath satisfied Justice; and though he be infinitely holy and pure, perfect light, and Sinners abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably filthy, yet there is no fear he should loath and abhor them, when they are Cloathed with the white and spotless Robes of Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and they are so well acquainted now with the design of God to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the glory of his free Grace in their Salvation, that they are very secure, that neither their past sins, nor present habitual impurities can do them any hurt: but they <hi>shall be saved with a notwithstanding their sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are those fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, with which these men have blessed the World from a pretended acquaintance with Christ's Person, which are so unlike the <hi>holy Religion of our Saviour,</hi> that for distinction sake, it ought to be called the <hi>Religion of Christ's Person,</hi> in opposition to the Religion of his Gospel.</p>
                  <p>And since we have discovered the Principles of this new Religion of Christ's Person, I cannot forbear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring briefly into the practical infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from it, that we may at once view the grand Mystery of this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100660:39"/>
both in its principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
                  <p>Now the practice of this Religion consists in accepting of Christ, and coming to him, and applying his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and satisfaction, and righteousness to our selves, for pardon and justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in those duties which are consequent upon such an Union and closure with Christ. For Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving satisfied for our sins, and fulfilled the righteousness of the law for us, it is a plain and necessary consequence, that we have nothing to do, but to get an interest in the satisfaction and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ, that they may be imputed to us; for he is very ignorant of Christ, who hopes that any thing else will avail him to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may thus come to Christ and close with him, it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary, that we be sensible of our lost and undone condition out of Christ. How impossible it is for us to atone the wrath of God, or to have any righteousness of our own, which can bear the severe scrutiny of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and in a sence of this we must work our imagination and fancy into great terrours and agonies, and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100660:39"/>
fear of the unsupportable wrath of God, and his natural and inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble justice: this is the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, which we must lie under, before we can attain to the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for we shall never value and prize Christ, and go to him for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till we are convinc't of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of him, and driven to him by the threatnings and terrours of the Law; and the promise of ease and rest, is made only to the weary and heavy laden; and these only shall be satisfied, who hunger and thirst after the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteousness of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And now being thus stung with sin, it is time for us to look up to Christ, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did on the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent, that we may be healed; now we must begin to see his fulness and perfection and suitableness to the wants and necessities of our Souls, that he is our atonement and expiation, our wisdom and righteousness, all that we can desire or need.</p>
                  <p>And if it should so happen, that the sense of our sins and unworthiness makes us afraid to come to Christ, and apply him to our Souls, we must then have recourse to our acquaintance
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100660:40"/>
with the Person of Christ, to answer all our doubts, and quiet our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. As for instance, <hi>Dost thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I am a great Sinner, and will Christ save me?</hi> the Answer is easie, <hi>whom did Christ come to save? whom doth God justifie but the ungodly? did he take our flesh upon him, and not our sins? bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance all things together, your sins and Christs merits together, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your sins should not so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you from coming to Christ, as the greatness of his merits should encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you to come to him. For where sin abounded, Grace did much more abound. Compare your distress and Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion together, your wants and Christ's fulness together, your unworthiness and Christ's freeness together, your desires and Christ's invitations together, your own weakness and Christ's strength together, Satan's objections and Christ's answers together;</hi> and now if Christ do not prevail above all thy fears, thou art not worthy to be acquainted with him.</p>
                  <p>Nay further, <hi>if thou objectest, what</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Shepards sound Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever p. 80.</note> 
                     <hi>have I to do with Christ? why should he have to do with me; who have such an unholy, vile, hard, blind, and most wicked</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:100660:40"/>
                     <hi>heart?</hi> (the objection you see is full and home to the purpose, but mark the answer) <hi>O! for the Lord's sake dishonour not the Grace of Christ, it is true, thou canst not come to Christ, till thou art laden, humble, and separated from thy sins—yet remember for ever, that no more sorrow for sin, no more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from sin, is necessary to thy closing with Christ, than so much, as makes thee willing, or rather not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that the Lord should take it away; and know, if thou seekest for a greater measure of humiliation, antecedent to thy closing with Christ, than this, thou showest the more pride therein, who wilt rather go into thy self to make thy self holy and humble, that thou maist be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Christ, than go out of thy self unto the Lord Iesus to take away thy sin; In a word, who thinkest, Christ cannot love thee, until thou makest thy self fair, and when thou thinkest thy self so (which is pride) wilt thou think otherwise of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the reason of all this is very plain from our acquaintance with Christ; for he is our Physician, and therefore we must not think of healing our selves, but must go to him with all
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100660:41"/>
our Diseases and Sores about us, that he alone may have the honour of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us. He is a Fountain set open for sin and for uncleanness, and therefore we must go to him with all our filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be cleansed and washed, for if we be first clean, there is no need of a Fountain. He is all fulness, and therefore it is not fit we should carry any thing to him, as if he needed any thing from us. He is our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and therefore if we have any, we must leave all our righteousness behind us, when we go to him. He is all beauty and loveliness, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must not carry any beauty to him, but receive it all from him; So that all we have to do in this great work, is to go to Christ weary, and sick, and filthy, and naked, stript of every thing, but our sins and impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to receive ease and health, and fulness, and beauty from him. Christ is the gift of God, and therefore we must only receive him by the hand of Faith, and apply him to our Souls, and then what a blessed change and Metamorphosis is there presently made in us! for though we continue as we were, yet we have all in Christ. We
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100660:41"/>
are now united to him, and made his Members and Spouse, and so have an interest in all his merits and fulness. <note n="*" place="margin">Watson's Christs Loveliness. pag. 462.</note>

                     <hi>Grace of God hath altered him, than of all truths the truths of Christ savour best, those truths that come out of the mouth of Christ, and out of the Ministry concerning Christ, they are most sweet of all.</hi> Such sanctified Souls and Ears loath all dull, insipid, moral discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which are perpetually inculcating their duty on them, and troubling them with a great many rules and directions for a good life; which he is pleas'd to call the <hi>quaint Points of Vertue and Vice;</hi> for this is not to enjoy <hi>Christ in Ordinances,</hi> they go away from such entertainment without having met with the beloved of their Soul, without hearing any news from him, or having the least glympse of his beauty and perfections; which is a plain contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the nature and design of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which are only for our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Communion with Jesus Christ. That is, to unload our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and disburden our sins on him in our Confessions, and to beg of him the imputation of his righteousness to make us lovely, and to put our Souls into some raptures, and amorous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to him, and to hear some good news from him by his Ministers, how
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100660:44"/>
much he loves us, and longs after us, how pittiful he is to us, ready to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look all our miscarriages, and cover all our deformities with his own beauty and loveliness, and to take us to the enjoyment of himself, that where he is, we also may be, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to behold his glory, and solace our selves in his love:</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another consequential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Act is obedience to our spiritual Husband, a duty which few Wives care for, and the truth is, though the Gospel of Christ be very plain and express in exacting this from them, and inculcates it so much, that it savours too strong of a legal spirit and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, yet it is very hard to find a proper place for it in this new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or to deduce it from an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Christs Person.</p>
                  <p>For this is not necessary at all to our coming to Christ, and closing with him, nay it is a great hindrance to it, for we must bring nothing to Christ with us, the marriage is consummated without it, and then we have less need of it than before; for then we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with the beauty of Christ, are holy with his holiness, we are delivered
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100660:44"/>
from the guilt of sin by his expiation, he must look to it to see the debt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, which he hath now taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself, and we are righteous with his righteousness, which gives us an actual right to glory, and we need no righteousness of our own to save us, which were to suppose a defect in the righteousness of Christ; so that, how obedience should come in, is hard to say. It is concluded on all hands by those, who are most intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Person of Christ, that it is but a consequential duty, that which ought to follow our Espousals with Christ, and Justification by him, as a fruit and effect of it; but yet the reason of it is not evident. Some tell us, that it is due upon account of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and thankfulness to our Saviour, which I cannot so well understand, unless our righteousness and obedience be due to Christ in thankfulness to him for saving us without obedience and righteousness, which is just as broad as long, and we get nothing by the bargain. Especially considering that this is hardly reconcileable with that essential condition of accepting Christ, wherein these spiritual Espousals consist.

                  <p>HAving thus shewed you what that Religion is, which these men pretend to learn from an acquaintance with Christ's Person, it is time now to consider this way of Reasoning, and shew you what an unsafe foundation it is to build any Religion on.</p>
                  <p>And first, this is at best to build Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon uncertain conjectures, or ambiguous and doubtful reasons; for suppose men were wary and cautious in drawing conclusions from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, (which few of these men are) yet what assurance can they have, that their inferences are true: Had we seen Christ in the flesh, and been witnesses of the many miracles he wrought, of his Death upon the Cross, and his resurrection from the dead, had he not acquainted us with the end and design of all this, we might have guest, and guest, till we had been weary, but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100660:46"/>
it is great odds we had never guest right, or at best could never have been secure we had.</p>
                  <p>We may understand necessary causes from necessary effects, and necessary effects from necessary causes; if we see a fire we know it burns something, and if we see smoak, we may safely conclude, there is some fire; but where the connexion of the effect with the cause is not necessary, but arbitrary, doth not depend upon the nature of things, but the institution and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of free Agents, we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand no more of the design, than the principal Agent is pleased to tell us. This is the case here: Christs coming into the World, and all that he did and suffered for us, is the pure effect of God's free Grace, and the design of his unsearchable Wisdom and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and therefore none can understand the reason and contrivance of this, but he who lay in the bosom of his Father, and those who learn from him: so that whoever would understand the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of our Saviour must learn it from his Doctrine, not from his Person; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is not a natural and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary connexion between the Person of

Christ, and what he did and suffered, and the Salvation of Mankind: the Incarnation, and Life, and Death, and Resurrection of Christ were available to those ends, for which God designed them, but the vertue and efficacy of them doth depend upon Gods institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and appointment, and therefore can be known only by Revelation.</p>
                  <p>When we are acquainted by Christ, for what end he came into the World, and suffered, and died, and rose again, we may discover the Wisdom and goodness of God in it, in sending us such a Saviour, and qualifying him in so excellent a manner for the work of our Redemption; but we cannot safely draw any one conclusion from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, which his Gospel hath not expresly taught, because we can know no more of the design of it, than what is there revealed.</p>
                  <p>And is it not intolerable presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for men to mould and shape Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion according to their fancies and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and to stuff it with an infinite number of Orthodox propositions, none of which are to be found in express terms in Scripture, but are only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be deduced from thence by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100660:47"/>
such imaginary consequences, from some little hints and appearances of things? Especially, is not this unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable in those men, who cry down reason for such a prophane and carnal thing, as must not presume to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in holy matters, and yet lay the foundation of their Religion, and erect such glorious and magnificent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks, on nothing else but some little shews and appearances of Reason? But the plain truth is this, when men ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the nature of God, and his Works and Providences, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mankind, and those eternal notions of good and evil, and the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential differences of things, that is, when men argue from plain and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Principles, which have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable and unchangeable nature, and so can bear the stress and weight of a just consequence, this is carnal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but when men argue from fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and imaginations, which have no stable nature, from some pretty Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and Similitudes, and Allegories, which have no certain shape, nor form, but what every mans fancy gives them, this is sanctified and spiritual reason, but why I cannot imagine, unless that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100660:48"/>
it so much resembles Ghosts and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, which have nothing solid and substantial in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How dangerous this way of reasoning from an acquaintance with Christ's Person is, appears in this, that it will serve any mans turn, who hath any quickness and vigour of fancy. It is an easie matter at this rate to set up the trade of making new Hypotheses of Religion. I have already given you one draught and Scheme of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from a pretended acquaintance with Christs Person, and it were easie to present you with many more, with as fair colours and pretences, and as exact and regular proportions, and fanciful consequences, and artificial connexions; I need not tell you, what use all our Allegorical Divines would make of this, who have the peculiar knack and gift of adapting every simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and resemblance, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses they please: We know how the Valentinians of old perverted all the passages of our Saviours Life and Death by such fanciful applications to confirm the doctrine of their <hi>Aeones,</hi> and the portentous production of their Gods, and to patronize all their vilest
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100660:48"/>
practices; and if we allow of this way, I know not, why one mans fancy should not be admitted as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But to shew how easily this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Christ's Person may be made to serve different purposes, I shall oppose another Scheme of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is much more plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from an acquaintance with Christs Person, to what these men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance for the great Mystery of the Gospel, and the only spiritual Wisdom; And thus I argue.</p>
                  <p>Since we see the Eternal Son of God leave his Fathers Throne, and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to come into the World in the nature and likeness of a man, we may certainly conclude, that it was upon a design of love and goodness; for had he intended to destroy the World, he would have Cloathed himself with thunder and lightning, he would have appeared like himself with an awful and astonishing Majesty, and with all the terrible solemnities of vengeance and judgment, incircled with Legions of Angels, and with Clouds of smoak and fire: but we now see nothing dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his looks, nor in his Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was made a Man, as we are,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100660:49"/>
which argues a good will and kindness to humane Nature, he had all the sweetness of innocence, and an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging goodness, that we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suspect any ill design under so charming and inviting an appearance, his miracles were great and glorious, but not frightful and astonishing, they surprized with wonder, not with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and fear: his Almighty Power was displayed and manifested in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of love and kindness, in healing the sick, and dispossessing Devils, in feeding the hungry, and raising the dead, not in over-turning Kingdoms and Empires, or bringing fire from Heaven to consume his Enemies. From all this we may safely conclude, that he came upon an Embassy of Peace, to assure the World of Gods good will towards them, and to reconcile the differences between God and Men.</p>
                  <p>And when we consider further, that this Heavenly Embassador and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is no less than the Eternal Son of God, by whom the Worlds were made, we may reasonably conclude, that he came upon no less design, than of universal goodness, for he can have no temptation to partiality, as being
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100660:49"/>
equally concerned in the happiness of all men, and we cannot imagine, why he should lay a narrower design of love in the redemption, than in the Creation of Mankind; that when in the first Creation he designed all men for happiness, in this new and second Creation, he should design, and intend the happiness only of some few, which is to make him less good in redeeming, than in creating Mankind, though Creation cost him no more than the exercise of his power, but redemption the expence of his bloud: no sure, his goodness did not become less infinite and boundless, when he became man; the design of his appearing was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store Mankind to that honour, and happiness, and immortality, they had lost; and to repair the sullied glory of the first Creation by making all things new again.</p>
                  <p>Thus when we consider the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and holiness of his life, that he was a great example of an unaffected piety towards God, and all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of an innocent and useful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with men, we may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conclude, that his great design was to reform the debaucht manners of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100660:50"/>
World, to reduce Mankind to the obedience of God, to teach man how to live as well as talk, and to restore the practice of piety, and justice, of meekness, and humility, and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal good will, which had been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of the World by the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical pretences of a more refined sanctity in washing hands and Dishes, in tithing Mint and Cumming, and such like pieces of legal and Ceremonial Righteousness; But now our Saviour by his example as well as laws, taught us another Lesson, that as we lost our happiness at first by sin, so the way to regain the favour of God, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life, is by the practice of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and universal righteousness. He came to be our example and guide to Heaven as well as our Mediator and Advocate, and therefore we must imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his life, if we would enjoy the benefits of his Death and Intercession; for so holy a Person can never be the Patron of Vice, nor an Advocate for impenitent and incorrigible Sinners.</p>
                  <p>When we remember, that Christ died as a Sacrifice and propitiation for sin, this gives us a great demonstration of Gods good will to us, how ready
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100660:50"/>
he is to pass by all our former sins, in that he hath appointed an atonement for us, and given no less person, than his own Son, for our ransom, which is the greatest assurance God could give us of his readiness to accept of true Penitents, and therefore the most powerful motive and encouragement to return to our duty.</p>
                  <p>And besides this, the death of Christ assures us, what the desert of sin is, and what will be the portion of all impenitent Sinners: for in that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the death of his own Son to be an atonement for sin, he hath plainly declared, that all Sinners deserve to die, and that none shall escape this just Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but those, who are washed and purifyed in the blood of Christ: He will not pardon sin without a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, nor accept of any other atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the death of his Son, and accept of that for none, but those, who believe and obey the Gospel; and if God did not think fit to save true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents without a ransom, where shall the Sinner and ungodly appear. So that though we do not pretend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the strict Philosophy of that atonement made by Christ, yet we may
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100660:51"/>
easily learn all that is useful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for us to know; that Christ's Death and Sacrifice for sin Seals the Covenant of Grace and pardon to all penitent and reformed Sinners, and seals the irrevocable decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation against all others; for that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is sealed with the blood of so great and stupendious a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, must needs be irrevocable and Eternal.</p>
                  <p>In the Resurrection of Christ from the dead, and his Ascension into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we have an ocular demonstration of the rewards of holiness and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that for the innocence and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his life, and the humility and obedience of his Death, he is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to the right hand of God, and cloathed with Majesty and Glory. That Power and Authority, he is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with, secures us of the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his intercession, of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant care and providence over his Church, of the influences of his Grace, and the supply of all our spiritual wants, and of that glory and happiness, to which he will advance us at the last day.</p>
                  <p>All this we learn from an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100660:51"/>
with Christ's Person (as these men call it) and it were easie now to draw the whole plot and design of Christianity, to search into the deep Councils of God, and to discover those principles and motives, he was acted by, and the infinite Wisdom of the contrivance, and the true methods of a Sinners recovery by Christ, and what that homage and worship is, which we owe our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>As to make some short Essay of it. Those natural notions, which we have of God, acquaint us, that he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely good, and the History of the Creation assures us, that God made the World to be an image and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of his own glory and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but especially Man, who was made after the image of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with that Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and all those Principles of Piety and Vertue, which would have made him a living and active image of the Divine perfections. This was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the happiness of his nature to know God, and to be like him, to praise and adore his great Benefactor, and to be inseperably united to him by those natural tyes of love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100660:52"/>
For nothing else can be the happiness of a reasonable Creature, but Conformity to the Divine Nature, which is the pattern and measure of all rational perfections and happiness. And therefore when Mankind apostatized from God, they miserably defeated the end of their Creation, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted those natural Communications of the divine goodness, by making themselves unworthy and uncapable of them: and now we may easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, how much a good God was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and offended with this, not as a haughty and Imperious Prince would be with the miscarriages and rebellion of his Subjects, but as a kind Father is displeased and grieved for the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his Children, for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory and unmanageable temper; not so much as an affront and contempt of his own Authority, but as it is a necessary cause of the ruine and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of his Children, whose happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he so passionately desires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</p>
                  <p>This made the divine goodness so restlesly zealous and concerned for the recovery of Mankind; various ways he attempted in former Ages, but</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:100660:52"/>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Of the Knowledge of Christ, p. 19.</note> with little success, as I observed before: but at last God sent his own Son our Lord Jesus Christ into the World to be the great Shepherd and Bishop of Souls, to seek and to save that which was lost.</p>
                  <p>And that we may be able in some measure to comprehend the infinite Wisdom and goodness of this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and how well the means is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the end, we must consider that the whole Mystery of the recovery of mankind consists only in repairing the Divine Image, which was defaced by sin; that is in making all men truly good and vertuous. Sin is our apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from God, and doth as naturally make us miserable, as it makes us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the most happy Being. But holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness restores us to our Primitive State, to the perfect constitution of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and makes us good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happy, as God is.</p>
                  <p>And this was the great difficulty to perswade men to be good, to work upon the different tempers, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and passions, of mankind, and to reduce them to the forsaken and untrodden paths of vertue: and though the laws and precepts, the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100660:53"/>
and threatnings of the Gospel confirmed by so many stupendious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and by the resurrection of Christ from the Dead, have in themselves a mighty power to reform the World, yet the consideration of Christ's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of what he did, and suffered for us gives a peculiar force and energy to them.</p>
                  <p>Sin and guilt makes men fearful, and it makes them disingenuous, they are apt to distrust goodness or to abuse it: will either believe God implacable, which makes them desperate, because there is no hope of pardon; or believe him to be fond and indulgent, which makes them saucy and presumptuous; and to prevent both these extreams of superstition, which are such profest Enemies to a sincere and unaffected Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, God sent his own Son into the World, and by the greatness of his Person, and the manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his appearance, did confute them both.</p>
                  <p>If guilt make us afraid of God as an angry and severe judge, behold here the distance taken in the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of God, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to come down to us cloathed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100660:53"/>
with our nature, as a mild and a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Prince, by all the methods of love and sweetness to reduce us to our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and subjection to God; in him we see the good will of God to Sinners, here is a demonstration of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending goodness, which stooped as low as earth, and did not disdain the nature and appearance of a man, nor the Conversation of Sinners, nor the shame of the Cross, nor the pale ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and agonies of Death and the Grave.</p>
                  <p>And to remove all possible suspition concerning Gods love to Sinners, the Son of God dies as a Sacrifice for our sins, to make atonement for us, and with his blood Seals the Covenant of Grace and Pardon, and all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Eternal life. And still to give us the greater security of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all this, our dying and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Lord is raised again from the dead, and advanced to the right hand of power and Majesty to intercede for us.</p>
                  <p>Thus God deals with us after the manner of men, and to encourage us to return to our duty, hath given us all the security of our acceptance, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100660:54"/>
guilt it self (though infinitely jealous and suspicious) could desire: for what could we wish for more, than that God should send so great and so beloved a Person to us on an Embassy of Peace, than that the Son of God should be our propitiation and Advocate, our Lord and Judge, he who took our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and our infirmities on him, who knows our weakness and our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who died to expiate our sins, and is entred into the Holy of Holies to intercede for us in the vertue of his blood, and in the power of his glory, and the triumphs of his Conquests, and with a tender and compassionate sense of our infirmities.</p>
                  <p>But then on the other hand to cure our presumption, that we may not think God to be so easie, as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to Sinners, and to their vices together; the death of Christ upon the Cross assures us, what the merit is, and what the portion of sin shall be; that all Sinners deserve to die, and shall certainly have their deserts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a sincere repentance and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their lives; for to expiate sin by death can signifie no less than this, that death is the proper recompence of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100660:54"/>
sin, and therefore that those sins which are not expiated by the Sacrifice of Christ (as none are, till we repent and reform) shall certainly be expiated by the Death of the Sinner. Especially considering how holy our Priest and Sacrifice was, we cannot reasonably conceive, that he died, or that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for incorrigible Sinners. The Sacrifice of his Death extends no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the example of his life, <hi>he was made manifest to destroy sin, and in him was no sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now though I dare not be so bold as to say, what infinite Wisdom can do, yet it is not imaginable, how God could have contrived a more effectual way to reform the World, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains so many powerful obligations, such forceable endearments, such ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing charms; which makes such a pleasant and inviting representation of God to the World, which so confirms our Faith, and encourages our hopes, and enflames our love, and awakens our fears, and excites our emulation, which doth even affect our senses with the arguments of Religion, and storm the lower and more bruitish faculties of our Souls, and captivate them to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100660:55"/>
the love and obedience of Christ.</p>
                  <p>From hence it is easie to understand, what is the true method of a Sinners recovery by Christ, and what returns of love and gratitude we owe our Lord and Saviour. When we are so affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the powerful arguments to a new life, which are contained in his Incarnation, and life, and doctrine, and example, and miracles, and death, and resurrection, and Ascension into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and his Intercession for us, as to be sensible of the shame and folly of sin, and to be reconciled to the love and practice of true piety and holiness, then we partake in the merits of his Sacrifice, and find the benefit of his Intercession, and have a title to all the blessings, and promises of his Gospel: this was the design of Christ's coming into the World not to distract our guilty minds with the terrours of the Law, and the inexorable justice of God, not to bring us under a Legal dispensation of fear and bondage, but to encourage us to forsake our sins, and reform our lives, by all the endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of love and goodness, and the lively hopes of a blessed Immortality, mixt with an awful regard and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100660:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for God, who is a holy and righteous Judge, and an irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Enemy to all sin. This is such a method of converting Sinners, as is proper to the Person of Christ, and the manner of his appearance, which was not designed to cause tempests and Earthquakes in our minds, like the Thunder and Lightning from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but to work a reformation in the World by more silent and gentle methods, and in more humane ways. If our Faith in Christ have reformed our lives, and rectified the temper and disposition of our minds, and made us sincere Lovers of God and goodness.</p>
                  <p>Though we are not acquainted with these artificial methods of repentance, have not felt the workings of the Law, nor the amazing terrours of Gods wrath, nor the raging despair of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spirits, and then all on a sudden (as if we had never heard of any such thing before) have had Christ offered to us to be our Saviour, and heard the woings and beseechings of Christ to accept of him, and upon this have made a formal contract and espousal with Christ, and such like working of a heated fancy, and religious distraction,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100660:56"/>
though our conversion be not managed with so much art and method, and by so many steps and gradations, we are never the worse Christians for want of it. For indeed this must needs be the effect of ignorance, not of an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Christ, which suggests so many encouraging considerations to return to God, as to a merciful and compassionate Father, and not to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at his presence, as a severe and inexorable judge.</p>
                  <p>And hence we learn, that the truest expression of love to our Saviour, is not some fond and amorous passions, but obedience to his Laws, and the greatest honour we can do him, is to imitate his example, and to express the power of his death and resurrection in the exemplary holiness of our lives; for this best answers the end of his coming into the World, is the fruit of his intercession for us, and the greatest glory and ornament of his spiritual Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you a brief Scheme and Hypothesis of Religion from an acquaintance with Christs Person; and if they will owne this a safe way, to build Religion on an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100660:56"/>
with Christs Person, they must owne, what I have now discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which is much more agreeable to the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> and the design of his appearing, and more easily and naturally deduced from it, than their own wild and fantastical conceits. If they do not like this, I must advise them to quit this way, as the which will serve others as well as themselves, and let us all fetch our Religion from the plain Doctrines and Precepts of the Gospel of Christ, not from any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Personal Acquaintance with him.</p>

                  <p>THere is a very obvious objection against this whole discourse, the answering of which will further discover the ill consequences of frame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such fanciful <hi>Idaeas</hi> of Religion from an acquaintance with Christ's Person; And that is this, that though these men deduce their Religion from an acquaintance with Christ, yet there are no men, that so abound in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proofs to confirm what they say, and therefore they do not lay the Foundation of their Religion on such uncertain conjectures; and the truth is, if you consult these mens Writings, you shall find their Books stuffed with Scripture, or if you talk with them, their whole discourse is little else, but Scripture phrase: but that <hi>Reverend Doctor</hi> confessed the plain truth, that their Religion is wholly owing to <hi>an acquaintance with the Person of Christ,</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:100660:57"/>
and could never have been <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>savingly</hi> learn't from his <hi>Gospel,</hi> had they not first grown acquainted with his <hi>Person.</hi> And then it is no wonder, if they can accommodate Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions to their own dreams and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. For when mens fancies are so pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest with Schemes and <hi>Idaeas</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whatever they look on appears of the same shape and colour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their minds are already tinctured, like a man sick of the Jaundies, or that looks through a painted Glass, who seeth every thing of the same colour, that his eye or Glass gives it: all the Metaphors, and Similitudes, and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories of Scripture are easily applyed to their purpose; and if any word sound like the tinkling of their own san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, It is no less than a demonstration, that that is the meaning of the Spirit of God, and every little shadow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance doth mightily confirm them in their pre-conceived opinions.

contrived sigment of their own brain: and thus the minds of men are abused with words and phrases, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is prest to serve every new-fang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led conceit in Religion.</p>
                  <p>The wildest and most extravagant opinions that were ever yet vented under the name of Religion, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the authority of Scripture for their Patronage; though any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced man would wonder, how the reading such places of Scripture should suggest such notions to them: but this is no wonder, when we consider that men first contrive their Religion (as these <hi>acquaintances</hi> of Christ do) and possess their Fancies throughly with their private opinions, and then read the Scripture with no other design, than to find something there to stamp Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity on their own conceits. For it is easie to pervert the plainest sense, and by the help of a strong imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make any thing of any thing; such men dote upon words and phrases, metaphors, and allusions, as best fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their purpose, they found their Religion on obscure Texts, or Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal interpretations of plain Texts, and by the help of some arbitrary distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100660:58"/>
and limitations, glosses, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrases, by curtailing of Texts, or transplacing words and comma's, or separating a single sentence from the body of the discourse, make the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speak their sense as plainly, as the Bells ring, what every boy will have them. Which is to deal with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> observes) as if a man should take a Picture of the <hi>King</hi> which consisted of an artificial composition of precious stones, and transplace all these stones into another form, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of an Ape, and then should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade silly people, that that was the Kings Picture: At this rate we may find the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the Bible, as well as make so many Books so different, and contrary to each other, from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous compasition of twenty four Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This is plain and evident at the first proposal to any intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but to put it out of all doubt, I shall give you some Instances of it, and show you how these <hi>familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of Christ</hi> (and who may better make bold with him than they) take the liberty to pervert his Gospel to serve their opinion.</p>
                  <p>There are two ways of expounding
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100660:59"/>
Scripture in great vogue among them. First, by the sound and clink of words and phrases, which is all some men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by <hi>keeping a form of sound words.</hi> Secondly, when this will not do, they reason about the sense of Scripture from their own pre-concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved notions, and opinions, and prove that this must be the meaning of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because otherwise it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable to their dreams, which is called expounding Scripture by the <hi>Analogy of Faith:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, they expound Scripture by the sound of words and phrases, that is, if they can find any words in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which chime to the tune of their private conceits, without ever consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the use of the words in those places where they are found, they clap their own sense on them, and then they serve for very solid and substantial proofs. I shall give you several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this way.</p>
                  <p>Thus when men are possest with the fancy of <hi>an acquaintance with Christs</hi> Person, then to <hi>know Christ</hi> can signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing else, but to know his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and all his personal excellencies and beauties, fulness and preciousness,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100660:59"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when Christ is said to <hi>be made Wisdom to us,</hi> this is a plain proof, that we must learn all our spiritual Wisdom from an acquaintance with his Person. Though some duller men can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand no more by it, than the Wisdom of those Revelations Christ hath made of Gods will to the World.</p>
                  <p>Thus when men have first learn't from an acquaintance with Christ to place all their hopes of Salvation in a <hi>Personal Union</hi> with Christ, from whom they receive the free Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Pardon and Grace, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Salvation, what more plain proof can any man who is resolved to believe this, desire of it, than first <hi>Ep. Iohn</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi> For what can <hi>having the Son</hi> signifie, but having an Interest in him, being made one with him; though some will be so perverse as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, of believing and obeying his Gospel; but the phrase of <hi>Having the Son</hi> confutes that dull and moral inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, especially when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it is called being <hi>In Christ</hi> and <hi>abiding in him,</hi> which must signifie a very near Union between Christs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100660:60"/>
and us, such as there is between two things, which are within one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which makes all Christ ours, and us Christs.</p>
                  <p>Now it is self evident, that before we can thus be united to Christ, we must go to him, and therefore <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the Instrument of this Union, is very luckily called <hi>coming to Christ:</hi> from whence it is very evident, that to believe in Christ is to go to him for Salvation, which Metaphors of coming and going are a very intelligible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of believing. But when the Soul is come to Christ, is this enough? no surely, the Soul then must <hi>receive Christ,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, <hi>to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God. Iohn</hi> 1. 12. That Faith, which serves us for legs to go to Christ, must be a hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and to apply all his merits and fulness and righteousness to our Souls; and now when we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, we must embrace him in our arms too, <hi>as good old</hi> Simeon <hi>did, when he found him in the Temple,</hi> which is a little nearer Union; as plainly appears from the example of the <hi>Patriarchs, who saw the promises afar of, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:100660:60"/>
                     <hi>them. Hebr.</hi> 11. 13. and now we have Christ, we must <hi>trust, and lean upon him,</hi> as we are often commanded, <hi>to trust in God, which signifies that Act of Faith, whereby finding and feeling our own weakness, as unable to support our selves, we do lean and rest on Christ,</hi> and if leaning be not enough, we may make a little more bold, <hi>and rowl on him, as appears from Psalne</hi> 37. 5. <hi>rowl thy ways on the Lord, as the Original</hi> Gal <hi>signifies, which is that Act of Faith, whereby we being laden with sin, and seeking ease, we at last discharge our Load, and cast it on Christ.</hi> And this is plain from the phrase of believing <hi>In</hi> Christ, and <hi>On</hi> Him. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 6. for what can that signifie, but leaning and rowling on Him, <hi>laying and building our selves on him, as on a Foundation.</hi> And now we have thus brought our Souls to Christ, we must commit them to his trust to take charge of them, and save them, and if they perish, it will be his fault, and he must give account of it. Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perswaded, that he is able to keep that, which I have committed to him against that day.</hi> And now we must hide our
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100660:61"/>
selves in Christ from the fierce wrath and displeasure of God, <hi>as the Dove hides in the Rocks,</hi> Cant. 2. 14. <hi>O my</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Watson's Christs Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> 
                     <hi>Dove in the Clefts of the Rocks. Christ's wounds are the clefts of the rocks, where this believing Soul, Christs Dove, hides it self.</hi> And besides this, <hi>a Rock is a Screne to shade off the heat, so Christ is called Isai.</hi> 32. 2. <hi>a shadow from the heat; he shades a poor Sinner from the scorchings of Gods wrath.</hi> And then, <hi>We must fetch comfort too from Christ, as honey came out of the Rock, Deut.</hi> 32. 13. <hi>he made him suck honey out of the Rock, and oyl out of the stinty Rock, the honey of the Promise, and the oyl of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness comes out of this blessed Rock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>But this is not enough yet; for we must <hi>be cloathed with the Righteousness</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Idem.</note> 
                     <hi>of Christ, as appears from that expression that we must put-on Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rom.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. which can signifie nothing else, but putting on Jesus Christ, that is his righteousness, as men put on a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to cover their nakedness, and to adorn them. <hi>And therefore Christ is resembled to a beautiful Robe.</hi> Isai. 61. 10. <hi>He hath covered me with the Robe</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Watson Ibidem.</note> 
                     <hi>of Righteousness: His righteousness is a lovely Robe, no Robe of Gold or Ermin,</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:100660:61"/>
                     <hi>wherewith Kings are invested, is so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable as this. In this Robe we shine as Angels in Gods Eye; The High Priests glorious Vestments,</hi> Exod. 28. 2. <hi>The Mytre, the Robe, the Ephod of gold, and the Breast plate of precious stones, did all but serve to set out the beautiful Robes of Christs righteousness, wherewith a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is adorned:</hi> thus if we would get the blessing, we must go to God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did in the Robes of our Elder Brother, though I confess, this resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance doth not very well please me; for though <hi>Iacob</hi> was a good man, yet this looks like a cunning trick, to rob his elder Brother of the blessing, and to cheat his blind Father, and men must not think that God is thus to be impos'd upon. But however that be, this is plain, that when we are thus united to Christ, and made one with him, then <hi>all Christ is ours,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us, <hi>All is yours, and you are Christs, and Christ is Gods:</hi> The merit of his Death is ours to free us from the guilt and punishment of our sins, and his Active obedience to the will of God, his Righteousness is ours for our justification, as is plain, in that he is called the <hi>Lord our Righteousness,</hi> and is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100660:62"/>
said <hi>to be made unto us of God Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> And as <hi>I. O.</hi> well observes, we are reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, and saved by his life, that is by the <hi>Righteousness of his life,</hi> which is made ours. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. And now what better proof can you desire for all this, if you will be contented with express words. Though I am very much of the Doctors mind, that we could never have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered these mysteries clearly and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, had it not been for an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Christs Person. No man would ever have dream't of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of Scripture, who had not been prepossest with the mysterious notion of a fanciful Union to Christ, and application of Christ to us: for here is no other proof of this, but words and phrases, separated from the body of the Text, and the design of the discourse, and like straglers pickt up, and listed into the service of their Hypothesis.</p>
                  <p>For indeed the whole mystery of this, and a great deal more stuff of this nature, consists in wresting metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, and allusive expressions to a proper sense. When the Scripture describes the profession of Christianity, a sincere belief and obedience to the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100660:62"/>
Gospel, by having Christ, and being <hi>in</hi> Christ, and coming to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him, these men expound these phrases to a proper and natural sense, to signifie, I know not what unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Union, and spiritual progress and closure of the Soul with him; An Union of Persons, instead of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in faith and manners. As will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thus when they talk of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual impotency, and inability to do any good thing (for after all the noise they make about our coming to Christ, they mean being carryed thither with an Omnipotent and irresistible power) they prove it wonderfully from <hi>our</hi>

                     <hi>being dead in trespasses and sins,</hi> and therefore as a dead man can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute nothing to his own Resurrection, no more can we towards our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: which is true of natural Death, but will be hard to prove of a moral Death, which consists in the prevalency of vicious habits contracted by long custom (which was the case of the Heathens, whom the Apostle there speaks of) which do so enslave the will, that it is very difficult, though not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, for such persons to return to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100660:63"/>
the love and practice of vertue: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument of the like nature is, that we are said to be <hi>created to good works,</hi> and to <hi>become new Creatures,</hi> and therefore can contribute no more to it, than we did to our first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that we are <hi>born again,</hi> which signifies, that we are wholly passive in it: which were true indeed, if our <hi>being created</hi> to good works did signifie the manner and method of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and not the nature of the new Creature, which is the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; that as in the first Creation we were created after the image of God, so we are renewed after his<note place="margin">1</note> image in the second; which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expresly called in other places the renewing and renovation of our minds.</p>
                  <p>When this way fails, they take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther course with metaphors, and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes to make them serve their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and that is, by considering all the properties and qualifications of those things Christ is compared to, and applying all, that will serve their turn, to Christ, without any regard to the end, for which they are used.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100660:63"/>
is the Gospel, is compared to a pearl of great price. <hi>Mathew</hi> 13. 46. This Pearl in some mens Divinity signifies Christ, and the excellency of Christ appears plainly in this comparison. <hi>For</hi>

                     <hi>other Pearls add no real worth to them, that wear them, but Christ this Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pearl doth, he makes us worthy with his worthiness.</hi> Excellently turned to serve their purpose; though all that the Parable means is, that we should be as ready to part with all for the belief and profession of the Gospel, as other men are, to sell all they have to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase a pearl of great value.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus Christ was prefigured by</hi> Mannah,<note place="margin">Idem. Christs Loveliness.</note> 
                     <hi>and this</hi> Mannah <hi>was of a circular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and this Circle was a figure of Christs perfection; this was meat cooked and drest in Heaven, God himself prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, and then served it in, thus Iesus Christ was prepared and set apart of his Father to the blessed work of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And</hi> Mannah <hi>suited it self to every ones Palate, thus Iesus Christ suits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to every Christians condition; he is full of quickning, strengthening, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue.</hi> That is, he is what every man fancies him to be, relishes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the gusto of their own palates:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100660:64"/>
what precious discoveries are here of Christ! and what irrefragable proofs for them! Thus to proceed, Christ was resembled to a Rock, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3.<note place="margin">Watson. ibidem.</note> 
                     <hi>That Rock was Christ. And then he is a Rock for defence, and a Rock for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and a Rock for Comfort to screne us from the wrath of God, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the honey of the promises.</hi> Christ is resembled by the brazen Serpent: <hi>now</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Watson's true brazen Serpent.</note> 
                     <hi>brass being an inferiour metal signifies the meanness of his humanity, and it being a firm solid metal, it signifies the power of his Godhead, and though it shines, it doth not dazle the eyes, and so signifies the glory of the Godhead vailed with the Manhood:</hi> thus the <hi>bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent was made like a Serpent, but was no real Serpent, so Christ was made in the likeness of sinful flesh, but was no Sinner. The Serpent was lift up, so Christ was lift up in the acclamations of Angels, in the preaching of the Gospel, and upon the Cross, which the Pole was a Type of, and in our hearts by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating, admiring, loving him. And the Serpent was lift up to be lookt upon by the stung Israelites, which looking implyed a secret hope, they had of Cure, so if we do but look on Christ fiducially,</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:100660:64"/>
                     <hi>we shall be cured of our sins.</hi> Never was there so happy a man in expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Types; never was any brazen Serpent half so subtil.</p>
                  <p>Thus as the same Author tells us, <hi>Christ is compared to a</hi> Vine, <hi>and that upon several accounts. The Vine of its self is weak, and must be supported and born up, so the Humane Nature of Christ</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Watson's Spiritual Vine.</note> (which it seems is represented by the Vine) <hi>was of it self weak, and was fain to be supported, and underpropt by the Divine Nature. The Vine grows in the Garden, not in the Forest, thus Christ grows in the Garden of the Church, he is not known among the Heathen:</hi> but I should have thought it more grand to have said, that Christ this Spiritual Vine doth not find, but make a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where ever he grows, since the Church owes its Being to him, not he to the Church; thus <hi>the Vine commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates to the branches, and Christ shoots up his sap of grace into Believers, who are the branches of this Vine: And the Vine hath rare, delicious, fruit growing on it, and thus the promises are the Clusters of Grapes growing upon Christ the true Vine. And whereas other Vines bear but one sort of fruit, this spiritual</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:100660:65"/>
                     <hi>Vine bears many, the fruit of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the fruit of sanctification, and the fruit of consolation. And the blood of Christ is the Wine of this Spiritual Vine, which chears the heart of man, as other Wine doth,</hi> as he excellently proves from an old Latin Catch, <hi>Curam me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum<expan>
                           <am>

                        </expan> juvat dulci lydo solvere,</hi> that is let us drink away care, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and now what fine work might a prophane wit make with Scripture at this rate of expounding metaphors.</p>
                  <p>But still they have a fetch beyond all this, which consists in jumbling me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, and Allegories, and Types, and Figures, altogether, and proving one thing from another in a most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner.</p>
                  <p>As suppose a man would prove, that Christ is infinitely beautiful and lovely, this is a most easie thing to do, if you take the right method: for first, <hi>he is</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Watsons Christs Loveliness.</note> 
                     <hi>Lovely in his Titles, he is the desire of all Nations, the Prince of Peace, the holy one of</hi> Israel, <hi>Elect and precious, these are most lovely Titles, which argue him to be very beautiful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then he is lovely in his Types too: <hi>he was typified by Persons most lovely: by</hi> Moses, <hi>and</hi> David, <hi>and</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100660:65"/>
who were all lovely for one thing or other, either upon account of Natural beauty, or education, or office, or those great things done by them. But then he was typified by lovely things; As by the <hi>Pillar of Cloud and Fire, which was most lovely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; by the</hi> Mannah, <hi>which was very lovely too, because it was of a circular figure, and extraordinary meat, and sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to every ones Palate;</hi> and by <hi>the mercy seat, and brazen Serpent, and Noahs Ark.</hi> Who can forbear being smitten with so <hi>lovely</hi> a Person? <hi>Lovely as a Pillar of Cloud and fire, lovely as Noahs Ark, lovely</hi> as any <hi>Serpent,</hi> yea as <hi>a brazen Serpent?</hi> But besides all these, <hi>Christ is resembled to a Rose, the Rose of</hi> Sharon, <hi>the Queen of flowers, and how lovely is this Rose. To a Vine, the noblest of Plants, and oh what lovely Clusters grow upon this Vine! To a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner stone, and oh how lovely and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is this Stone! to a Rock, and a River in a dry ground, and a rich treasure, and a beautiful Robe, and all these are lovely,</hi> (and so should any thing have been, that had come in his way at that time) and who can doubt after all this, <hi>but that Christ is the chiefest of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:100660:66"/>
                     <hi>yea that he is altogether lovely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus if I had a mind to imitate these men, and prove that Christ is very powerful, as well as lovely, most of the same types and resemblances, would serve the turn. For he was prefigured by <hi>Moses,</hi> who did wonders in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> He was typified by <hi>David;</hi> who killed <hi>Goliah;</hi> by <hi>Solomon;</hi> who was the most powerful Prince in his days; by the Pillar of Cloud and Fire, out of which God thundred upon the Host of <hi>Pharoah;</hi> By the brazen Serpent, which had power to Cure the stung <hi>Israelites;</hi> by <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, which was certainly very strong, that it could resist all the force and power of the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge; He is resembled to a Corner stone, which supports the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to a Rock which is for offence, and defence, to a rich treasure, and riches all men know, are the Nerves and Sinews of Power, and he is most beautiful, and beauty is stronger than all the rest, and Conquers more than Sword or Fire.</p>
                  <p>Thus Christ is very rich; for he is rich in Wisdom, and rich in beauty, and rich in strength, and power, rich in his Godhead, and rich in his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;

and then do but add Husband to all this, and he is a rich and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and a beautiful Husband: thus Christ is Lovely, because he is rich and powerful, and he is powerful, because he is rich and lovely, and Rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is powerful and lovely: and how is it possible these men should want proofs for any thing. And is there any need now to prove, that all this is the work of fancy and imagination, that it is nothing but phrase, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious tattle, the fruit of precarious <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> and of a pretended ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Christs Person; for at this Rate it were easie to make any thing of any thing, to find out some pretty words, and phrases, and allusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, types, or Metaphors, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance all the feats of Enthusiasm, and the more godly Romances of Popish Legends. He who would be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Reader of Books, who hath no mind to turn every thing into Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque, ought carefully to distinguish between proper, and allusive, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical expressions, to consider the use of words and phrases, and the great variety of Dialects, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Moods of speaking in every lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100660:67"/>
and in every age, and to urge Metaphors no further than their first intention, without which we may deal by all Authors, as these men deal by the Scripture, make them speak non-sence, or (as they use to call them) venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mysteries, and overthrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict their own design: And this is their first way of expounding, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called adulterating and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture, by the sound of words.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When this will not do, then they argue and reason about the sense of Scripture from their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived notions and opinions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, pretend to prove their own Scheme and fancies of Religion from the Scripture, but in truth prove the sense of the Scripture by its agreement with their own opinions; which is such a trick, as the Papists have got, to prove the Authority of the Church from the Scripture, and the Scripture from the Church. I might give Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this in abundance, but I shall mention only some few, lest I tire my self, and my Reader.</p>
                  <p>Thus after all their talk of being justified by the imputation of Christs Righteousness, there are a great many
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100660:67"/>
places of Scripture, which expresly tell us, <hi>that we are justified by Faith, have Remission of sins by Faith, have peace with God by Faith, are sanctified by Faith, are the Sons of God by Faith, have Eternal Life, and are saved by Faith:</hi> now how do you think shall all these Scriptures be reconciled to their notion of being justified by the imputation of Christs Righteousness: for Faith certainly is not the Righteousness of Christ in their notion of it: why this is plain at first sight to these <hi>acquaintances</hi> of Christ. <hi>For when Faith is said to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, and save, &amp;c. we must not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this absolutely, that is, we must not understand this of Faith, considered as Faith, but we must understand it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that Faith justifies, as it brings us to Christ, and makes us one with him, by whom we are justified: Faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the Righteousness of Christ, and the Righteousness of Christ justifies:</hi> now this distinction is plainly owing to their preconceived opinions, without which no man could ever have stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on't: that when the Scripture saith, that Faith justifies, the meaning should be, that it justifies and saves instrumentally and relatively (words
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100660:68"/>
which the Scriptures are unacquainted with) that is, not as it is Faith, but as it apprehends the Righteousness of Christ; which in plain words signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that Faith does not justifie; though the Scripture so often says it does.</p>
                  <p>But now the Reason of this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is very plain; for should Faith justifie, as our own Act, (that is, as Faith) it would be as bad as good works, and as perfectly irreconcileable with the free Grace of God: <hi>For had justification been promised to any thing wrought in us, or done by us, it had been of desert, not of Grace, of wages, not of mercy: if God had promised ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification upon any work of ours, had said, we must bring so much humiliation, so much repentance, so much breaking of Spirit, so much Grace, so many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Alms-deeds,</hi> (or so much Faith, as our own Act) <hi>and then we should be justified, it would not have been of Grace,</hi> not of free mercy: though modest men, who are not so apt to dream of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by every thing they do, would have thought, that free Grace and Faith might have been easily reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, though Faith had justified, as our own Act, since the reward and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100660:68"/>
does so infinitly exceed the work that there can be no suspition of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and where there is no merit, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is of Grace, and not of debt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the condition of the promise be.</p>
                  <p>But this is past all doubt, when it is confirmed by a metaphor or two, of which there is great variety, some more apt than others: as for Instance: <hi>the vertue is not in Faith but in Christ,</hi> as appears in this, <hi>a Ring, which hath</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Watson Mystery the Lora Supper, p. 64.</note> 
                     <hi>a precious stone in it, which will staunch blood, we say the Ring stauncheth blood, but the vertue doth not barely lye in the Ring, but in the stone in the Ring: so Faith is the Ring, Christ the precious stone, all that Faith does, is to bring home Christs merits to the Soul, and so it justifies:</hi> so that if you can but find out an improper and absurd form of speech in use among the vulgar, or if you can but invent one, as this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman does, for I never met with this before; it is a sufficient reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Scripture, as improperly as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men talk, or think; or if you can but fancy Faith a Ring, and Christ a precious Stone, it is enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all those places of Scripture, which speak of that legal and meritorious way
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100660:69"/>
of justification by Faith: And thus Faith justifies, as it is a receptive Grace: it is the receiving the Gold, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches, so Faith receiving of Christs merits, and filling the Soul with all the fulness of God, must needs be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching Grace: <hi>In the body there are</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Idem. p. 65.</note> 
                     <hi>Veins, that suck the nourishment that comes into the Stomach, and turns it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blood and Spirits; Faith is such a sucking Vein, that draws vertue from Christ, and therefore is called a precious Faith:</hi> Is not this very plain now to him, who understands the nature of our Union to Christ, which is like that of the Members of a natural body, and that we are saved by Christ, just as the body is nourished by the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>And now to make all clear, we may give a Philosophical account, why God chose Faith to be the Instrument of our Justification; <hi>because it is a humble</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                     <hi>Grace, and gives the glory of all to free Grace. If repentance should fetch justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from Christ, a man would be ready to say, this was for my tears</hi> (strange deserving Creatures these, who can dream of meriting Heaven with a few tears) <hi>but Faith is humble, it is an empty hand, and what merit can</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:100660:69"/>
                     <hi>there be in that? doth a poor mans reaching out his hand, merit an Alms?</hi> (yes just as much as a few tears merit Heaven) <hi>Faith is only a golden Bucket, that draws Water out of the well of life;</hi> But why may not those, who are so apt to be conceited of merit, grow as proud, that they have a <hi>golden Bucket,</hi> as if the whole Well were their own.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see, how these men deal with the Scripture, and <hi>poor humble Faith,</hi> make what they please of them, to fit them to their purpose; that Faith is sometimes feet to go to Christ, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a hand to receive him, a mouth to feed on him, an eye to look fiducially on him, a Ring to hold this precious Stone, a Vein to suck justification out of the Spiritual Stomach (which by the way is a very new conceit, for though Christ is called the head, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before read, that he was the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach) a Bucket to draw water out of this <hi>Well, Christ,</hi> though in this they are very civil to Faith, in making it a Golden Bucket; whereas at other times they tell us, that Faith may be a sore and blear-eyed <hi>Leah,</hi> a shaking and Palsie hand, weak and bending Legs, and have all the infirmities that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100660:70"/>
may be, and be never the worse nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to the purpose of justification; so that Faith had need be a very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Grace, else it would take such lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage very ill from them.</p>
                  <p>Thus to give you but one instance more; when these men are prest with those Scriptures, that urge the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of good works, and a holy life: <hi>that without holiness no man shall see God; that the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all unrighteousness, and ungodliness of men.</hi> That our accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God depends upon a holy and vertuous life: <hi>that God is no res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pector of Persons, but in every Nation, he that feareth God, and worketh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is accepted with him. That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our Righteousness exceed the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Scribes and Pharisees</hi> (those Immoral Hypocrites who plac't all their Righteousness in observing the Ceremonies of the Law without the purity of their hearts and lives) <hi>we shall in no wise enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. That he who breaks one of the least of these Commandments, and teacheth men so; shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (that is shall have no Inheritance there) <hi>and he that</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:100660:70"/>
                     <hi>doth, and teacheth them, shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that is shall be greatly rewarded, with many more of the like nature, which assert the absolute necessity of a holy life, and keeping the Commandments of God, to entitle us to his love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the rewards of the next life; which perfectly overthrow their fundamental notion of justification by the righteousness of Christ; the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of whose death they say free us from the guilt of sin, and that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is due to it, make us as perfectly Innocent, as if we had never offended, and the righteousness of his life imputed to us, makes us righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, so as to deserve a reward: gives us an actual title to glory: Now any one, who is not mightily acquainted with the Person of Christ, would think it a very hard task to reconcile this Doctrine of Justification by the imputation of Christs Righteousness without any thing of our own, with the necessity of a holy life, which the Scripture doth so expresly assert. But these men defie you, if you charge them with destroying the necessity of a holy life: And I wish with all my
<pb facs="tcp:100660:71"/>
heart, that whatever the consequence of their Doctrines is, it may have no bad influence upon their lives.</p>
                  <p>For they tell us, <hi>that this Universal Obedience and good works</hi> (a very sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious word, which methinks these men should be afraid to name) <hi>are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. Owen's Communion with Christ, Ch. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>necessary from the Soveraign appointment and will of God, this is the will of God, even our Sanctification; It is the will of the Father, and it is the will of the Son, I have ordained you, that you bring forth fruit.</hi> John 15. 16. <hi>and the appointment of the Holy Ghost. And then Holiness is one eminent and special end of the peculiar dispensation of Father, Son, and Spirit, in the business of exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of God in our Salvation; It is the end of the Fathers electing love, he hath chosen us, that we should be holy,</hi> Eph. 1. 4. <hi>the end of the Sons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming love, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> Titus 2. 14. <hi>and of the Spirits sanctifying love,</hi> as any one would easily guess.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is necessary to the glory of God, to the glory of the Father, to the glory of the Son, and to the glory of the Holy</hi>

                     <hi>Ghost, whose Temple we are:</hi> and are not these men now mightily injured in being charged with denying the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a Holy Life, who make it necessary upon so many accounts? Is it not great pity, they should be so abused? But the truth is, all this is not one syllable to the purpose; for the question was about its necessity to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and if we be justified and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without it, all this cannot prove any necessary obligation on us to the practice of it: God hath appointed and commanded obedience, but where is the sanction of this Law, will he damn those, who do not obey, for their disobedience, and will he save and reward those who do obey for their obedience, not a word of this; for this destroys our justification by the Righteousness of Christ <hi>only:</hi> And if after all these commands, God hath left it indifferent, whether we obey or not, I hope such commands cannot make obedience necessary.</p>
                  <p>The Father hath elected us to be holy, and the Son redeemed us to be holy: but will the Father elect and the Son redeem none but those who are holy, and reject and reprobate all
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100660:72"/>
others? doth this Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption suppose Holiness in us, or is it without any regard to it? For if we be elected and redeemed without any regard to our own being holy, our Election and Redemption is secure, whether we be holy or not, and so this cannot make holiness necessary on our parts, though it may be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary on Gods part to make us holy, but that is not our care.</p>
                  <p>Obedience and a holy life is for the glory of the Father, the Son, and holy Spirit: how so? when the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Holiness is so destructive to free Grace, which is the only glory God designs to advance by Christ. If this will not do yet <hi>Holiness is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our honour, for it makes us like to God.</hi> Prophane men that they are! as if the perfect Righteousness of Christ, his beautiful Robes, were not much more for our honour, and did not make us more like to God than the rags and patches of our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: however if men prefer their lusts and interests before their honour, the necessity of holiness ceases.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But it is for Peace.</hi> What Peace I

                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:100660:73"/>
                     <hi>him is no darkness at all, we are dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and in us no light at all. He is life, a living God, we are dead, dead Sinners, dead in trespasses and sins. He is holiness, and glorious in it, we wholly defiled, an abominable thing. He is love, we full of hatred, hating and being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Surely this is no foundation of agreement, or upon that of walking (that is of Communion) together: nothing can be more remote than this frame from such a condition. The foundation then of this peace (that is of agreement and Communion with God) is laid in Christ, hid in Christ, he, saith the Apostle, is our peace, he hath made peace for us; he is the new and living way into the holy of holies. I am the way (saith Christ) and no man cometh to the Father, but by me; he is the Medium of all Communication between God and us, in him we meet, in him we walk.</hi> So that if this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans memory had not failed him, he would never have told us in the 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> that holiness is necessary to our Peace and Communion with God: when a little before he had disclaimed this, as wholly useless to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>But however holiness is very <hi>useful</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:100660:73"/>
                     <hi>to all the purposes of life:</hi> that it may be, and not necessary to Salvation: <hi>It serves for the Conviction of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God.</hi> How so? When it is not essentially necessary to his Friends; And <hi>it is for the Conversion of others.</hi> Why so? When men may be converted without it: <hi>It keeps the judgments of God from other men, as Ten good men would have preserved</hi> Sodom. But why cannot the righteousness of Christ do this more effectually, than the holiness of men? But, <hi>It is necessary in respect of the state and condition of justified Persons: for they are accepted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Friendship with an holy God, a God of purer eyes, than to behold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore they must cleanse and purifie themselves. What need of this? When they are Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Robes of Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which is the only foundation of our Communion with God, as you heard before.</p>
                  <p>But however holiness is <hi>necessary with respect to sanctification. We have in us a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>this new Creature is fed, cherisht, nourisht, kept alive, by the fruits of holiness; to what end hath God given us new hearts,</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:100660:74"/>
                     <hi>and new Natures? is it, that we should kill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them, stifle the Creature, that is found in us, in the Womb? that we should give him to the old man to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured?</hi> The phrase of this is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the reasoning unanswerable: for if men be new Creatures, they will certainly live new lives, and this makes holiness absolutely necessary by the same Reason, that every thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily is, what it is, when it is; but still we enquire after a necessary obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the practice of holiness, and that we cannot discover yet.</p>
                  <p>Well! <hi>But Holiness is necessary as the means to the end.</hi> This indeed is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, but let us hear how: <hi>Though it be neither the cause, matter, nor condition of our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (mark the Hypothesis) <hi>yet it is the way appointed of God for us to walk in for the obtaining Salvation, and therefore he that hath hope of Eternal Life, purifies himself, as he is pure, and none shall ever come to the end, who walketh not in the way, for without holiness it is impossible to see God.</hi> This I confess is all pertinent, and home to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but yet there are two little faults in it; that it contradicts it self,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100660:74"/>
and overthrows their darling opinions, which I can very well pardon, if he can: What? the necessary way to Eternal Life, and yet neither the cause, matter, nor condition: at least you might allow the way to Eternal life to be the <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> without which we shall never get thither; and that in spight of all your distinctions will entitle it to the nature of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But not to dispute about words, I am content it should only be a necessary way to Eternal Life: but what becomes of Christ then? who is the <hi>only</hi> way, the truth and the life: is not the righteousness of Christ able to save us without an additional righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of our own? doth the Active and Passive Righteousness of Christ both free us from guilt and punishment, and give us an actual right and title to glory? and yet can we not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without walking in the ways of holiness? what becomes of free Grace then? is not this to <hi>eke out the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ with our own? to make Christ our justifier, and our works our Saviour?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you see, how men wrest and pervert the Scripture to make it speak
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100660:75"/>
their sense, and justifie their darling opinions and fancies, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with the same success; for some truths are so plain and stubborn, that they will not bend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but must be broke into the most palpable absurdities and contradictions, before they can be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their opinions, and then they agree like new Cloath in an old Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which makes the rent the wider.</p>
                  <p>It were easie to produce many more instances of this nature, but this is enough to show you how dangerous it is to pre-possess our fancies with some arbitrary notions in Religion, which naturally force men to pervert the Scriptures to make them speak the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox language. To this we owe all those nice and subtle distinctions, which constitute the body of Systematical Divinity, which commonly have no other design, than to evade the force of Scripture, or to bribe it to speak on their side. The Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is sacred and inviolable, and it is dangerous to call that into question, whatever acquaintance men have with the Person of Christ; but as Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi> observes of the Church of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100660:75"/>
                     <hi>Rome, that to establish her Tyranny over mens Consciences, she need not either abolish or corrupt the holy Scripture (which in regard of the numerous mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Copies dispersed through all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, translated into almost all languages, guarded with all solicitous care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, had been an impossible attempt) but the more expedite way, and therefore the more likely to be successful, was to gain the opinion and esteem of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and authorized Interpreter of them, and the Authority of adding to them, what Doctrines she pleased under the title of traditions or definitions.</hi> Thus though their fancies and the Scripture agree no better, than the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Scripture do, yet they may be both retained, so their opinions may but expound the Scriptures, and add such limitations, distinctions, glosses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as are necessary to make them Orthodox.</p>
                  <p>The sum of all is, that to know Christ is not to be thus acquainted with his Person, but to understand his Gospel in its full latitude and extent; It is not the Person, but the Gospel of Christ, which is the way, the truth, and the life, <hi>which directs us in the true</hi>

This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Christs Person, which these men pretend to, is only a work of fancy, and teaches men the Arts of Hypocrisie, it undermines the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental design of the Gospel, makes men incurably ignorant, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of their own knowledge, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and endless talkers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent Censurers of all Mankind: every Boy, who is acquainted with these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, learns to despise the ignorance of his teachers, as if they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Christ, and of the Mystery of the Gospel; and now the Laws of Christ will not down with them, this is moral and legal Preaching; nothing appears wholesom and savoury to their palates, but some Romantick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of the beauty, loveliness, fulness, and preciousness of Christ. But I hope hereafter they will see reason to believe, that we are not such Strangers to Christ, as they imagine, but have a greater Reverence for him, than to be so rude and unmannerly,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100660:76"/>
than to make so bold with his Person, and with his Laws; and are too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest to abuse the people with such dreams and fruitless speculations.</p>
                  <p>The wildness and distraction of these men makes me so much the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Wisdom and the Honesty of our Church, who in her publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism hath been careful to prevent these cheats and delusions of fancy: feeds her Children with wholesom and substantial food, hath taught them a Religion without Art or Subtilty, hath instructed them in the nature of their Baptismal Vow, and those obligations it lays on them to a vertuous life: hath taught them the Apostles Creed, which contains those great and essential Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, which are the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Principles of Action, hath given them a plain and easie explication of the Ten Commandments, which are the rules of a good life, hath taught them to pray to God, and what the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of our Saviours Institutions is, without filling their heads with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Artificial Theories of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which serve only to make them giddy with a vain conceit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to talk ill, and to live worse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:100660:77"/>And now it is time to dismiss these acquaintances of Christ, and if nothing will make them wiser, to leave them to their own dreams and dotage; only advising them, that however they may indulge themselves in these choice speculations, they would have a care of pretending any acquaintance with Christs Person for the neglect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Laws, lest they fare as ill, as another of his acquaintance did, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 21. who argued from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his temper and disposition to apologize for his own sloath and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>for I feared Thee, because thou art an austere man, who takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that, thou didst not sow.</hi> But it seems, as great an acquaintance as he was, he drew a very false conclusion, when he hid his Talent in a Napkin, as his Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinct him to his cost: and it will be the same case, though we argue from other Principles, not from the severity, but from the fondness and Indulgence of our Saviour, from the merits of his Death, or the Imputation of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: The safest way is to do what he bids us, lest he be too hard for us at Reasoning, and making <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:100660:77"/>But yet there is one thing more, which I must take notice of: that as when the Scripture speaks of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, it includes not only the speculative part of knowledge, which consists in true notions, and opinions, but the vertue and efficacy of this knowledge in the government of lives, in transforming us into the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Lord and Saviour, and and making us obedient to his Laws; without which all our knowledge is but like a curious piece of painting, an accurate Image and Picture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life or sence: so these men talk also of an experimental knowledge of Christ; the meaning of which is, that this acquaintance with the Person of Christ warms and heats their fancies, and moves their passions; sometimes they find great breakings of heart, they melt and dissolve into tears for their sins, when they remember, what their Lord suffer'd for them, they see him hang upon the Cross, and have all his agonies, and dying groans in their Ears; and then they Curse their sins that nailed him there, and tremble at the thoughts of the <hi>Naturalness of Gods vindictive justice to him:</hi> and feel all
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100660:78"/>
the horrours and agonies of damned Spirits: at other times they are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ravisht with his love, and charm'd and captivated with his beauty: fancy they have him in their arms in the closest embraces; <hi>they hear Christ call them by name, and say to them, as he did to that Woman in the Gospel, thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi> They are refresht and ravisht with his Comforts, and the sweet Caresses of his love: they see Christ adorning them with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Robes of his Righteousness, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for his dearest Spouse, and expressing all Conjugal affections to them; now they tast and relish the sweetness of Christ, which other men only talk of, and have an experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sense of his fulness to supply their wants, of his Love in chearing their Souls, of his beauty in adorning them, they are all life and spirit, which is a plain argument, that now Christ hath taken up his abode with them.</p>
                  <p>This will fall under consideration in what follows; at present I shall only say this; that all this may be no more, than the working of a warm and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick fancy, and no man ought to think himself ever the more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100660:78"/>
acquainted with Christ, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he find the power of it in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life: It is very desireable to have always such a quick and vigorous sense of the love of our dying Lord, as may constrain us to live to him, who dyed for us; but without this we are still ignorant of him, however we may be transported with these fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick raptures and exstasies of love and joy.</p>

                  <p>NExt to the knowledge of Christ there is not a greater Mystery, than <hi>our Union to him, and Communion with him;</hi> on which, as these men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it, are built all those wild and fanciful conclusions, which so directly oppose both the Doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Christianity. And therefore it is of great concernment to state this matter, and to examine, what is meant in Scripture by our Union to Christ, and Communion with him; for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does mention such a relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and Christians, as may be exprest by an Union, and those phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>being in Christ, and abiding in him,</hi> can signifie no less.</p>
                  <p>And first, I observe, that those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors,<note place="margin">I.</note> which describe the Relation and Union betwixt Christ and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, do primarily refer to the Christian
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100660:79"/>
Church, not to every individual Christian. Thus Christ is called <hi>a Head,</hi> but he is the head of his Church, which is his body, as a Husband is the head of the Wife, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23, 24. No particular Christian is the body of Christ, but only a member in this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Christ is called a Husband, but then the whole Church or Society of Christians, not every particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is his Spouse, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>For I am jealous over you with a godly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie; for I have espoused you to one Husband, that I may present you as a chast Virgin to Christ.</hi> Christ is a <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherd,</hi> and the Christian Church is his Flock, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. For the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Shepherd and Sheep doth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily concern the whole Flock: Christ is the Rock, upon which his Church is built, the chief Corner Stone, and the Christian Church a Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: so that all these Metaphors in their first and most proper use refer to the whole Society of Christians, and are designed to represent the Union between Christ and his Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I observe further, that<note place="margin">II.</note> the Union of particular Christians to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100660:80"/>
Christ is by means of their Union to the Christian Church: the Church is <hi>the body of Christ,</hi> and every Christian by being united to this body becomes <hi>a member of Christ,</hi> as the Apostle tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. <hi>Now you are the body of Christ, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in particular.</hi> The Church is the <hi>Temple of God built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ being the chief Corner stone,</hi> and every Christian is a <hi>lively stone in this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual building:</hi> The Church is <hi>Christ's Flock,</hi> and every Christian, who is of this fold, is one of <hi>Christ's Sheep.</hi> The Church is <hi>Christ's Spouse,</hi> and every Christian is a member of that Society, which Christ ownes for his Spouse: but every Christian is not <hi>Christ's Spouse;</hi> He is a great Enemy to <hi>Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and hath but <hi>one Spouse,</hi> as he hath but <hi>one body, and one Church;</hi> which quite spoils the prettiness and fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Wit of a late <hi>Exhortation to young Women to chuse Christ for their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, because he is rich, and beautiful,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Thomas Vincent.</note> 
                     <hi>and kind, and hath all the properties of an excellent Husband;</hi> which would have sounded much better in a <hi>Popish Nunnery,</hi> than among such <hi>pretenders</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:100660:80"/>
                     <hi>to reformation:</hi> for this is the great Art, whereby those cunning Priests wheadle silly Girls into a profession of <hi>perpetual Virginity,</hi> by perswading them that in so doing, they are <hi>marryed to Christ:</hi> And to give every one their due, the Papists are the most generous sort of Suiters for Christ, for they perswade them to forsake all other Husbands for Christ, which is more honourable and meritorious.</p>
                  <p>Thus to proceed, Christ is called the Vine, and Christians the branches in that Vine, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. which must be expounded to the same sense with what goes before, where Christ speaking of himself saith, <hi>I am the true Vine.</hi> The meaning is, that Church, which is founded on the belief of my Gospel, is the true Vine: <hi>I,</hi> signifies <hi>Christ</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>his Church, which is his body:</hi> upon which account the <hi>Church</hi> is elsewhere called <hi>Christ,</hi> as I observed above. And my reasons for this exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are these:</p>
                  <p>First, Because the Jewish Church is frequently in the Old Testament com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>Vine, Isaiah</hi> 5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>Hosea</hi> 10. 1. Now a <hi>Vine</hi> being the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, whereby the <hi>Church</hi> useth to be
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100660:81"/>
described, we cannot reasonably under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it otherwise here; <hi>I am the true Vine,</hi> that is the Church, which is founded on the belief of my Gospel, is the only true Church, which God now owns; He having rejected the <hi>Iewish Synagogue,</hi> as proving a <hi>degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Vine.</hi> Especially when we consider, that Christ himself applies the Parable of the Vineyard to the State of the Gospel, <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 33. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Christian Church is called <hi>an Olive Tree,</hi> and the members of it expresly called <hi>branches, Rom.</hi> 11. 17, 18. which metaphor hath the very same nature and signification <hi>with the Vine and branches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because God is called the Husband-man, who takes care to dress this Vine, which cannot be understood of Christ, but of the Church, which is therefore called <hi>God's Husbandry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Christ speaks of such <hi>bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in him,</hi> as bear no fruit; now there can be no such branches in the <hi>Person of Christ;</hi> for <hi>our very Union to his Person</hi> (as those men acknowledge, who talk of such <hi>an Union of Persons between Christ and believers</hi>) will make us fruitful: and therefore being <hi>in him</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:100660:81"/>
can signifie no more, than being <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his visible Church,</hi> which is made up of Hypocrites, as well as sincere Christians.</p>
                  <p>But fourthly, To confirm all this, and to prevent objections, it is evident from this very Chapter, that when Christ speaks in the first Person, <hi>I</hi> and <hi>In me,</hi> he cannot mean this of his <hi>own Person,</hi> but of his <hi>Church, Doctrine, and Religion,</hi> according as the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the place require, thus in the 5. <hi>Ver. I am the true Vine, ye are the branches, he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing.</hi> I would willingly learn what sense can be made of this, if we understand it of the <hi>Person of Christ:</hi> for it is not very intelligible, how we can <hi>be</hi> or <hi>abide in</hi> the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, and it is more unintelligible still, how <hi>we</hi> can be in the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, and the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of Christ at the <hi>same time be in Us;</hi> which is a new piece of Philosophy called Penetration of dimensions; and that our fruitfulness should depend upon such an <hi>Union to the Person</hi> of Christ, is as hard to my understanding, as all the rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:100660:82"/>But if by <hi>He</hi> that abideth <hi>in me,</hi> we understand the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> he who makes a publick and visible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith in me, and continues in Society with those, who do so; and by <hi>I in</hi> him, the <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> both the sense, and Reason of it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident: the sense is this; That Church, which owns my Doctrine and Religion, is the <hi>true Vine,</hi> and all you, who make a publick profession of Faith <hi>in me</hi> (of a belief of my Gospel) and live in Communion with one another, are the <hi>branches</hi> in this Vine; and whoever of you continue stedfast in this profession and Communion, and do not only make a visible profession of Faith in me, but suffer my Doctrine and Precepts to dwell and abide in you, to govern your will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to direct your Conversation in the World, all such of you will be very fruitful in good works, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such a sincere and hearty belief of my Gospel, it is impossible, you should do any thing, that is good.</p>
                  <p>So that to <hi>abide in Christ</hi> is to make a publick and visible profession of Faith in Christ, to be the members of his visible Church; but because many
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100660:82"/>
are so, who do not much credit their profession, (being branches in him that bear not fruit) hence to distinguish all true Christians from such Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Professors, he adds, <hi>and I in you,</hi> that is my words abide in you. <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. if my Doctrines and Precepts take fast hold of your wills and affections, they will make you fruitful in good works.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see, that the Union of particular Christians to Christ consists in their Union to the Christian Church: And hence it is, that the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers interpret all those Metaphors, which decypher the <hi>Union between Christ and Christians,</hi> to signifie the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire love and Unity of Christians among themselves.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> expounds <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19, 20, 21. where the Apostle speaks of <hi>that spiritual building, which is erected on the foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, Iesus Christ being the chief Corner Stone,</hi> to signifie the Unity of the Church in all Ages; that both the Jewish and Christian Church are united in Christ, as the several parts of the building are kept together by the Corner Stone; and St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> to the same purpose tells us, <hi>duos populos in se suscepit salvator, &amp; secit unum in</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:100660:83"/>
                     <hi>Domino, sicut &amp; lapis angularis duos pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietes continet in unitate domûs sirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos.</hi> i. e. <hi>That Christ united two people in himself (the Iew and Gentile) and made them one in the Lord, as the Corner Stone unites two Walls in a building, and makes it but one House.</hi> Which is the plain design of the place to prove, that Christ hath taken away the enmity and distance, which was between the Jew and Gentile, and <hi>hath reconciled them both to God in one body by the Cross, Ver.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Thus St. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> observes on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. that the Apostle to disswade them from Schisms and Factions tells them, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. That they were Gods building, and if they were Gods building, they must not be torn asunder, for then they are no longer a building; and if they were Gods Husbandry, they must not be divided from each other, but they must be one enclosure, hedged and walled in by Unity and agreement.</hi> And adds, <hi>let us therefore be built on Christ, and cleave to him as to a foundation, and as a branch to the Vine; that there may be no distance between Christ and us to interrupt this Union, for if there be, we immediately</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:100660:83"/>
                     <hi>perish; for the branch draws nourishment and fatness from the Vine by its Union to it, and the building stands firm by the strong adhesion of its parts.</hi> Which plainly signifies, that our <hi>Union to Christ</hi> consists in our <hi>Union to the Christian Church,</hi> and when we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and separate from the Church, we are broken off from Christ, as a branch is from the Vine; we are then like a building, whose stones fall asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and destroy the whole fabrick.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>same Father</hi> argues on <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 21. to perswade Christians to Peace and Unity: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>&amp;c. for he (Christ) unites us to each other by many examples and patterns of the closest Union; He is the Head, and we the body, and the whole body by the Union of its several parts must be firmly united to the head; He is the foundation, we the building, He the Vine, We the branches; He the Husband, We his Spouse; He the Shepherd, We his Sheep; He the way, we those who are to walk in that way; We are a Spiritual Temple, and He it is, who dwells in us; He is the first born, we his Brethren; He the Heir, we fellow Heirs with him; He the life, we those who live by him; He</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:100660:84"/>
                     <hi>the Resurrection, we those who rise with him; He the light, and we are all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by him; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. All these metaphors describe the nearest and closest Union of Christians to each other, and of all to Christ, which will not admit of the least distance and separation:</hi> so that according to the sense of this <hi>Holy man,</hi> particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are united to Christ by means of their Union to the Christian Church, otherwise I cannot understand how our Union to Christ can be an argument to Unity and Concord among ourselves, if we are immediately united to the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> without being first uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his <hi>Church.</hi> Which I wish those men would seriously consider, who boast so much of their <hi>Union to Christ,</hi> and yet <hi>rend his Church</hi> into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand little factions, tear the members of his body from each other, and yet pretend to be united to the head, make new enclosures in the Husbandry, and Vineyard of God, and when Christ hath broken down the middle Wall of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and made Jews and Gentiles but one Church, do now erect more Partition Walls in the <hi>Christian,</hi> than
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100660:84"/>
ever were in the <hi>Iewish Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we need not depend on Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the confirmation of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Union of particular Christians with Christ, consists in their Union with the Christian Church; for those <hi>Sacraments</hi> our Saviour hath In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, as <hi>Symbols of our Union with him,</hi> are a plain demonstration of it: Our first undertaking of Christianity is represented in our <hi>Baptism,</hi> wherein we make a publick profession of our Faith in Christ; and it is sufficiently known, that Baptism is the <hi>Sacrament of our admission into the Christian Church;</hi> and if any one should deny this we have the Authority of St. <hi>Paul</hi> for the proof of it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body;</hi> In which the Apostle seems to allude to Baptism, which confers the same holy Spirit on us all, and thereby makes us all members of that <hi>one body</hi> of Christ, which is his Church; but more expresly in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>There is one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and one Spirit, as you are called in one hope of your Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism;</hi> that is, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Baptism is but one, and is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Union, making us all the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100660:85"/>
members of that one body of Christ; this is called being <hi>Baptized into Christ, i. e.</hi> admitted into the Christian Church by a publick profession of our Faith in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is a Sacrament of Union, and signifies that near Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction between <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church,</hi> and the mutual fellowship of one Christian with another: hence the Apostle calls the <hi>Cup of Blessing</hi> the <hi>Communion of the blood of Christ,</hi> and <hi>the Bread</hi> the <hi>Communion of the body of Christ; for we being many are one bread and one body</hi> (one body represented by this one bread) <hi>for we are all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that one bread.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>For the Intention of our Lord and Saviour in what he did and suffer'd for us was, not meerly to reform and save some single Persons but, to erect a Church and to combine all his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples into a publick Society, to unite them by holy Mysteries, and to engage them to a mutual discharge of all Christian offices, whereby the <hi>whole body may edifie it self in love;</hi> and therefore our Saviour does not owne any relation to particular men, as such, but as they are members of his body,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100660:85"/>
for he is the <hi>Saviour of the body,</hi> and <hi>Redeemed his Church with his own blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us in his first <hi>Ep. Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. <hi>That which we have seen and heard</hi> (the whole Doctrine and History of the Gospel) <hi>declare we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Iesus Christ.</hi> First, that ye may have <hi>fellowship with us,</hi> become <hi>members of the Church of Christ,</hi> by which means you have fellowship and Communion with God and Christ.</p>
                  <p>And therefore those publick cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, whereby rotten or dead mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are cut of from the body of Christ, consist in casting such persons out of the Society of Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in debarring them from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Prayers and Sacraments, and all Religious offices, which is a plain demonstration, that our Union to Christ is not an Union to his <hi>Person</hi> (of which more hereafter) but consists in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and spiritual Communion with the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> otherwise this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion with the Church could be no visible signification of our Union to Christ, nor could our excision from the visible Church signifie our separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:100660:86"/>But thirdly, It will be requisite now<note place="margin">III.</note> to explain more particularly the nature of this Union between Christ and the Christian Church, which is not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but a <hi>Political</hi> Union, that is such an Union, as is between <hi>a Prince</hi> and <hi>his Subjects:</hi> Christ is <hi>a spiritual King,</hi> and all Christians are his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and our Union to Christ consists in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of his Revelations, obedience to his Laws, and subjection to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Hence our Saviour tells the Jews, <hi>if you continue in my words, then are ye my Disciples indeed,</hi> John 8. 31. which is the same thing <hi>with being in him:</hi> and by <hi>keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we abide in his love, Iohn</hi> 15. 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14. 21. and <hi>to have his word abide in us</hi> is a description of the closest and firmest Union to him <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 7. As obedience to our Prince is the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est bond of a Political Union, which is dissolved and broken by disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Rebellion. Thus our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our calls himself a <hi>Shepherd</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians his <hi>Sheep. Iohn</hi> 10. to signifie that Authority he hath over his Church, which bears some Analogy to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> which is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times used as a name of power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100660:86"/>
as God is styled the <hi>Shepherd of Israel, Psalm</hi> 80. 1. and <hi>Kings</hi> are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called <hi>Shepherds</hi> both by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and sacred Writers. Though this name is most commonly given to <hi>Prophets,</hi> who feed and instruct the Church, which includes power and Authority; and so does very properly belong to our Saviour, who erected this spiritual Kingdom on the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Doctrine and Laws, and by the exercise of his prophetical office: for which Reason he is called the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherd and Bishop of our Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus he is called a <hi>Head</hi> and the Church his <hi>Body,</hi> a <hi>Husband</hi> and the Church his <hi>Spouse,</hi> which two meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors signifie the same thing, and are both of them names of power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; as appears from <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>&amp;c. For Husbands are said to be the head of their Wives, as Christ is the head of the Church, and are commanded to love their Wives, as their own bodies, as Christ loves his Church:</hi> so that a <hi>Husband,</hi> as a <hi>Husband</hi> represents the <hi>head,</hi> and the <hi>Wife</hi> the <hi>body;</hi> and what the meaning of all this is, the Apostle plainly tells us: that Christ is called the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Husband,</hi> because he hath
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100660:87"/>
the Rule and Government of us, and therefore exhorts <hi>Wives to be subject to their Husbands as the Church is subject unto Christ the Spiritual Head, v.</hi> 24. For because the Head in the natural body hath the command and government of all the members; hence <hi>Head</hi> is a common name for Princes and Governours, <hi>Deutr.</hi> 28. 13. <hi>The Lord shall make thee the Head and not the Tayl, and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath,</hi> that is, thou shalt rule and govern; <hi>Psalm.</hi> 18. 43. <hi>Thou hast made me the Head of the Heathen, and a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostles always expound this metaphor of Christ's being a <hi>Head</hi> by <hi>power and Authority. Eph.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22. <hi>Hath set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places, far above all Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers—and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be Head over all things to the Church, which is his body.</hi> Col. 1. 18. <hi>And he is the Head of the body, the Church, who is the beginning, the first born from the dead, that in all things, he might have the preheminence:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; that is that he might not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100660:87"/>
only excel other things, but that he might rule and govern them; for so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies him, who hath the first place of Authority; <hi>because go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is naturally entailed on the greatest excellency and perfection.</hi> Thus Christ is the <hi>Head of all Principalities and powers,</hi> that is their Lord and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10. This is the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this relation betwixt Christ and his Church. He is the <hi>Head and Husband,</hi> because he is invested with Authority to govern; and the Church is <hi>his body and Spouse,</hi> because it must be obedient to his Laws, and subject to his Government: as we know it is very familiar to call a Society of men, who live under the same Laws and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government, a <hi>body Politic,</hi> which signifies their subjection to the same Authority, as a body hath but one Head; and that regard they must have to the preservation of the whole, and their mutual care of each other, as members of the same body.</p>
                  <p>Now the true Reason why this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom of Christ is described by the Authority of a Shepherd over his Sheep, and of a Head and Husband over his body and Spouse, is to signifie
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100660:88"/>
the mildness and gentleness of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that great and near concern he hath for the welfare of his Church: that he governs his Church with the care and tenderness of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd: that he defends and ransoms his Church with his own blood, as a <hi>good Shepherd lays down his life in defence of his Sheep. Iohn</hi> 10. That he loves his Church with the natural kindness of a <hi>Head or Husband;</hi> that his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is only for the good of his Church, not for his own private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; as a kind Husband exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth no other Authority over his Wife, but what is for <hi>her</hi> good, as well as <hi>his own;</hi> or as the <hi>Head</hi> hath no other concern, but that all <hi>his members</hi> be preserved in their natural State and vigour, and perform their proper and natural offices; and therefore we may be secure, that <hi>his yoak is easie, and his burden light;</hi> that he will be gentle in his Discipline, and favourable in his censures; especially when we consider how dearly he hath purchast this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Church, <hi>that he gave himself for it, that he might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word. Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26. Upon which account
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100660:88"/>
                     <hi>we may well be called the Members of his Body, of his Flesh, and of his Bones, vers.</hi> 30. the Church being, as it were, taken out of his crucified Body, as the Woman was taken out of the Man; as <hi>Christ is said to have reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Gentiles</hi> (that is, taken them into his Church) <hi>in the body of his flesh through death, Col.</hi> 1. 21, 22. because the Covenant of Grace, which is the Foundation of the Christian Church, and receives Gentiles as well as Jews, was sealed with the blood of Christ; so that the Church is taken out of the crucified body of Christ, which in the mystical sense answers to the Womans being taken out of the Man, which seems to be the Apostles meaning in that place. For the same reason Christ ownes himself our Friend, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 14. <hi>Ye are my friends, if you do what soever I command you:</hi> which does not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie such an equality betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> as there is betwixt friends, nor encourage any rudeness and unbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming familiarity in our addresses to him; but acquaints us with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his government, that he will rule his Church with the same care and tenderness, which one friend expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:100660:89"/>So that all this is a description of the state of the Gospel, in which our Lord and Master is our Shepherd, our Head and Husband, our Friend and Saviour, who hath redeemed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased us with his own blood, who laid the Foundation of his spiritual Kingdom in the most surprising and astonishing goodness, and exerciseth his authority in all the methods of love and compassion. Upon which account God also hath now laid aside in a great measure that severe name of a <hi>King,</hi> and calls himself our <hi>Father,</hi> to assure us of his fatherly care and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to signifie that liberty of Sons we now enjoy under the Gospel in opposition to the bondage and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then we must observe farther, that though Christ be our Lord and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, he doth not govern us imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by himself, for He is ascended up into Heaven, where he powerfully intercedes for his Church, and by a vigilant Providence superintends all the affairs of it, but hath left the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and external conduct and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church to <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> who preside in his name, and by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100660:89"/>
his authority: in the first Ages of Christianity, Christ conferred such extraordinary gifts on men, as quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them for so great an office, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. &amp;c. But though these miraculous gifts ceased, when the Gospel was fully published and sufficiently confirmed, yet the offices still continue for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and government of the Church, though managed in more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and humane ways. Christ now governs his Church by men, who are invested with his authority: which is a plain demonstration of what I discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed above, that the Union of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Christians to Christ, is by their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Christian Church; which consists in their regular subjection to their spiritual Guides and Rulers, and in concord and unity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For if our Union to Christ consists in our subjection to him as our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master, our Head</hi> and <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;</hi> and this authority is not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately exercised by <hi>Christ himself,</hi> but by the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church; it necessarily follows, that we cannot be united to Christ, that is, cannot owne his authority and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till we unite our selves to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100660:90"/>
publick Societies of Christians, and submit to the publick Instructions, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Discipline of the Church, as no man can be said to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his Prince, who denies subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to those subordinate Magistrates, who act by his Princes Commission: for the Union of Bodies Politick (such as the Christian Church is) consists in Order and Government, when all the Members keep their proper places, and are knit to each other by a faithful discharge of their several offices and trusts: Schismaticks are in the Church, just as Rebels are in the Kingdom, not as part of it, but as open and profest Enemies: but the Apostle tells us wherein the Unity of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Christ is the Head, from whom the whole body fitly joyned together and compacted by that, which every joynt supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body to the edifying of it self in love.</hi> That is, the supreme power is invested in Christ as Head, to whom the Church is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and subject, but to make this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on firm and lasting, there must be a regular subordination of the several
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100660:90"/>
Members, and a mutual discharge of all Christian offices, which is the most effectual way to advance their spiritual growth in all Christian graces, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to increase that love and friendship, which is the very life and soul of the Church: This indeed sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses a <hi>visible Society of Christians,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the Faith of Christ, and living in communion with each other; for if there be no such visible Society (as it may happen in times of persecution, or some great degeneracy of the Church) it must of necessity alter the case: our Union to Christ then consists in an acknowledgment of his Authority and Subjection to his Laws, which makes us Members of the <hi>Universal Church,</hi> though there be no <hi>particular Church</hi> to communicate with: but when there is a visible Church, we are under the necessary obligations of a <hi>visible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> because herein <hi>our subjection to the Authority of Christ,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>our Union</hi> to him, consists.</p>
                  <p>And this by the way gives a plain account of the only cause, that can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie our separation from any Society of Christians: for our Union with the Christian Church being the Medium
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100660:91"/>
of our Union to Christ, while the Church, we live in, acknowledges the Authority, and submits to the Laws of Christ, we are bound to live in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it, because this unites us to Christ. When nothing is made the condition of our Communion, which is expresly forbid by the Laws of our supreme Lord, we acknowledge his Authority in our subjection to our spiritual Guides; and we disowne his Authority in disowning and affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theirs; as our Saviour tells his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, and he that despiseth you, despiseth me, and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me, Luk.</hi> 10. 16. But when any Church prevaricates in the Laws of Christ, corrupts his Religion, and undermines the fundamental design of it, which is to make men good and vertuous, when we cannot obey our spiritual Rulers without disobeying the express Laws of Christ, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our Communion with such a Church ceases, because it doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer (nay contradicts) the end of Christian Society, which is to <hi>have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wship with the Father, and with his Son Iesus Christ.</hi> For in this case we
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100660:91"/>
cannot owne their authority, but we must renounce the authority of our Head and Husband: now as it is in an Army, should any Captain revolt from his Prince, the Souldiers under his Command are not bound to turn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, because their Leader is so; or should a whole Troop or Regiment conspire in the Treason, no particular Souldier is obliged to continue in the Company, or submit to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rebels, no more than he is obliged to be a Rebel; the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son holds good as to Christian Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; if any particular Church aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize from the Faith of Christ, we are then under the same necessity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting their Communion, as we are of obeying the Laws, and submitting to the Authority of our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; but nothing less than this can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie a separation; while the Church is subject to Christ, we must be subject to the Church; while the fundamental Laws of his spiritual Kingdom are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and his Institutions reverenced, and the great ends of his Religion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, to separate from such a Church is to separate from the Body of Christ; for our Union to Christ consists in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100660:92"/>
to his Authority, and it is plain, that we disowne his Authority, when we reject those, who act by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>Now this Political Union betwixt Christ and his Church may be either only <hi>external</hi> and <hi>visible,</hi> and so <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crital Professors</hi> may be said to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ, or <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real,</hi> which imports the truth and sincerity of our obedience and subjection to our Lord and Master: For since Christianity is become the Religion of Nations, and is entailed on us by our Ancestors as part of our inheritance, is received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Laws and Constitutions of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and made a great Instrument of Civil Government, it is too often seen, that many men undertake this Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion only as the Mode and Fashion of their Country, to avoid singularity, and to serve a worldly interest; And thus the Christian Church is filled with <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>visible Professors,</hi> who are great Strangers to the life and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the <hi>Holy Iesus;</hi> while some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Christians practise all the villanies of the Heathen World, and live in a publick defiance to the Laws of that Religion they pretend
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100660:92"/>
to owne; others make a fair show of external conformity to the Laws and Constitutions of this spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and conceal their impurities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some glorious and pompous form of Religion, and pass for very good Christians, when they are no better than disguised Hypocrites; and this makes it necessary to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a meer <hi>external</hi> and <hi>real</hi> Union, between those, who do no more than make a visible profession of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and those who are true and sincere Christians.</p>
                  <p>Earthly Princes can exact only an external conformity to their Laws, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they can take no cognizance of the secret workings of mens minds, and the end of their Government is attained in the preservation of publick peace and order; But the spiritual Kingdom of our Lord is of another nature, which requires not only an external and visible subjection to Christ our Head and Husband, and a visible Union to the Christian Church, but the homage and obedience of the Soul, the government of our thoughts and passions, the renovation of our minds and spirits, <hi>We must be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:100660:93"/>
                     <hi>of Water and of the Spirit, if we would enter into the Kingdom of God, Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. That is, before we can be the Disciples of Christ, the Subjects of his spiritual Kingdom, which is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven; we must be born of water,</hi> must make a publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our Faith in Christ, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Him in our Baptism: but this is not sufficient, unless we be <hi>born of the Spirit</hi> too, that is, unless our minds and spirits become subject to Christ, unless our Faith in Christ, and subjection to Him, be sincere and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do govern all the motions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of our Souls, and make us really such, as we pretend to be; which is called <hi>Being born of the Spirit,</hi> because all Christian Graces and Vertues are in Scripture attributed to the Spirit of God as the Author of them. Hence the Apostle tells us, that <hi>In Christ Iesus nothing availeth but a new Creature,</hi> that is, that none are true Subjects of Christ, such as shall be rewarded by Him, but those whose minds and spirits are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the love of vertue and goodness.</p>
                  <p>Now as a visible Profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100660:93"/>
is the Foundation of this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-political Union betwixt Christ and his Church; so this new Nature is the Foundation of a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and this the Scripture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to us under several notions. First, by the subjection of our minds and spirits to Christ, as our spiritual King, when we put our Souls as well as Bodies under his Government and Conduct: hence Christ is said <hi>to dwell in our hearts by faith, Eph.</hi> 3. 17. that is, to have the sole Command and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of our wills and affections, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our hearts, as a man does the house, in which he dwells. And thus all those Metaphors, which signifie our subjection to Christ, must be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the subjection of our Souls and Spirits to Him, as well as the outward conformity of our actions; because Christ is a spiritual King, who rules and governs hearts, as earthly Princes govern the bodies of their Subjects: our subjection to him ought to begin in the Soul, in a sincere acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Power and Authority, in a stedfast belief of his Doctrines and Revelations, and in a chearful and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling obedience to his Laws; such a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100660:94"/>
as a Wife ought to yield to her Husband, and Members to their Head, the effect of a free choice, not a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or forced compliance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By a participation of the same nature, which is the necessary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the subjection of our minds to him: for the Gospel of our Saviour is the truest image of his mind, he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed his own nature into his Laws, and therefore a sincere obedience to his Laws is a conformity to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Hence is that exhortation, <hi>That the same mind be in us, which was in Christ Iesus, Phil.</hi> 2. 5. and to be his Disciples is <hi>to learn of him, who was meek and lowly in mind, Matth.</hi> 11. 29. Hence also our Union to Christ is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by having the <hi>Spirit of Christ.</hi> Rom. 8. 9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his;</hi> that is, unless he have the same temper and disposition of mind which Christ had, which is called <hi>having the Spirit of Christ</hi> by an ordinary figure of the cause for the effect, for all those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and graces, wherein our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Christ consists, are called the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>the fruit of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in all goodness, righteousness, and</hi>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:100660:94"/>
                     <hi>truth, Eph.</hi> 5. 9. and therefore what the Apostle in that place calls, <hi>having the Spirit of Christ,</hi> in the next verse he expresses by <hi>if Christ be in you: i. e.</hi> if you be possest with the same love of vertue and goodness, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared so eminently in him; which is much to the same sense with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>of Christs being formed in you.</hi> Gal. 4. 19. <hi>My little Children of whom I travel in birth again, till Christ be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in you:</hi> that is, till you be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly instructed in the Doctrine and Religion of Christ, and are thereby moulded into his likeness and image. Hence in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. the Apostle tells us, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit:</hi> that is, herein consists our Union to Christ, that we have the same temper of mind which he had: for there can be no Union betwixt Souls and Spirits without this, that they are acted by the same Principles, and love, and chuse the same things: bodies are united by an external ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion of parts, but Souls by an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and consent of wills. This makes two <hi>one Spirit,</hi> when there is a perfect likeness of disposition, when they agree in the same designs as much, as if the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100660:95"/>
same Soul animated them both: when we love God and men, as our Saviour did, when we are meek and humble, and patient and contented, as he was, we are as closely united to him, as if he dwelt in us, and we in him: as if we had but <hi>one Spirit</hi> in us both.</p>
                  <p>But Thirdly, there is a closer Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on still, which results from this, which consists in a mutual and reciprocal love. When we are transformed into the image of Christ, he loves us, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like to him, and we love him too, as partaking of his nature. He loves us as the price of his blood, as his own workmanship created to good works, and we love him as our Redeemer and Saviour. Now love is the great Cement of Union, which unites inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, and thereby does more firmly unite hearts: hence when our Saviour had told his Disciples, <hi>At that day ye shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you,</hi> Joh. 14. 20. he explains the meaning of it in v. 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and manifest my self unto him.</hi> That is, God and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100660:95"/>
Christ, and Christians are all united by a mutual and reciprocal love, founded on a likeness of dispositions and actions, on obedience to those Laws, which are but a Copy of the <hi>Original Holiness of God,</hi> and of the <hi>life of Christ.</hi> To the same purpose Christ prays for his Disciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 21. <hi>that they may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.</hi> Which refers to their agreement in doctrine and love. Thus according to the Scripture phrase love makes us one with God and Christ, and with each other.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This Union is exprest in Scripture by resembling the Christian Church to <hi>Gods Temple,</hi> wherein he dwells, as formerly he did in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> while that typical and ceremonial Worship was in force, God was pleased to dwell in a Temple made with hands, there he placed the Symbols of his Presence, from thence he gave forth his Oracles, there he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Sacrifices and Oblations, and returned an answer to their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But since Christ hath introduced a more manly and spiritual Worship, God dwells no longer in a Temple of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100660:96"/>
wood and stones, by such visible signs of his presence, as formerly he did, but hath chosen the society of devout minds and pure souls for the place of his residence and abode. Thus in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Know you not, that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you:</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>Know you not, that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God:</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Ye are the Temple of the living God, as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in (or among) them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</hi> To the same purpose we find in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 3. that after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the <hi>Holy City,</hi> the <hi>New Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem coming down from God out of Heaven,</hi> which signifies the state of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> there was heard a great voice out of Heaven, saying, <hi>Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.</hi> Now all this must be expounded in allusion to the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> that as the <hi>Temple</hi> was the place of Gods peculiar presence with that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100660:96"/>
signifying that he was always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand to assist them in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, to supply their wants, to defend them from their enemies, to hear all the pious prayers they put up to him: that is, <hi>that he would be their God, and they should be his people;</hi> as the Apostle expounds it; thus it is now with the Christian Church, they are the only society of men, whom God hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar regard for, with whom he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways present, whom he protects and defends by a vigilant and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular providence, whom he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen for his peculiar people to dwell among them.</p>
                  <p>And as in the Temple God placed the Mercy-seat and the Cherubims as Emblems of his Majesty and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, for which reason he is so often said <hi>to dwell betwixt the Cherubims:</hi> so he hath now bestowed his <hi>holy Spirit</hi> on the Christian Church, which is a surer pledge of his dwelling among them, than those Types and Shadows were, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Know ye not, that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,</hi> or among you: that is, this is a sufficient evidence, that ye are the <hi>Temple of</hi>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:100660:97"/>
                     <hi>God,</hi> in that God hath given his Spirit to dwell with you: which primarily refers to those extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, which God in that Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the Christian Church: this was the true <hi>Shecinah</hi> or <hi>divine glory</hi> resting on them: for which reason he is called the <hi>Spirit of Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 14 <hi>The Spirit of Glory and of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth on you:</hi> that is, that Spirit of God, which is the visible manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his glory in the Christian Church, of which that visible glory, which sometimes filled the Jewish Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, was an Emblem. Hence S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>the glory of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which is the ministration of the Spirit</hi> (which was confirmed by such miraculous and plentiful effusions of the holy Spirit) <hi>did far exceed the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the first Covenant, written and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in stones, though that was so glorious, that the Children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses, because of the glory of his countenance,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8. for this was a glorious manifestation of a divine Presence with the Church, that God did indeed dwell with them, and walk among them: and though these extraordinary
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100660:97"/>
gifts are now ceased, yet the vertue and glory of them still remains, they are a lasting demonstration of Gods peculiar presence with his Church in all Ages, as they are of the truth of the Christian Religion: for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church in all Ages since Christ and his Apostles is but <hi>one,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore still inherits the glory as well as the Religion of former Ages. In al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to this the <hi>Christian Church</hi> is called <hi>Gods Building,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22. <hi>and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Iesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone, in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth into an holy Temple in the Lord, in whom ye are also built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, a <hi>Spiritual Temple</hi> in opposition to the <hi>material Temple</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual House</hi> or <hi>Temple,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. all which refers to this notion, that the <hi>Christian Church</hi> is <hi>Gods Temple</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he dwells.</p>
                  <p>Now though all this do most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to the Christian Church, as a spiritual Society; that they are
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100660:98"/>
the Temple of the living God: yet it is accommodated in Scripture to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Christians: and <hi>Philo</hi> also al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to it, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>that the mind of a wise and good man is in truth and reality the Palace and Temple of God:</hi> every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Soul is Gods Temple wherein he dwells: an enlightned mind, which is stored with all the treasures of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wisdom and knowledge, is his <hi>Debir</hi> or Oracle: a pure heart is his Altar, and devout prayers are spiritual incense and sweet perfumes: the body it self is a consecrated place, and is also called the Temple of God, which must therefore be preserved pure and undefiled, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. nay our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are <hi>Sacrifices</hi> too, which we must offer up to God by devoting them to his service, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture loves to allude to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and <hi>Aliar,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the Law, which in a moral sense may very well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the Christian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Service, as in their Typical sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification they prefigured Christ, whose <hi>Body</hi> was the <hi>true Temple,</hi> where the <hi>Divine Glory</hi> dwelt, who was both Priest and Sacrifice, and by his death
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100660:98"/>
put an end to that Typical Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; only we may observe, that when the Scripture mentions Gods or Christs dwelling with particular Christians, it uses a more familiar style, and seems rather to allude to a <hi>private house,</hi> than a <hi>publick Temple:</hi> Thus in <hi>Ioh</hi> 14. 23. <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him:</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is all I can find in Scripture concerning the Union betwixt Christ and Christians, and that this is the true account of it (besides what hath been already urged) will evidently appear from those Institutions of our Saviour, which are the Instruments and Symbols of our Union to him, which we commonly call <hi>Sacraments, Baptism and the Lords Supper:</hi> which represent and signifie both our external and real Union with him.</p>
                  <p>First our external Union: Thus Baptism is a publick profession of the Christian Religion, that we believe the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100660:99"/>
Gospel of Christ, owne his Authority, and submit to his Government: We are baptized <hi>in the Name of Christ,</hi> that is, we publickly owne him for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor and Governour, to believe whatever he hath taught, and to do whatever he hath commanded. And the Lords Supper is a foederal Rite which answers to the Feasts on Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices under the Law, whereby we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our Covenant with our Lord, and vow obedience and subjection to him: hence these Institutions were by the Ancients called <hi>Sacraments,</hi> in allusion to that Oath which Souldiers took to be true and faithful to their Prince, when they were listed into his Army, which was called <hi>Sacramentum Militiae</hi> or the <hi>Military Oath;</hi> of this nature are <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> a Vow and Covenant to be subject to Christ as our Head and Husband, wherein our external and visible Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consists.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They signifie also our real Union to Christ, thus Baptism signifies our profession of becoming new men, our profession of conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Christ in his Death and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>We are buried with Christ by</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:100660:99"/>
                     <hi>Baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life, Rom.</hi> 6. 4. that is Baptism, or our immersion under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to the ancient Rite of administring it, is a figure of our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial with Christ, and of our conformity to his death, and so signifies our dying to sin, and walking in newness of life: for the death of Christ must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, not barely as a natural death, a separation of soul and body, but as a Sacrifice for sin to destroy the power and dominion of it, and so our dying to sin (that is, ceasing from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it) is the truest conformity to the death of Christ; and we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider his Resurrection, not only as his returning to life again, but as his living to God, his advancement into his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom, the design of which is to promote the interest of Religion, and a divine life, and so our walking in newness of life (a vertuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious life) is our conformity to his Resurrection, makes us the true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his spiritual Kingdom; which the Apostle tells us, gives us an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant assurance of a glorious resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100660:100"/>
that we shall in a proper sense rise with him; because this new life, wherein our spiritual Conformity to the resurrection of Christ consists, is an immortal principle of life, which can no more die, than Christ can die again, now he is risen from the dead. Thus Baptism is called <hi>putting on Christ, Gal.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>He that is baptized into Christ hath put on Christ:</hi> that is, hath engaged himself to be conformed to his image and likeness, to adorn his mind with all those vertues and Graces, which appeared in our Saviours life:</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lords Supper is a spiritual feeding on Christ, <hi>eating his flesh and drinking his blood,</hi> which signifies the most intimate Union with him, that <hi>we are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone: Eph.</hi> 5. 30. That as we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by his Death and sufferings, are the purchase of his blood, and so as it were taken out of his Crucifyed body, as the Woman was taken out of the Man; so by this spiritual feeding on Christ we are transformed into the same nature with him as much as if we were of his flesh and bones. This is a Sacrament, wherein we celebrate the love of our dying Lord, and express
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100660:100"/>
our most passionate love and devotion to him; The memory of what he hath done and suffer'd for us, excites a just hatred of our sins, sincere purposes and resolutions of a new life, <hi>to live to him, who died for us;</hi> a great hope in God, who hath provided such a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Atonement, such a Mediator and Advocate for us; and a stedfast expectation of a future reward. This is eating the flesh and drinking the blood of Christ, when these visible fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of his Death and Sufferings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our minds with such a strong and passionate sense of his love to us, and excite in us such a firm hope in God, as transforms us into a divine Nature: and this is our real Union to Christ, as you heard above.</p>
                  <p>Now I take it for granted, that there can be no better way to understand the nature of our Union to Christ, than to consider the nature of those Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were designed as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and signs of our Union to him; and if we will take that account, the Scripture gives of them, all the Union they signifie, is only a publick and visible profession of our Faith in Christ, and subjection to him, as our
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100660:101"/>
Lord and Saviour, and a sincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of our hearts and lives to the nature and life of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I observe further, that<note place="margin">IV.</note> fellowship and Communion with God, according to the Scripture notion, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies what we call a Political Union, that is, that to be in fellowship with God and Christ signifies to be of that Society, which puts us into a peculiar relation to God; that God is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and we his Children, that Christ is our head and Husband, our Lord and Master, we his Disciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, his Spouse, and his body: thus in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1. 3. <hi>That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Iesus Christ:</hi> where I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that our fellowship with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son is first founded on our fellowship with the Christian Church, that is on our profession of the Faith of Christ, obedience to his Laws, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his Government and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which he now visibly exerciseth by the Bishops and Pastors of the Church; this unites us into one Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and body politick: and now by
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100660:101"/>
vertue of our fellowship with the Christian Church, we have fellowship with Christ, who is the supreme Head and Governour of his Church, which is a plain argument, that all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle means by fellowship with God and Christ is such a Political Union, as is between a Prince and his Subjects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Superiours and Inferiours in the same Society. Now (as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) if this profession be only exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and visible, without the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our hearts and lives to the laws of Christ, it gives us only an external fellowship, or relation to God and Christ; that is, such men only appear to be in fellowship with Christ, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a visible fellowship with his Church, when in truth they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect strangers to him, such as Christ will not owne for his Disciples, as the Apostle adds in <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>If we say, we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lye, and do not the truth, but if we walk in the light, as God is in the light, then have we fellowship one with another, &amp;c.</hi> That is, we abuse our selves, if we hope, that God will owne himself our Father, and bestow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Children on us, while we
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100660:102"/>
live in sin; but when we join the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of real righteousness with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible profession of Christianity, then God will owne us for his Children, and Christ for the true members of his body. So that this fellowship with God and Christ is such a state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as we are put into by a visible profession and sincere practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and that in short is, that we are united to God as his Sons and Children, and are united to Christ, as his Disciples, and members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which intitles us to the Inheritance of Children and all the blessings of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Thus in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by whom ye are called into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of his Son Iesus Christ our Lord:</hi> where the fellowship of Christ can sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no more than the fellowship of the Christian Church, whereof Christ is Lord and Head, and therefore the Apostle immediately adds in the next Verse, <hi>Now I beseech you Brethren, by the name of our Lord Iesus Christ</hi> (for the honour and reputation of Christ and his Religion) <hi>that you all speak the same thing, that there be no divisions nor Schisms among you, but that you be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:100660:102"/>
                     <hi>joyned together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.</hi> Where he argues from the nature of their Faith in Christ, to the obligations of Peace and Unity, which plainly evinces that this fellowship with Christ is that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we stand in to him, as Members of the Christian Church, whereof he is Head.</p>
                  <p>And that the true notion of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which we render sometimes by Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, sometimes by Communion, is as plain as we can wish, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. where the Apostle disswades them from having any fellowship with Heathen Idolaters, from eating of their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, &amp;c. <hi>Be ye not unequally yoked with unbelievers,</hi> that is, have no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with those men, whose Religion is so contrary to yours, that you will be as uneasie to each other, as two Heifers in the same yoke, which draw different ways: <hi>For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?</hi>

How can a Believer and Unbeliever, a Christian and an Idolater have right to a part of the same Sacrifice? <hi>What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi>

All these expressions decypher to us the nature and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of fellowship; the nature of it consists in the union of things, which in rational Beings consists in mutual relations and common interests, and the foundation of it is a likeness of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and consent and harmony of wills; and therefore the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains our fellowship with God by our being the Temple of God, and that God dwells in us, and walks in us, <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:100660:103"/>Now because the Lords Supper is the only Act which the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby our fellowship with God and Christ in this World is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, hence it is called the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>or the Communion and fellowship;</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16. <hi>The Cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the Communion of the blood of Christ? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Christ?</hi> And why he calls it the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, appears from the following verses. First, because it signifies the Communion and fellowship of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with each other, that they are all Members of the Body of Christ, that they are all the Children of the same Father, as being entertained by him at the same Table, <hi>vers.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, It is a Communion also, as it signifies our fellowship with God. <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. <hi>Behold Israel after the flesh, are not they which eat of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice partakers of the Altar?</hi> The meaning of which is, that the Sacrifice which was offered upon the Altar, was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as Gods meat, as the Temple was his house, and therefore those that eat of the Sacrifice, were entertained at Gods Table, which was a significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100660:104"/>
of their fellowship with him, that he was their God, and they his people. Thus the Lords Supper is a Feast upon a Sacrifice, even that great and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Sacrifice of the Body of Christ, which was offered upon the Cross; and therefore to eat the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated Bread, and drink the Wine, which are the figures of his Body and Blood, is to eat of that Sacrifice, that spiritual food God hath provided for us. Thus God entertains us at his Table, as his own Children, who are of his houshold and family, as the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, who have a right to all the blessings of the new Covenant, which was sealed with his blood. This is the true Interpretation of all Feasts upon Sacrifice (such as the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in an eminent manner is) that it is to eat of Gods food, and to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at his Table, which is such an argument of our fellowship with God, as eating and drinking together is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, always allowing for that infinite distance which is between God and us.</p>
                  <p>This is the only Act of Religion, which in Scripture signifies Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fellowship, because it is the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100660:104"/>
most proper signification of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with God, and with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but prayer and meditation, and such like Acts of Devotion, are no where called Communion with God, though a prevailing custom hath in our days almost wholly appropriated that name to them; fellowship with God doth not consist in transient Acts, but is a state of life, that relation we stand in to God and Christ, and there is no Act of Religion, which doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly signifie this fellowship with God but only eating at his Table: for you will not say, that a poor man enjoys communion and fellowship with his Prince, when he puts up a Petition to him to beg his charity, or praiseth him for his clemency and bounty: to pray to God is an Act of Homage, which we owe him, as he is our Maker and Father, it is a duty which results from our relation to, and fellowship with God, but it is not in its own nature an act of fellowship and communion: which expression I purposely avoid, not only because it is improper, and hath thrust out the true notion of our fellowship with God, and not only the notion but the practice of it too (for
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100660:105"/>
certainly did men understand, what our fellowship with God is, they would not so much neglect the Lords Supper, which is the only Act whereby our Communion is exprest) but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men have abused it to great ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence and familiarity with God in their addresses to him, while they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that they are now acting the part of Gods Fellows, and therefore may talk to him with such freedom, as they use in common conversation.</p>
                  <p>I have discoursed these things at large, because they are too commonly mistaken: our Union to Christ hath been represented as a Riddle and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, which no body can understand, the perfect knowledge of which must be reserved for the next World, or the coming of <hi>Elias;</hi> and the mistakes about it have had a bad influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Religion, not only to confound the notions, but to debauch the practice of it. The sum of what I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy said is this; that those Phrases and Metaphors, which represent our Union to Christ, signifie our visible Society with the Christian Church, and our sincere practice of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: when we joyn in Communion
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100660:105"/>
with the Church of Christ, and live in a regular subjection to our spiritual Governours, and a mutual discharge of all Christian offices, when we profess to believe the Gospel, and to obey the Laws of our common Saviour, then we are visibly united to Christ, as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Prince, and Members to their Head; and when this profession is sincere and hearty, when we really are what we pretend to be, then our Union to Christ is real and spiritual too. A visible and real Union to Christ differ as a visible Professor and sincere Christian, the one is a Christian only in show, the other is what he pretends to be: and this Union to Christ enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles us to his peculiar care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to the influences of his Grace, to the power of his Intercession, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us into his nature and likeness, and makes us the Temple of God, wherein he delights to dwell. All this may be understood on this side Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and without sending for <hi>Elias</hi> to unriddle it; and this is all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tells us of our Union to Christ.</p>

                  <p>I Know not whence it comes to pass, that men love to make plain things obscure, and like nothing in Religion but Riddles and Mysteries: God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was pleased to institute a great many Ceremonies (and many of them of very obscure signification) in the Jewish Worship, to awe their childish minds into a greater veneration of his Divine Majesty. But in these last days God hath sent his own Son into the World to make a plain, and easie, and perfect Revelation of his Will, to publish such a Religion, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it self to our reason, and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our affections by its natural charms and beauties; and there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a greater injury to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion than to render it obscure and unintelligible: and yet too many there are, who despise every thing, which they understand, and think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a sufficient tryal of their Faith,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100660:106"/>
but what contradicts the sense and reason of mankind. I might give you too many instances of this, but our present Argument may serve instead of many. There is nothing more easie to be understood than our <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Communion with Christ,</hi> and it had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly continued so, had not some men undertook to explain it, who have now made it <hi>more than mystical,</hi> that is, an <hi>unintelligible Union;</hi> though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that is the least fault, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood; for as they have ordered the matter, it is made to serve a great many evil purposes, and to overthrow the main Designs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. And to make this appear, I shall as briefly and plainly, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will bear, represent to you those other opinions concerning our Union to Christ, which are now in great vogue in the World, and do very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly challenge to themselves the name of <hi>Gospel-Mysteries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As first when we inquire what this Union betwixt Christ and Believers<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb.</hi> on <hi>Rom. 8.</hi> pag. 42.</note> is, they answer <hi>in general, that it is a mystical Union through the Spirit and Faith.</hi> This <hi>Mystical</hi> is a hard word, and therefore to explain it, they tell
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100660:107"/>
us, <hi>that this mystical Union is an Union of Persons, where yet Persons and Natures</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> 
                     <hi>are distinct. As there is an Union of three Persons in one Nature in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of two Natures in one Person in Christ,</hi> which is the <hi>Hypostatical</hi> Union, so the <hi>mystical Union is an Union of Persons, where both Persons and Natures are distinct: and it is an Union of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but no Personal Union. The Person of Christ is united to the person of the Believer, and the person of the Believer is united to the Person of Christ</hi> (as it must needs be where the Person of Christ is united to the person of the Believer) <hi>which Union is made by Faith, which receives the Person of Christ, and therefore must unite to the Person of Christ</hi> (I doubt that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not good, for men are not united to every thing they receive, but yet what follows may help it out) <hi>as it is in the Marriage-Union, which joyns person to person.</hi> This is not very clear yet, and therefore as a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler explication of it, the same Author describes it thus, <hi>This mystical Union</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>is that supernatural, spiritual, intimous Oneness and Conjunction, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Person of Christ and the person</hi>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:100660:107"/>
                     <hi>of Believers, through the bonds of the Spirit and Faith, upon which there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows mutual and reciprocal Communion with each other. This Oneness and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> are hard words still, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to explain them, you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, <hi>that Christ and Saints are united, how? why in respect of that Oneness and Conjunction that is between them.</hi> This now is as plain as one could wish, <hi>they are one by their Oneness.</hi> Union is Union, and Christ is Christ, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are Believers, and Oneness is Oneness, and thus Christ and Believers are united by their Oneness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But what are the bonds of this Union?</hi> (though it had been convenient first to have understood the Union better) <hi>why they are the Spirit and Faith, the Spirit unites Christ to us, and Faith unites us to Christ:</hi> and who can deny this to be a very mystical Union? But besides this <hi>mystical Union,</hi> there<note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> is <hi>a Legal or Law-Union betwixt Christ and Believers, as he is their surety and a moral Union, the foundation of which is Love</hi> (of which more in its proper place) <hi>and thus the Person of Christ and the person of Believers are united mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, legally, morally.</hi> The design of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100660:108"/>
all these distinctions is to prove the Union of Persons betwixt Christ and Believers, and because I find this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath bewildred himself, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to help him out; for it is a very plain case: if Christ and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are united, their Persons must be united too; for the Person of Christ is Christ himself, and the Persons of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are the believers themselves, and I cannot understand, how they can be united without their Persons, that is without themselves: but then they are united by mutual relations, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of a Prince and his Subjects, of a Husband and his Wife are united, or by mutual affections, or common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, not by a natural adhesion of Persons; but because I find it doth not satisfie these men, that Christ and believers are united, unless their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons be united too, it makes me suspect that there is a greater Mystery in this <hi>Union of Persons,</hi> than every one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends; and therefore,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us inquire, what they mean by the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> to which believers must be united. And here they have out-done all the metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal subtilties of <hi>Suarez,</hi> and have found
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100660:108"/>
out a <hi>Person</hi> for Christ distinct from his <hi>Godhead</hi> and <hi>Manhood:</hi> for there can be no other sense made of what Dr.<note place="margin">Commun. with Christ pag. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>Owen</hi> tells us, <hi>That by the Graces of his Person, he doth not mean the glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of his Deity considered in it self, abstracting from the office, which for us as God and Man he undertook, nor the outward appearance of his humane nature neither, when he converst here on Earth, nor yet as now exalted in glory; But the graces of the Person of Christ, as he is vested with the office of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; His spiritual eminency, comeliness, beauty, as appointed and anointed by the Father unto that great work of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home all his Elect into his bosom.</hi> Now unless the <hi>Person of Christ as Mediator,</hi> be distinct from his <hi>Person,</hi> as <hi>God Man,</hi> all this is idle talk; for what <hi>Personal Graces</hi> are there in Christ as <hi>Mediator,</hi> which do not belong to him either as God, or Man? there are some things indeed which our Saviour did and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, which he was not obliged to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as, <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> but as <hi>Mediator,</hi> but surely he will not call the peculiar duties and actions of an office, <hi>Personal Graces.</hi> His <hi>Personal Graces</hi> fitted him for the discharge of his <hi>Mediatory of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:100660:109"/>
but whatever <hi>Personal Graces</hi> are in Christ, belong to his <hi>Person</hi> still, are seated either in his Divine or Humane Nature, and he hath no <hi>Personal Graces</hi> as <hi>Mediator,</hi> which he hath not either as <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi> And the <hi>Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> when he accommodates the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, the Spouse gives of her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, to Christ, tells us, <hi>That he is</hi>

                     <hi>white in the glory of his Deity, and ruddy in the preciousness of his humanity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause white is the complexion of glory, and ruddy is very applicable to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, because man was called</hi> Adam <hi>from the red Earth, whereof he was made;</hi> which are excellent proofs, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>white and ruddy</hi> belong to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane nature, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to his <hi>Mediatory office,</hi> for <hi>he had been white in the glory of his Deity, and ruddy with the red Earth of his humanity,</hi> whether he had been consider'd as <hi>Mediator,</hi> or not. And in his first digression concerning the<note place="margin">Pag. 64.</note> 
                     <hi>excellency of Christ Iesus,</hi> to invite us to Communion with him in a Conjugal relation, he tells us, <hi>that Christ is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding excellent and desireable in his Deity, and the glory thereof, He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable and worthy our acceptation, as</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:100660:109"/>
                     <hi>consider'd in his Humanity, in his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from sin, and fulness of Grace, &amp;c.</hi> Now though this look very like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to what he said before, that by the <hi>graces of his Person,</hi> he meant neither the <hi>excellencies of his divine, nor humane nature,</hi> yet he hath a salvo, which will deliver him both from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and from sense; <hi>that he doth not consider these excellencies of his Deity or Humanity, as abstracted from his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Mediator:</hi> though he might, if he pleased, for he considers those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, which are not peculiar to the office of Mediation, but which would have belong'd to him, as God and Man whether he had been Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or not: but what becomes of his distinction of the <hi>Graces of Christs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as Mediator, from the Graces of his Person as God and Man:</hi> when there are no <hi>Personal</hi> Graces in Christ, but what belong to his <hi>Deity</hi> or <hi>Humanity:</hi> and then you can find no other <hi>Person</hi> to be the subject of these <hi>Personal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,</hi> unless his <hi>office of Mediation</hi> must go for a <hi>distinct Person,</hi> which is a new kind of <hi>heresie.</hi> But whatever becomes of the sense of the distinction, there is a very deep fetch in it, the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100660:110"/>
observing of which will discover the whole Mystery of the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> and <hi>our Union to him:</hi> for these men consider, that Christ saves us, as he is our <hi>Mediator,</hi> and not meerly consider'd as God or Man, and they imagine, that we receive Grace and Salvation from Christs Person, just as we do water out of a Conduit, or a gift and largess from a Prince; that it flows to us from our Union to his <hi>Person;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they dress up the <hi>Person of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> with all those personal graces and excellencies, which may make him a fit Saviour, that those, who are thus united to his <hi>Person,</hi> (of which more in the next Section) need not fear mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Salvation: Hence they ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack all the boundless perfections of the Deity, and whatever they can find or fancy, which speaks any comfort to Sinners, this is presently a <hi>Personal Grace</hi> of the Mediator: they consider all the glorious effects of his Mediation, and whatever great things are spoken of his Gospel or Religion, or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us, these serve as <hi>Personal Graces</hi> too; that all our hopes may be built, not on the <hi>Gospel Covenant,</hi> but on the <hi>Person of Christ:</hi> so that the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100660:110"/>
dispute now lies between the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Gospel;</hi> which must be the foundation of our hope, which is the way to life and happiness.</p>
                  <p>To make this appear, I shall consider that account, which Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> gives us, of the <hi>Personal graces and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, pag. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>of Christ,</hi> which in general consist in three things. <hi>First, His fitness to save from the grace of Union, and the proper and necessary effects thereof: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, His fulness to save from the Grace of Communion, or the free conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Grace of Union: and Thirdly, His excellency to endear from his compleat sutableness to all the wants of the Souls of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That he is fit to be a Saviour from the Grace of Union,</hi> and if you would understand what this strange <hi>Grace of Union</hi> is, <hi>it is the uniting the nature of God and Man in one Person, which makes him fit to be a Saviour to the uttermost: He lays his hands upon God by partaking of his nature.</hi> Zachar. 13. 7. <hi>and he lays his hands on us by partaking of our nature;</hi> Hebr. 2. 14. 16. <hi>and so becomes a days-man or Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire between both:</hi> now though this be a great truth, that the Union of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100660:111"/>
Divine and Humane Nature in Christ did excellently qualifie him for the Office of a Mediator, yet this is the unhappiest man in expressing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, that I have met with: for what an untoward representation is this of Christs Mediation, that he came to make peace <hi>by laying his hands on God and men,</hi> as if he came to part a <hi>Fray</hi> or <hi>Scuffle:</hi> and he might as well have named <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. or <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 1. or any other place of Scripture for the proof it, as those he mentions: but to let that pass, in his <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses this more at large, and thither I shall follow him. Where he tells us, <hi>how glorious Christ is in his Deity, and how desirable in his Humanity, and what are the glorious effects of the Union of the Divine and Humane Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>first, how excellent and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Christ is in his Deity.</hi> From the Deity of Christ he observes, <hi>the endless, bottomless, boundless grace and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that is in him. It is not the grace of a Creature, no not of the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, that can serve our turn; if it could be conceived as separate from the Deity, surely so many thirsty guilty Souls, as every day drink deep and large</hi>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:100660:111"/>
                     <hi>draughts of grace and mercy from him, would (if I may so speak) sink him to the very bottom, nay it could afford no supply at all, but only in a moral way</hi> (and that is a very pitiful way indeed) <hi>But when the Conduit of his Humanity is inseparably united to the infinite inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible Fountain of the Deity, who can look into the depths thereof: If now there be grace enough for sinners in an alsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient God, it is in Christ</hi>—On this ground it is, <hi>That if all the World should (if I may so say) set themselves to drink free grace, and mercy, and pardon, drawing waters continually from the Wells of Salvation; if they should set themselves to draw from one single pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, an Angel standing by, and crying, Drink, O my Friends, yea drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, take as much grace and pardon, as shall be abundantly sufficient for the World of sin, which is in every one of you, they would not be able to sink the grace of the promise</hi> (of the Person of Christ you mean) <hi>one hairs breadth—The infiniteness of Grace with respect to its Spring or Fountain</hi> (the Deity of Christ) <hi>will answer all objections—What is our finite guilt before it</hi> (a World of sin is something, though it
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100660:112"/>
hear no proportion indeed to infinite Grace) <hi>shew me the Sinner that can spread his iniquity to the dimensions (if I may so say)</hi> (no man ever had more need, nor made better use of <hi>so says) of this grace: here is mercy enough for the greatest, the oldest, the stubbornest transgressor, &amp;c.</hi> enough in all reason this, what a comfort is it to sinners to have such a God for their Saviour, whose Grace is <hi>boundless</hi> and <hi>bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> and <hi>exceeds the largest dimensions of their sins,</hi> though there be a World of sin in them? But what now if the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> it self have not such an <hi>endless, boundless, bottomless grace and compassion,</hi> as the <hi>Dr. now</hi> talks of? For at other times, when it serves his turn better, we can hear nothing from him but the <hi>naturalness of Gods vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Iustice.</hi> Though God be rich in mercy, he never told us yet, that his mercy was so boundless and bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less: he hath given a great many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of the severity of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against sinners, who could not be much worse, than the <hi>greatest, the oldest, and stubbornest transgressors.</hi> But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Divine Nature were such a <hi>bottomless Fountain of Grace,</hi> how comes
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100660:112"/>
this to be a <hi>Personal Grace</hi> of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; For a <hi>Mediator,</hi> as <hi>Mediator,</hi> ought not to be considered as the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> but as the <hi>Minister of Grace: God the Father</hi> certainly ought to come in <hi>for a share at least</hi> in being the <hi>Fountain of Grace,</hi> though the Dr. is pleased to take no notice of him. But how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is the Grace of Christs Person above the Grace of the Gospel? For that is a bounded and limited thing, <hi>it is a strait gate, and narrow way that leadeth unto life, there is no such bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less mercy, as all the sins in the World cannot equal its dimensions, as will save the greatest, the oldest, and the stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est transgressors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>the Love of Christ is an eternal Love, because his Divine Nature is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and it is an unchangeable Love, because his Divine Nature is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and his love is fruitful, for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love of God, it must be effectual and fruitful in producing all the things which he willeth unto his Beloved: he loves Life, Grace, Holiness into us, he loves us into Covenant, loves us into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> This is an excellent Love indeed, which doth all for us, and leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for us to do: we owe this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100660:113"/>
see you to an <hi>Acquaintance with Christs Person</hi> (or rather with his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature</hi>) for the <hi>Gospel</hi> is very silent in this matter. All that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel tells us, is, that Christ loved sinners so as to dye for them, and that he loves good men, who believe and obey his Gospel so as to save them, and that he continues to love them, while they continue to be good; but hates them, when they return to their old vices: and therefore I see, there is great reason for sinners to fetch their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, not from the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but from the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> which as far excels the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as the <hi>Gospel</hi> excels the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But methinks this is a very odd way of arguing from the Divine Nature; for if the love of Christ as God, be so infinite, eternal, unchangeable, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I would willingly understand, how sin, and death, and misery came into the World: For if this Love be so eternal and unchangeable, &amp;c. because the Divine Nature is so, then it was always so: for God always was what he is, and that which is eternal, could never be other than it is now; and why could not this eternal, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100660:113"/>
and fruitful love as well preserve us from falling into sin, and misery, and death, <hi>as Love, Life, and Holiness into us;</hi> for it is a little odd, first <hi>to love us into sin and death,</hi> that then he may <hi>love us into Life and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;</hi> which indeed could not be, if this Love of God were always so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable and fruitful, as this Author perswades us, it is now: for if this Love had always <hi>loved Life and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness into us,</hi> I cannot conceive, how it should happen, that we should sin and dye.</p>
                  <p>Not that I deny, that the Love of God is eternal, unchangeable, fruitful, that is, that God was always good, and always continues good, and manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his love and goodness in such ways as are suitable to his Nature, which is the fruitfulness of it: but then the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness of Gods love doth not consist in being always determined to the same object, but in that he always loves for the same reason, that is, that he always loves true vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, where-ever he sees it, and never ceases to love any person, till he ceases to be good, and then the immutability of his Love is the reason, why he loves
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100660:114"/>
no longer; for should he love a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, the reason and nature of his Love would change: And the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of God's Love with respect to the Methods of his Grace and Providence doth not consist in producing what he loves by an omnipotent and irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power (for then sin and death could never have entred into the World) but he governs, and doth good to his Creatures in such ways, as are most suitable to their natures. He governs reasonable Creatures by Principles of Reason, as he doth the material World by the necessary Laws of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and bruit Creatures by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts and Propensities of Nature.</p>
                  <p>From hence he proceeds to shew, <hi>how desirable Christ is in his Humanity, by reason of his freedom from all sin, both Original and Actual, and his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Grace; that all Grace was in him for the kinds thereof, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Grace, for its perfection.</hi> This indeed doth represent him as a very excellent Person, a spotless Sacrifice, and a great Example to the World, but these <hi>personal perfections</hi> cannot pass out of his <hi>Person</hi> to become <hi>ours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:100660:114"/>But then Thirdly, you must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>That all these perfections of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Nature are united in one Person, and this made him fit to suffer, and able to bear whaetever was due unto us, which no Creature could do; for if the weight of our sins had been laid upon a meer innocent Creature, how would they have overwhelmed him, and buried him for ever out of the presence of God?</hi> No doubt the Sacrifice of Christ, who was God-Man, was of greater value, than the Sacrifice of any meer Creature could be, but I know not what this is to his purpose, and do as little admire his <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But his being God and Man, made him an endless, bottomless Fountain of Grace to all that believe:</hi> This he was as God, as we were told before, and his Grace was never the more <hi>bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> for becoming Man. The design, you see, of all this is to make the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ</hi> the <hi>Fountain of all Grace,</hi> from whence we must <hi>drink pardon and mercy</hi> as long as we need any, and such mercy too, as his Gospel is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; he hath a <hi>fulness of all Grace</hi> in himself, and from thence we

must receive the communications of it.</p>
                  <p>And this brings me to the second sort of the <hi>Personal Graces and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of Christ, his fulness to save from the Grace of Communion, or the free consequences of the Grace of Union.</hi> As for this <hi>Grace of Communion</hi> (as he is pleased to call it, though it sounds a little harsh to be a <hi>Personal Grace,</hi> and yet communicated) <hi>whereby Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his fulness to Believers,</hi> I shall reserve it for its proper place, and shall at present only consider, what this <hi>Personal fulness in Christ is,</hi> which he calls, <hi>all the furniture he received</hi>

They say, that these are the <hi>Personal Graces</hi> of Christ, as Mediator, which are <hi>inherent in him;</hi> and must be derived from his <hi>Person;</hi> we say, they signifie the <hi>Perfection and Excellency of his Religion, as being the most compleat and perfect declaration of the will of God, and the most powerful Method of the Divine Wisdom for the reforming the World; as it prescribes the only Righteousness, which is acceptable to God, and directs us in the only way to Life and Immortality.</hi>

                  <p>Now to bring this controversie to an issue, there cannot be a more effectual
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100660:116"/>
way, than to examine those places of Scripture, which speak of this matter, and to learn their sense of it: for if men be allowed to take Scripture phrases, and put what sense they please on them, we may quickly have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different Religions, as there are different fancies among men.</p>
                  <p>To begin then with the <hi>fulness of Christ;</hi> and the first place, in which we meet with it, is in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 16. <hi>And of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi> Now what is meant by this <hi>fulness,</hi> we may learn from <hi>Verse</hi> 14. <hi>The word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

of the Law; is <hi>Truth</hi> in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Types and Figures:</hi> This is the <hi>fullness</hi> we receive from Christ, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect revelation of the Divine Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Salvation of Mankind, which contains so many excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, that it may well be called <hi>Grace;</hi> and prescribes such a plain and simple Religion, so agreeable to the natural notions of good and evil, that it may well be called <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>fulness</hi> dwelt <hi>only</hi> in Christ, and from him alone we receive it; for none of the Prophets, who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, did so perfectly understand the will of God, as he did: <hi>No man hath seen God at any time, but the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. v.</hi> 18.

the design of the Apostle in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to perswade the <hi>Colosians</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Gospel of Christ; not to be seduced either by Jews, or <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> (who talkt very much in their canting phrase of the <hi>pleromata</hi>) to corrupt the Religion of Christ with Jewish Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, or Pagan Superstitions, <hi>Ver.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19. and the principal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he urges to this purpose, is the perfection of the Gospel Revelation, <hi>that in Christ</hi> (that is the Gospel of Christ) <hi>are hid all the Treasures of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge, Ver.</hi> 3. <gap reason="foreign">

And then he adds, <hi>for in him</hi> (that is, in Christ) <hi>dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily:</hi> so that this must refer to that compleat and perfect Revelation of the Gospel, which needs not be supplyed by the Philosophy or Traditions of men. And to understand the Reason of this Phrase, and the force of the Apostles argument, we must consider, that this is an allusion to <hi>Gods dwelling in the Temple</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> which were the <hi>Symbols</hi> of his <hi>presence:</hi> for the Tabernacle or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was Gods House wherein he dwelt, and the mercy seat, and Cherubims, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were the Emblems of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence there, and this Symbolical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God in the Temple was very agreeable to that Symbolical and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial worship, which he then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted and commanded: He dwelt among them by Types and figures, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100660:119"/>
fore instituted a Typical and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Religion; and this was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and obscure Declaration of himself to the World: But now God hath sent his Son to Tabernacle among us. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14. the <hi>Deity it self</hi> now dwells in the <hi>Temple of Christs body,</hi> not by Types and figures, as formerly he dwelt in the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but by a real and immediate presence, and Union; and therefore those Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are made by Christ, are answerable to the <hi>Inhabitation of the Godhead in him,</hi> contain a true and perfect Declaration of Gods will, in opposition to the imperfect Rudiments and obscure Types and figures of the Law. So that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, filled in him; you need no other Instructor but Christ, who hath revealed as much of Gods will, as is necessary for us to know. So that <hi>this fulness of the Godhead dwelling bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in Christ,</hi> does ultimately resolve
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100660:120"/>
it self into the perfection of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Revelation; for since the <hi>fulness of the Deity</hi> did inhabit in <hi>Christs Person,</hi> we need not question, but he was able to acquaint us with the whole mind and will of God, and that he would do so. The force of which Reason our Saviour himself takes notice of <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 34, 35. <hi>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God,</hi> that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth his whole will to us, <hi>for God giveth not the Spirit by measure to him:</hi> It is not with him, as it was with mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Prophets, who had only some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Revelations of the Divine will; <hi>but the fulness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>fulness of Christ,</hi> you see, signifies the excellency and perfection of the Gospel; and in other places this fulness signifies the Church of Christ. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23. <hi>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the Church, which is his body, the fulness of him, that filleth all in all:</hi> Where the <hi>Church</hi> is called the <hi>fulness of Christ,</hi> which makes him (as it were) compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100660:120"/>
for he cannot be a <hi>perfect Head</hi> without a <hi>Body;</hi> hence the <hi>Church</hi> is called <hi>Christ.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many are one body, so also is Christ:</hi> that is the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> as it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows; <hi>for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Iews, or Gentiles, whether we be bond, or free;</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> tells us, that this is the the reason of that phrase, which so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occurs in the New Testament, of <hi>being in Christ,</hi> that is being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Church</hi> is called the <hi>Fulness of Christ</hi> with respect to its extent and universality, that it is not confined to any particular Nation, as the Jewish Church was, but takes in <hi>Iews and Gentiles, Bond and Free:</hi> for this I take to be the meaning of <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>For it pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell,</hi> which words are commonly expounded to the same sense with <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily;</hi> but if we consult the Context, we shall see reason for a different sense, and <hi>Beza</hi> observes, that some Expositors by <hi>his fulness</hi> in this place

understand the <hi>Church:</hi> for <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. the Apostle tells us, that <hi>He is the head of the body, the Church, who is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the first-born from the dead, that in all things he might have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence: for it pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell:</hi> where <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> must be expounded of the <hi>Church,</hi> that it pleased God to unite his Church into Christ; for the Apostle assigns this as the reason of Christs being the <hi>Head of the Church.</hi> And if you would know, why the Church is called <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>all fulness said to dwell in Christ:</hi> the reason follows in 20, 21. <hi>And having made peace through the blood of his Cross to reconcile all things by him, I say, whether they be things in Earth, or things in Heaven. And you, who were sometime alienated, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled.</hi> This is that <hi>fulness that dwells in Christ,</hi> that he is made the Head of the Universal Church both in Heaven and Earth, that Jews and Gentiles are now united in <hi>one Body;</hi> that whereas in former Ages, the <hi>Church of God</hi> seemed to be confined to the <hi>Iewish Nation,</hi> now it pleased the Father, that Christ should
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100660:121"/>
be the <hi>Universal Shepherd and Bishop of Souls,</hi> by him to reconcile all things to himself: and this too is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Phrase, <hi>The fulness of</hi> him, <hi>who filleth all in all:</hi> therefore the Church is called his <hi>Fulness,</hi> because <hi>he filleth all in all:</hi> that is, doth not confine his care and providence, and the influences of his Grace to <hi>any one</hi> Nation or People, but extends it to the <hi>whole World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>fulness of Christ</hi> signifies in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Till we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man, to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</hi>

                  <p>This is all that I can find in Scripture concerning the <hi>fulness of Christ,</hi> which either signifies the perfection of his Gospel, or the Universality of his
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100660:122"/>
Church: which is a plain demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those mens skill in expounding Scripture, who make this fulness a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Grace</hi> in Christ, and apply it to every thing they can find, or fancy, in him: <hi>All the furniture that he received from the Father by the Unction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for the work of our Salvation: The fulness of his Divine and Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the fulness of Love in Christ, the fulness of habitual Grace, fulness of Satisfaction, fulness of Merit, fulness of Power and Vertue, a fulness of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a fulness of Sanctification:</hi> which fulness, I am sure, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded mens notions of Religion, and made them look upon Christ only as a <hi>Fountain,</hi> from whence they must <hi>drink</hi> grace, and mercy, and pardon, justification, and eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Let us now consider in what sense Christ is called <hi>our life:</hi> and he is so called with respect to his Doctrine, his Sacrifice, and that Power he is invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to raise us from the dead. He is called <hi>Life</hi> with respect to his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> because he preached the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> and <hi>hath brought Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light by the Gospel:</hi> hence in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 4. the Evangelist tells us,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100660:122"/>
                     <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men:</hi> That is, he preached the Word of Life, which enlightned the dark minds of men: for it is not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable how <hi>Life</hi> should be light in any other sense, than as this Word of Life, which Christ preached, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their minds, and dispelled all the Mists of Errour and Ignorance: hence Christ tells his Disciples, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh to the Father but by me, Ioh.</hi> 14. 6. that is, I declare the true and only way to life and happiness, and no man can throughly understand the will of God, nor consequently be a true Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of him, without learning of me: thus he calls himself the <hi>Bread of life: Ioh.</hi> 6. with respect to the Doctrine he preached, <hi>Vers.</hi> 33. and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to that Sacrifice he offered for the life of the World, <hi>Vers.</hi> 51. <hi>I am the living Bread, which came down from Heaven, if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever, and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Christ is called <hi>our Life,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath power and authority to bestow <hi>immortal life</hi> upon all his sincere
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100660:123"/>
Followers, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 26, 27. <hi>I am the Resurrection and the Life, he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live, and he that liveth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in me shall never dye:</hi> That is, he hath power to raise the dead, and will actually raise all those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and reward them with eternal life. To the same purpose our Saviour speaks in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 25, 26. <hi>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live; for as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself:</hi> That is, he first raises those who are dead in sin, to a new spiritual life by the power of his Doctrine, &amp; then hath Authority to raise them to an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life. This is the meaning too of that expression in <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3, 4. <hi>You are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God, when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory:</hi> That is, you profess your selves to be dead to this World in conformity to the death of Christ; and though that immortal life, which you expect to enjoy with Christ, who is now risen again from the dead, be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100660:123"/>
at present concealed from your view, yet when Christ, who is the Author of eternal life, and hath power to raise us from the dead, shall appear the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to judge the World, then shall ye appear with him in glory.</p>
                  <p>So that when Christ is called <hi>our Life,</hi> the meaning is, that he hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the Word of Life to us, which contains the most express promises of a blessed Immortality, and the most plain and easie directions how to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: and that by his death he hath expiated our sins, and confirmed all these promises to us; and being risen from the dead himself, hath now pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to raise us. We must not dream of fetching life from the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, as we draw water out of a Fountain; but if we would live for ever with Christ, we must stedfastly believe and obey his Gospel, which is a Principle of a Divine life in us, and then we may joyfully expect, that when our Lord and Saviour comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to judge the World, he will raise us from the dead, and reward our Faith, and Patience, and Obedience with <hi>Immortal Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus to proceed, <hi>Christ is the Power</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:100660:124"/>
                     <hi>of God, and the Wisdom of God,</hi> which these men call <hi>Personal Graces too.</hi> But I have already shewed you at large, that Christ is the Wisdom of God, with respect to those Revelations he made of Gods will. The Gospel of Christ is the Wisdom and Power of God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of God:</hi> that is, the Doctrine of a crucified Christ, as will appear from the verses before: <hi>The Iews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, to the Iews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness; but to them who are called both Iews and Greeks Christ the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God.</hi> The Jews were all for Signs and Miracles, the Greeks were for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Philosophical Speculations, which might gratifie their inquisitive minds, and therefore neither of them could relish that plain simple Doctrine of a crucified Christ, but whatever these men thought of it, the Apostle tells us, that this Doctrine of a crucified Saviour is <hi>the Power of God and Wisdom of God.</hi> That is the most powerful Method which was ever used by God for the reforming the World, and the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100660:124"/>
and effect of excellent Wisdom; and thus the Gospel of Christ is called the <hi>Power of God to Salvation to them that believe:</hi> Rom. 1. 16. and <hi>by this foolishness of Preaching,</hi> that is, by preaching this foolish Doctrine (as it was accounted by the Wise-men of the World) of a crucified Christ, <hi>it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to save them that believe.</hi> Christ indeed being now exalted to the right hand of the Majesty on High, may in a proper sense be called the Power of God, because all power is given to him both in Heaven and Earth, and he hath the supreme government of all the affairs of this spiritual Kingdom; and this is a <hi>Personal</hi> Power inherent in him, which all good men shall find the blessed effects of: but then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of this Power is confined to the Rules of the Gospel, he hath power to save those who believe and obey him, and he hath power to destroy his enemies, to accomplish all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and to execute all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of his Gospel: So that this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Power in Christ can give us no greater encouragement than the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doth; It cannot save any man whom the Gospel condemns, we have
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100660:125"/>
no reason to trust to his Personal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, unless we first obey his Gospel: for how omnipotent soever he be, his Gospel is the measure of his Actings, if that condemns us, his omnipotent Power will not save us. But the chief <hi>Personal Grace,</hi> which these men most vehemently contend for, is still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, <hi>viz. the Righteousness of Christ:</hi> Now no Christian will deny, that Christ was very righteous, a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of universal Holiness and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and it must be confessed, that his Righteousness was not an <hi>imaginary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteousness,</hi> but <hi>Inherent and Personal;</hi> but what comfort is this to us, that Christ was Righteous, if we continue wilful and incorrigible Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Yes, says the Doctor, <hi>Hast thou</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Communion with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. p. 55.</note> 
                     <hi>the sense of guilt upon thee? Christ is compleat Righteousness, the Lord our Righteousness:</hi> This makes Christ suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the wants of a Sinner indeed, that he hath a righteousness for him, which God infinitely prefers before <hi>any home-spun Righteousness of his own.</hi> This is a very comfortable notion for bad men, and such as I would not part with for all the World, did I resolve to live wickedly, and yet intend to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100660:125"/>
get to Heaven: But it is good to be sure in a matter of such importance, and therefore let us consider, in what sense Christ is called <hi>our Righteousness,</hi> and what the Scripture intends by these Phrases of <hi>the Righteousness of God,</hi> or the <hi>Righteousness of Faith, or the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God by Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin then with that famous place in the Old Testament, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23. 6. where Christ is expresly called the <hi>Lord our Righteousness: In his days</hi> Judah <hi>shall be saved, and</hi> Israel <hi>shall dwell safely, and this is his name, whereby he shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness:</hi> a very express place to prove, that <hi>Christ is our Righteousness:</hi> that is, as these men expound it, <hi>that the only righteousness, wherewith we must appear before God, is the righteousness of Christ imputed to us:</hi> but is there no other possible sense to be made of this Phrase? <hi>Righteousness</hi> in Scripture is a word of a very large use, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times signifies no more, than <hi>Mercy, kindness,</hi> and <hi>beneficence,</hi> and so the <hi>Lord our righteousness</hi> is the Lord, who does good to us, who is our Saviour and deliverer: which is very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Reason of this name, <hi>that in</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:100660:126"/>
                     <hi>his days</hi> Judah <hi>shall be saved, and</hi> Israel <hi>shall dwell safely:</hi> And <hi>righteousness</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that part of Justice, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in relieving the injured and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest: thus <hi>David</hi> speaks in <hi>Psalm</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Hear me, when I call, O God of my righteousness:</hi> i. e. <hi>Thou O God, who maintainest my right and my cause. Psalm</hi> 9. 4. Thus in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 54. 17. <hi>No weapon, that is formed against Thee, shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise up against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn; this is the heritage of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, and their righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is of me, saith the Lord.</hi> Which is a parallel expression to the <hi>Lord our righteousness,</hi> and signifies no more than that God will avenge their cause, and deliver them from all their Enemies. The like we have in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 45. 24. <hi>Surely shall one say, in the Lord have I Righteousness and strength; even to him shall men come, and all that are incensed against him, shall be ashamed; in the Lord shall all the Seed of</hi> Israel <hi>be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and shall glory:</hi> that is, the Lord is that just and righteous judg; who will justifie good men, <hi>i. e.</hi> deliver them from the violence and injuries of their Enemies: He is <hi>their righteousness</hi>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:100660:126"/>
                     <hi>and strength,</hi> their righteous, strong, and powerful deliverer: which agrees with that promise in <hi>Verse</hi> 14. <hi>In Righteousness thou shalt be established, thou shalt be far from oppression, thou shalt not fear, and from terrour, for it shall not come near thee.</hi> And to name but one place more: <hi>Isaiah</hi> 61. 10, 11. <hi>I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my Soul shall be joyful in my God, for he hath cloathed me with the garments of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he hath cover'd me with the Robe of Righteousness, as a Bridegroom deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself with Ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth her self with Iewels: for as the Earth bringeth forth her bud, as the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord will cause Righteousness and Praise to spring forth before all Nations.</hi> This sounds very like an <hi>Imputed Righteousness;</hi> for what can be meant by the <hi>Robe of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> but that pure and spotless Robe of Christs Righteousness, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all our sins and deformities, and makes us appear as beautiful and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the eyes of God, as a Bride does, who adorns her self with Jewels? This is the effect of our espousal with Christ, that we are cover'd, and adorn'd
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100660:127"/>
with his Righteousness: but if we will attend to the circumstances of the place, and not to the bare sound of words, we need seek no farther for the confutation of this fancy: for the <hi>Garment of Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Robe of Righteousness,</hi> signifie those great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances God promised to <hi>Israel</hi> in the former <hi>Verses,</hi> which should make them as glorious in the eyes of men, as a splendid garment would: <hi>that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and praise, which God would cause to spring forth before all Nations: even as the Earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the Garden causeth those things which are sown in it to spring forth:</hi> That is, that God would work such great deliverances for them by such improbable means, and in such plenty and abundance, as if they sprang out of the Earth, which should make it appear to all Nations, <hi>That they are the Seed whom the Lord hath blessed:</hi> Vers. 9. And what hath this to do with the <hi>Imputation of Christs Personal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is time now to proceed to the <hi>New Testament;</hi> for indeed we cannot reasonably expect, that so great a <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Mystery,</hi> as this of the <hi>Imputation of</hi>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:100660:127"/>
                     <hi>Christs Righteousness</hi> is, should be so clearly discovered in the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> where the <hi>Gospel</hi> was wrapt up in <hi>Types and Figures.</hi> Now it is very observable, that in all the Histories of the Gospel, which give us an account of our Saviours Sermons and Parables, whereby he instructed the people in all necessary Truths, he makes no mention at all of the <hi>Imputation of his Righteousness</hi> to them, but exacts from them a Righteousness of <hi>their own,</hi> if they would find mercy with God: now it is very strange (if the <hi>Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs Righteousness for our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> be the great Gospel Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the only way to find favour with God) that our Saviour in all his Sermons should not once mention this; that he should not once warn his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (as the <hi>Gospel Preachers</hi> of our days do) to beware of trusting to their <hi>own Righteousness,</hi> or of expecting Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their <hi>own Works;</hi> but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of this, he should so severely enjoyn them the practice of an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Righteousness</hi> as the only thing that pleases God; and so severely threaten those who continue in any sin, <hi>who break the least of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:100660:128"/>
that they shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but shall be banished from the presence of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to outer darkness. This, I confess, to me (who am apt in the first place to admire <hi>our Saviours Sermons, who was the first Author of our Religion,</hi> before the Writings of the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, though inspired men) is a very great prejudice against such notions, as are set up for the <hi>Fundamentals of Christianity,</hi> without the belief of which we cannot be saved, when there is not the least footsteps of them to be seen in the Gospel of our Saviour: for did not our Saviour instruct his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in all things necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or have the Evangelists given us an imperfect account of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Doctrine, and omitted so essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial a part of it, as the <hi>Imputation of his Righteousness?</hi> Chuse which side you please, and the consequence is very bad: if the first, then Christ was not faithful in the discharge of his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Office, did not instruct his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in all things necessary to Salvation; if the latter, you overthrow the <hi>Credit</hi> of the Gospel, and by both destroy the Foundation of our Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:100660:128"/>There were some things indeed, which the <hi>Apostles themselves,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Jewish prejudices, could not understand, while Christ was with them; and therefore he reserved the more perfect Revelation of those Truths till the <hi>descent of the Holy Ghost:</hi> as he tells his Disciples in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 12, 13. Such was that Doctrine of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his <hi>spiritual Kingdom,</hi> which should commence with sufferings and death, whereas they expected a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Messias,</hi> as the rest of the Jews did; and the receiving the <hi>Gentiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church,</hi> which <hi>S. Peter himself</hi> did not understand, till he was instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a Vision, in <hi>Act.</hi> 10. which is so frequently in the Epistles called that <hi>Mystery which was hid from Ages:</hi> but now the knowledge of these things was not absolutely necessary to eternal life, and therefore the perfect revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them might be deferr'd till the most convenient season: It was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary indeed, that the Apostles should understand the full extent of their Commission to preach the Gospel to all Nations, Gentiles as well as Jews; but it was not necessary to know this, till they were sent to preach: but we
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100660:129"/>
cannot imagine, that our Saviour would neglect to acquaint them with the necessary terms and conditions of Salvation: for <hi>his Sermons</hi> were to be the Rule of <hi>theirs;</hi> and had the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles taught any thing as necessary to Salvation, which our Saviour had not taught, especially any thing that did so plainly contradict the Doctrine of our Saviour, as this <hi>imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> doth, it would very much have weakned their credit with me; for this had been to preach another <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> than our Saviour did, and we have S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s command to reject such Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, though they were <hi>Apostles,</hi> or <hi>an Angel from Heaven, Gal</hi> 1. 8, 9. I do not speak this to evacuate the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Apostles, or of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; for they do not make any thing necessary to Salvation, but what Christ did, nor contradict any thing, which Christ hath taught: But to awaken those men, who take little notice of the Gospel of our Saviour, while they fetch all their <hi>Mysterious Divinity</hi> out of some obscure passages of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles; Though S. <hi>Peter</hi> long since told us, <hi>That there were many things in them hard to be understood, which they</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:100660:129"/>
                     <hi>that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other Scripture, to their own destruction,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. and yet if they can meet with any obscure Phrases, which will serve their turn, without considering how their sense agrees with the Gospel of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, they make it the Foundation of their Faith, and a <hi>standing Rule</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Doctrine of our Saviour, and to measure the <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> of all Opinions: whereas on the contrary, this ought to be a sufficient reason to reject such Interpretations, that the Gospel of our Saviour is perfectly si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in a matter pretended to be of such absolute necessity to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Having premised this, it is time now to consider those Texts of Scripture, whereon they found this notion of the <hi>Imputation of Christs Righteousness:</hi> And it is worth observing, that in all the <hi>New Testament</hi> there is no such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression as the <hi>Righteousness of Christ,</hi> or the <hi>Imputation of Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> we there only find the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God,</hi> and the <hi>Righteousness of Faith,</hi> and <hi>the Righteousness of God, which is by the Faith of Iesus Christ;</hi> which is very strange, did the whole

Mystery of the Gospel consist in the <hi>Imputation of Christs Righteousness,</hi> that neither Christ nor his Apostles should once tell us so in express words. But to consider particular places: I shall begin with that Phrase of the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God,</hi> which sometimes signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his <hi>Iustice, Veracity, or Goodness, Rom.</hi> 3. 5. but most commonly in the <hi>New Testament</hi> it signifies <hi>that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness which God approves and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and which he will accept for the Iustification of a Sinner;</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Terms of the Gospel: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>For therein is the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith:</hi> Thus it is called the <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God,</hi> Matth. 6. 33. <hi>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which is the same with the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of his Kingdom: now the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> signifies the <hi>state of the Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> or <hi>of his Kingdom,</hi> that Righteousness which the Gospel prescribes, which is contained in the Sermons and Parables of Christ, and consists in a sincere and universal obedience to the Commands of God.</p>
                  <p>That we may the better understand
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100660:130"/>
this, we must observe farther, that <hi>this Righteousness of God</hi> (that which he commands and rewards) <hi>is the Righteousness of Faith, or Righteousness by the Faith</hi> of Christ: Now <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> is often used obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, for the Gospel of Christ, which is the object of our Faith, or contains those matters which are to be believed; and so the <hi>Righteousness of Faith, or by the Faith of Christ is that Righteousness which the Gospel commands.</hi> Thus in <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 24. <hi>Felix sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the Faith of Christ:</hi> that is, <hi>concerning Righteousness, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and the judgment to come: Ver.</hi> 25. which are the principal matters of the Gospel: thus <hi>obedience to the Faith</hi> is obedience to the <hi>Gospel, Rom.</hi> 1. 5. In this sense <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to each other in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, as hath been abundantly proved by others: the great dispute in the Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> is, whether we must be justified by the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> or by the <hi>Faith of Christ:</hi> that is, whether the observation of all the external Rites and Ceremonies of the Law, and an external conformity of our Actions, to the moral Precepts of it will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100660:131"/>
a man before God; or that sincere and universal obedience, which the <hi>Gospel of Christ</hi> requires, which trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms our minds into the likeness of God, and makes us new Creatures: And that this Righteousness of Faith, and this alone, can recommend us to God, the Apostle proves from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the 4. Chapter; who was accounted Righteous for the sake of his sincere and stedfast belief of Gods promises: <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for Righteousness, Ver.</hi> 3. and this, while he was <hi>uncricumcised,</hi> which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing argument against the Jews, that <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and the observance of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is not necessary to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, because <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was the Father of the faithful, and is set forth for the Pattern of our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was justified without it.</p>
                  <p>But that we may understand, what this justification by Faith is, and how the Apostle argues from <hi>Abrahams</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified by Faith to prove, that we must now be justified by the Faith of Christ, it is necessary to enquire, what that Faith was, whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified, and what agreement
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100660:131"/>
there is between the <hi>Faith of Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Faith in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith was not a <hi>Faith in Christ,</hi> but <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> Christ indeed was the <hi>Material object</hi> of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, that is, he believed that promise, which God made of sending Christ into the World, upon which account our Saviour tells the Jews, <hi>your Father</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to see my day, and he saw it, and was glad: Iohn</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5, 6. But no man could believe in Christ, till he came, that is could not believe any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Authority; which is the true notion of believing in him, as you shall hear more presently.</p>
                  <p>There is not a plainer argument, how apt men are to pervert the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to reconcile them to their own prejudices and preconceived opinions, than to observe what work they make with <hi>Abrahams Faith,</hi> as if that Faith, which was imputed to him for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, were a <hi>fiducial reliance</hi> and <hi>recumbency</hi> on Christ for Salvation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Righteousness of Christ apprehended by Faith was imputed to him: for suppose this <hi>imputation of</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:100660:132"/>
                     <hi>Christs Righteousness</hi> were revealed in the most plain and express words in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> yet it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how <hi>Abraham</hi> should learn this great Mystery from that general and obscure promise, <hi>In thy seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed,</hi> which is all, that was ever revealed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> concerning Christ: This is such a train of thoughts from <hi>in thy seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> to the <hi>imputation of Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> himself could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have hit on: for is there no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible way for God to bless the World, but by the imputation of Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness? or is there such a natural and necessary connexion between this blessing, and the imputation of Christs Righteousness, that we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the one without the other.</p>
                  <p>Pray let us consider, how many things <hi>Abraham</hi> must distinctly know (according to these mens own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) before he could come to the knowledge of the imputation of Christs Righteousness; and he would be a wonderful man indeed, who could learn all this from that general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, without some more particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation:
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100660:132"/>
As first, he must be well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that the <hi>Blessings</hi> here meant are <hi>spiritual blessings, pardon of sin, and eternal life,</hi> and that Christ should be a <hi>spiritual</hi> King and Saviour, and though this be the least difficulty of all, yet the promise is not so clear and express in this matter, but that men might mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake it, and so we know, the <hi>whole Iewish Nation</hi> for many Ages did, who had more particular promises concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ, than this was, and yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected only a <hi>Temporal Prince,</hi> who should sit on the <hi>Throne of David,</hi> and subdue their Enemies under their feet; and this was the great prejudice, which the <hi>Iews</hi> had against Christ and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that he so much deceived their expectations by his <hi>mean appearance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And secondly <hi>Abraham</hi> must know too, that Christ was to die for the sins of the World, without which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctor) it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God should forgive sin, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>naturalness of his vindictive Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to him;</hi> and this was more than the <hi>Apostles</hi> of Christ themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood till after his Resurrection, though Christ had expresly told them of it: And Thirdly, He must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100660:133"/>
also the perfect Holiness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of Christs life, and that he fulfilled all righteousness, not for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> but for <hi>us:</hi> Nay Fourthly, He must understand that great Mystery of the <hi>Incarnation of the Son of God;</hi> for without this it is impossible to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the vertue and efficacy of his expiation, and Sacrifice, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, since the sufferings of a meer man could never expiate sin, nor his Righteousness serve any more than himself: And Fifthly, He must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand also that <hi>intimate oneness</hi> and Conjunction, which is betwixt Christ and his Church, by vertue of which Union believers may challenge a right to all, that Christ did and suffer'd, which is such a riddle, as these men explain it, as is not understood to this day: And Sixthly, He must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand too the nature of Faith, of <hi>rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Soul on Christ for Salvation, and renouncing all <hi>Righteousness of his own,</hi> and then possibly he might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado understand this great Mystery of the <hi>imputation of Christs Righteousness,</hi> and he that can believe, that <hi>Abraham</hi> could learn all this from that general promise, <hi>In</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:100660:133"/>
                     <hi>thy seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed,</hi> may believe, what he will, and I suppose no man will trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to confute him.</p>
                  <p>Now if you would know, what the <hi>Faith of Abraham,</hi> and of all good men in ancient times was, the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> gives us a full account of it, in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. That he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses there of a <hi>justifying</hi> Faith, that is, such a Faith <hi>as renders men approved of God, &amp; which he will count for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> appears from the whole tenour of this Chapter. In the 2. <hi>Verse</hi> he tells us, <hi>That by this the Elders obtained a good report, i. e.</hi> the Fathers of the Old Testament were approved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by God for the sake of this Faith: as he shows particularly that <hi>Abel obtained witness, that he was Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, v.</hi> 4. that <hi>Enoch</hi> had the <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that he pleased God, v.</hi> 5. that <hi>Noah</hi> became <hi>the Heir of Righteousness which is by Faith, v.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this <hi>justifying</hi> Faith is the <hi>substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen:</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap> an argument of the being of those things, which we do
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100660:134"/>
not see; that is, Faith is such a firm and stedfast perswasion of the truth of those things, which are not evident to sense, as makes us confidently hope for them: The object of Faith must be unseen things, as the Being, or provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, or a future state, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing past or to come; the Creation of the World, or the final dissolution of it, or the accomplishment of any promises, and predictions; the nature of Faith consists in such a firm assent to these unseen things, as produces some answerable effects in our lives; This is the general notion of Faith, <hi>by which the Elders obtained a good report,</hi> and the different sorts of Faith result from the different objects and motives of it: the Apostle takes notice of two kinds of Faith in this Chapter, and <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> makes a third, which are all the kinds of Faith, the Scripture is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>
                  <p>The first we may call a natural Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> a belief of the Principles of natural Religion, which is founded upon natural demonstrations, or moral arguments; <hi>as that God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them, that diligently seek him,</hi> which was the Faith of <hi>Abel</hi>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:100660:134"/>
and <hi>Enoch,</hi> whereby they pleased God: for there being no mention made of the Faith of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> in the old Testament, the Apostle proves, that they were true believers, because they had this Testimony, <hi>that they pleased God;</hi> now it is impossible to be sincerely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, or to do any acceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God without the belief of his Being, and Providence, and care of good men: These are the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all Religion, and God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no more of those good men, who had no other particular Revelations of his will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a Faith in God, or a belief of those particular Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which God made to the Fathers of the Old Testament: of this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle gives us many examples in this Chapter: Thus <hi>Noah</hi> believed God, when he fore-warned him of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal deluge, and in obedience to him, provided an Ark for the safety of himself, and his Family, and this was imputed to him for Righteousness: <hi>He became the Heir of the Righteousness, which is by Faith:</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> in obedience to the Divine Revelation left his own Country and Fathers House,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100660:135"/>
and went into a strange Land: thus <hi>Sarah</hi> by believing the promise of God, <hi>received strength to conceive Seed, and was deliver'd of a Child, when she was past age; because she judged him faithful, who had promised.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God offered his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> which was as Heroical an Act of Faith, as was ever done by Man: for besides that great and passionate kindness he had for his <hi>only Son,</hi> which made this a very difficult tryal; this command of offering his Son seem'd to thwart that former promise, <hi>In Isaac shall thy Seed be called, i. e.</hi> that from <hi>Isaac</hi> should proceed that numerous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, which God had promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was not very likely, when this very <hi>Isaac</hi> must be offer'd in Sacrifice, and die without leaving any Child to succeed him; but yet <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was so well assured both of the faithfulness and power of God, that whatever impossibilities humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son suggested, he would neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey Gods command, nor distrust his promise, <hi>but did believe in hope against hope:</hi> the like examples we have of the Faith of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and <hi>Moses, &amp;c.</hi> who firmly believed
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100660:135"/>
all those particular Revelations God made to them, and confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the performance of all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, how unlikely soever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to be: This is that Faith, whereby <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the good men in those days were justified, <hi>viz. Such a firm belief of the Being and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and all those particular Revelations God made to them, as made them careful in all things to please God, and to obey him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence we learn thirdly, What <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> is, which is now impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us for Righteousness, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Faith was to him; for to make our <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> answer to the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all good men in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, (without which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles argument from <hi>Abrahams</hi> being justified by Faith to our justification by Faith is of no force) our <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> must signifie <hi>such a stedfast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of all those Revelations, which Christ hath made to the World, as governs our lives and Actions: Abraham</hi> was justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by believing those Revelations, which God made to him, and we are justified by believing those Revelations, which Christ hath made of Gods will to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100660:136"/>
us; for if by the <hi>Righteousness of Faith,</hi> you understand the <hi>Righteousness of Christ apprehended by Faith and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us,</hi> you utterly destroy the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles argument for our justification by Faith: for <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the good men of old were not justified by such a Faith as this; they never hear'd of the <hi>Righteousness of Christ imputed to us:</hi> Noah <hi>was made Heir of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that is, was accounted a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Person, because he believed that the <hi>World should be drown'd,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared an Ark at Gods command for himself and his Family: <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith was <hi>imputed to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> because he left his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and followed God into a strange land, and believed, that God would give him a Son, and make him the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many Nations, when he and his Wife were so old, that according to the course of nature, they could not expect any Child: and when <hi>Sarah</hi> by Faith had conceived, and brought forth this <hi>Son of the Promise,</hi> he offers this Son at Gods command without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusting the performance of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: Now what hath all this to do with an <hi>Imputation of Christs Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness?</hi>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:100660:136"/>
how does it follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by such noble and generous Acts of Faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall be justified by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Christs Righteousness, by <hi>rowling our Souls</hi> on Christ for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: These two Faiths are of as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds, as can well be imagined, and therefore we cannot reason from one to the other, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood himself better, than to argue at this weak rate.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to bring this discourse to an Head, the difference between the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Faith of Christians is this, <hi>that Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved God, and it was counted to him for Righteousness,</hi> and we believe in Christ, and this is counted unto us for Righteousness; <hi>Abraham</hi> believed those Revelations God made to him, either immediately by himself, or by the Ministry of Angels, we believe all those Revelations God hath made to us by his <hi>own Son: for God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past to the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son: Hebr.</hi> 1. 1. So that the first notion of Faith in Christ is a firm belief of his Divine Authority,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100660:137"/>
which necessarily draws after it a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the whole Doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: thus in <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 31. <hi>The Christian Faith is described by believing that Iesus is the Christ, the Son of God:</hi> and 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Who is he that overcometh the World, but he that believeth, that Iesus is the Son of God:</hi> That is, that he came from God with full power and Authority to declare his will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and ratifie the new Covenant. So that the difference between the <hi>Faith of Abraham</hi> and <hi>Faith in Christ is,</hi> that <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith was founded on the immediate inspirations of God, or the Revelations of Angels, but a Faith in Christ is founded on the Authority of Christ, which is the first object of the Christian Faith; and the reason and foundation of all other Acts of Faith: <hi>Abraham</hi> had only some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Revelations, as the object of his Faith, but now Christ hath made a perfect Revelation of the whole will of God, which is the object of our Faith; and thus the Christian Faith excells all other kinds of Faith, as much as the Revelations of the Gospel excel all other Revelations made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and other good men: but still the end of all Faith is the same to govern our
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100660:137"/>
lives, and make us obedient in all things to God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, without which no Faith can justifie.</p>
                  <p>And the same difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Righteousness of Faith in a general notion, as it is applyed to <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and those worthies of old, and <hi>the Righteousness of God by the Faith of Iesus Christ: Rom.</hi> 3. 22. and that <hi>Righteousness which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith: Phil.</hi> 3. 9. The first signifies that Righteousness which is owing to an hearty belief of the Being and Providence of God, and those particular Revelations, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God; the latter is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a sincere belief and obedience to the Gospel, which is the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Revelation, which God ever made of his will to mankind. This is so plain and easie an account of the rise and use of these phrases, and of the force of the Apostles reasoning from the <hi>Faith of Abraham</hi> to the <hi>Faith of Christ</hi> (which is unintelligible in any other way) that could men be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to plain sense, it would need no other confirmation but the natural evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of naked and simple truth. But not to be wanting to a good cause, let
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100660:138"/>
us now examine those Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are abused by these men to set up the <hi>Personal Righteousness of Christ as the only formal cause of our justification,</hi> as that alone which can make us righteous before God.</p>
                  <p>I shall begin and end with that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. (for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this will give us occasion to consider all the material passages of Scripture, which are applyed to this purpose) <hi>yea doubtless, and I account all things loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whom I have suffer'd the loss of all things, and I do account them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness, which is of God by Faith:</hi> by <hi>my own righteousness</hi> these men understand <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousness,</hi> whatever good St. <hi>Paul</hi> had done, either while he was a Jew, or after his Conversion to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity: this he rejects, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>righteousness, which is through the Faith of Christ,</hi> must needs be an <hi>imputed Righteousness,</hi> the <hi>Personal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ apprehended by Faith,</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:100660:138"/>
                     <hi>and imputed to us.</hi> This is fairly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, but what proof have they for it? That, I confess, I cannot learn, only it is taken for granted, that <hi>my Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> signifies <hi>inherent Righteousness,</hi> and the <hi>Righteousness of Faith imputed Righteousness,</hi> and it is a sufficient ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to this to say, they need not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie so. <hi>My own Righteousness</hi> can sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no more than that, in which he placed his Righteousness, whatever it was; and what necessity is there to understand this of <hi>Inherent Holiness;</hi> an <hi>external</hi> Righteousness serves most mens turn very well, and this is the <hi>righteousness</hi> by which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> (and amongst the rest St. <hi>Paul,</hi> while he was a <hi>Pharisee</hi>) expected to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for what his Righteousness was he tells us in <hi>Ver.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>Circumcised the eight day; of the stock of</hi> Israel, <hi>of the Tribe of</hi> Benjamin, <hi>an Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the Law a Pharisee</hi> (who were mighty strict and punctual in observing all external Ceremonies) and he exprest his <hi>zeal</hi> for the law of <hi>Moses, by persecuting the Christian Church,</hi> and <hi>touching the Righteousness, which is in the Law, he was blameless:</hi> which last phrase, <hi>touching the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>

                     <hi>of the law blameless,</hi> signifies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>an external blamelessness of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: for this was the Pharisees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even of the <hi>moral law,</hi> that the obligation of it did reach no farther than the outward man, and <hi>Trypho the Iew in Iustin Martyr</hi> quarrels with the Gospel of our Saviour for this very reason, that it requires the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our thoughts and passions, which, he says, is impossible for a man to do: and thus we must understand this <hi>blamelessness</hi> here, unless we will say, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> while he was a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee, did perfectly observe the <hi>moral law,</hi> was blameless before God as well as before men, which I suppose those who talk so much of the impossibility of keeping Gods laws, will be loath to owne. So that <hi>my own Righteousness, which is of the law</hi> is so far from signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying an <hi>inherent Righteousness,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and vital principle of holiness, that it signifies only an <hi>external Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> which consisted in some <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rites,</hi> as <hi>Circumcision and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>external priviledges,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>of the Seed of</hi> Abraham, and <hi>stock of</hi> Israel, or an <hi>external Civility and</hi>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:100660:139"/>
                     <hi>blamelessness of Conversation,</hi> and this Righteousness he had reason to reject, because God will reject it.</p>
                  <p>This was all the Righteousness he had, while he was a Pharisee, and <hi>this he accounts dung and loss for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the knowledge of Iesus Christ our Lord; i. e.</hi> for the sake of the Gospel (which is the knowledge of Christ, as you hear'd above) which contains a more excellent and perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than the Law did: and that <hi>he might win Christ, i. e.</hi> that he might attain to an Evangelical Righteousness, such as Christ was the Preacher, and example of: and <hi>that he might be found in him, not having his own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is of the law:</hi> that at the last day he might appear to be a sound and sincere Christian, whose righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness does not consist only in some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal observances, or an external Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Gods Law, <hi>but that, which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which is of God by Faith: i. e.</hi> that inward and vital principle of holiness, that new nature, which the Gospel of Christ requires of us, and which this Christian Faith will work in us; which is a Righteousness of Gods own chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100660:140"/>
which he commands, and which he will reward.</p>
                  <p>To confirm all this we must observe a double <hi>Antithesis</hi> in the words, the <hi>Righteousness of the law</hi> is opposed to the <hi>Righteousness, which is by the Faith of Christ,</hi> and <hi>my own Righteousness</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the <hi>Righteousness of God;</hi> now the surest way to understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this is to consider, how these phrases are used in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Righteousness of the law</hi> (as you have already hear'd) is an <hi>external Righteousness,</hi> which consists in wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and purifications, and Sacrifices, or an external Conformity to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law: the <hi>Righteousness, which is by the Faith of Christ,</hi> is an <hi>Internal</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which consists in the reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our minds and Spirits, in the government of our thoughts and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which is therefore called <hi>being born again,</hi> and becoming <hi>new Creatures,</hi> and <hi>rising again with Christ,</hi> and <hi>putting off the old man,</hi> and being <hi>renewed in the spirit of our minds, and putting on the new man, which after God is created in Righteousness and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</hi> The meaning of all which phrases is that that Righteousness
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100660:140"/>
which God requires of us under the Gospel must be an inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of love and obedience, which changes our natures and transforms us into the image of God, as much as if we were born again, and made new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why God sent Christ into the World in our nature, to die as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our sins, and to confirm and seal the new Covenant with his blood was, <hi>that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit, Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4. <gap reason="foreign">

the <hi>Typical and Figurative</hi> Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law.</p>
                  <p>I know very well, that this place is expounded of the <hi>imputation</hi> of Christs Righteousness, that we fulfil the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law, not <hi>personally,</hi> but <hi>imputatively:</hi> but what reason can there be assigned for this, besides that they will expound Scripture so, which no man can help: for is there any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here of the Righteousness of Christ? that he fulfilled all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for us, and that his Righteousness is imputed to us, and so we fulfil the Righteousness of the law in him? And we ought to consider, how consistent such an interpretation is with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles design, which is to show the great vertue and efficacy of the Gospel in delivering us from the power of sin, which the law could not effect: <hi>The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Iesus</hi> (that divine and spiritual law, which Christ hath given us, which governs our minds and spirits, and is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of a new spiritual life) <hi>makes us free from the law of sin and death</hi> (from the power and dominion of sin, which is called <hi>a law,</hi> and the <hi>law in our members warring against the law of our</hi>

What pretty sense would this make of the Apostles Argument? The Law was too weak to make men throughly good, to conquer their love to sin, and to reform their hearts and lives; and therefore God sent his Son into the World; What for? To give them better laws, and more excellent promises, and more powerful assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to do good? No, by no means, but to fulfil all righteousness for them, that they may fulfil the righteousness of the law, not by doing any thing themselves, but, by having all done for them, by having this perfect Righteousness of Christ imputed to them: there was no
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100660:142"/>
reason surely to abrogate the <hi>law of Moses</hi> for this end; it might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in full force still, and have been as available to Salvation as the Gospel is, <hi>with the supplemental Righteousness of Christ:</hi> But the <hi>weakness of the law,</hi> which the Apostle complains of, was, not the want of an <hi>imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> (which might have been had as well under the Law, as under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, if God had pleased) but, a want of strength and power to subdue the sinful appetites of men, <hi>it was weak through the flesh,</hi> by reason of the greater prevalency of sensual lusts, which the law could not conquer; and therefore the Gospel of our Saviour must supply this defect, not by an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteousness,</hi> but, by an addition of greater power to enable men to do that which is good, to fulfil the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteousness of the law by a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and spiritual obedience.</p>
                  <p>Much to the same purpose the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle discourses in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>Wherefore my Brethren, you also are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dead to the law by the body of Christ</hi> (who put an end to that imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect dispensation by his death) <hi>that you should be marryed to another, even to</hi>

Apostle, which can never be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with an <hi>imputed Righteousness,</hi> which would make his argument fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish and absurd: and therefore in other places, he tells us, what little reason we have to be so zealous for the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> since we have the perfection of it in the Gospel: what need is there of the <hi>Circumcision of the flesh,</hi> which the law required? when in the Gospel <hi>we have that Circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the Circumcision of Christ;</hi> which is the <gap reason="foreign">

The Apostle explains what he means by this in the following Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, where he gives us a description of the <hi>righteousness of the law,</hi> and the <hi>righteousness of Faith:</hi> The righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the law is an external Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the letter of the Law, <hi>The man that doth them shall live in them: i. e.</hi> shall enjoy all those temporal blessings of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which were promised to the observance of the Law: but the righteousness of Faith is a firm and stedfast belief of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of Christ, <hi>that he is the Lord;</hi> and more particularly a belief of his <hi>Resurrection from the dead,</hi> as the last and great confirmation, which God gave to the Divinity of Christs Person and Doctrine: This is that Faith that
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100660:144"/>
overcomes the World, and purifies the heart, and transforms us into the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, which is the perfection of all the ritual righteousness of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account Christ is said to be <hi>made unto us righteousness.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>But of him are you in Christ, who of God is made unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption: i. e.</hi> he is the Author of all this to us; He is <hi>our Wisdom,</hi> as he is our great Prophet and Teacher, who instructs us in true Wisdom; <hi>Our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> as we are justified by Faith in him, by a sincere belief of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is the only Righteousness acceptable to God; <hi>Our Sanctification,</hi> because the <hi>law of the spirit of life in Christ Iesus, makes us free from the law of sin and death:</hi> that Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>law of Faith</hi> conquers the Power and Dominion of sin, which the <hi>law of Moses</hi> could not do: and <hi>our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> as by these means he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd us from the bondage and peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogie of the Jewish Law, from the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Customs of the Heathens, and the Tyranny of wicked Spirits, and from the wrath of God, which is the just merit and desert of sin.</p>

                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:100660:144"/>Thus you see how the Apostle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the <hi>righteousness of the law</hi> to the <hi>righteousness of Faith,</hi> not as an <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> and <hi>Personal</hi> to an <hi>Imputed</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, but as an <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Ritual</hi> to an <hi>Inherent, real,</hi> and <hi>substantial</hi> Righteousness, this is the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:100660:145"/>Let us now consider in what sense the Apostle opposes his <hi>own</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to the Righteousness of God: <hi>not having mine own Righteousness, but the Righteousness which is of God by Faith;</hi> and there is no great difficulty in this; for the Apostle himself tells us, that by his <hi>own righteousness,</hi> he means the <hi>righteousness of the law,</hi> and by the <hi>Righteousness of God, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Faith: And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness which is of God by Faith:</hi> and what that is, you have already heard: thus in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>For they being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Gods Righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the Righteousness of God:</hi> where their <hi>own righteousness,</hi> which the Jews so obstinately adhered to, was the <hi>righteousness of the law,</hi> and the <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> which they were ignorant of, and would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, was the <hi>Righteousness of Faith:</hi> for this was the great controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jews and Apostles (which is the subject of this Epistle) whether men were to be justified by the <hi>law of</hi>

                     <hi>Moses,</hi> or by the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> by a legal, or Evangelical Righteousness, as appears from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30. <hi>Israel, which followed after righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness; wherefore? because they sought it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the law:</hi> that is the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so earnestly after Righteousness, are excluded from righteousness, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of sins, and are under a Curse, because they did not look for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and Justification in the way, which God prescribed, which is <hi>by Faith in Christ,</hi> or <hi>by Christianity,</hi> but by the observance of the <hi>law of Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the most obvious Reason, why this <hi>righteousness of the law</hi> is called their <hi>own righteousness,</hi> and the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Faith, Gods Righteousness,</hi> is, because this <hi>legal righteousness</hi> was a way of justification, not of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment but their own chusing; God never designed, that any man should be justified to eternal life by observing the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but yet they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently expected justification by that Law, and for that reason rejected the Gospel of Christ: But the <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Faith</hi> is a righteousness of Gods,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100660:146"/>
chusing; this he approves and accepts of for the justification of a Sinner; <hi>by this the Elders obtained a good report,</hi> by this <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> were justified before God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this may well be called the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God,</hi> because this he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and this he will owne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Thus, you see, that there is no foundation in Scripture for all this talk of a <hi>Personal Righteousness of Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in him,</hi> and <hi>imputed to us:</hi> but the righteousness of which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaks, is not the righteousness of Christs Person but of his Gospel, that is, that way of Righteousness and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, which Christ hath revealed in his Gospel.</p>
                  <p>I have now considered all the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Graces</hi> of Christ, (as these men call them) and upon inquiry it appears, that what they appropriate to his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> belongs to his <hi>Gospel,</hi> and is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to describe the perfection and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Religion, as being the most perfect Revelation of the will of God, the most powerful method of his wisdom for the reforming the World, the only way to life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and which prescribes the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100660:146"/>
only Righteousness, which is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God.</p>
                  <p>There is indeed one metaphorical expression still behind, which exercises mens wits and fancies, <hi>viz</hi> the <hi>riches of Christ, Eph.</hi> 3. 8. Which must needs be a <hi>personal Grace</hi> too, or Personal Estate, or what you will call it: <hi>unto me, who am the least of all Saints, is this Grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.</hi> Where by the <hi>unsearchable riches</hi> of Christ is meant the Gospel, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the Gentiles, as being ordained by Christ to be the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the Gentiles: and he calls it <hi>unsearchable riches,</hi> because the Grace of the Gospel is not a narrow and stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing, is not confined to a particular Nation, as the law was, but is offer'd to all Mankind, whether Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, bond or free: the Gospel of Christ contains those glorious discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods goodness to all Mankind, as may well be called the riches of his Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. for riches signifie only an abundance.</p>
                  <p>And is it not a great violation of the Majesty of Scripture to sport and toy with words and metaphors, as some

                  <p>HAving showed you what kind of <hi>Person</hi> these men make of Christ, how they have fitted him to all the wants and necessities of a Sinner, let us now consider, wherein this Union they talk of, between the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ and the <hi>Persons</hi> of Believers does consist.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Union</hi> betwixt Christ and Christians is represented in Scripture by various metaphors, which I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained at large: but these men instead of explaining these metaphors, turn all Religion into an Allegory: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Christ is called an <hi>Husband,</hi> and

the Church his <hi>Spouse;</hi> and now all the invitations of the Gospel are Christs <hi>wooing</hi> and <hi>making love</hi> to his Spouse, and what other men call <hi>believing the Gospel of Christ,</hi> whereby we devote our selves to his service, these men call that <hi>consent and contract, which makes up the marriage betwixt Christ and Believers:</hi> Christ takes <hi>us</hi> for his Spouse, and we take Christ for our <hi>Husband,</hi> and that with all the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of marriage (except the <hi>Ring</hi> which is left out as an Antichristian Ceremony) Christ saying thus, <hi>This is</hi>

                     <hi>that we will consent unto, that I will be for thee, and thou shalt be for me; and not for another. Christ gives himself to the Soul with all his excellencies, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, preciousness, graces, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, to be its Saviour, Head, and Husband, to dwell with it in this holy Relation, and the Soul likes Christ for his excellencies, Graces, suitableness far above all other Beloveds whatever, and accepts of Christ by the will for its Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Lord and Saviour,</hi> and thus the Marriage is compleated, and <hi>this is the day of Christs Espousals, of the gladness of his heart;</hi> and now follow all <hi>mutual conjugal affections,</hi> which on Christs

part consist <hi>in delight, valuation, pity, or compassion, and bounty:</hi> on the Saints part in <hi>delight, valuation, Chastity, duty;</hi> which is much like Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of his <hi>Artificial Man</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:</hi> But I have already cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected this fooling with Scripture-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, and Phrases, and my business at present is to consider, wherein they place the nature of this <hi>Union betwixt Christ and Believers;</hi> namely in this, that it is such an Union, <hi>as makes all Christ ours, and us Christs:</hi> when a man is united to Christ, he hath a propriety and interest in all his Personal Graces and Eminencies: <hi>He is lovely with Christs loveliness, Righteous with Christs Righteousness, the Wisdom, and Power, and fulness</hi> of Christ are his; whatever Christ hath done, or suffer'd, is all his as much, as if he had done and suffer'd the same things himself.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Union of Persons</hi> betwixt Christ and Believers, which gives them such a propriety in all the <hi>Personal Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of Christ, is commonly explained by a <hi>conjugal relation,</hi> and <hi>legal Union,</hi> that mutual Relation, which is betwixt Husband and Wife, and that Union, which is betwixt the Surety and Debtor.</p>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100660:149"/>
Husbands Estate, and is secur'd from all Arrests at Law, and if these be not weighty reasons, let any man, that can, give better.</p>
                  <p>To consider this briefly, they say, <hi>that a Wife hath an Interest in her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Estate, and is secured from all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests at Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and therefore, <hi>Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Husband all his Personal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies righteousness, &amp;c. are ours; and the Law cannot take hold of us, but our Husband must be responsible for our faults:</hi> a very hard Law truly, and I think a Husband is in a very ill Case, when he has a bad Wife: Now suppose this were the Case in some earthly marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, it were worth while to consider, whether this be <hi>essential to marriage,</hi> or whether it depends upon <hi>private contracts,</hi> or <hi>publick Laws and Customs,</hi> which are arbitrary and mutable; for if this be not essential to marriage, how can we be secure, that this is the law of our <hi>spiritual marriage,</hi> unless our <hi>spiritual Husband</hi> had told us so: especially considering, that this <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual marriage</hi> betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> is of a different nature from <hi>earthly marriages,</hi> and if they differ in any thing we cannot be sure, but that
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100660:150"/>
they differ in this, unless we have some better proof of it, than this Analogy and resemblance between earthly and spiritual marriages; nay and better proof too, than Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> gives us of it. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Behold thou art fair my Companion, behold thou art fair, thou hast Doves Eyes,</hi> and Cant. 3. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>O my Dove, that art in the clefts of the Rocks, and in the secret places of the stairs, let me hear thy voice, let me see thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,</hi> or Cant. 4. 8. <hi>Come with me from</hi> Lebanon <hi>my Spouse, look from the top of</hi> Amana, <hi>from the top of</hi> Shenir <hi>and</hi> Hermon, <hi>from the Lions Dens, and the Mountain of the Leopards,</hi> or Isai. 4. 2. <hi>The branch of the Lord is beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth is excellent and comely to them, that are escaped of</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: which are all the proofs he can find (for if he had any better, he did ill to conceal them) for <hi>Christs giving himself to the Soul with all his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, Righteousness, Preciousness, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Eminencies, &amp;c.</hi> Now how any such consequence as this can be drawn, either from <hi>Doves Eyes,</hi> or from the <hi>Clefts of the Rocks,</hi> or <hi>from Lebanon,</hi> or
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100660:150"/>
                     <hi>from the top of Amana, Shenir,</hi> or <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> or from the <hi>Lions Dens,</hi> or <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Leopards,</hi> is past my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to make out. But let the Laws of Kingdoms and Nations be as they will, there can be no Law made to alter the nature of things; there never was any Law, that the <hi>Personal vertues and qualities and perfections of the Husband should be setled upon his Wife for a jointure:</hi> though the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band be never so fair and comely, wise and vertuous, his Wife may be ugly and deformed, a Fool or a Harlot; for <hi>Personal</hi> and <hi>Inherent</hi> perfections can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pass out of the <hi>Person,</hi> nor be made over to any other, as money and lands are: and therefore whatever other priviledges we may enjoy by our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to Christ, his <hi>Personal excellencies</hi> cannot be ours, though his <hi>Person</hi> were.</p>
                  <p>And we know, that in marriage, there are private contracts too, and the Wives interest in her Husbands Estate may be limited to such condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they agree upon: and the truth is Christ hath not made such an absolute settlement of himself upon us, as these men dream he has; for the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100660:151"/>
Gospel contains the Articles of this Marriage (to speak in these mens dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) and there we must learn to what purposes, and upon what conditions, Christ gives himself to us, and must challenge no more from Christ by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our marriage to him, than what the Gospel (the marriage Covenant) promises, and we find nothing there of his <hi>Personal Righteousness</hi> to be made ours. As for what they tell us, that <hi>a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man under covert is not liable to an Arrest or action at the law, but all must fall upon her Husband,</hi> it is true as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Debt, but does not extend to Crimes: if a Woman kill her Child, or rob upon the High-way, I doubt her being under covert will not secure her from the Gallows: was it never known that a Woman was hang'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with or without her Husband? The Keeper of <hi>Newgate</hi> could have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed them in this nice point of Divinity: and how secure soever any man may fancy himself of his marriage to Christ, I would not advise him to venture too much upon it, for if he be guilty of any gross wilful sin, there is some danger, that the law or Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel may condemn him, unless he
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100660:151"/>
timely repent, and reform his Vices.</p>
                  <p>So that this <hi>conjugal Relation</hi> to Christ does not make him so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ours, as these men pretend, who by their loose discourses and inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reasonings seem neither to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>Divine</hi> nor <hi>Humane Laws:</hi> when the Scripture calls <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Husband,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> his <hi>Spouse,</hi> it means no more, but that Christ is our <hi>Head and Governour,</hi> who rules his Church with as great kindness, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and compassion, as a Husband ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth towards his Wife, and that we are to pay the same love, duty, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Christ, that Wives owe to their Husbands; and here we must have done with the <hi>Metaphor,</hi> unless we will turn Religion into a <hi>Romance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Christ and Believers are<note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>legally</hi> united: now there are two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways of explaining this, some iusist most upon the notion of a <hi>Surety,</hi> others of a <hi>Mediatour,</hi> which come much to one, but yet have some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar absurdities belonging to each of them: as for the notion of a <hi>Surety,</hi> which is the first way, Dr. <hi>Iacomb</hi> gives us this account of it, that <hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>as the Saints</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Surety, struck</hi>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:100660:152"/>
                     <hi>hands with God (as the word imports) put himself into their stead, took their Debt upon himself, and bound himself upon their account to make satisfaction to God: now in law the Debtor and the Surety are but one Person, the law looks upon them as one, and makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, and therefore both are equally liable to the Debt, and if the one pay it, it is as much in the eye of the law, as if the other had paid it: Thus it is with Christ and us, he is our Surety, for he took our Debt upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, engaged to pay whatever we owed, for us; upon this, Christ and we are but one Person before God, and accordingly he deals with us; for he makes over our sins to Christ, and also Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and satisfaction to us, he now in a legal notion looking upon both but as one Person.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the account of Christ's being our <hi>Surety,</hi> now I have two things to say to this. First, I wonder why this should be called the <hi>Union of Saints to Christ?</hi> or why Christ should be called <hi>only</hi> the <hi>Saints Surety?</hi> The Apostle tells us, that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>The Surety of a Testament or Covenant:</hi> now as I take it, there is a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100660:152"/>
vast difference between <hi>Christ's being the Saints Surety,</hi> and the <hi>Surety of the Covenant,</hi> for the <hi>Covenant</hi> respects both <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> and therefore is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to our <hi>Union to Christ, as Saints:</hi> and to be a <hi>Surety of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> signifies no more than to confirm and ratifie this Covenant, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for the performance of it, that all the promises of the Covenant shall be made good upon such terms and conditions, as are annexed to them; but to be <hi>a Surety for Saints,</hi> (as the Dr. explains it) <hi>is to strike hands with God,</hi> (as men do at making a bargain) <hi>and to put himself into their stead to do and to suffer, what they ought to have done and suffer'd, upon which God makes over our sins to Christ, and Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and satisfaction to us;</hi> Now this notion is so different from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Surety of a Covenant, that methinks it wants some better proof, than barely Christ's being called a <hi>Surety,</hi> or the <hi>Surety of a Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Secondly, Suppose Christ had been called the <hi>Saints Surety,</hi> I doubt they are as much out in the <hi>law of Suretiship,</hi> as they were before in the <hi>laws of marriage;</hi> though the Dr. tells
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100660:153"/>
us, <hi>that this doth so exactly fall in with the common notion and case of Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship among men, that he needs not any further insist on the illustration of it.</hi> I confess, I am of another mind, and think it wants a great deal more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration, than he hath bestowed on it. For first the prime end and design of Suretiship among men, is not that the Surety shall without more ado pay the Debt, but to give security to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor that the Debt shall be paid: that is, the <hi>Surety</hi> doth not make himself the <hi>immediate</hi> Debtor; but the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is Debtor still, and bound to pay the Debt, and the Surety is liable only in case of his default. It is the strangest definition of Suretiship, that was ever heard of, that it is <hi>an absolute taking the Debt upon our selves,</hi> and an actual discharge of the Debtor. For I dare say, never any man was surety upon these terms, that is, no man in his wits ever became Surety for another, when he knew before hand, that if he did, he must pay the Debt; but men become Sureties upon some reasonable assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they shall suffer no injury by it; and therefore when Christ died for us, he did not die as our <hi>Surety,</hi>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:100660:153"/>
but as <hi>our Sacrifice</hi> substituted in our room, which is the Scripture notion of it, and differs as much from the notion of a surety, as paying the debt doth from being bound with another, that it shall be paid.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Suppose that <hi>Christ dyed for us as our surety,</hi> (though I think, however the Doctor triumphs in this, the <hi>Socinians</hi> have no reason to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of such Adversaries, who have no better way to defend the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ, than by the notion of sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship) yet did <hi>Christ fulfil all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness for us as our surety too?</hi> Doth this also <hi>so exactly answer the case of suretiship among men, that there is no need to insist upon the Illustration of it?</hi> The Doctor indeed was so wise, that he would not assert this in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but very craftily thrusts it into the Conclusion, that <hi>therefore God makes over our sins to Christ, and Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Satisfaction to us:</hi> But was there ever such a suretiship heard of among men, that one man should discharge all the offices of Piety and Vertue, Justice and Temperance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of another? If such a thing had ever been, such a man ought not to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100660:154"/>
have been called a <hi>Surety,</hi> but a <hi>Proxie;</hi> but humane Laws, as many defects as there are in them, never admitted of such Proxies, for these are personal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which no other can perform for us; and you may as well say, that a man may live and be a man by Proxy, as discharge those Duties, which are necessarily entailed on his <hi>Person</hi> by a <hi>Proxy:</hi> Proxies are allowable only in such cases, where the consideration of the person that doth it, is not essential to the Action, where the material In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is, whether the thing be done, not who doth it; but where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the person that doth it, is essential to the Action, there is no place for a Surety or Proxy (call him what you will) because in this case it doth not satisfie the Law, that the thing is done, unless it be done by such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Thus it is in all the Duties of Piety and Religion, every individual person is bound to do them, and though there were never so many righteous men in the world, their righteousness can avail none but themselves; nay the <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> which is more than the righteousness of all the men in the world; cannot make an unrighteous
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:100660:154"/>
man righteous; no <hi>external Relation</hi> can make the righteousness of another our righteousness, because it is a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteousness that is required of us, and the righteousness of another can never be our <hi>personal righteousness,</hi> unless we become <hi>one person</hi> with him: and therefore though the Doctor be so careful to tell us, that <hi>our Union to Christ is an Union of Persons, but no Personal Union, that we are not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the Essence and Being of Christ, so as to be Christed with Christ,</hi> yet indeed there is no other way to make the <hi>Personal Righteousness</hi> of Christ our <hi>personal</hi> righteousness (which is the righteousness required of us) but by a <hi>Personal Union</hi> to Christ, <hi>by being Christed with Christ,</hi> as some speak how <hi>boldly</hi> soever, yet very agreeably to these Principles.</p>
                  <p>But Thirdly, Let us consider what truth there is in what he asserts, <hi>That in the Law the debtor and the surety are but one person, the Law looks upon them but as one, and therefore both are equally liable to the debt, and if the one pay it, it is as much in the eye of the Law, as if the other had paid it,</hi> which he makes the Foundation of the <hi>Imputation of</hi>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:100660:155"/>
                     <hi>Christs Righteousness and Satisfaction to us,</hi> because <hi>he being our surety, we are but one person with him;</hi> that is, <hi>legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not personally one person</hi> as he warily distinguishes.</p>
                  <p>Now there needs no great skill in the Law to discover the weakness and Sophistry of this Discourse: for no considering man can think it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, who pays the debt, the surety or the debtor, or that they are both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually obliged to it; the debtor is the immediate debtor still, and the surety only is obliged in case the other refuse, or be unable to pay the debt, and that is some little difference: but then though the creditor be satisfied, whether the debt be paid by the debtor, or his surety, and the Law will allow him no farther Action against either of them, yet the Law doth not account it indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, which of them pay it; for though it permit the payment to be exacted from the surety, in case the debtor refuse, yet it will look back again, and allow the surety an Action against the debtor for such a refusal, which is an Argument, that the Law doth not judge them <hi>one Person,</hi> nor think it indifferent which of them pays the debt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:100660:155"/>Thus it is in other cases, if a man be surety for the appearance of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is called giving Bail, and is sometimes admitted in Criminal Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; the Law doth not judge them <hi>one Person;</hi> for if the Prisoner escape, the Bail or Surety shall be punisht accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the Fact, and yet the Prisoner is not quitted by this means, but liable either to the Arrest of the Surety, or in Criminal Causes to the Sentence of the Law, if ever he be re-taken.</p>
                  <p>Thus in Sureties for good Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our (which sounds as if it were nearest of kin to the Imputation of Christs Righteousness as our surety) though the surety be never so innocent and vertuous a person himself, this will not serve him, for whom he is surety; but if he prove a Villain, they shall be both punisht: So that humane Laws are strangers to this Mystery of imputing the Righteousness of a Surety to a bad man. Suretiship doth not so unite their persons, that whatever one doth, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and to all purposes imputed to the other; and if this will not hold good among m<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">

betwixt Christ and Believers, <hi>That he should take their sins upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and impute his Righteousness to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now try, whether the notion of a <hi>Mediator</hi> can do any better ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than the notion of a <hi>Surety,</hi> which is the <hi>second way</hi> of explaining this <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Union</hi> betwixt Christ and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which entitles them to all that Christ hath done or suffered: and what this means, we may learn from Dr.<note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Son, Chap. 6. p. 182.</note> 
                     <hi>Owen,</hi> who gives us this account of it: <hi>That Christ fulfilled all Righteousness, as he was Mediator, and that whatever he did as Mediator, he did it for them, whose Mediator he was, or in whose stead, and for whose good he executed the office of a Mediator before God;</hi> and hence it is, <hi>that his compleat and perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law, is reckoned to us.</hi> This is well said, if it were as well proved, and because this is a matter of great consequence, I shall first examine those reasons the <hi>Dr.</hi> alledges to prove, <hi>That Christ fulfilled all Righteousness, as he was Mediator in their stead, whose Mediator he was:</hi> Secondly, to avoid calumnies and objections, I shall shew you briefly <hi>what influence the Righteoeusness of</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:100660:156"/>
                     <hi>Christs life, and the Sacrifice of his death have upon our acceptance with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the first, we have some reason to require good proof of this, since the notion of a <hi>Mediator</hi> includes no such thing: A <hi>Mediator</hi> is one, who interposes between two differing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to accommodate the difference: but it was never heard of yet, that it was the office of a Mediator to perform the terms and conditions himself. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 9. and his office was to receive the Law from God, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it to the people, and to command them to observe those Rites, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and Expiations, which God had ordained; but he was not to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the <hi>Righteousness of the Law</hi> for the <hi>whole Congregation:</hi> thus <hi>Christ</hi> is now the <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> and his Office required, that he should preach the Gospel, which contains the terms of peace and reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men, and since God would not enter into Covenant with sinners without the intervention of a Sacrifice, he dyes too as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Propitiation</hi> for the sins of the world, and confirms and seals this new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100660:157"/>
with his own blood, and being risen again from the dead, he executes this Office of Mediator with power and glory, that is, he intercedes for us according to the terms and conditions of this new Covenant, to obtain the pardon of our sins, and the assistance of the divine Grace to do the will of God; and all those other blessings which are promised: but the Office of Mediator doth not oblige him to fulfil the <hi>Righteousness of the Covenant</hi> for us; this I am sure doth not <hi>so exactly fall in with the case and notion of Mediatorship among men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before we examine their proofs, it is necessary to consider, what it is they would prove, that is, <hi>what that Righteousness is, which, they say, Christ as our Mediator</hi> fulfilled for us: and Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> is very exact and curious in<note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Son, p. 178.</note> stating this matter, and distinguishes between the several sorts of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Christ, that we may know, what belongs to us, and what is peculiar to himself.</p>
                  <p>First he tells us of <hi>an habitual Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ as Mediator in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, which was the absolute, compleat, exact conformity of the Soul of</hi>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:100660:157"/>
                     <hi>Christ to the mind, will, or law of God, or his perfect, habitual, Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:</hi> now he tells us, that this Righteousness <hi>was the necessary effect of the Grace of Union</hi> (that is of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Divine and Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Christ) and that <hi>the Relation which this Righteousness of Christ hath to the Grace we receive from him, is this, that thereby he was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, fit to do all that he had to do for us; for without this he could not have actually fulfilled that Righteousness which was required at his hand, nor have been a compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Sacrifice, &amp;c.</hi> So that this <hi>habitual, inherent Righteousness</hi> of Christ, is not <hi>imputed</hi> to us, but was his <hi>own proper Righteousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But secondly, <hi>There is the actual obedience of Christ, which was his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, chearful, obediential performance, of every thing, duty, and command, that God by vertue of any Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we were subject and obnoxious, did require, and moreover to the peculiar Law of the Mediator:</hi> Let us then first consider the <hi>peculiar Law of the Mediator,</hi> which he tells us <hi>respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself meerly</hi> (so that we have nothing to do with this neither) <hi>and</hi>
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:100660:158"/>
                     <hi>contains all those acts and duties of his, which were not for our imitation,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances <hi>in his obedience which he showed in dying</hi> (though St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Divine,</hi> (and I think the greater of the two) tells us, that we must imitate him in this also, <hi>must lay down our lives for the Brethren,</hi> as Christ died for us. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 3. 16. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that we <hi>must be conformed to the Death and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, Rom.</hi> 6. which sounds very like an <hi>imitation</hi>) though in the next page he excepts the Case of <hi>dying,</hi> of his <hi>passive obedience,</hi> and tells us, <hi>that all the rest of his obedience to the Law of mediation is not imputed to us, as though we had done it.</hi> So that by the <hi>Law of Mediation</hi> he understands whatever Christ was bound to do, as our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whatever was proper to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory Office, all this (though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when he better thinks of it, he excepts <hi>dying</hi>) is not imputed to us, as though we had done it: I hope we shall find something at last to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, and yet there is nothing left now. But thirdly, That which concerns him in a private capacity, <hi>as a man subject to the Law,</hi> and now <hi>whatever was required of us by vertue of</hi>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:100660:158"/>
                     <hi>any Law, that he did and fulfilled;</hi> and this is <hi>that actual obedience of Christ, which he performed for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This methinks is very strange, that what he did as Mediator, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, but what he did not as our <hi>Mediator,</hi> but <hi>as a man subject to the law,</hi> that is imputed to us, and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as if we had done it, by reason of his being our Mediator: and it is as strange to the full, that Christ should do, <hi>whatever was required of us by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of any law,</hi> when he was neither Husband nor Wife, nor Father, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant or Tradesman, Seaman or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, Captain or Lieutenant, much less a temporal Prince or Monarch; and how he should discharge the duties of these several relations for us, which are required of us by certain Laws, when he never was in any of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and could not possibly be in all, is an argument, which may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the subtilty of <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and to them I leave it.</p>
                  <p>Having now discovered <hi>what that Righteousness is, which Christ was to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil for us, as our Mediator,</hi> viz. <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was required of us by vertue of any law,</hi> whether it concerned us in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100660:159"/>
as men, or had respect to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous relations, conditions and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of our lives (for each of these have their proper duties belonging to them) setting aside that difficulty of proving that Christ did, what he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, let us consider how the Dr. proves, that what Christ did, he did for us, and in our stead, and here he makes use of a little reason, and a great deal of Scripture to as little purpose. And to prepare the way for his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I find the Dr. much puzled (and I do not wonder at it) to prove, that <hi>Christ acted as Mediator in those things, which did not concern the law of his Mediation,</hi> which he did <hi>as a private</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Commun. pag. 182.</note> 
                     <hi>man subject to the law:</hi> for he tells us, that of this expression, <hi>as Mediator,</hi> there is a double sense. <hi>It may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken strictly, as relating solely to the law of the Mediator, and so Christ may be said to do as Mediator, only what he did in obedience to that law,</hi> (that is, only what he did <hi>as Mediator,</hi> which is a pretty observation) <hi>but in the sense now insisted on</hi> (that is <hi>not strictly as Mediator,</hi> but as <hi>not Mediator</hi>) <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Christ did as a man subject to the Law, he did as Mediator, because he did</hi>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:100660:159"/>
                     <hi>it as part of the duty incumbent on him, who undertook so to be:</hi> the meaning of which is, that he, who was Mediator, being bound to do such things, though not <hi>as Mediator, but as a man subject to the law,</hi> yet he did them <hi>as Mediator,</hi> because he was <hi>a Mediator,</hi> who did them: which is just as good an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it would be to prove, that every <hi>Embassadour eats, and drinks, and sleeps, as an Embassadour,</hi> because though this be no part of his <hi>Embassy,</hi> yet he is an <hi>Embassadour,</hi> who does it, which is such an exposition of <hi>Quâ,</hi> as the subtilest <hi>Schoolman</hi> of them all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet thought of.</p>
                  <p>But there is another objection which<note place="margin">Pag. 184.</note> troubles the Doctors Head; for since it is the <hi>actual obedience</hi> of Christ, which is imputed to us, he finds it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to distinguish the <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> obedience of Christ: <hi>for every Act almost of Christs obedience from the blood of his Circumcision to the blood of his Cross, was attended with sufferings, so that his whole life in that regard might be called a death:</hi> this is a very subtil objection, but observe the answer, that <hi>looking upon his willingness and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in it, it may be distinguished from</hi>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:100660:160"/>
                     <hi>his sufferings peculiarly so called, and termed his active obedience:</hi> this is a strange solution of it, for now it will be as hard to find out what the <hi>passive obedience</hi> of Christ was, for as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Scripture tells us, that he was as willing and chearful in submitting to Death, as in any other Act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and I am sure our <hi>Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> tells us, <hi>that he laid down his life, and no man took it from him,</hi> which argues some good degree of <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 183.</note> what he said in the page before is a much better answer, <hi>that doing is one thing, and suffering another, they are in divers Predicaments, and cannot be coincident.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for this last scruple, the Dr. might very well have spared it, but that a man so well furnished with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Predicaments,</hi> may venture upon any thing; but the former diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty <hi>of Christs doing those things as Mediator, which did not belong to the Laws of his Mediation,</hi> is a very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial one, and requires great skill in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick to get rid of it; but however it is wisely done to make a show of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing something to that, which cannot be answer'd: for he was sensible, that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:100660:160"/>
what Christ did <hi>purely as Mediator could not be imputed to us, as though we</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 181.</note> 
                     <hi>had done it, though the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or fruits of it are,</hi> because we were never designed to be <hi>Mediators,</hi> and the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> of a <hi>Mediator</hi> is as improper to be <hi>imputed</hi> to those who are not <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators,</hi> as it is to impute the <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of a <hi>Prince</hi> to a <hi>Beggar.</hi> The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of every man consists in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of those duties and offices, which belong to his state, condition, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of life, not in doing those things, which he is not concerned to do; and therefore that the Righteousness of Christ might be fit to be imputed to us as our Righteousness, he was forced to consider him, not as <hi>Mediator,</hi> but as a <hi>private person made subject to the Law, who did whatever was required of us by vertue of any Law,</hi> though this too was impossible, for he could not at the same time act so many different and opposite parts, as there are relations and conditions of men in the World; and yet when he thought on't again, he found, that it was not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of a <hi>private person,</hi> that would avail us, though it were never so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect (because we have no way to come at it, to make it ours) but only the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100660:161"/>
Righteousness of a Mediator, who did whatever he did, for us and in our stead, and so he wheels about again, and tells us, that though what Christ did as a man subject to the Law, did not belong to the Law of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet he did it as Mediator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a Mediator who did it: and thus he is caught in the Net and Labyrinth of his own making, and the more he turns and windes himself, the faster it holds him, <hi>A Mediator, who acts as a Mediator, in a private capacity, as a man subject to the Law.</hi> I shall certainly believe, as they say some Country-people do, that <hi>Logick is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring,</hi> if it can reconcile such palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contradictions.</p>
                  <p>It is very <hi>ominous</hi> thus to stumble at the threshold, but though <hi>Mediator</hi> and not a <hi>Mediator</hi> be contradictory terms, which Learned men say cannot be reconciled, yet let us forgive him that slip, and see how he proves, that <hi>whatever Christ did is reckoned to us, as done in our stead;</hi> and all the reason I<note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 183.</note> can find in his Discourse may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to three Heads; first, <hi>that Christ was under no obligation to do it himself;</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>that there</hi> r <hi>can be no other reason</hi>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:100660:161"/>
                     <hi>assigned, why he did it at all, but that he did it for us,</hi> and thirdly, <hi>that this was absolutely necessary it should be so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That Christ was under no obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obey these Laws himself,</hi> and to make this appear, he discourses particularly both of the <hi>Law of our Creation,</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonial Law given to the Iews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the first, <hi>the Law of Creation,</hi> that comprehends those eternal Laws, which result from the essential differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of good and evil, which all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are bound to observe by the very frame and constitution of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: now he dares not deny, that Christ was bound to obey this Law <hi>for himself,</hi> but then <hi>his obedience</hi> (he says) <hi>was voluntary;</hi> and what of that? for so the obedience of every good man is: for by <hi>voluntary,</hi> he tells us, he doth not mean, that it <hi>was meerly arbitrary, and at his choice, whether he would yield obedience to it, or not; but on supposition of his undertaking to be a Mediator, it was necessary it should be so; but he voluntarily and willingly submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto it, and so became really subject to the commands of it,</hi> and is it not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain now, that Christ was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obey these Laws, because <hi>he</hi>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:100660:162"/>
                     <hi>willingly submitted to them?</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he means something more by this <hi>voluntary,</hi> than he could tell how to express, and all that I can guess is, that whereas <hi>we</hi> are bound to obey these Laws <hi>antecedentally to our own choice,</hi> it was not so with <hi>him,</hi> for his obligation was only <hi>consequential</hi> upon his being born, and becoming Man, which was his own choice; and yet even then, as he tells us, <hi>as he was Mediator, God and Man, he was not by the Institution of that Law obliged to it, being as it were exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, and lifted above that Law by the Hypostatical Union.</hi> Now this is very profound reasoning; for the meaning of it is this, that Christ had not been bound to live like a man, unless he had become man, and yet I can grant some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more; that it was <hi>impossible</hi> he should have lived <hi>like a man,</hi> dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all the duties of a man without <hi>being man;</hi> but when he chose to be a man, there was no need to chuse any more; for then he was bound by the Laws of his Nature to discharge all the duties of a man for himself: But how could he be <hi>exempted from this Law</hi> (though it be but <hi>as it were</hi>) and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed above it by <hi>being Mediator, God</hi>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:100660:162"/>
                     <hi>and Man,</hi> when the Doctor himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges two lines after, that <hi>upon supposition of his being Mediator, it was necessary it should be so,</hi> that is, that he should yield obedience to the Law; now <hi>not to be obliged by the Institution of the Law as Mediator,</hi> and that it should <hi>be necessary for him to obey the Law as Mediator,</hi> are at so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that it may serve for another tryal of skill to reconcile them.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, Though we suppose, that Christ as Man was bound to yield obedience <hi>to the Laws of the Creation,</hi> yet the Doctor observes, <hi>that this is the only Law, he could be liable to, as a Man: for an innocent man in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, as he was, needed no other Law, nor did God ever give any other Law to such persons: the Law of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the only Law, that an innocent Creature is liable to, with what Symbols of the Law God is pleased to add:</hi>—But now <hi>Iesus Christ yielded perfect obedience to all those Laws, which came upon us by the occasion of sin, as the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, yea those very Institutions that signified the washing away of sin, and repentance from sin, as the Baptism of</hi> John, <hi>which he had no need of himself,</hi>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:100660:163"/>
                     <hi>this therefore must needs be for us.</hi> This now looks something like, though I fear, it will prove like all the rest, that is, to no purpose: for though the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor takes it for granted, yet I would willingly have had some proof of it, that an <hi>innocent man can be bound by no other Law, than the Law of Creation;</hi> especially since he acknowledges (which is a great favour) that God might add what <hi>Symbols</hi> he pleased to that Law; (for, I suppose, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> and the <hi>Tree of knowledge of good and evil</hi>) now I know not what these <hi>Symbols</hi> are but <hi>positive Laws,</hi> and such the <hi>Ceremonial Laws</hi> were; and if God may require the obedience of an <hi>innocent man</hi> to <hi>one</hi> positive Law, I see no reason, why he may not, if he please, enjoyn <hi>twenty such Laws</hi> by the same Authority. But <hi>they are such Laws as came upon us by occasion of sin,</hi> and therefore an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man</hi> cannot be obliged by them: but why not? Though they were at first commanded upon <hi>occasion of sin,</hi> an <hi>innocent man</hi> may observe them to good and wise purposes, as publick and solemn Acts of Worship, as external and visible expressions of devotion, as
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:100660:163"/>
a publick profession of Righteousness and a vertuous life, to which purposes among others the Sacrifices and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law, and the Baptism of <hi>Iohn</hi> served: And if there were no other reason, this were sufficient, that it becomes an <hi>innocent man</hi> to set an example of reverence to all <hi>Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,</hi> that every conceited Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionist, (who may be far enough from being <hi>innocent</hi>) may not presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit himself above all <hi>Forms and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worship,</hi> as the Doctor knows, who are too apt to do.</p>
                  <p>But this is not worth contending about; for the <hi>Righteousness of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law</hi> could never justifie any man, and therefore if Christ had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled this Law for us, it could have availed us nothing. Nor can I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, why the Doctor should suppose, that Christ fulfilled the Ceremonial Law for all Believers, when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of them (the Gentiles) were never under the obligation of it.</p>
                  <p>His second Argument to prove, that what Christ did as Mediator (that is, the actual obedience of his life) he did for us and in our stead, is this, that there <hi>can be no other reason assigned of</hi>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:100660:164"/>
                     <hi>Christs obedience to the Law of God, but only this, that he did it in our stead.</hi> Now this Argument would be good, were it true, and were there not a great many things done, which we cannot as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign the reason of, and yet done for great and weighty reasons; but it appears from what I have already discoursed, that there was sufficient reason, why Christ should obey the Laws of God, <hi>viz.</hi> because he was as much bound to it, as any other man is: But to wave this, let us consider how he manages this Argument: he takes it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 182.</note> (as he is very apt to do things, which he cannot prove) that if Christ were not bound to obey these Laws upon his own account, <hi>it must be either for us, or to fit him for his death and oblation,</hi> but it was not to fit him for his death and oblation, therefore it was for us: for he tells us, <hi>That he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered all Types, and was every way <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, fit to be made an Offering for sin by his Union and habitual Grace; so that if the obedience Christ performed be not reckoned to us, and done upon our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, there is no just cause to be assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why he should live here in the World so long as he did, in perfect obedience to all the Laws of God: had he dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:100660:164"/>
                     <hi>there had been perfect innocence and perfect holiness by his habitual Grace, and infinite vertue and worth from the dignity of his Person, and surely he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not that long course of all manner of obedience but for some great and special purposes in reference to our Salvation:</hi> yes truly, it was <hi>for some great and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial purpose in reference to our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that Christ lived so long in the World, and consequently <hi>yielded such a long course of all manner of obedience to God;</hi> but must this needs be <hi>his actual fulfilling all Righteousness for us?</hi> What do you think of his preaching the Gospel throughout all <hi>Iudaea,</hi> which required, that he should be a man before he did it, and would take up some time in doing it? What do you think of those many Miracles, which he wrought for the confirmation of his Doctrine? What do you think of train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Apostles to succeed him in his Ministry as eye and ear witnesses of his Miracles and Doctrine? Nay what do you think of the holy example of his life, which was no less necessary than his Laws? These were all <hi>great and special purposes in reference to our Salvation,</hi> though we should suppose him fit to have been a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> (as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:100660:165"/>
designed he should have been) as soon, as he was born: though by the way I think he could not have answered the <hi>Types</hi> and Predictions of him, had he died so soon, notwithstanding his <hi>perfect innocence and perfect holiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His third reason to prove that Christ<note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 185.</note> performed all Righteousness for us, is from the <hi>absolute necessity of it; for this is the term of the Covenant, do this and live; life is not to be obtained, unless all be done that the Law requires; that is still true, if thou wilt enter into life keep the Commandments, they must be kept by us, or by our Surety: so that we being unable to yield that compleat and perfect obedience, which the Law requires, as the condition of life and happiness, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that Christ our Mediator and Surety should fulfil the Law for us.</hi> Now the best that can be made of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that it proves it ought to be so, but it does not prove that it is so; just like the Papists alledging the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of an infallible judge to prove, that the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is infallible; but such arguments prove nothing but the arrogance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the disputant, who will undertake to prescribe methods to God, and to prove, that he ought to have
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100660:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
done so, when it does not appear, that he has done so: the sum of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that there never was, nor ever can be a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> that God still exacts the rigorous perfection of the Law from us, and that we must not appear before him without a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect righteousness of our own, or of another:</hi> now this is the thing in Question, whether we must be made Righteous with the perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ imputed to us, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will for the sake of Christ dispense with the rigour of the Law, and accept of a sincere and Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal obedience, instead of a perfect and unsinning Righteousness; so that he only confidently affirms what was in dispute, and this goes for an argument.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see how weak their reason is, let us now examine their Scripture evidence; and the Dr. makes a great flourish with some Scripture phrases,<note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 167.</note> 
                     <hi>that there is almost nothing that Christ hath done, but we are said to do it with him: we are Crucified with him, we are dead with him, and buried with him, and quickned together with him, &amp;c. In the acting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s of Christ, there is by vertue of the compact between him as Mediator, and the Father, such an</hi>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:100660:166"/>
                     <hi>assured foundation laid of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the fruit of these actings unto those in whose stead he performed them, that they are said in the participation of these fruits to have done the same things with him:</hi> But he is quite out in the reason of these expressions, which is, not that we are accounted to do the same things, which Christ did (for the things here mentioned belong to the peculiar Office of his Mediation, which he told us before were not reckon'd as done by us) but because we do some things like them: our dying to sin is a Conformity to the Death of Christ, and our walking in newness of life is our Conformity to his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the consideration of the Death and Resurrection of Christ, is very powerful to engage us to die to sin, and to rise into a new life; and this is the true reason of these phrases, not that Christ did all in our stead, and therefore we are said to do it too, but for a quite different reason because we must do something like it, express the power and image of his Death and Resurrection in our lives.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose also he cites that<note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 184.</note> Text in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>God sent forth his</hi>

Rom.</hi> 8. 15. So that
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:100660:167"/>
the meaning of this Text is this, that God hath now put an end to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the Law, which is called <hi>redeeming them that were under the Law,</hi> in a state of servitude and bondage, and hath established a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the room of it, which as much excells the Law, as the <hi>adoption of Sons</hi> does the state of Servants, and this God brought to pass <hi>by sending his Son into the World, made of a Woman, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law:</hi> for the understanding of which words we must consider, what influence Christs appearing in the world had on the abrogation of the Law, and that was, that he accomplished all the Types and Figures of the Law in his own Person, and when all these Types were fulfilled, they grew out of date: so that his <hi>being made under the Law</hi> most probably signifies, his being made such a Person, as should exactly ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer all the Types and Figures of the Law, and so put an end to it, as of no further use: Thus the Temple was Gods House, wherein he dwelt, but now the <hi>Shecinah</hi> or Divine Glory rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Christ, and the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily, so that now there was no longer any need of a
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100660:167"/>
material Temple, as a pledge of Gods peculiar presence among them; the Priests and Sacrifices of the Law were Types of Christ, and when that great high Priest came, and offered that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Sacrifice of himself, all legal Priests and Sacrifices were of no use: Thus by his being made under the Law, and accomplishing all the Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of it, he put an end to all those beggarly Rudiments, and delivered the Jews from the bondage of the Law; for though the Gentiles too are redeemed by Christ, yet they were not redeemed from the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they never were.</p>
                  <p>Several other places he alledges to the same purpose, but I have either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready considered them, or shall do in what follows; but what I have now discoursed, is enough to satisfie any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Inquirer, how vain and preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious this Principle is, which too many make the very Foundation of their Faith, that <hi>Christ as Mediator fulfilled all Righteousness in their stead, whose Mediator he was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now had I no other design than to expose the mistakes of other men, I should need add no more, till I saw
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100660:168"/>
this answered; but I have a greater and better design, <hi>viz.</hi> to explain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the true notions of Religion in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to such mistakes, and therefore having shewed you, that there is no foundation in Reason or Scripture to fancy such an Union between Christ and Believers (whether we consider it as a <hi>Conjugal Relation,</hi> or <hi>Legal Union,</hi> as he is our Surety or Mediator) as should entitle Believers to the <hi>Personal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> of Christ, lest any man should suspect, that the design of all this is to <hi>lessen the Grace of God,</hi> or <hi>to disparage the Merits</hi> and <hi>Righteousness of Christ,</hi> (which God forbid any Christian should be guilty of) I shall <hi>secondly</hi> examine what influence the <hi>Sacrifice of Christs death,</hi> and the <hi>Righteousness of his life</hi> have upon our acceptance with God: and all that I can find in Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, is, that to this we owe the <hi>Covenant of Grace:</hi> that God being well pleased with the <hi>obedience of Christs life,</hi> and <hi>the Sacrifice of his death,</hi> for his sake entred into a <hi>new Covenant</hi> with Mankind, wherein he promises pardon of sin and eternal life to those who belief and obey the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>This is very plain with reference to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100660:168"/>
the <hi>death of Christ;</hi> hence the <hi>Blood of Christ</hi> is called the <hi>Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Heb.</hi> 10 29. and Christ is called <hi>the great Shepherd and Bishop of Souls through the blood of the everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> Heb. 13. 20. and the <hi>blood of Christ</hi> is called <hi>the blood of Sprinkling, which speaks better things than the blood of Abel, Heb.</hi> 12. 24. which is an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to <hi>Moses</hi> his sprinkling the blood of the Sacrifice, whereby he confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ratified the Covenant between God and the Children of <hi>Israel, Heb.</hi> 9. 19, 20, 21. <hi>For when Moses had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken every precept to all the people accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law,</hi> (when he had declared the terms of this Covenant to them) <hi>he took the blood of Calves and Goats with water, and Scarlet wooll, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop, and sprinkled both the book and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the Testament, which God hath ordained to you.</hi> Thus the blood of Christ is called <hi>the Blood of Sprinkling,</hi> because by his blood God did seal and confirm the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> as the <hi>sprinkling the blood of beasts</hi> did confirm the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical Covenant.</hi> Hence we are said to be <hi>justified by the blood of Christ,</hi> Rom. 5. 9. that is, by the <hi>Gospel Covenant,</hi>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:100660:169"/>
which was confirmed and ratified with his blood; and Christ is called a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation through faith in his blood,</hi> that is, by a belief of his Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. Hence it is also, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture uses these phrases promiscuously, to be <hi>justified by faith,</hi> and to be <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Faith of Christ,</hi> and <hi>to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by Christ,</hi> and to be justified <hi>through Faith in his Blood,</hi> and to be <hi>justified</hi> and <hi>saved by Grace,</hi> nay by <hi>believing that Christ is the Son of God, Ioh.</hi> 20. 31. and <hi>that God raised him from the dead, Rom.</hi> 10. 3. All which signifie the same thing, that we are justified by believing and obeying the Gospel of Christ: for Faith or Faith in Christ, signifies such a firm and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast belief of the Gospel, as brings forth all the fruits of obedience; and the <hi>Grace of God</hi> is the Gospel of Christ, expresly so called in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. as being the effect of the free grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God to Mankind; and Faith in the Blood of Christ is a belief of the Gospel, which was confirmed by his death; and believing that <hi>Christ is the Son of God,</hi> that is, that Messias and Prophet, whom God sent into the World to reveal his will to us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100660:169"/>
a general belief of the Gospel, which he preached; and <hi>believing that God raised him from the dead</hi> doth the same, because his Resurrection from the dead was the last and great confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which God gave to the truth of his Gospel and Religion. And hence it is also, that the Apostles attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute such things to the Blood of Christ as are the proper and immediate effects of the <hi>Gospel-Covenant,</hi> because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Blood of Christ as the <hi>Blood of the Covenant,</hi> and therefore all the blessings of the Gospel are owing to the Blood of Christ, because the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant</hi> it self was procured and confirmed by the Blood of Christ. Thus the <hi>Gentiles who were sometime afar off,</hi> are said <hi>to be made nigh by the Blood of Christ,</hi> and the Gentiles and Jews were <hi>reconciled unto God in one body by the Cross, Eph.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. That is, the Gentiles were received into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of Gods Church, and the Jews and Gentiles united in <hi>one Body,</hi> or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; now this <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> is owing to the Gospel, which takes away all marks of distinction and separation, and gives them both an equal right to the blessings of the new
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100660:170"/>
Covenant. The <hi>Mosaical</hi> Covenant did belong only to the Children of <hi>Israel;</hi> but this new Covenant belongs to all Mankind, to Gentiles as well as Jews, <hi>there</hi> is now no distinction of persons, <hi>neither Iew nor Greek, Barbarian, Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian, Bond nor Free, but Christ is all and in all:</hi> That is, there is no respect of persons or Nations under the Gospel, no man is ever the more or less acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to God, because he is a Jew or a Greek, but the only thing of any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue now is Faith in Christ, or a belief of the Gospel, which is indifferently offered to all. Now this is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> and to his death upon the Cross, because thereby Christ put an end to the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and sealed this new Covenant of Grace with Mankind, as the Apostle explains himself in the following Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, 17, 18, &amp;c. that Christ <hi>having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished the Law of Commandments</hi> by his death, <hi>he came and preached peace</hi> (that is, the Gospel of Peace) <hi>to them who were afar off</hi> (to the Gentile World) <hi>and to them who were nigh</hi> (to the Jews, who were Gods peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) that is, he abrogated the <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law, that Law of Commandments</hi>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:100660:170"/>
                     <hi>contained in Ordinances,</hi> which was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Jews, and separated them from the rest of the World; and he broke down the <hi>middle Wall of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which kept the <hi>uncircumcised Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, though Proselytes,</hi> at a distance from God, as confining their worship to the outward Court of the Temple, which the Apostle seems to refer to in that phrase, <hi>them that were afar off;</hi> and now by the Gospel he admits the Gentiles to as near an approach to God, as the Jews; as he adds, <hi>for through him, we both have an access by one spirit to the Father, Ver.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Jews are said <hi>to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Curse of the Law</hi> by the accursed Death of Christ upon the Cross, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. Because the Death of Christ put an end to that legal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, and sealed a new and better Covenant between God and Man: and the Gentiles <hi>were redeemed from their vain Conversation received by tradition from their Fathers,</hi> that is, from those idolatrous and impure practices they were guilty of, <hi>not with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:100660:171"/>
1. 18, 19. Now the Gentiles were delivered from Idolatry by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, which is called their being redeemed by the blood of Christ, because we owe this unspeakable bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to his Death, <hi>who having abolished in his flesh</hi> (by his Death) <hi>the enmity, even the Law of Commandments, &amp;c. came and preached peace to you, which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as the Death of Christ upon the Cross, and his Ascension into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and presenting his blood to God in that <hi>true holy place,</hi> did answer to the first sprinkling of the blood under the Law, which confirmed the <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Covenant, as the Apostle discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. So his continual Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us in vertue of his blood once shed, and once offered to God, answers to those frequent expiations by Sacrifice under the Law, especially to that general Sacrifice on the great day of expiation, when the High Priest entred into the holy of holies with the the blood of Beasts.</p>
                  <p>The reason, why the legal Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were so often repeated, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were imperfect and typical,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100660:171"/>
                     <hi>but a shadow of good things to come, and so could not take away sin;</hi> but Christ <hi>by one offering hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. Hebr.</hi> 10. 14. He hath made a perfect expiation for our sins by dying once, and hath sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the promises of pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness to them who are sanctified, and <hi>where remission is, there is no more offering for sin, Ver.</hi> 18 Such a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as once for all Seals the Covenant of Pardon and Forgiveness, makes all other Offerings and Sacrifices needless; and then the High Priest, who entred into the Holy of Holies with the blood of the Sacrifice, did continue there to intercede for the people, but came out of that holy place, and could not return thither again without a new Sacrifice; <hi>but this man after he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered one Sacrifice, for ever sat down at the right hand of God. Hebr.</hi> 10. 12. and because <hi>he continueth for ever, he hath an unchangeable Priesthood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able also to save them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make Intercession for them. Hebr.</hi> 7. 24, 25. So that Christ by his Death expiated our sins, and confirmed an everlasting Covenant,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100660:172"/>
and being ascended up into Heaven he there appears in the presence of God for us, and perpetually intercedes in vertue of his blood once offered, which is of infinite more value than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Sacrifices of the Law: he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the pardon of our sins by his Death, and dispenses this pardon to us by his Intercession; he sealed that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace by his blood, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for us in vertue of his blood, but still according to the terms and conditions of that Covenant, and this is all we must expect from him as our Mediator.</p>
                  <p>From what I have now discourst, it appears, how injurious those men are to the <hi>blood of Christ</hi> (how much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pretend to magnifie it) who attribute no more to it than a <hi>non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of sin,</hi>

                  <p>The Scripture takes no notice of their artificial method, that the guilt of sin is taken away by the Death of Christ, and that we are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by his Righteousness; but the blood of Christ is said to justifie us, and to

give us admission into the holiest of all, into Heaven it self, nay we are made righteous by the Death of Christ too. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God by him:</hi> that is, though Christ was a very holy Person, yet he died as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our sins, <hi>the just for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, that we might be reconciled to God:</hi> So that our Righteousness as well as innocence is owing to the Death of Christ, to that Sacrifice he offered for our sins: his blood had a great vertue and efficacy in it to make us righteous, <hi>to purge our Consciences from dead works, that we might serve the living God,</hi> and our Righteousness and acceptance with God is wholly owing to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which he purchast and sealed with his blood.</p>
                  <p>But though the pardon of our sins, and our justification be attributed to the blood of Christ, yet I could never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self, that this wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the perfect obedience and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of his life: for the Apostle tells us, that we are <hi>accepted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. Eph.</hi> 1. 6. So that whatever ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Christ <hi>beloved of God,</hi> did contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100660:173"/>
something to our acceptance; for because he was beloved we are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his sake, and I think no man will deny, that God was very highly pleased with the perfect obedience of our Saviours life.</p>
                  <p>We know how many blessings God bestowed upon the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> for the sake of their Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who were great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Faith and Obedience, which made them very dear to God; and there is no doubt, but God was more pleased with the obedience of Christ, than with the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore we ought not to think that we receive no benefit by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ, when <hi>Abrahams</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity was so blessed for his sake: but then the Righteousness of Christs life and the Sacrifice of his death do not serve two such different ends, as these men fancy, (that the death of Christ removes the guilt of sin, and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is imputed to us to make us righteous) but they both serve the same end to establish and confirm the Gospel-Covenant: God was so well pleased with what Christ did and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, with the obedience of his life
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100660:174"/>
and death, that for his sake he entred into a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; as <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith was not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi> to his posterity, as their act, but <hi>for Abrahams sake God entred into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them, and chose them for his peculiar people.</hi> The Obedience and Righteousness of Christs life was one thing, which made his Sacrifice so me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, which was <hi>the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot.</hi>

2. 8. and his offering himself in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is called <hi>doing the will of God, Hebr.</hi> 10. 9, 10. and whether this be <hi>properly</hi> said or not, I will leave the Doctor to dispute it with the Apostle; it is plain, that in this Chapter, there is no express mention made of any other act of Obedience and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, whereby we are reconciled to God, but only his dying for us, in <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. The Apostle tells us, <hi>that Christ died for us, while we were Sinners,</hi> in <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. <hi>that we are justified by his blood,</hi> in the 10. <hi>that we are reconciled to God by the Death of his Son,</hi> which makes it more than probable, that by his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and obedience here, the Apostle understands his Death and Sufferings, because this was the subject of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: but yet these expressions <hi>his Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> seem to take in the whole compass of his obedience in doing and suffering the will of God: and the meaning of the words is this, that as God was so highly displeased with <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, that he entailed a great many evils and miseries, and death it self upon his Posterity for his sake, so God was so well pleased with the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Obedience of Christs

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100660:175"/>
as God is; which <hi>Righteousness</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>gift,</hi> because it is not owing solely to humane endeavours, but is wrought in us by supernatural means, by those powerful arguments and motives, and divine assistances, which God in infinite love and goodness has afforded the World by Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>This gives a fair account how we may be said <hi>to be made righteous by the Righteousness of Christ,</hi> not that his actual obedience is reckoned as done by us (which is impossible) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are made righteous both in a proper and forensick sense by the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant,</hi> which is wholly owing to the Grace of God, and to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Righteousness of Christ: the great arguments and motives, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful assistances of the Gospel form our minds to the love and practice of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and so make us inherently righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and the <hi>Grace of the Gospel</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and rewards that sincere and Evangelical obedience, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rigour and severity of the Law could deserve no reward: so that <hi>our Righteousness</hi> is wholly owing to the <hi>Righteousness of Christ,</hi> which may in this sense be said to be <hi>imputed to us</hi>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:100660:176"/>
(though that phrase never occurs in Scripture) because without this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, which is founded on the <hi>Righteousness of Christ,</hi> the best man living could lay no claim to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness or future glory.</p>
                  <p>So that the <hi>Righteousness of Christ</hi> is our Righteousness, when we speak of the foundation of the Covenant, by which we are accepted, but if we speak of the terms of the Covenant, then we must have a righteousness of our own, for the Righteousness of Christ will not serve the turn: Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and our own are both neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to our Salvation, the first as the foundation of the Covenant, the other as the condition of it.</p>
                  <p>The sum of this Section is this, that there is no foundation in reason or Scripture, to imagine any such Union betwixt Christ and Believers, as should intitle them <hi>to all the personal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ,</hi> as much as if it had been performed by themselves; but the vertue of Christs Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, so far as it concerns our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is contained in the Gospel-Covenant: he is the Mediator of the Covenant, and his blood is the blood
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:100660:176"/>
of the Covenant, and we must expect no other advantage from what Christ hath done and suffer'd, but to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to the gracious terms and conditions of the Gospel.</p>

                  <p>I Have now explained to you the nature of our Union to the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> as these men represent it, whereby (they say) we are entitled to all his <hi>Excellencies, Graces, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Preciousness, &amp;c.</hi> and made it appear, that there is no foundation for such a notion, either in Scripture or reason; but before I dismiss this, it will be convenient to take notice of the great evil and mischief of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which may satisfie any consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man (though there were no other evidence of it) how false it is; and I shall observe two things to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: First, That according to this
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100660:177"/>
notion <hi>men may, nay must be united to Christ, while they continue in their sins,</hi> which according to my understanding overthrows all Religion, and destroys the necessary obligations to an holy life. Secondly, That according to these mens discourses no man can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tell how to <hi>get into Christ,</hi> or know whether he <hi>be in Christ or not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the first, that men may, nay must be united to Christ, while they continue in their sins, it is easie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce abundant evidence for the proof of it. <note n="*" place="margin">Sound Believer. p. 321.</note> Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi> tells us expresly, <hi>that obedience does not make us Gods people, or God our God, but he is first our God (which is only by the Covenant of Grace) and hence it is, that he being ours, and we his, we of all others are most bound to obey:</hi> as for the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obedience, we will consider that anon, at present it suffices, that we are Gods people, and that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant of Grace, before we obey him: the same Author <note n="*" place="margin">P. 318.</note> tells us, <hi>that we are not united to Christ our life by obedience, as</hi> Adam <hi>was to God by it, but by Faith</hi> (that is by such a Faith of which Obedience is no part,

otherwise he opposes a part to the whole, and so the same thing to it self) <hi>and therefore as all actions in living things comes from Union, so all our acts of obedience are to come by Faith, from the Spirit on Christs part, and from Faith on our part, which make the Union:</hi> the meaning of which is this, that we must first be united to Christ by this Faith (of which more anon) before we can do any thing, that is good; before this Union <hi>the best actions we can do, are sins,</hi> which is a plain demonstration of the truth of this charge; because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this principle we can do nothing but sin, before we are united to Christ: hence these men constantly place <hi>our justification before our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> that we are first accounted holy by God before we are made holy, now our justification follows our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to Christ, and our fanctification follows our justification, and therefore we must first be united to Christ, so as to have a title to all the Promises of the Gospel, to Justification and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, before we are sanctified, that is, before we are made Holy: hence we are told, <hi>that</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But not to insist upon some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sayings, let us consider the whole progress of the Soul (as they represent it) to a closure with Christ, the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral steps and degrees whereby men are brought at last to <hi>an Union with the Lord Iesus,</hi> and they are <hi>Conviction, Compunction, Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>uniting Grace;</hi> now if there be nothing of forsaking sin included in all this, then men must be united to Christ before they forsake their sins: it were easie to produce the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judgments of many Authors, for what I shall now say, but that would be too tedious, and therefore I shall confine my self to Mr. <hi>Shephards Sound</hi>

                  <p>For now when the Soul is thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, it is time it should go to Christ, though the truth is, such Souls are <hi>so wounded and humbled now, that they</hi>

                     <hi>done all for it, it comes out of all it hath or doth unto Christ for life. The Soul by sin is averted from God, and turns his back upon God, the turning and coming of the Soul (not unto duties of Holiness, for that is obedience properly, but) unto God in Christ again is properly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Faith: So to come to Christ, as to drink in of Christs fulness, is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then Faith is the coming of the <hi>whole Soul to Christ,</hi> and that is, <hi>when the eye of the Soul so sees Christ, and the</hi>

                     <hi>heart so embraceth, and relyeth upon Christ, as that it resteth in Christ, as in its portion and all-sufficient good.</hi> This is the Faith which unites us to Christ, and this Faith you see hath nothing at all to do with obedience <hi>in uniting us to Christ;</hi> but it perfects this Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and Believers, while they are as ugly, and deformed, and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as may be; very unfit persons me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks to become the Members of so holy an Head.</p>
                  <p>This is enough to convince any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering man, how false this notion is of our Union to Christ, according to which wicked men who live in sin, may be united to Christ: for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100660:182"/>
places the <hi>formal nature of our Union to Christ</hi> in a <hi>subjection to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and <hi>Obedience to his Laws,</hi> as I have already made it appear; and therefore an holy life must not only follow our Union to Christ, as an effect of it, but must at least in order of Nature go before it, because by this we are united to Christ. A visible profession of an holy life is necessary to our admission into the Christian Church, which is the Body of Christ; but though this makes us visible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christs Body, and give us a right to an external Communion, yet we are not real and living Members of Christ, till we sincerely obey him, till our minds are transformed into his Image: our Union to Christ is more or less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect according to our attainments in true piety and vertue. The first and lowest degree of our Union with Christ is a belief of his Gospel, which in order of Nature must go before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it; but yet it includes a purpose and resolution of obeying it; and in this sense we must be united to Christ, before we can be holy; because this belief of his Gospel is the great Principle of Obedience; as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100660:183"/>
tells his Disciples, <hi>Abide in me, and I in you, as the branch cannot bring forth fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye, except you abide in me, Ioh.</hi> 15. 4. But then our Union is not perfected without actual obedience; this makes us the true Disciples of Christ, when we are fruitful in good works, as he adds in <hi>Vers.</hi> 8. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that you bring forth much fruit, so shall you be my Disciples.</hi> A belief of the Gospel of Christ, and a purpose to live in obedience to it, is all that can be expected from begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but this doth not give us an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual title to all the promises of the Gospel, unless we actually obey it: but when in the strength of this Faith we conquer all the temptations of the World and the Flesh, and improve all the opportunities of doing good, this makes us the Disciples of Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and Heirs of Glory: Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives bad men as soon as they believe his Gospel, and resolve to be good, but their reward is suspended upon the performance of these vows, and this is no reproach to his Holiness; but nothing can be a greater dishonour to our Saviour, nor a greater contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:100660:183"/>
to his Gospel, than to affirm, that wicked men, while they continue such, are actually united to Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have an actual right to pardon, and righteousness, and eternal life. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> I am sure, understood not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when he told us, <hi>That God is light, and in him is no darkness at all: if we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,</hi> (live in any sin) <hi>we lye, and do not the truth; but if we walk in the light, as God is in the light, then have we fellowship one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine doth not only take away the necessity of holiness in order to our Union with Christ, but destroys the necessary obligations to holiness and obedience for the future, and so thrusts holiness quite out of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. Our Union to Christ is perfected while we are unholy, and when we are united to Christ, there is less need of holiness than before; for now the Merits and satisfaction of Christs death is imputed to us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the guilt of sin, and to deliver us from the punishment of it; and his actual obedience is imputed to us to make us righteous, and to give us an
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:100660:184"/>
actual right to Glory: so that if men will obey Christ out of a principle of good nature, and thankfulness to him, they may; but according to this notion there can be no necessity of it, because they are delivered from the wrath of God, and have a right to eternal life without it: And this is a plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that these notions are so far from being an essential part of the Christian Religion, that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all Religion, by leaving it at every mans liberty, whether he will worship and obey God or not: but I have <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> discoursed this at large already in the examination of Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> reasons for the necessity of Holiness and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

                  <p>THus I have made good the first charge, that according to this
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:100660:184"/>
notion of our Union to Christ men may, nay must be united to Christ (if ever they be united) while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in sin, and this is a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Person and Gospel of our Saviour; the other thing which I charged upon this notion, is a more immediate <gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>injury to men, as expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to perpetual doubts and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies about their Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> that according to these principles no man can certainly tell how <hi>to get into Christ, or know whether he be in Christ or not:</hi> And if I can make this appear, it will be a sufficient reason for every man to reject it, who hath any care of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or any regard to the peace and quiet of his own mind.</p>
                  <p>First then according to these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples there is no certain way <hi>to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ:</hi> Suppose a sinner, who hears of those great Priviledges, which are consequent upon our Union to Christ, should inquire what course he should take to be united to Christ, and to have a Right and Interest in all the <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, Preciousness, Graces,</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> of the <hi>Lord Iesus;</hi> the method prescribed in order to this is <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Compunction, Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi>
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:100660:185"/>
which is the <hi>uniting Grace;</hi> now I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve first, that a man is <hi>passive</hi> in all this, and can contribute nothing to it himself any otherwise, than as he is acted by an irresistible power, and it is a vain thing to give such rules and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections as no man can follow; this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us by what methods <hi>God</hi> unites us to Christ; not what we <hi>must do,</hi> but what we must <hi>suffer</hi> in order to this Union. <hi>A Sinner may stir up in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self some natural conviction of sin, some natural fear and sorrow, &amp;c.</hi> and in a sense of this may <hi>set upon the work of reformation, of leaving his sins, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming duties,</hi> but all this they tell us is to no purpose; for unless this convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and compunction, and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be wrought in us by the irresist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible power of the Spirit of God (which no man can possibly tell, whether it be or not) it is not of the right stamp, and will avail us nothing: So that the sinner hath nothing to do but to sit still, and patiently expect till God will do all for him.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, Suppose a man have this <hi>conviction, compunction,</hi> and <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> is this a sufficient reason to lay hold on Christ by the hand of Faith?
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100660:185"/>
by no means; the end of <hi>conviction</hi> is <hi>compunction,</hi> and the end of <hi>compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is <hi>humiliation,</hi> and all this carries us no nearer to Christ, <hi>than</hi>

                     <hi>turning the other cheek unto the Lord even smiting of us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that if the Lord show mercy, it will be wonderful, if not yet the Lord is Righteous, and therefore we have no reason to quarrel against him for denying special mercy to those to whom he does not owe a bit of bread: and now the Soul is indeed humbled, because it submits to be disposed of as God pleases;</hi> that is to be saved or damned: so that this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, compunction,</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> contribute nothing to our Union with Christ, but their whole vertue consists in bringing us to such a temper of mind, as to be content either to <hi>have Christ,</hi> or <hi>to go without him,</hi> as God shall please: <note n="*" place="margin">P. 137.</note> 
                     <hi>humiliation makes the Soul in the sense of its own infinite vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and unworthiness not to quarrel at the Lord, and Devil-like grow fierce and impatient before and against the Lord, in case he should never help it, never pity it, never succour it.</hi>

                     <hi>this do thee good,</hi> and this is all men get by <hi>humiliation, that if the Lord intend to do them good,</hi> this is the way, in which he will do it, but though they be humbled, they cannot be sure, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God intend to do them good or not: and therefore we are told, that <note n="*" place="margin">P. 144.</note> we are as much bound to submit to God, whether he will save or damn us, as we are to submit to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of God, as to any <hi>common mercy:</hi> though you must <hi>pray for mercy, it must be with submission to the good will of the Lord, saying the Lords will is good</hi> (whether it be to save or damn) <hi>but mine is evil,</hi> though it be to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to have Jesus Christ: nay we are much more bound to submit our selves to God, whether he will save or damn us, than we are to submit to him in the lesser concernments of this life: <note n="*" place="margin">P. 145.</note> 
                     <hi>For if it be pride to murmur in case the Lord deny you smaller matters, the offals of this life, doest thou not see, that it is far greater pride for thee to sink, and quarrel with him, if he denies thee greater, the things of another life? is he bound to give thee greater, who doth not owe thee the least? the Lord gives you life, blessed be his name, but you ask</hi>
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:100660:186"/>
                     <hi>for treasures of Grace and mercy</hi> (now God hath given you life, you would feign live for ever, an unpardonable fault this!) <hi>thousands of pounds, Christ himself, and all that he is worth, and the Lord seems to deny you, and now you sink, and grow sullen, may not the Lord now say, was there ever such pride and insolence?</hi> as to be unwilling to be damned for ever; though I dare say this is not the pride which cast the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Angels out of Heaven. So that though <hi>conviction,</hi> and <hi>compunction,</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> be the only way to come to Christ, yet it is such a way, as brings us never the nearer him; when all this is done we are where we were: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were humbled it was at the Lords good pleasure, whether we should have Christ or not, and so it is still.</p>
                  <p>What then is to be done further in order to our <hi>closing with Christ by Faith?</hi> for hitherto there is no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for our Faith: why <hi>you must not catch at Christ, but stay till God give Christ to you, till God take you up in his arms, that you may lean and rest upon the bosom of your beloved through Faith; you must stay till God give you a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>

                     <hi>not immediately offer himself to all men, as a Saviour, whereby they may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to serve him as a King</hi> (that is he does not promise Salvation and Eternal Life in the Gospel with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, that every one that will, should take encouragement from these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to obey and serve him) <hi>but first as a King, commanding them to cast away their Weapons, and stoop under his Scepter, acknowledging that if ever he save me, I will bless him, if he damn me</hi>

                     <hi>God hath elected but few, and Christ hath shed his blood for few, and therefore we must venture,</hi> (and a hard venture it is, where there is such great odds against us, and yet our eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness depends upon the success, too great a stake for such a venture!) <hi>as many men among us do now, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one good living fallen, twenty of them will go and seek for it, although they know only one shall have it</hi> (though did they know, it were irrevocably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, who should have it, none of them would stir, but wait till the news were brought them; good God what Merchant-Adventurers are poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,

                     <hi>For if you come to Christ, because you have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> (that is, if you come to Christ, because you are sure you are already come) <hi>or because you feel such and such graces, and Heavenly impressions of Gods Spirit in you, then you may many a day and year keep at a distance from Christ, and live without Christ:</hi> this is a hard saying, that though we <hi>come</hi> to Christ, we may keep <hi>at a distance</hi> from him, nay though we come, because we are sure, we are come already: it is time

now to give over, and despair of ever being sure, when <hi>assurance it self</hi> is no security.</p>
                  <p>Nothing then but a <hi>particular call</hi> is a good reason to come to Christ: <hi>when the Spirit of God makes the general call</hi> (which signifies nothing) <hi>particular,</hi>

                     <hi>when the Soul sees, that the Lord in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial means me, singles out me in special to believe: for otherwise the Souls of the elect will not be much moved with the call of God, so long as they think, that the Lord offers no more mercy to me than to any reprobate</hi> (that is no more mercy than what will damn them) <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the spirit of Christ makes the call particular, I have called thee by name, Isaiah</hi> 43. 1. <hi>He calleth all his Sheep by name, Iohn</hi> 10. 5. <hi>not by their Christian name</hi> (as he well observes, for they cannot be Christians before they come to Christ, and that must be after this call) <hi>but as the Lord from before all Worlds wrote down their names in the Book of Life, and loves them in special, so in vocation (the first opening of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the Lord makes this call special; and so special as if it were by name: look, saith the Lord Iesus, how I have left thousand thousands in the World, and</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:100660:189"/>
                     <hi>have had greater cause so to have left thee</hi> (this is free Grace indeed) <hi>but behold I am come unto thee, oh come thou unto me.</hi> So that it is impossible for a Sinner to do any thing in order to his Union to Christ; there is no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our Faith in Christ, but this <hi>particular call,</hi> and we must wait pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for it, and be contented too, if it never come.</p>
                  <p>And when the Soul hath this <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular call,</hi> suppose it should suspect this <hi>call</hi> for a delusion, what course can it take to satisfie it self, that this is the call of the spirit of God, and not the cheat and imposture of an enthusia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick fancy? truly none that I know of; if this calling by name will not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie it, there is no other way but to call for the Book of Election, and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its name be enrolled there: the best of it is, that all that are called must come, and therefore they need inquire no further.</p>

                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:100660:191"/>
                     <hi>do you not think, speak, act as you did before? do ye walk in newness of life? &amp;c. have you crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts? do you bring forth fruit, as every branch in Christ (which is not rejected by him) doth?</hi> that is, you must prove your justification by your sanctification, your Faith by your Works: It must be acknowledged, that these are some of those marks and Characters, which the Scripture gives of good Christians, by which we may as certainly know what our state is, as the Tree is known by its Fruit; and since it is no better, I am heartily glad it is no worse, that good works and a holy life may at least put in for marks and evidences of a justified state: though the truth is, this is a meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to holiness, and as they order the matter, a holy life can no more be the sign of a justified state, than it can justifie us.</p>
                  <p>For first, since holiness is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to our Union with Christ, it can be no necessary sign of it; we are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ before we are holy, as appears from what I have already dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed, and therefore an unholy man may be united to Christ, and how then
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:100660:191"/>
can holiness be the only sure mark of our Union to Christ? indeed they tell us, that holiness does necessarily follow our Union to Christ, but no man knows how long it may be before it follows, and yet all this while such a Person is united to Christ; at best this gives evidence but to one part of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, a holy life may be a good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that such a man is in Christ, but the want of it is no certain evidence, that a man is not in Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this mark may be rejected by any one, who hath no mind to it.</p>
                  <p>Nay secondly, According to these mens principles, we cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are holy or not, till we know whether we are in Christ or not; our Union to Christ must be an evidence of our holiness, not our holiness an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Union to Christ: till we are united to Christ, we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to please God, the best actions of Christless and unregenerate men are but <hi>splendida peccata, glittering impieties,</hi> which may appear so fair and lovely, that they may deceive both other men and themselves for the true fruits of the Spirit, but yet are odious and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to God, because <hi>the person</hi> who
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:100660:192"/>
does them, is <hi>out of Christ:</hi> our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must be first accepted in Christ, and then our services: we cannot judge of holiness by the external performance of any duty, nor by the inward sense of our own minds, but must first know whether we are in Christ, whether our persons be accepted in him, before we can tell whether any thing we do be good and acceptable to God: and this is a plain demonstration, that holiness cannot be an evidence of our Union to Christ, because we must first know our Union to Christ, before we can know that we are holy.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, At other times these men make <hi>the work of sanctification in this life</hi> so imperfect, and so like an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified state,</hi> that it is impossible to distinguish a sanctified and unsanctified man; and upon this account holiness and sanctification must needs be a very sorry evidence of our Union to Christ, when it is so imperfect, that it cannot be known, for that which is an evidence of another thing, ought to be very evident it self.</p>
                  <p>An unregenerate man is under the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> under the reigning power of it, and a <hi>regenerate man</hi> (as they des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:100660:192"/>
him) is in a state as like this, <hi>as one Egg is like another:</hi> for <hi>a regenerate</hi> man may be <hi>carnal, sold under sin,</hi> that is a Slave and Captive to it; <hi>he may do those things which he allows not, nay those things which he hates;</hi> that is, he may sin against the clearest convictions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and sense of duty; he may neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to do those things which he knows he ought to do, and do those things which he knows he ought not to do; he may <hi>find a Law in his members, that when he would do good evil is present with him; a Law in his members warring against the Law of his mind, which brings him into Captivity to the Law of sin, that is in his members:</hi> for so they tell us, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complains of all this <hi>in the Person of a regenerate man,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Now an unregenerate man does the very same, and indeed cannot do much worse; <hi>he sins against his Conscience, is brought into Captivity to sin, and is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd by indwelling sin; he finds a great many natural fears and terrours, when he is tempted to sin, which give some check to him, and make him sin against his own will with some unwillingness and reluctancy; he approves the Law of God as just and equal, his Conscience assents to it, but there is a strong byass upon his</hi>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:100660:193"/>
                     <hi>will, which runs counter to all these holy commands, and makes him a Slave and Captive to his lusts;</hi> Now not to dispute at present which of these two the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle means in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. I think it is hard to assign any difference between them, the <hi>regenerate man</hi> according to this description is full as bad as the <hi>unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man,</hi> or if there be any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the <hi>regenerate man</hi> is the worse of the two, <hi>because in the regenerate man the Spirit is led into Captivity, but in the unregenerate man only natural Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is a much weaker principle, and so is capable of a better excuse, is led into Captivity;</hi> but which of these two it is no man can tell, and therefore a regenerate man hath great reason to fear, that he may be unregenerate, and an unregenerate man hath as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to hope that he may be regenerate: and what becomes then of this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of sanctification to prove our Union to Christ, when sanctification it self cannot be distinguisht from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified State: <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. p. 182.</note> Dr. <hi>Iacomb</hi> in his Discourse of the Law of Sin, attempts to assign the difference <hi>between the Law of sin as it is in the regenerate, and as it is in the unregenerate;</hi> and hath given
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:100660:193"/>
us such a Description of an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate State, that I think there is scarce such an unregenerate man in the World; and yet if we must judge what a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man is by inverting the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the unregenerate, he is by odds much the worse man.</p>
                  <p>As first, <hi>When the whole bent and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the heart is towards sin, when the propensities of the Soul thereto are entire and unmixt, there it is the Law of sin, and the Law of sin, which is proper to the unregenerate:</hi> but is every one a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man then, who hath some good inclinations and propensities in him? who hath some wouldings and vellei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to that which is good? it is to be hoped then as many bad men as there are, there are few unregenerate men in the World.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Which he tells us is the <hi>explication</hi> of the former, (as indeed I think it needs some explicati<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>when all the several faculties of the Soul are altogether on sins side, and wholly take its part, then it is the Law of sin, and that which is proper to the unregenerate: where the understanding gives in its final and positive dictate, that sin is good, represents it as eligible to the will,</hi>
                     <pb n="372" facs="tcp:100660:194"/>
                     <hi>upon this closes with it, embraces it, cleaves to it, the affections (desire, joy, delight) run out upon it, where it is thus the case is determined:</hi> Yea without controversie; but where shall we find such a man? it is so far from being true, that there are such unregenerate men, that I believe there never was such a man born: there are too many, who chuse evil though they know it to be evil, for the seeming advantages of profit or pleasure it brings with it; but to chuse evil as believing it to be good, and to rejoice and delight in it as good and eligible for it self, is such an unregenerate State, as the Devil himself never yet arrived at; for though he be a very wicked Spirit, yet he is no Fool, or Sot, as those must be, who mistake evil for good in such plain and palpable instances; the Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at this rate were all regenerate men, for their Consciences accused them for doing evil. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. they knew good to be good, and evil to be evil, though they did not act agreeably to this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: there never was such a man as he describes, when he tells us, <note n="*" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                     <hi>That sin comes to the Sinner, and says, art thou willing that I should rule? Yes (saith he)</hi>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:100660:194"/>
                     <hi>with all my heart, I like thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Government, I am thine, and submit to thee to be at thy dispose, I here swear fealty and allegiance to thee, &amp;c.</hi> This <hi>Oath, &amp;c.</hi> might very well have been spared, for there is enough in all Conscience without it: and yet if this be the principal difference between a regenerate and unregenerate man, that the unregenerate man chuses sin as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it to be good, and the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man chuses sin, though he knows it to be evil, it is plain, that the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man is much the worse, because his sins have the greatest aggravation that any sins are capable of, which the sins of an unregenerate man have not, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are sins against know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and so according to our Saviours reasoning, this regenerate man will be beaten with more stripes; I doubt not but in this description he wrongs the unregenerate man very much, but yet he makes the regenerate man ten times more the Child of wrath than the other.</p>
                  <p>But then Thirdly, <hi>The Law of sin hath different workings in the people of God than in others;</hi> this working of the Law of sin in the people of God,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:100660:195"/>
let it be what working he will, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks is an ill thing, and makes sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication a very sorry evidence, but let us hear how it is.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Where sin is committed indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously and designedly, there it is the Law of sin, and which is peculiar to the Graceless:</hi> so that unless men be very cunning at the trade of sin, and lay projects and designs of sinning, they are not under the Law of sin, as it is peculiar to the Graceless; Grace is very consistent with taking all fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of sinning, so we do not design it before hand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>When the temptation easily prevails, and there is little or no opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to sin, then it is the Law of sin,</hi> as it works in the unregenerate: this is an argument indeed that a man is a willing slave, but when a man is conquered by a temptation, though he make some resistance, it is an argument that sin is his Master, which rules and governs, especially if this be often; and such a man surely is none of Christs Freemen.</p>
                  <p>And therefore not to fail, Thirdly, <hi>When sin carries it in spight of all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, then it is the Law of sin, and the</hi>
                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:100660:195"/>
                     <hi>power of sin: that is, against all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal discouragements, all the threatnings of the Law of God, the Scepter of the Gospel, the love and mercy of God, or his wrath and justice, the Death, Sufferings, Agonies, Wounds, Blood of Iesus Christ, the reproof of the Word, Ministers, Christians; his own resolutions, vows, promises, purposes, &amp;c.</hi> So that it seems when sin carries it in despight of all external oppositions only, it is the mark of an unregenerate man, but when it carries it both against external and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal oppositions, that is a sign of a regenerate man: for a regenerate man has the same external oppositions to preserve him from sin, that an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man hath; and besides these he hath the internal oppositions, the checks of his own Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he says the unregenerate man has not.</p>
                  <p>And fourthly, <hi>When it is sinning, and no sense of sin, no after repentance for it, then it is the Law of sin:</hi> now what bad man is there, who does not at one time or other repent of his sins, and complain of them, and how many are there, that repent of their sins, and make large Confessions of them, and yet return to them again: so that there
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:100660:196"/>
are no men, but do at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther express some sorrow for their sins (which he calls Repentance) and there are a great many, who pretend thus to be sorry for their sins; who, it is to be feared, are never the better men for it: and yet were there any such, who sin without any sense of it, they would be much better than these rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men, who feel the gripings of their Consciences for sin, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it.</p>
                  <p>The result is this, That there is no great matter to chuse between the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and the unregenerate man, only (as they order the matter) the regenerate man hath the better name, but is the worse man: that if we come to external evidences, the regenerate man hath all the reason in the World to fear, that he is unregenerate, and the unregenerate man hath some little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to hope, that he is regenerate; and is not Sanctification an excellent mark now of our Union to Christ, when a regenerate man may be full as bad or worse than the unregenerate? Indeed it is wonderful to consider, how little a matter will serve for an evidence of Grace (after all their talk of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation)
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:100660:196"/>
when they come to administer comfort to distressed Consciences:<note place="margin">Shephards Saints Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, pag. 192.</note> 
                     <hi>Oh! saith the Soul, I find sin prevail, and how can I be comforted!</hi> (not by the mark of Sanctification sure!) Answ. <hi>I will subdue your iniquities, and cast your sins into the midst of the Sea.</hi> Obj. <hi>But the Devil will be busie with me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I go.</hi> Answ. <hi>God hath said it, I will tread down Satan under your feet.</hi> Obj. <hi>But I cannot go to God by prayer to fetch comfort:</hi> (Comfort? what hast thou to do with comfort? get quit of thy sins first, and then it is time enough for comfort) Answ. <hi>Though it be so, yet believe and thou shalt have thy desire:</hi> (but I doubt the Soul that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray, cannot believe neither) Obj. <hi>But I am afraid I shall fall away from God</hi> (afraid of it? thou art fallen away from God already, if sin prevail so much, for sin is the great Apostacy from God) Answ. <hi>None can pluck thee out of Christs hands, neither sin nor the Devil</hi> (but how if they be not in Christs hands yet, sin I doubt may keep them out, and if God cut off barren branches from this spiritual Vine, there is some danger that putrid and rotten branches will not escape) <hi>And God</hi>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:100660:197"/>
                     <hi>hath said, I have made an everlasting Covenant with thee, that I will not turn away from thee to do thee good.</hi> Obj. <hi>This is good news, had I a right to the promise, but alas! I cannot believe, and take a naked promise.</hi> Answ. <hi>Dost thou desire to believe and to have Christ? and say thus, If it were possible Christ and Heaven should be separated, I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desire Christ without Heaven, than Heaven without Christ.</hi> Obj. <hi>But this is a hard matter, and I cannot say I tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire Christ on such terms as I should</hi> (this saying is the best sign of Grace I have met with yet; for it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he is an honest man, who will not contradict the natural sense of his mind, and say he can do that, which is impossible to be done: for it is a very odd proposal in order to comfort a poor Soul, that he must be willing to be damned with Christ, before he must take comfort in hopes of being saved by him) Answ. <hi>But is it the grief of thy heart, that thou canst not deny thy self? and desirest thou rather than be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Christ, to close with Christ upon any terms?</hi> Obj. <hi>Alas! I am so far from being grieved as I ought, that I rather find a heart that will not grieve</hi>
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:100660:197"/>
                     <hi>and mourn for sin, &amp;c.</hi> (certainly they are at cross purposes, their Objections and Answers do so ill agree; what is matter for mourning for sin, man? Canst thou desire to have Christ upon any terms, though it be to be damned with him?) Answ. <hi>Hast thou any will to it? mark the place, and whosoever will, let him take of the waters of life freely: not that every one that will have Christ, shall have him, but art thou wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with thy sins? But the poor Soul saith again, I fear I shall never do this: But art thou willing that Christ should make thee willing</hi> (against thy will) <hi>and pitch thee upon a promise, and hold thee there:</hi> (for shame, poor Soul, refuse not this) <hi>then comfort thy self, thou hast a right to Gods promises.</hi> Thus this evidence of Sanctification is dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled away into <hi>a desire to be willing,</hi> nay <hi>into a desire to be made willing;</hi> and he is a strange man, who cannot go so far.</p>
                  <p>But then fourthly I observe further, That when they have a mind to take down the confidence of men, who are apt to presume too soon, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is good, they do so magnifie the attainments of Hypocrites, who shall
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:100660:198"/>
never go to Heaven, that it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any sanctified man to do more than an Hypocrite may do; so that notwithstanding any evidences of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, which he can discover in himself, for ought he or any body else can tell he may be a Hypocrite still; which quite spoils the evidence of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, because we cannot distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish a sanctified man from a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</p>
                  <p>Thus for Example, <hi>One may plead, I</hi>

                     <hi>But I am grieved and am sorrowful, and repent of my sins; so did</hi> Judas; but he hanged himself, and that indeed is no repentance to life: <hi>But I love good men and their company; so did the foolish Virgins;</hi> but they slept, and suffered their lamps to go out, which I hope all that love good men do not: <hi>But God hath given me much knowledge; That thou mayst have, and never be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> yes, and twenty good things more, but if a blameless honest man have the keeping of this knowledge, it is never the worse for him. <hi>But I keep the Lords day strictly; so did the Iews, whom yet Christ condemned:</hi> Had he been as well acquainted with the Scriptures as the Pharisees were, he would not have said, that the Jews kept the <hi>Lords day;</hi> however this is one good thing, which doth well in the company of more, though it will not justifie a man, when it is alone. <hi>But I have many good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and endeavours to get to Heaven; these thou and thousands may have, and miss of Heaven:</hi> and yet when he was in a more gentle humour, he told the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:100660:199"/>
poor doubting Soul, that desire, nay that a desire only to desire at two or three removes, was enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But many do duties without life or zeal, I am zealous; so was Iehu</hi> (to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Worship of <hi>Baal,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Calves) <hi>and so was</hi> Paul <hi>while a Pharisee</hi> (in persecuting the Christian Church, and therefore an universal, and religious, and well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned zeal; for God can be no sign of Grace.) <hi>But I am constant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in godly courses; so did the young man, all these things have I kept from my youth</hi> (only he left Christ for the sake of his riches, and so did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe.) <hi>But some men are conscious to themselves of their own hypocrisie, but I do all with a good heart for God: So thou mayst think of thy self, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;</hi> (and if this be an objection, let a man have what marks he will, the objection will still be good, and so all evidences signifie nothing; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all it may be objected, That a man may be deceived in it, and think he hath these marks, when he hath them not.) <hi>There is a way that seemeth right to a man, but the end thereof is death, thou mayst live so as to deceive</hi>
                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:100660:200"/>
                     <hi>thy self and others, and yet prove an Hypocrite:</hi> as if because some men may think themselves good, who are in a bad way, no man could ever be sure, that he is in the right; and thus fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel all evidences.</p>
                  <p>But after all this, it would be worth the while to know how to distinguish a regenerate from an unregenerate man; and that he tells us may be done thus, <hi>An unregenerate man, let him go never so far, do never so much, yet he lives in some one sin or other;</hi> this now is very strange, <hi>What go never so far? and do never so much? and yet live in some one sin or other?</hi> What live a <hi>blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, innocent, honest, smooth life,</hi> and yet live in some one sin or other? and yet suppose he did, a <hi>regenerate man</hi> may be in <hi>captivity to the law of sin,</hi> and pray what's the difference? but then <hi>an unregenerate man cannot be poor in spirit, and so carried out of all duties to Christ:</hi> That is, if an unregenerate man do good, he is conscious to himself that he doth it, if he have a good heart, he feels a good heart in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and in all he doth, and therefore <hi>feels not a want of all good,</hi> which is true poverty of spirit: So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:100660:200"/>
to this discourse, the surest mark of a regenerate man is either to have no good in himself, or if he have any, to be mistaken and think he hath none, either of which I think is a very odd sign of Grace.</p>
                  <p>But then <hi>an unregenerate man comes unto Christ, but he never gets into Christ, never takes up his eternal rest and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Iesus Christ only:</hi> I thought <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> had been <hi>believing,</hi> and that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> would have done the business, and if so, God forbid that any man should be damned for want of that other Metaphor <hi>of taking up his eternal rest and lodging in Christ: men in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of Conscience</hi> (that is, all unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men under such distress) <hi>if they have comfort from Christ they are contented, if they have Salvation from Hell by Christ they are contented</hi> (and I think they have some reason then to be contented) <hi>but Christ himself</hi> (that is, without comfort and without Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) <hi>contents them not.</hi> Now to be contented with Christ without comfort and without Salvation, is so far from being the mark of an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man, that I am not yet satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:100660:201"/>
that it is the mark of an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man.</p>
                  <p>Now are not these men do you think great friends to sanctification, who make all the parts of sanctification, <hi>the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our lives, an innocent &amp; blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Conversation, Fasting, Prayer, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, conversing with good men, zeal for God, perseverance in well doing, honest and sincere intentions in all we do,</hi> no more than the marks of Hypocrites; and give no better marks of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man than to be sensible of no good in himself, (and then he must either have none, or be a Fool, though ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving none is the surest way not to be sensible of it) and to take up his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rest in Christ, and to be contented with Christ without Comfort and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And now I shall conclude this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a remarkable passage in the <hi>Sincere Convert,</hi> whereby it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently<note place="margin">P. 167.</note> appear, what these men think of <hi>sanctification:</hi> there we have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what course some men take to secure their eternal happiness: <hi>that when they find themselves tired and weary of themselves, and hearing that only</hi>
                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:100660:201"/>
                     <hi>Christ can save them, they go to Christ to remove those sins, which tired and loaded them, that he would enable them to do better than formerly: if they get these sins subdued and removed, and if they find power to do better, then they hope to be saved,</hi> (here is the evidence of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification) <hi>whereas</hi> (as he adds) <hi>thou maist be damned, and go to the Devil at last, though thou dost escape all the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, and that not from thy self, and thy own own strength; but from the knowledge of Iesus Christ, wo to you for ever if you die in this state</hi> (with your sins mortified and subdued by Christ) and the reason is, <hi>because this is to come to Christ to suck juice from him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own Berries</hi> (<hi>his own stock of Graces</hi>) <hi>alas! he is but the Ivy, he is no member nor branch in this Tree, and hence he never grows to be one with Christ.</hi> So that holiness and obedience is no evidence of our Union to Christ, though we fetch strength from Christ to do his will; we may only grasp about Christ all this while, as the Ivy doth about the Oak, but never be united to him, and become one with him: so that now we must return where we began, and stick to the <hi>testimony of the</hi>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:100660:202"/>
                     <hi>Spirit,</hi> without any external evidence, that, is to private Enthusiasms, for san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification can be no evidence of our Union to Christ.</p>
                  <p>Good God! Into what mazes and Labyrinths do these men lead poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Souls, they can direct them to no certain way of getting into Christ, nor how to know whether they are in Christ or not: and now we may plainly see what friends these men are to a holy life: they all agree that holiness is not antecedently necessary to our Union with Christ, but they only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make it a necessary mark and evidence of our Union, and yet they will not allow it this priviledge neither to be a certain evidence of our Union to Christ; it may prove us united to Christ, as the Ivy is to the Oak, not as a branch is united to the Vine; and I hope this will justifie any mans zeal against such opinions, as undermine the very foundations of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>The Gospel method of Salvation is very plain and easie: those great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles our Saviour wrought, and his Resurrection from the Dead, are the foundation of our Faith, a sufficient reason to believe that he came from
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:100660:202"/>
God, and declared his will to the World: a publick profession of this Faith in our Baptism makes us the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible members of his body, which is his Church; and a sincere obedience to his Gospel makes a real Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and us, and entitles us to all the promises of the Gospel: and every man may as certainly know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be thus united to Christ, as he can feel the motions of his own mind, as he can know what he loves, and hates, and chuses, and what the course of his life and actions are, and there is no need of any revelation, of any private testimony of the spirit to assure men of this, no more than there is to assure them of any thing, which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their outward or inward senses.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>testimony of the Spirit</hi> concerns the <hi>general adoption</hi> of Christians for the Sons of God, not to testifie to any particular man, that he is a good Christian, or in a state of Grace: that is, it is not a <hi>private,</hi> but a <hi>publick te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi> given to the whole Christian Church: that Holy Spirit, which God bestowed upon the Apostles and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians, which enabled them to
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:100660:203"/>
work miracles, and to speak Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which they had never learnt, and to Prophesie, was a plain argument to all the World, that God now owned the Christians, not the Jews, for his chosen and elect people, for his Sons and Children: for this was the great dispute of those days, whether Jews or Christians were the Sons of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God now owned the Jewish or the Christian Religion, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles decide this controversie by the testimony of the Spirit; for God could not give a greater testimony to the Christian Church than the gift of the Holy Spirit; for it was a plain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he owned them for his Sons, when he bestowed the Spirit of his Son on them: as the Apostle argues. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> That is, did God bestow his Spirit on you, while ye were Jews? or upon your Conversion to Christianity? for if God bestowed his Spirit only on Christians, this is a sufficient seal to the Christian Religion.</p>
                  <p>This is very plain and intelligible; the testimony of the Spirit assures us, that all Christians are the Sons of God,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:100660:203"/>
and Heirs of his Promises, and every mans own Conscience will tell him, whether he be a Christian, that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he heartily believe, and obey the Gospel of Christ, and herein consists our Union to Christ, and fellowship with him: let us then leave those other dim notions to men, who can believe, what no man can understand, who des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise every thing, that can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as if it were no better than <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reason.</hi>

                  <p>I Have now finisht the greatest part of my design, and shall discourse more briefly of what remains. Next to our <hi>Union</hi> with Christ, follows <hi>our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with him; for though Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowship in the Scripture notion of those words signifie no more, than what we call Union, as <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 4. Sect. 1. P. 186.</note> I have already proved, yet in these mens Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity they are very different: our <hi>Union</hi> to Christ is represented by <hi>our marriage</hi> to him, our <hi>Communion</hi> with him by <hi>consequential, conjugal affections:</hi> the only thing I shall at present take notice of for a Conclusion of all, is that mutual and reciprocal love, which is betwixt Christ and Believers, <hi>Christs love to Believers,</hi> and <hi>the Believers love to Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Christs love to Believers:</hi> the Scripture doth very justly magnifie the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:100660:204"/>
                     <hi>love of Christ,</hi> as the greatest example of goodness, that was ever known in the World; and the greatest expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the love of Christ was his <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us: he is that good Shepherd who giveth his life for his Sheep. Iohn</hi> 10. 11. and our Saviour himself tells us, <hi>greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend:</hi> and therefore when the Apostle designed to mention the greatest expression of Christs Love, he instances in this. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it:</hi> and when the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle represents the constraining power of Christs love to captivate our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to engage us to live to him, he argues from his love <hi>in dying for us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>For the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead, and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again:</hi> and the most sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing circumstance of all, which gives a new luster to the love of Christ, is <hi>that he died for us while we were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. <hi>For when we were</hi>
                     <pb n="394" facs="tcp:100660:205"/>
                     <hi>yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly, for scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a good man some would even dare to die, but God commendeth his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, that while we were yet Sinners, Christ died for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though this be the greatest, it is not the only expression of Christs love; herein indeed was the love of Christ perfected that he died for us, but he expresses the same good will in all the methods of his Grace and Providence: for Christ being our <hi>Lord and Master,</hi> the most proper expression of his love to us is in an easie and gentle Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a kind and watchful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not in such a fondness of passion, as is sometimes seen among equals, this <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 4. Sect. 1.</note> I told you was exprest by those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors of his being a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> a <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> a <hi>Head,</hi> a <hi>Friend:</hi> and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our assures us, <hi>that his yoke is easie, and his burden light,</hi> that he is a mild and gentle Governour, <hi>meek and lowly in mind:</hi> that he hath declared to us the secrets of Gods Counsel concerning our Salvation with the same freedom and plainness, that a man useth to his friend; <hi>henceforth I call you not Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:100660:205"/>
                     <hi>for the Servant knoweth not what his Lord doth, but I have called you Friends; for all things, that I have heard of my Father, I have made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: Iohn</hi> 15. 15. He pities our weakness and infirmities, and is ready to help and succour us; he is now as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up into Heaven, where he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally intercedes for us, and with his own hand dispenses all those blessings to us, which we want and pray for in his name; <hi>he is a gracious and merciful High Priest, who is touched with a feeling of our infirmities, being in all things tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Hebr.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
                  <p>And now it is no wonder, if he, who died, and who intercedes for us, take pleasure in good men, and dwell with them, as one friend dwells with another. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 21. <hi>He that hath my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my self unto him:</hi> and in <hi>Ver.</hi> 23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him:</hi> That is, Christ will in a more peculiar manner be present with such good men,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:100660:206"/>
who are careful in all things to obey him, and will give very sensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of his presence with them: not that he will make any new revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, for he hath already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the whole mind and will of God in such a plain and familiar manner, that every one may understand it, who will but exercise the same reason in it, that he does to understand the Laws of his Prince; but yet when a Soul is transformed into the likeness and image of Christ, it many times feels such strong and vigorous motions to that which is good, and such great and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing delights in all the acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as infinitely excel all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of sense, and are a plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of a more peculiar presence of God in such a Soul; these divine joys are by the Psalmist compared to the Feasts upon Sacrifices, <hi>Psalm</hi> 36. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Sacrifices, which are offered in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for it is very reasonable to think, that a Soul, which is made one with God by a participation of his nature, should feel such divine impressions from God, as may both quicken its motions, and sweeten its work: there is a secret sympathy between things, which are alike, two unisons will move, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is toucht, and two Souls which are of the same make, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a strong and intimate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, do many times feel each others passions at a distance, by a secret and unaccountable power of nature; and can we think then, but that a Soul, which heartily loves God, and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately breaths after a greater likeness to him, and fuller enjoyment of him, must needs sometimes feel such divine touches and impressions as are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects (if I may so speak) of a mutual love and sympathy of natures: some such thing our Saviour hath promised, and good men experience, not in equal degrees indeed, nor equally at all times, but in proportion to their attainments in true Piety and vertue, and to the present frame and disposition of their own minds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="398" facs="tcp:100660:207"/>This is a short and true account of the <hi>love of Christ,</hi> which deserves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to be admired and adored; and it must needs be a very hearty trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all good men to see so great and so generous a love so miserably abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and misrepresented by childish and romantick descriptions: too many there are, who cloath our Saviour with all the passions and follies of mortal men, and think they honour him very much, the more extravagant they make him in his love: It were easie to expatiate in this argument, and to give such a character of the love of Christ, as I believe, these very men will think prophane, when they find it in any Books, but their own; and possibly it might do good service to Religion, and tend much to the honour of our Lord and Master to put them out of conceit with it; but I fear the Reader would think me prophane in doing it, though in their own words, and therefore I shall chuse rather only to take notice of two things, which these men much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on in their discourses of the love of Christ, and so dismiss them.</p>
                  <p>First then, the love of Christ is a love to the <hi>Person</hi> of a Believer, without
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:100660:207"/>
considering any other <hi>qualifications,</hi> than that he is <hi>such an individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> that is, the excellency of Christs love consists in this, that he loves for no reason; now I confess this is a <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful love,</hi> but wherein the excellency of it consists, I cannot see; I am sure we account that man a Fool, who loves at this rate; we who are reasonable Creatures, think that we are bound to govern all our actions and the passions of our mind too by reason, and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a reproach to a man to act ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against reason or without it, to do any thing of which he cannot give a reasonable account; and how that should come to be the perfection of the love of God, which is a reproach to men, is above my apprehension. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were this true, it would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the very foundations of Religion; for the great end of Religion is to please God, and to procure his love and favour, but if God and Christ love for no reason, then it is a vain thing for us to think of pleasing God, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his love by any thing, we can do: whether we obey him, or disobey him, it is all one as to this Case; for if he please to love us without any
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:100660:208"/>
reason, our sins cannot hinder it, and if it does not please him to love us, our Holiness and Obedience cannot alter him: when our acceptation with God depends wholly upon a Soveraign and unaccountable will, nothing we can do can either hinder or promote it, and therefore all Religion is in vain.</p>
                  <p>The foundation of this mistake is a Philosophical nicety, that God must act wholly from himself, and therefore must not be moved by any external cause, whereas should he love us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are holy and obedient to him, or hate us, because we are wicked, his love and hatred would depend upon an external cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the holiness or wickedness of Creatures, which unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an <hi>Independant being</hi> to depend upon any thing else: the sum of which reasoning is this, that because God is the first cause of all things, on whom all other things depend, and he on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, therefore he must love and hate his Creatures without any reason but his own unaccountable will: for this is all the inconvenience they can object, that when God loves or hates, rewards or punishes his Creatures, the reason of this difference, he makes between

his Creatures must be fetcht from the persons themselves, whom he thus loves or hates; and so it must of necessity be, if he have any reason at all; for the reason of love or hatred ought to be in the object, not in the person, who loves or hates: and yet in propriety of speech God cannot be said to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on his Creatures or any thing without himself for the reason of his love or hatred, but his own nature is the reason of it: he is infinitely holy, and therefore loves holiness and hates sin, and his natural love to holiness is the reason why he loves holy men, and his natural hatred to sin is the reason why he hates wicked men; his own holiness is the reason why he loves holy men, but the holiness of a Creature is the reason why he determines his love to any particular person, and if they will call this a depending on Creatures, we must acknowledge that God does thus depend on his Creatures in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of his Providence, in the distributions of rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and he should not be wise, and holy, and just, and good, if he did not, that is, if he did not put such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between things and persons, as
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:100660:209"/>
their natures require. It is a strange noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an <hi>Independant Being,</hi> that he must have no other reason for what he does but his own arbitrary will, which is so far from being a perfection, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys all the other perfections of the divine nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, These men tell us too, that <hi>the love of Christ is immutable,</hi> that having once fixt his love upon us though without any reason, he can never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: that <hi>sin it self cannot separate us from the love of Christ; as there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in us, that was the ground of his planting his love on us, so there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that shall be able to overturn the thoughts of his love, when once they are fixt on us:</hi> (though this is no certain demonstration, for he who loves for no reason may give over loving for none) <hi>if sin fore-seen were not able to hinder him from planting his heart on us, how then shall it</hi> (that is sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) <hi>be able to overturn the thoughts of his heart, when once they are fixed on us?</hi> this is a strong and fixed love indeed, which sin it self cannot alter, but how <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> a love it is, let any man judg: herein <note n="*" place="margin">Com. p. 158.</note> Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> tells us <hi>the depth of Christs love is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated,</hi>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:100660:209"/>
                     <hi>that whereas his holy Soul hates every sin, it is a burden, an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, a new wound to him, and his poor Spouse, that is, sinful Believers are full of sin, failings, infirmities, he hides all, covers all, bears with all, rather than he will loose them.</hi> He adds indeed, <hi>by his power preserving them from such sins, as a remedy is not provided for in the Covenant of grace:</hi> I suppose he means the sin against the Holy Ghost, for there is a remedy provided for all other sins in the Covenant of Grace: and all other sins a Believer it seems may be guilty of, <hi>and Christ will hide all, cover all, rather than lose him:</hi> now this is as down right <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> as ever Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> or <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> vented: There have been and are to this day a great many wise and learned men, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend earnestly for the <hi>perseverance of the Saints,</hi> that those who are once in a <hi>state of Grace,</hi> shall always continue so, but then they found this not on such an immutable love, as sin it self cannot alter, for this is not reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the holiness of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor with those threatnings in the Scripture against such back-sliders; <hi>when the righteous man turneth away</hi>
                     <pb n="404" facs="tcp:100660:210"/>
                     <hi>from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations that a wicked man doth, shall he live? all the righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned; in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die. Ezek.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>And if any man turn back my Soul shall have no pleasure in him:</hi> which is a plain demonstration, the truth of which is acknowledged by all sober Writers, that if such men can be supposed to relapse into a sinful state, God also will cease to love them; and therefore they found the <hi>immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of Gods love to them, on <hi>their perseverance in doing good:</hi> God loves all good men, but if they cease to be good, he also must cease to love: and herein the <hi>immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and unchangeableness of Gods love consists, not that he always loves the <hi>same Person,</hi> but that he always loves for the <hi>same Reason:</hi> for it is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to be so fixt in our kindness, that where we love once, we will always love, whatever reason there may be to alter our affection; for by this means we may love undeserving objects, which is the greatest degeneracy of love: but
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:100660:210"/>
the perfection of love consists in loving deserving objects, and in loving upon honourable reasons, and the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of love consists in loving always for the same reason, which is the only foundation of a <hi>vertuous immutability.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason of Christs love to any Person is his Holiness and Obedience: <hi>if any man love me he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. Iohn</hi> 14. 23. and the unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of his love is seen in this, that he will continue to love, while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to obey him: <hi>if ye shall keep my Commandments,</hi> that is, continue to do so, <hi>ye shall abide in my love,</hi> I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to love you, <hi>as I have kept my Fathers Commandments, and abide in his love. Iohn</hi> 15. 10.</p>
                  <p>This is the immutability of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, that God always acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on steddy and constant principles, that whatever changes there are in the World, which may occasion very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent administrations in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet he is the same still, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver changes; whereas should God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways love the <hi>same Person,</hi> however he changed and alter'd, God must
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:100660:211"/>
change and alter too, because though he still loves the same Person, yet he must love for different or contrary reasons, or for none at all; and that is the much greater change of the two, to alter the reason, than the object of love: if God love a good man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is good, and continue to love him, when he is wicked, his love is a mutable thing, which can love goodness or wickedness, which can love for none, or for contrary reasons; but if God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways love true goodness, and good men, and never loves any other, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever change there be in Creatures, God is the same still, and unchangeable in his love.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see, while these men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to admire and magnifie the love of God and Christ, they make it a despicable and worthless thing, such as a wise man would be ashamed of, and such as a good man cannot be guilty of, to love for no reason, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to love contrary to reason: And as this is a great reproach to God and to our Saviour, so is it a great injury to men too; for it must of necessity make them careless of pleasing God, and secure in their sins, when they are
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:100660:211"/>
perswaded that sin cannot hinder God from loving them, nor alter his love towards them: that if ever he love them, it is for no reason but because he will, and when once he is resolved upon it, the immutability of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes it necessary for him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to love: that now sin it self can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not separate us from the love of God: if this were true, the worst man living would have as much reason to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of Gods love, as the best men have; nay, if the depth, and mystery, and glory of the love of Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in loving for no reason, or contrary to reason, the worse men are, the fitter objects are they of the love of Christ.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Concerning the Believers love to Christ.</head>
                  <p>HAving showed you wherein the <hi>Love of Christ</hi> consists, I shall now consider, what are those returns of love which we owe to our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: I take it for granted, that all men who believe that Christ came into the World to save Sinners, are of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles mind, <hi>if any man love not the Lord Iesus, let him be Anathema Maranatha;</hi> the only dispute is, how we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our love to Christ: now love pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily signifies the inward affection of the mind, but is made visible by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions: as for the affection of the mind, we must consider, that Christ is our Superiour, our Lord and Master, and therefore our love to Christ ought not to express it self in a fond and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar passion, such as we have for our friends and equals, but in a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and devotion: Superiours must be treated with honour and respect,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:100660:212"/>
which requires that we keep our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and therefore our love to our Parents and Superiours is called <hi>honour</hi> in the fifth Commandment, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> and the same religious affection to God which is sometimes called <hi>love,</hi> is at other times called <hi>fear,</hi> which signifies a <hi>reverential love,</hi> or a love of honour, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and devotion: which includes a great delight in the thoughts of God, a devout sense of his greatness and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, a great admiration of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and perfections, a religious awe and reverence for him, and all those affections of the Soul, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive of love and honour.</p>
                  <p>As for the external expressions of our love, they are as various as the expressions of honour are: and herein we must have a peculiar regard to the nature and condition of the Person, and that relation we stand in to him: thus Christ being <hi>the only begotten Son of God,</hi> we must have regard to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and excellency of his <hi>Person,</hi> that our returns may bear some proportion to it: Christ having condescended to come into the World in our nature, to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:100660:213"/>
suffer and die for us, it becomes us to admire his love and goodness, to extol and praise him; to celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of his Death and Passion in that holy Feast, which he hath on purpose instituted to be a thankful remembrance of our Crucified Lord: since he is our Mediator and Advocate, the truest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of our love and honour is to confide and trust in him, to depend on his intercession for us, to offer up all our Prayers to God in his name, and to expect an answer to our Prayers for his sake: and when we consider him as our Prophet and Law-giver, we must express our love to him in a stedfast belief of his Gospel, and in a sincere and hearty obedience to all his Laws: love to equals, who have no authority over each other, but what love gives them, makes them very flexible and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious to each others desires and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests; but our love to Superiours to our Prince or Parents includes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in its own nature; and therefore this our Saviour makes the principal tryal of our love to him; <hi>if you love me, keep my Commandments: and he that hath my Commandments and keepeth</hi>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:100660:213"/>
                     <hi>them, he it is that loveth me: but he that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings; you are my friends, if you do whatsoever I command you,</hi> Joh. 14. 15. 23, 24. and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>vers</hi> 14. for there cannot be a more proper expression of our love and honour to a Law-giver, than to obey his Laws. And when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider our Saviour as <hi>our Guide and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> the truest expression of our love and honour is <hi>to imitate him, to live as he lived in the World:</hi> For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more natural than to imitate what we love and reverence, which is the plainest demonstration of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est honour, in that we think it our perfection and happiness to be like our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>And that which perfects our love, is an undaunted courage and resolution in professing the Faith of Christ, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dangers and miseries it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose us to in this World; as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, <hi>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 18. when we can <hi>hate Father and Mother, Wife and Children, Brethren and Sisters for the sake of Christ, and sacrifice our lives also for him rather than abjure his Gospel, or violate his Laws.</hi> These are
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:100660:214"/>
the proper expressions of our love to Christ, which are summarily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in believing his Gospel, and obeying it; for to be a true Lover of Christ signifies neither more nor less than to be a good Christian, one who diligently obeys all the Laws of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>This is a short account of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Love to Christ, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves a larger Discourse; but I am now hastening to a conclusion, and what I have already said, is so plain and easie, that it may be understood without a larger explication. Our love to Christ is not such a subtil, airy, and metaphysical notion, as some men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it to be, but is a vital Principle of Action, which governs our lives, and makes us fruitful in good works: And indeed of all mistakes there is none more fatal and dangerous than to mistake the nature of our love to Christ, because this is a practical Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which hath an immediate influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our lives, and one mistake in the Principles or Rules of Action is of greater consequence than a great many false Opinions, which end in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation: And therefore for a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:100660:214"/>
of all, I shall briefly take notice of those mistakes some men have been guilty of concerning the nature and expressions of our love to Christ.</p>
                  <p>And first, as they tell us that Christ falls in love with <hi>our Persons,</hi> without considering any qualifications in us, which may make us fit objects of his love, so in requital to him, we must love <hi>the Person of Christ.</hi> This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess is as certain and evident as any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration in <hi>Euclide,</hi> that if we love Christ, we must love his <hi>Person,</hi> for the Person of Christ is Christ himself, and if we love Christ, we must love him, and if they would be satisfied with this, the dispute would be at an end; but this will not serve their turn, and therefore we must examine what they mean by loving the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ: Now they oppose our love to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of Christ to our love to him <hi>upon account of his benefits, to our love to our selves,</hi> and <hi>to our duties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, we must love the Person of Christ in opposition to his benefits, that is, we must not consider what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we do, or may receive from Christ, what he ha<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h done or suffered for us, but we must love his person
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:100660:215"/>
purely for himself without any other considerations to endear him to us: This matter is very gravely stated and determined by * <hi>W. B.</hi> who tells us,<note place="margin">W. B. Christs Personal excellency the object of our love, p. 15.</note> 1. <hi>That it is a good and lawful thing to love Christ in reference to his benefits.</hi> This is a very liberal grant, that grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which hath hitherto been account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great and excellent vertue, is now owned to be a lawful thing. 2. <hi>It is our duty to love Christs Person, to have our hearts drawn out with love to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Person of Christ.</hi> This is so certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that even those men, who love Christ for his benefits, love his Person. But 3. <hi>The excellency of Christs Person is not the object of my Faith, but Christ crucified.</hi> 4. <hi>Though Christ crucified be the object of my Faith, yet the personal excellencies of Christ are the object of my Love: yea it is a more excellent thing yet to love the Person of Christ, than the benefits of Christ, a more excellent thing to have my heart drawn out in love to the Person of Christ, than to have my heart drawn out in love to him for his benefits.</hi> Now what can be the meaning of all this, but that the excellency and perfection of our love to Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in loving him for no reason; the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:100660:215"/>
proper object and reason of love is <hi>Goodness;</hi> to love that which is good for nothing is the folly and degeneracy of love, and it is as foolish and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a task to love a Person, who hath been good to us, not because he hath been good, but for no reason: Now this is the case here, for if you separate the Person and Personal Excellencies of Christ from the consideration of his benefits, his personal goodness from the expressions of his love and goodness to our selves and others, it can be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject nor reason of our love; for a goodness which doth no good, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any, or which is all one, is considered as doing none, is so far from being the object of our love, that it is not the object of our understanding; for we cannot understand what that goodness means, which never did any good. God challenges our love not upon account of an imaginary goodness of Nature, which never did any good, but for the real and sensible effects of his goodness in the works of Creation and Providence, and the Redemption of Mankind by our Lord Jesus Christ; and Christ himself challenges our love for the like reasons, because he hath
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:100660:216"/>
loved us, and dyed for us, and now intercedes for us, and will at the last day bestow a Crown of Glory and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality on us, but never, as I can observe, requires such an abstracted and metaphysical love to his Person, without any respect to his benefits.</p>
                  <p>Indeed these men seem not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand themselves, when they oppose our love to the Person of Christ to our love to him upon account of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; for when you inquire what this Person of Christ is, which is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our love, then they describe his beauty and perfections, <hi>the comeliness of his Person, the sweetness of his dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his great riches, that he is a good suitable to all our wants,</hi> that in him we shall find whatever we need; <hi>if you be poor, he is rich; if you be foolish, he is wise; if you be out of the way, I am the way, saith he; if you want a Director in the way, I am the Truth; if you be in the dark, I am light; if you be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sinful, he is Righteousness, the Lord our Righteousness.</hi> Now either all this signifies the benefits we receive by Christ, or it signifies nothing, and how then do these personal Excellencies of Christ differ from his benefits? nay,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:100660:216"/>
when they direct us how to attain to this love to the Person of Christ, they<note place="margin">W. B. ibid.</note> bid us <hi>behold how Christ hath loved us, and our persons, how many impediments his love hath broken thorough, how free it is,</hi> so free that there was no reason for his love to us, <hi>neither likeness, benefit, nor love,</hi> &amp;c. and they teach us <hi>to use Christ much,</hi> if we would love his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: <hi>in any good thing you have, the more you use it, the more you prize it, and the more you prize it, the more you love it; if you have a good friend, the more you use him, the more you prize him, and the more you prize him, the more you love him; if you have a good Horse, the more you use him, the more you prize him, &amp;c. if you have a good Knife, the more you use it, &amp;c. if you would love Christ, use him much, and then the more you will prize him, and the more you will love him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to let pass the rudeness of the Comparisons, this using Christ must sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his benefits, and to prize and love Christ much, because we use him much, is to love him, because we make great advantage of him, and receive many benefits from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is neither better nor worse than to love him for his benefits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="418" facs="tcp:100660:217"/>The occasion of all this contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confusion in these mens discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is, that they do not distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween loving the benefit, and loving the person upon account of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: It must indeed be acknowledged to be very bruitish and barbarous to delight in the gift, and to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the giver, to solace our selves in the effects of the divine bounty and goodness, and to make no returns of love and thankfulness and duty to God: this is to love the benefit, but not the person, who bestows this benefit: but those blessings and benefits we receive from God and Christ are the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, why we are bound to love them, and could we be supposed to love God and Christ for no reason, or, as these men phrase it, purely for themselves, without respect to those many blessings we have received from them, it would not be accepted, because this is not a reasonable love, but an unaccountable and foolish passion.</p>
                  <p>The love we owe to God and Christ is no other than gratitude, because God loved us first, and our love is only a return of his; now thankfulness and gratitude includes a necessary respect
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:100660:217"/>
to those blessings and benefits we have received: it is peculiar to God, who wants nothing, and can receive nothing from his Creatures, to love without any respect to benefits, but the love of indigent and dependent Creatures is a love of thankfulness, is a grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of those many blessings we receive from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, These men oppose our love to <hi>the person of Christ,</hi> to our love to our selves: the first destroys the reason and the object of our love, and this destroys the principle of it; it is made the Character of a wicked man,<note place="margin">Shephards sincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, p. 4. ed. 1672.</note> who wants <hi>an inward principle of love to God and Christ,</hi> that <hi>though he seeks to honour God never so much, yet all that he doth, is done out of love to himself, and therefore God abhors all that he performs. All the good things such a wicked man doth are for himself, either for self credit, or self-ease, or self content, or self-safety; he sleeps, prays, hears, speaks, professeth for himself alone: hence acting always for himself, he committeth the highest degree of Idolatry—makes himself a God, &amp;c.</hi> Hence the same Author thus exhorts Sinners; <hi>away then out of your selves to</hi>

Here is the strongest dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of all, to row against the stream, to hate a mans self</hi> (our own Souls and eternal Salvation) <hi>and then to follow Christ fully:</hi> now is not this a hard case, that before we can love God and Christ as we ought, we must root out the very principle of all love; that we must learn to hate Salvation and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness, before we can close with Christ for Salvation! he might well say, that this is the strongest difficulty of all, for indeed it is impossible: love to our selves is the foundation of our love to all other things, even to God himself; he that does not love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, will love nothing else; he that hates himself and his own Soul, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spises eternal Salvation, will not care for Christ, nor Salvation by him: all the motives and arguments of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:100660:218"/>
to perswade us to love, and fear, and obey God, are founded on self-love; for how is it possible, that we should be affected with a due sense of Gods goodness to us? that we should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and quickned by the hopes of such great rewards? that we should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd and govern'd by the fears of punishment? if we did not love our selves, if we did not care what became of us, whether we were happy or mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for ever.</p>
                  <p>It is a vain thing to perswade a man not to love himself, for this is as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and necessary, as it is for the fire to burn, or Sun to shine, it is not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our choice, it is not in our power to do otherwise; and all that such discourses as these can do, is either to make men Hypocrites, to pretend to do that which they cannot do; or to make honest men, who cannot thus cheat and delude themselves, despair of their Salvation, because they cannot find themselves contented without Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that Christ without Comfort and without Salvation cannot satisfie them.</p>
                  <p>It is true, when men set up self in opposition to God, when self-love tempts them to disobey God, to despise his Counsels, to renounce their Faith
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:100660:219"/>
and Religion, this is a very vicious and mistaken self-love, such men neither love themselves nor God in a proper sense, because it is our interest as well as duty to obey God: such men are Idolaters, as our Author speaks, because they set up self above God, and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to him; but when our love to our selves teaches us to love God, and in all things to submit our selves to his will and pleasure, we do, as we ought to do; and they who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate our love to God from our love to our selves, from the care of our own happiness and Salvation, do plainly declare, that they neither understand the nature of man, nor the Gospel of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They oppose our love to Christ to our own duties, that is, they oppose our love to Christ to the most proper and natural expression of our love to him: herein Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> places the <hi>chastity of our affections to Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 165.</note> (which you know is a great marriage duty) <hi>in not taking any thing (as our own righteousness) into our affections and esteem for those ends and purposes, for which we have received Christ:</hi> and God forbid, that any Christian should; for our own righteousness and duties cannot be our Mediators and Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:100660:219"/>
cannot expiate for our past sins, nor merit Heaven for us, which Christ hath done: what then is the difference? why it is only this, that the Dr. places the Righteousness of Christ in the room of our righteousness, to be not only the foundation, but the condition of the Covenant of Grace, and then makes it an expression of our chast affections to Christ, quite to thrust out our own righteousness, and to allow it no place in our Religion: he first makes Christ all to us, (more than ever Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make himself) and leaves no room for any thing else, and then warns us upon our vow of Chastity not to take any thing into Christs place; whereas, as he has ordered the matter, we must take our own righteousness into Christs place, or else cast it quite away, for there is no other place left for it: what he alledges for this, I have sufficiently considered already, and shall not now repeat it; but is it not very strange, that when our Saviour hath made our obedience the great and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal expression of our love to him, these men should make such a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition between our love to Christ, and our obedience? should put such jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:100660:220"/>
into peoples heads, what great danger there is of their own duties and righteousness, lest they should prove like <hi>foolish lovers, who when they are to</hi>

                     <hi>wooe for the Lady, fall in love with the Handmaid, that is only to lead them to her: So men fall in love with, and dote upon their own duties, and rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the naked performance of them</hi> (that is, with doing good) <hi>which are only Hand-maids to lead the Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> is not this the ready way to perswade people, that our love to Christ consists in something more refined and spiritual than obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? which will quickly teach them to love Christ without obeying him, and not run the hazard of doting and resting on duties. No man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands the Gospel of Christ, can think that his own righteousness and obedience can merit Heaven; when we have done the best we can, we must acknowledge our selves to be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Servants, who have done but our duty; and must ascribe the praise and glory of all to the Grace of God in and through our Lord Jesus Christ, who pardons our past sins, and our present infirmities, and bestows such great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:100660:220"/>
on us, as we could never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; and if this will not preserve us from doting and resting on duties, there is no other remedy, but to let them quite alone, since it is so dangerous to meddle with them: and yet if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Mr. <hi>Shephard,</hi> this will not secure us; for <hi>it is one thing to trust to be saved by duties, another thing to rest in duties;</hi>

                     <hi>a man trusts unto them, when he is of this opinion, that only good duties can save him; a man rests in duties, when he is of this opinion, that only Christ can save him, but in his practice he goes about to save himself:</hi> that is, does all the good he can, with as much vigour and earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estness as if we were to merit Heaven by it, and then thinks to make amends for this ungodly resting in duties by acknowledging, <hi>when he hath done all, that he is an unprofitable servant.</hi> But the mystery of this will appear more in what follows.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see what the object of the Saints love is, <hi>the very person of Christ, in opposition to his benefits, in opposition to self-love, in opposition to duties:</hi> let us now inquire, Secondly, How they express their love to the person of Christ, and that consists in preferring

Sect. 2.</note> showed you, what these men mean by the person and personal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of Christ, that whatever is spoken of Christ, whether in respect of his Gospel and Revelations, or his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:100660:221"/>
and Sacrifice, or his mediation and intercession for us, these men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert into personal Graces, his personal fulness, and righteousness, and wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we must immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from the person of Christ; and this is the <hi>person</hi> of Christ, which these men so much admire, and prize, and value, above all other things in the World, a Person in whom there is all fulness, righteousness, life, power, beauty, and every thing that a Sinner wants; this is the person, whom they prefer before all legal righteousness, spiritual excellencies, duties, obedience, before the love of God himself, which is by these men accounted no better than a legal righteousness; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all which is, that they prefer the person of Christ, which hath such a perfect righteousness for them, and will save them without requiring any legal conditions of them, infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Religion and Gospel of Christ, before obedience to his commands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the love and fear of God: so that the foundation of their love to Christ is a fond imagination, that he will save them by his righteousness without any righteousness and holiness of their own;
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:100660:222"/>
this makes them so fond of the person of Christ, to call him their <hi>joy, and their Crown, their life, food, health, strength, righteousness,</hi> because they look upon him as a refuge and Sanctuary for the wicked and ungodly, where the <hi>greatest, the oldest, the stubbornest trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor</hi> may shelter himself from the wrath of God; and I have some reason to think, that Christ will not much prize and value such devoto's as these, nor their obsequious flatteries or praise.</p>
                  <p>And yet herein the devotion of these men consists, in admiring, prizing, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing, the person of Christ: this is that * <hi>Evangelical Righteousness, we must</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Pag. 178.</note> 
                     <hi>the great end of duties to carry us to the Lord Iesus Christ the only Saviour: hear a Sermon to carry thee to Iesus Christ: fast and pray, and get a full tide of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:100660:222"/>
                     <hi>in them to carry thee to the Lord Iesus Christ, that is, to get more love of him, more acquaintance with him, more Union with him: so sorrow for thy sins, that thou maist be more fitted for Christ, that thou maist prize Christ the more: use thy duties as</hi> Noahs <hi>Dove did her Wings, to carry thee to the Ark of the Lord Iesus Christ:—Or as it is with a poor man, that is to go over a great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a treasure on the other side, though he cannot fetch the Boat, he calls for it, and though there be no treasure in the Boat, yet he useth the Boat to carry him over to the treasure: so Christ is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thou on Earth, he doth not come to thee, and thou canst not go to him, now call for a Boat: though there is no grace, no good, no salvation, in a pithless duty, yet use it to carry thee over to the treasure, the Lord Iesus Christ. When thou comest to hear, say, Have over Lord by this Sermon, when thou comest to pray, say, Have over Lord by this Prayer to a Saviour, &amp;c.</hi> So that it seems, the whole business of our love to Christ, and Evangelical Righteousness, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in some flights of fancy and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in admiring and valuing the person of Jesus Christ, in getting an
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:100660:223"/>
acquaintance with him, and Union to him; and the business of all Religion is <hi>to have over to Christ,</hi> that we may love and prize his person and personal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness above all things in the World: It is not so much the business of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to acquaint us with the nature and attributes, works and providences of God, and to instruct us in our duty to him, and to encourage us to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it by all the motives and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Gospel, as <hi>to have over to Christ,</hi> to acquaint us with his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Righteousness, and alsuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to save us without such a legal Righteousness of our own: the design of Prayer is not so much to affect our Souls with a sense of the divine Majesty and greatness, to worship and adore the great Creator of the World, and to express our trust and affiance in him; as <hi>to have over to Christ,</hi> to fetch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and life, and health, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness from him: that sorrow for sin is not so much to imbitter sin to us, and to confirm and strengthen our resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against it, as to teach us to prize and value the person of Christ more who is our Righteousness: in a word, the nature and design of Religion is
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:100660:223"/>
now changed from being the homage and worship of God, the certain means of pleasing him, and transforming us into his nature and likeness, which is the natural end of Religion, into a <hi>Cock-Boat,</hi> or <hi>Skuller,</hi> to <hi>wast us over</hi> to Christ.</p>
                  <p>Here we see the true reason, why these men do so much despise morality in comparison with those Gospel du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of hearing Sermons, and Prayer, and Confession, and Humiliation, and Fasting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Because as they handle the matter, the practice of moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues cannot <hi>have us over to Christ,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apply the Righteousness and fulness of Christ to us, nor ravish our fancies with glorious images and Idaeas of his person; and since all the duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are such <hi>pithless</hi> things, <hi>which have no grace, no good, no salvation</hi> in them, but as they <hi>have us over to Christ, poor morality</hi> must needs be a worthless thing.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have finisht my designed task, and upon a review of it, it makes me amazed to think, how strangely these men have transformed the Religion of our Saviour, and disfigur'd the Gospel of Christ; how they have undermined
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:100660:224"/>
the fundamental design of the Gospel, which is to make men good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and like to God: how they have misrepresented the ends of Christ come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World, and abused his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation and Sacrifice, and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Intercession to the Patronage of Vice and Wickedness; how they have laid snares to betray some men to a licentious life, and to entangle others in endless troubles and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mind: how under a pretence of advancing the person of Christ, they have in effect through ignorance, and mistake, and want of consideration (for I am not willing to suspect any worse cause) banisht his Religion out of the World: I have faithfully and impartially stated the case, examined their proofs from Scripture and reason, and the result of all is no more but this, that the only way to please God and to save our Souls, is to obey the Precepts of the Gospel, trusting in the mediation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who having <hi>perfected</hi> the work of our redemption, <hi>is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi>
