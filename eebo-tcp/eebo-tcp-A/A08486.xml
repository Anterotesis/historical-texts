            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And often tymes I haue ſeene, when a long ſeaſon he would dyet hym ſelf with a ſmall peece of breade and one hearyng.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe wherefore he addicted him ſelfe to this Monaſticall order of<note place="margin">What mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued him to Monkery.</note> life: was becauſe he beleued the ſame to be moſt conformable to ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to the vnderſtanding of Gods doctrine, as he hath related, &amp; many hath knowen. Often tymes he was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with great and trembling feares, when he attentiuely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the wrath of God, &amp; the maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous examples of his puniſhmentes, that he was in a maner reft of hys wyttes. And I haue marked at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tyme, that beyng ſore abaſhed in one diſputacion of thys doctrine, becauſe he gaue attentiue eare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto:
<pb facs="tcp:21462:9"/>
he was ſode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly forced to remoue into a nygh Chamber, &amp; ther reſting on his bed, he medled &amp; reported ofte<note place="margin">His abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes at the wrath of God.</note> this ſentence: God hath ſhut vp al vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der our vnbelief, to the end he might extende mercye to all. Theſe abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes encreaſed after, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt aſperouſly he felt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he loſt hys deare friende &amp; companion, who was ſtayne, I know not by what miſhap.</p>
                  <p>Then penurye pricked hym not to this Monkerye, but the affection he had to learne to ſerue God. Albeit he learned ther the doctrine vſed in ſcho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les, he red the Doctors of ſentences, and in publick diſputacions, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed the difficulties, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not vnfold, whereat many muſed: Neuertheles, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he ſought not in this kinde of lyfe to wyn brute according to the vertu of his wit, but<note place="margin">Hys ſtudie in the holy ſcripture.</note> to noriſh him in the feare of God: he vſed theſe ſtudies, as one that eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to be principall of that he ſearched and eaſelye conceyued thoſe ſcholaſtical Methodes. In the meane ſeaſon he redde with great affection the fountaines of heauenly doctrine, that is, the Prophetes and Apoſtles,
<pb facs="tcp:21462:10"/>
therby to frame hys lyfe and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacion to the wyll of God, and ſo be continued in the feare &amp; faith of God, as by manye thynges it was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Yea, howe muche the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly he coueted thys exerciſe, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemplacion, ſo muche the more he was troubled wyth his dolour and abaſhment.</p>

And further he ſayd, that thys interpretacion was confyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the teſtimonies of Saynt Ber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nard,

&amp; he had ſhewed hym the place<note place="margin">An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſ.

                  <p>Luther ſayd he was not onely ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thened by theſe wordes: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he was alſo inſtructed of the ful meaning of ſaint Paule, who repeateth ſo many times this ſentence: We are iuſtified by fayth.

And reading by little and lyttle, with conferring the ſayinges and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Prophetes and Apoſtles, &amp; continual inuocacion of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citacion of fayth by force of prayers, he perceiued that doctrine more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently.</p>
                  <p>Then he began to reade S. Auſtens

They prayed him at the leaſt he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his writyng to the iudgement of the next general Councel.

                     <p>Neyther I deny that ſometymes ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hement mocions offend, ther is none in thys infirmity of Nature, voide of ſpot.

Certaynly I muſt confeſſe that theſe be good and praiſe worthy, and as S.

                     <p>We knowe that Luther hath bene ſuch, for conſtantly he hath mayntai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſinceritye of the Goſpel, and retayned an integrity of conſcience.

His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners wer good, his wordes ſwete and pleaſaunt. Finally, althinges (as S.

At that time he announced the grace of the Goſpell, in ſorte, that he ſayd lyttle of the abuſes of Rome, or nothing at al. For he thought it was neceſſarye that truth fyrſte knowen, ſhould worke in the hartes of hys au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, ſo that when they had wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanted the true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntaundements, they myght diſcerne the falſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaunt.

Truth it is in this poynt I cannot cleare thys yong man of all ſuſpicion of ſynne, although with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred deſire to ſerue God, he circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly tooke hede by euyl example to abaſe the authority of heauenly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.

                  <p>And all be it hee was aſſured hee ſhoulde not haue lyke ſalarye as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet he ſayde, yf they woulde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt hym that function, he woulde endeuour to dyſcharge the ſame. But he woulde not requyre it at the tyme of eſertion, as many are accuſtomed, to procure the voyce and ſuffrage of other. I was ſuborned, I truly Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye, to geue Zuinglius my voyce, whych I gaue, aud receyued graunt for hym. Who was immediatly ſent

for, &amp; admitted wyth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> incredible ioy of al good perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. A while after being in the Chapiter of the Chanons, he proponed vnto them, what he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to teach the people, to wit, the hiſtory of our Sauiour Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to S.

Further, he proteſted he wold not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſame by humayn ſence, bin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng himſelfe by othe to any priuate Interpreter, but by conference &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious collection of ſcripture, &amp; by the intelligence of the holy ghoſt, the whych he hoped to obtaine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> humble prayer made vnto God. This his reſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lution made ſome heauy &amp; ſorowful, &amp; ſome ioyful, euen as the voyces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wer not al alike to admit Zuing lius. He began to execute his promis at the Natiuity of our Lord. 1519. and ſynce purſued the ſame. Duryng hys<note place="margin">Martine Luther.</note> continue in this, Luthers name bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to grow in credit, &amp; many bought and red his bokes.

<pb facs="tcp:21462:86"/>
The reaſon that moued Zuinglius to do thys, was becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> people, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them &amp; vnderſtanding, Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>us emploied no time in ſtudi of them, myght conſider in both a conformity and a grement of teachyng &amp; opinion drawen out of the holye ſcriptures, &amp; be the more enflamed to ground vpon and addict them ſelues to the truthe. Thys godly deuiſe had profitable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſe a whyle after. Truth it is, the or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der he obſerued in preaching made much alſo, wherby the ſymple as wel as the learned and ingenious might profit. For he explaned the ſcripture ſo plainlye, and with ſuch dexteritye, that he was lothe any ſhoulde depart from hys ſermons, vnles they were edefied &amp; enriched wyth godlye lore. And as he manifeſtly taught y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> truth, and that with great diligence, ſo was he vehement, &amp; ſharpe in reprouyng vice, as much as euer was any man. Aboue al the reſt, he inueyed agaynſt the Penſionaries, the oppreſſors of the poore, &amp; the diſſolute, ydle, &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lyuers. He vſed ſuch a maieſty in rebukyng, as neuer none the lyke before, when he thundred w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> terrible

wordes agaynſt the Penſions &amp; diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute lyuing, becauſe he woulde not ſeeme to daſhe and aſtonyſhe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, or ſuche of the Commonty, as thronged among the peruers, &amp; repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bate in hearyng his ſermons, he euer more added thys: That thys my vehe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment rebuke may not agreue &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee, O vertuous man, vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d I touch thee not, nor in thys matter I haue to do with thee. Sometime he digreſſed from hys theame, when matters interceadyng enforced hym too ſurceaſe hys begunne purpoſe. But now the bleſſed &amp; happy tyme ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pired, the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſt and beſt part of the people embraced truth, he diſcourſed in hys ſermons againſt thynges leſſe tollerable in the Church, he condemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned the priuate gaynes of Prieſtes, &amp; ſuche as by priuate power abuſed the church, whych moued the prieſtes and laity to omit no time of conſultacion, by what wyle, or policies they myght entrap hym.

Beleue me Agathy, I was preſent at nyne ſeueral times, and hearde theyr friendly conference and vehement diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>putacions, it ſhall be ſuperſtuous to enlarge any further hereof.

of hys Countrye, the vertue of the Aunceltors, &amp; the glory of Chriſt, what ſo euer his enemies ceblaterate the which I proteſt in trouth before God. He was twyſe in the warres of the confederates, which bare y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name of a Monaſterye called the Chappell.

I haue heard him ſay he perceiued more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and peruers counſel ther, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before he red in vokes, or had lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned by experience. In the ſecond war he was elected Paſtor of the armye, where he went vnwyllyngly, foreſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peryl that was iminent. The condicion of the warre myſliked hym marueilouſly, and the rather for that he ſawe the enemyes victailes cut of, vnderſtanding well what myſchiefe hunger would brede &amp; compel. Albeit to ſpeake truly, after thoſe of Zurick had enterpryſed the ſame (wherunto certayne whom we knowe prycked them of a good zeale, hopynge in the

                  <p>Fourtene dayes before the armye was encamped, I hearde hym twyſe ſay in pulpit wher he preached, in the midſt of this broil: I know wel what thys meaneth, all thys is to procure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iny death. He declared ſecretly to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of his friendes, that the blaſing ſtarre which appeared many wekes, and whiche we ſuppoſed to portende Ecolampadius deceaſe: ſignified hys fatal fall. The Soldiours of Zuricke ruſhed forth in great diſorder. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſorowfully lament, when I cal to mynde that doleful tyme. They marched not lyke men of warre in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen rankes, but lyke a ſorte of ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, ſome ſtraglyng abroade, ſome runnyng before and behynde the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeygne, deſtitute of conduct counſell, and pollecye, and accorded not one wyth an other.</p>

Then as thys lyttle nomber approched to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre a huge army and in perfect order, Zuinglius folowed mounted on horſ backe, accordyng to the maner of the Country. I cannot expreſſe the dolor and ſorrowe I ſuſteyned, when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him, truly I was aſtoniſhed ther with. We mourned all that day, and made our humble prayer vnto God. But he hadde decreed an other thyng for vs, and not agaynſt vs, as I holily expounded the ſame. For by thys we haue learned to be more circumſpect, and to take better hede, reuerencyng more the Goſpel, and fearyng God al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo. And the enemyes that reſiſted the Goſpel, are now diſcloſed, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to vs. About the euenyng of the day, we were aduertiſed that the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles had ioyned very hotely, &amp; that we had loſt Zuinglius.

                  <p>After thys ouerthrow, the enemies hauyug good leyſure (for our Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours were retired into place of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde) ſought for the body of Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius. But who teld them he was in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> battayle and ſlayne? The body beyng founde, was condempned, and after ſentence geuen, diſmembred &amp; burnt to aſhes.
