            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am not concerned to enquire why other Persons have
given such accounts as they have, of the <hi>main Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
laid down in <hi>the Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. of the <hi>Design</hi> that Author had in
publishing his <hi>Treatise,</hi> and of the <hi>Reason</hi> why he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the <hi>Method</hi> he hath taken to clear and prove the
great Point treated of there. It may suffice to declare why
I apprehend that his <hi>Proposition,</hi> his <hi>Design,</hi> and the
<hi>Reason of his Method</hi> are very different from what they
have represented them; which in short is, <hi>because I
cannot help it.</hi> The Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. being perfect Master of his own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
hath expressed them in such perspicuous and proper
Terms, I must offer Violence to my own Understanding
and Reason, to put that Construction on them, which
some have assigned them.</p>
            <p>The worthy Author of <hi>the Animadversions,</hi> &amp;c. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
very particularly related what he took to be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
my setting down all along as I read his Account,
what I conceived was the Design, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the aforesaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
and my making some Observations on what he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb facs="tcp:57787:3"/>
in answer to those Passages he quoted out of <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. which are now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
to prompt others to peruse attentively that <hi>excellent
Treatise,</hi> and to make themselves Masters of the Truths
there delivered; and because I am perswaded that neither
the <hi>Doctrines delivered in the New Testament,</hi> nor
<hi>Christians,</hi> can have their full Right done them, till Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
do understand and entertain the great Point insisted on
in <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. and do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
themselves under the Influence and Conduct of it. It
is a Notion, that tends not so much to gratify some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's
Ambition, and serve their secular Interest, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may; But it is more adapted to the Advantage of
pure and undefiled Religion, and will contribute more to
Christians Growth in Scripture Knowledge, and all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of living, and to their rational Comfort and good
Assurance, than any other Notion I am acquainted with.</p>
            <p>One thing which hath occasioned many to entertain a
<hi>Prejudice</hi> against <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi>
&amp;c. I conceive is a wrong Notion they have imbibed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those Composures we call <hi>Creeds, viz.</hi> Their
fancying that all the Articles contained in all, or some of
the Creeds, are absolutely necessary to be explicitely believed
to make Men Christians. Concerning which, I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
            <p>1. That not one of the Authors we have, who wr<gap reason="illegible: folded" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
of a Creed in their Days. So that we cannot have a<gap reason="illegible: folded" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
certainty that there was any such thing, during the Fir<gap reason="illegible: folded" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
Hundred Years after Christ, though we are very sure the<gap reason="illegible: folded" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
were Christians during that space.</p>
            <p>2. Creeds were not originally designed to relate wha<gap reason="illegible: folded" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Articles were absolutely necessary to be explicitely believe<gap reason="illegible: folded" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to make Men Christians (though some did afterward<gap reason="illegible: folded" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
turn them to that purpose) but to direct the Clergy, an<gap reason="illegible: folded" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
those who were to instruct Christians in the Matters of Re<gap reason="illegible: folded" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ligion,
<pb facs="tcp:57787:3"/>
what Heads, Points, or Articles and Doctrines
of Faith they were to take particular Care to discourse of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and insist on in order to their building up Believers in
their most Holy Faith. Of this very good Evidence might
be produced from Antiquity, if there were occasion.</p>
            <p>3. We have no certainty concerning the precise Number
of the Articles which did make up the First Creeds. We
are certain that some of the Articles that now constitute
the oldest Creeds we have any Knowledge of, were not at
first in them, but were afterwards added on particular
occasions.</p>
            <p>4. A Doctrine's being placed in a Creed, is so far from
making the explicite Belief of it, absolutely necessary to
make Men Christians, that it doth not make it an Object
of Christian Faith. No Doctrine is an Object of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, but what Iesus Christ or his Apostles have
taught. And a Christian's Faith must be grounded on E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that he or his Apostles have taught it. Now
the placing of a Doctrine in a Creed, doth not make
it a Doctrine that Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have taught, nor doth
it sufficiently evidence that they have taught it. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
as such, is not to believe any Doctrine because it is
in a Creed; though when he is convinced that Christ, or
his Apostles have taught such or such a Doctrine, which
is placed in a Creed, he is to believe it. He that should
say that Faction first occasioned Men's composing of Creeds,
and that the Abuse of Creeds hath contributed no small
Assistance to the maintaining and keeping up of Factions,
would not be wholly disbelieved. Creeds are of great
use, if they be used aright. We may say of a Creed as
the Apostle doth of the Law, <hi>1 Tim. 1. 8. We know
that it is good, if a Man use it lawfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hear that some who (having a Mind to talk of what
they do not understand) apply themselves to rail against
<hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. in that
<hi>Phrase,</hi> with which the worst of Men made such a Noise
<pb facs="tcp:57787:4"/>
under the <hi>late Reigns,</hi> affirming confidently upon their
own Word, that it is contrary to <hi>the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
If these People are capable of thinking, would
they exercise that Faculty to any good purpose, they might
easily perceive that when Iesus Christ and his Apostles
have determined a point, it is the most scandalous and
wicked Aspersion that can be devised, to pretend to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<hi>the Church of England</hi> in opposition to them. Had
these People that respect for, and would they pay to <hi>the
Church of England</hi> that Deference which is due to her,
they would not prostitute her venerable Name at every
turn, in Imitation of those bad Persons who neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in our Blessed Saviour, nor in the Living God,
do constantly prophane their Sacred Names, when ever
they have a mind to give vent to some unreasonable
Passion.</p>
            <p>There is one thing which should particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. to
good Christians, and for which they can hardly set too
great a value on it, viz. That it fully resolves some Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
in our Saviour's Conduct (which I think) were
never throughly cleared to the World, till it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</p>
            <p>Some time after the following <hi>Observations</hi> were sent
to the Press, I met with some Papers writ by Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
against the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. and against my self; but to pass
them over without saying any thing of them, is the
greatest Civility that can be expressed to that Writer,

               <head>Observations on the Preface.</head>
               <p>IT cannot be denied but that a wrong Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
may be put upon a very good and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Book: And that what it discourses of may
be represented quite contrary to what the
Author designed, and hath delivered in most intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
apposite, and plain Expressions. Now if a
Person who pretending to write against a Book, he
does not rightly understand, or mis-represents, doth
propose any thing that is pertenent in opposition to
that Book, it is very rational to suppose his doing so
is rather to be attributed to <hi>Chance,</hi> than to the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness</hi>
of his <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and his certain <hi>Intention.</hi>
For it is hardly to be conceived that a Rational Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will deliberately and advisedly write any thing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57787:5"/>
but what he conceives hath a clear Connection
with what he directly and immediately proposeth
to be the Subject of his Discourse. And though
at some distance he aims at the Book he talks of,
yet he mainly designs to confirm the Propositions
he lays down (as he conceives) directly contrary to
those delivered in that Book. But if the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on both sides are in Truth very well consistent,
though he doth not apprehend so, he can hardly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any Considerations to weaken the Force, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Truth of the Propositions advanced by
the Author he professeth to oppose, but those very
Considerations will as certainly wound his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
and reflect as unluckily on them as they can
on the other: which it will not be allowed to suppose
a wise and prudent Writer could design. Whilst he
mistakes the Author he in Words opposeth, let him
confirm and establish his own Assertions ever so
strongly, he does not at all distress what that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath indeed Published. One Man affirms,
that <hi>all the Doctrines which are absolutely necessary to be
believed to make Men Christians, or to Salvation, are
laid down in the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
professeth to oppose this, and therefore lays
down, and elaborately endeavours to prove this
Proposition, <hi>That the Epistles are part of the Rule of
Saving Faith.</hi> Now both these Propositions are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true, and consistent; and whatever Arguments
can be produced to prove the latter, comport very
well with the Truth of the former, and cannot at
all invalidate, but may very much confirm it. But
if he who undertakes to prove the latter, do let fall
Passages which reflect on the former Proposition,
those Passages have really the same ill Aspect with
relation to his own Proposition, they have to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The whole amounts to no more, than if one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57787:5"/>
should declare that all that is absolutely necessary to
be believed to make a Man a Christian, or to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
is delivered in the Epistles. And another
out of a sort of Zeal for the Gospels and the Acts
should professedly oppose that Proposition, and
publish a Book to prove that the Gospels and Acts
are part of the Rule of Saving Faith. But when the
Question is this, seeing the Doctrines absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to make Men Christians, are
laid down both in the Gospels and Acts, and in the
Epistles, <hi>In what parts of the New Testament may it
be best discerned which be the Doctrines that are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be believed to make Men Christians?</hi>
Then certain Reasons may be assigned why they
may be better discerned by consulting the Gospels
and Acts, than the Epistles.</p>
               <p>Peoples misrepresenting a good Book may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from various Originals, as Wilfulness, Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertence,
Weakness, Prepossession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not
suspect that the Author of the <hi>Animadversions</hi> (lately
Printed at <hi>Oxford) on the Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
as delivered in the Scriputers,</hi> hath misrepresented
that excellent Treatise, through an Indulgence to
any thing for which he may be justly blamed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he writes for the most part with so much
Temper, and hath made a Profession in the Close
of his Preface so every way becoming a worthy
and good Christian. But if I understand the true
Meaning of the Author of the <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. as expressed in that Treatise, it is
mightily misrepresented in those <hi>Animadversions,</hi> how
innocent and harmless soever the Author may be in
what he has done.</p>
               <p>That I may do both these Authors all the Right I
am able, I will observe all along, wherein they do
agree, and give as true, impartial, and distinct an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57787:6"/>
Account of the Sense of the <hi>Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
as I can, in those Points treated of, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the First and Third Parts of these Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions;
and take some notice of what this Author
hath offered, against what he hath alledged out of
the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. And that I
may proceed the more orderly, I will begin my
Observations where the Author of the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
begins his; <hi>viz.</hi> P. 1. of his <hi>Preface:</hi> Where
he declares his Agreement with the Author of the
<hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. That <hi>the most Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Means of silencing all Religious Controversies, is
to take the Scriptures for the only Rule of Faith.</hi> This
I apprehend is a true Account of the Judgment
of the Author of the Reasonableness of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
concerning this Matter: And I conceive he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with the Author of the Animadversions, in
the main of that Reason which he hath annexed to
that Proposition. Though to express what I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
a more clear and full Account of the Sense
of the Author of the Reasonableness of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will take the Liberty to word it in some
Places, otherwise than this Author hath done, and
to add one Passage or Clause he hath not inserted.
<q>For there might be some probable Grounds to
hope for a happy Conclusion of all Disputes in
Religion, if all Parties would joyn issue in this, that
no Christian ought to be required to believe any
thing but what is injoyned by the clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Declarations of Scripture, nor any thing so
injoyned, till it be made appear to him, that it is
so injoyned; and that no Christian may reject, or
with-hold his assent from any Article which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to him to be plainly delivered in the Holy
Scriptures.</q> The Clause I shall add is this, That
nothing ought to be required to be believed as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57787:6"/>
necessary to make Men Christians, but
what is injoyned by the clear and express Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Scripture to be believed for that purpose.
And I add this Clause for this Reason amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
because whoever imposeth on People certain
Doctrines (though the Doctrines are really Christ's
Doctrines) as absolutely necessary to be believed to
make Men Christians, which Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
have not declared to be absolutely necessary to
be believed to make Men Christians, doth as really
advance a <hi>Foreign Authority,</hi> and set it up equally
with Christ's, as he doth who imposeth any thing
as a necessary part of the Christian Religion, which
Christ and his Apostles never made a part of it.
For notwithstanding the Doctrines which are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to be absolutely necessary to be believed to
make men Christians, be Doctrines which Christ
hath taught; yet if he hath not taught that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of them is absolutely necessary to make Men
Christians, but only requires them to be believed
for other Purposes, the requiring the Belief of them
as absolutely necessary to make Men Christians,
must be built upon a Foundation and Authority di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from Christ's and his Apostles; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at best can be but Humane Authority. Till
this Clause is agreed to, the former Clauses in the
Reason, will not avail much, to put a happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
to Religious Controversies. Besides, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
understand why the assumed Authority of the
several Parties may not be yielded to, for the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of particular Controversies in Religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as well as for the determining and assigning
what Points are to be be believed in order to any
Peoples being Christians. I leave it to others to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how much, Men's assuming Authority to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
certain of Christ's Doctrines, without his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57787:7"/>
as absolutely necessary to be believed, to make
Men Christians, hath contributed to their Stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the like Authority further, even to make some
things Parts of the Christian Religion, which Christ
and his Apostles have not authorized, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famously
done in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and perhaps
in some degree, in most of the Parties truly termed
Protestant. It may be easy to prove to those who
are Christians, that they are to believe such or such
Doctrines, by shewing them plainly that Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
whom they have received to be their Lord,
hath taught them. But when we require those who
are not Christians to believe them, as absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make them Christians, we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to prove to them, the Truth of those Doctrines
by some other Medium than Christ's Authority. For
it cannot rationally be expected that People who
do not believe Jesus to be the Messiah, or the Christ,
will assent to, believe, and receive Doctrines, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because he, they do not believe to be the Christ,
hath taught them. And when they are brought to
believe that Jesus is the Messiah, so as to take him for
their Lord and King, if that do not constitute them
Christians, it will not suffice to make them Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
to prove to them that Christ hath taught such
or such Doctrines, which therefore they must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but it must be proved to them, that that same
Jesus hath taught that these same Doctrines are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be believed to make them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
unless their believing this Branch upon some
other Authority will serve the turn: And if that will
do the Business, why may they not be required to
believe that Jesus is the Messiah upon the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
and consequently all the other Doctrines
the said Authority shall be pleased to avouch? The
Difference is not much in rational Discourse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57787:7"/>
a Person believes a certain Doctrine to be
Christ's, which he never taught, upon the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of such a Person, or Church; or whether he
believes a Doctrine Christ hath certainly taught,
to be absolutely necessary to a certain Purpose,
which Christ never declared to be absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to that purpose, upon the same Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
or Authority. For the Ground, Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Reason of the Belief in both Cases is
the very same, and is an Authority distinct from
Christ's.</p>
               <p>In the next place, the Author of the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
relates, what he thought was the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Author of the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in these Words: <q>The main Design
which the Author of the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> seems to have had, is, to lay down
such a Scheme of Faith only, as he finds delivered
in Scripture, and not to rest satisfied with those
Collections of Articles, which are to be met with in
the common Systems, without any sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from Scripture.</q>I will keep as near as I can
to this Author's Words, in relating what I conceive
to be the Truth touching this Matter. The main
Design of the Author of the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> seems to have had, as to one main
part of his Book, was to lay down such a Scheme
of those matters of Faith only, that are absolutely
necessary to be believed to make a Man a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
as he found delivered in the Scripture; but
not to lay down such a Scheme of those Matters of
Faith, as he found in Scripture, which any Man
after he is a Christian, may be necessarily obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to Believe. The Reason why the Author
of the Reasonableness did not rest satisfied with
those Collections of Articles which are to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57787:8"/>
met with in the common Systems doth not appear
to be, because all or most, or perhaps any of the
Articles in some of those Systems were without any
sufficient Warrant from Scripture: Though it may
be, the Composers of those Systems might assert
something concerning several of those Articles, for
which there might not be any sufficient Warrant
from Scripture. There might be sufficient Warrant
from Scripture for the Articles themselves; and not
the like Warrant for every thing those Authors
might deliver concerning them. But the Reasons
why he was not satisfied with those Collections seem
to me to be, 1. Because those Collections did not
agree; some of them consisting of more, some of
fewer Articles, and those which had the greatest
number, left out some of the Articles which were
insisted on, or inserted in another. 2. Because it
was pretended by the Composers of those Systems,
of their Followers, or both, that all the Articles col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
into those Systems were necessarily to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make Men Christians. Now according
to that Notion, what certainly could there be, who
were Christians, or to be admitted and owned as
such? whilst there was so great a Disagreement
concerning the Articles which were absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to make Men Christians?
For those who were Christians according to the
Composers and followers of one System, were not
Christians according to the Followers of another,
because they wanted something in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
absolutely necessary to make them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
The Design of those who write Systems of
Christian Divinity (I apprehend) should be to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
those Articles which are mainly insisted on in
the New Testament, and to which most or all that is
delivered in those Sacred Writings may be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57787:8"/>
and conveniently reduced, together with an
account of the principal things there taught, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those Articles. And if the Composers of
Systems did carefully distinguish the Articles those
Sacred Writings teach, are absolutely necessary to
be believed to make men Christians, from those
which are of great Moment to be known and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by them who are already Christians, I am of
Opinion, the Author of the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
would not think their doing so, any Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
to their Systems, and that he would not be
dissatisfied with any of those Articles of which
their Systems should consist, nor with any thing
they should say concerning those Articles, which
had sufficient warrant from Scripture.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And to this end (saith the Author of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversions)
he has run through the Gospels and
Acts to discover upon what Terms our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
who first founded, and his Apostles, who
afterwards built up Christianity, admitted Men
into that Religion.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Author of the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
finding so great a Disagreement amongst the
Writers of Systems, concerning the Articles which
must necessarily be believed to make Men Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
did betake himself <hi>to the sole reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
to discover upon what Terms our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and his Apostles did admit Men for Disciples
or Christians, or did own them to be Christians:
And upon his having made an <hi>attentive and unbiassed
Search</hi> throughout the Scriptures, upon what Terms
they admitted Men into the Christian Religion;
he found that what those Terms were, were best
to be discerned in the Gospels and Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles;
and for that Reason, confined himself in his
giving an account of those Terms, to the frequent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57787:9"/>
and exact Relations which are given of them in those
parts of the New Testament.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And (saith the Author of the Animadversions)
having declared at large all that he can find requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by them to make a Man a Christian, which
he tells us was only the believing Jesus to be the
Messiah; he concludes, that nothing ought to be
made necessary to be believed now, which was
not so then; nor any Articles imposed upon us,
which were not injoyned in order to Salvation,
in those parts of Scripture which he has consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
which alone, according to him, declare the
Conditions upon which Men are denominated Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
or Christians.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Author of the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
having shewn at large, that Jesus Christ and
his Apostles did not require any thing to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as absolutely necessary to make a Man who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in the only True and Living God, a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
but only this, that Jesus was the Messiah: He
concluded that nothing ought now to be imposed
on Men, as absolutely necessary to be believed to
make Men Christians, which is not injoyned as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to be believed in order to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the Gospels and Acts, in which parts of
Scripture, the Conditions upon which Men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated
Believers or Christians, are best to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
But I do not remember that he doth any
where say, that the Gospels and Acts are the Parts
of Scripture, which alone declare the Conditions
upon which Men are denominated Believers or
Christians. He doth expresly declare, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
necessarily to be believed to make Men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
are to be found in the Epistles. <hi>Reasonab.
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 295.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57787:9"/>
                  <p>This way of examining our Faith by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(saith the Author of the Animadversions)
had been an unexceptionable method for fixing the
measure of it, if he had omitted no Articles which
are there made as necessary to be believed by all
Christians, as what is observed in his Treatise.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Method then observed by the Author
of the Reasonableness of Christianity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable
for the fixing the Measure of Faith,
so far as he was inquiring after it; <hi>viz.</hi> what Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
are absolutely necessary to be believed to make
a Man a Christian (not what Articles may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed by all, or any who are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Christians) provided he did not omit any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which the Scripture makes absolutely necessary
to be believed to make a Man a Christian. And if he
hath omitted any such Article, that may be a good
Exception against his <hi>Collection,</hi> but not against his
<hi>Method.</hi> But had he collected a certain Number of
Articles delivered in the Scripture, proper to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by them who are Christians, and then affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that every one who is, or ever shall be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
must necessarily, explicitely believe every one of
them, and no Christian must believe any more; I
think there would have been very just Ground to
have excepted against his Collection, how unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
soever his way of examining our Faith had
been; unless he could have proved that every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
shall have both Capacity to understand every
one of them, and Space enough to be convinced
that every one of them is delivered in Scripture. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more Articles may be necessary to be believed by
some Christians than may be necessary to be believed
by other Christians; because some may attain to the
Knowledge of more Articles, and that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in Scripture, than many other very good
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57787:10"/>
Christians can. The Author of the Reasonableness
of Christianity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appears to be a Person, whose
Understanding and Charity are of a different Size
from theirs, who are for Persons swallowing Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith, as some People do Pills, a precise
Number (because said to be taken out of such a Box,
or of such a Persons prescribing) to make their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
certain, without understanding either what
they are made of, or for what particular Reasons
they are to be administred.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>For that there are others required even to make
a Man a Christian in these parts of Sacred
Writ, from whence he hath extracted his Article
of Faith, is (saith the Author of the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions)
what I purpose to make appear in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Observations.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Prove from any part of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that there are other Articles distinct from
those the Author of the Reasonableness of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
doth insist on, which are taught by Christ
and his Apostles to be absolutely necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make a Man a Christians, you do your
business as effectually, as if you prove it from the
Gospels and Acts. But this Author intends to prove
more than this, not only that there are more Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
in the Gospels and Acts absolutely necessary
to be believed to make Men Christians, than the
Author of the Reasonableness of Christianity hath
set down in his Treatise; but that there are Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
in the Epistles, which are not in the Gospels
and the Acts; which yet are absolutely necessary
to be explicitely believed to make Men Christians;
as appears from these following Words:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>As also to shew that there are some distinct Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
from what are set down in the Gospels and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57787:10"/>
Acts, delivered in the Epistles, that are absolutely
necessary to be believed to Salvation.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here this Author undertakes to shew, not
that there are Articles in the Epistles distinct from
all which are set down in the Gospels and Acts,
which may be necessary to be believed to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for both these Authors agree as to that: But
that these distinct Articles are absolutely necessary
to be explicitely believed to make Men Christians,
or to Salvation. So that should a Person upon found
Conviction, heartily yield up himself without any
Reservation, unto Jesus Christ, as the Messiah;
and unfeignedly receive him for his Lord, to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
governed by him; year, should sincerely
follow his Conduct as long as he lives, and having
attained the Knowledge of all the Articles taught
in the Gospels and Acts, does firmly assent to, and
believe every one of them, and makes such use of
them as Christ requires, in short, though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
truly of his Sins, turns to the Lord heartily,
and cleaves unto him with purpose of Heart all his
Days, yet happening to die before he doth explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know and believe these distinct Articles delivered
in the Epistles, he is no Christian, nor can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be saved, notwithstanding his being ignorant
of them cannot justly be imputed to him as his
Fault. This is a Notion which must be very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved from Scripture, before I can submit to,
and embrace it. This Point, the Author of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversions
undertakes to prove. He tell us:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>In answer to that Assertion of our Author, that
it is not in the Epistles that we are to learn what
are the Fundamental Articles of Faith, with some
others of the like Nature.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57787:11"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The author of the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
doth not say the Fundamental Articles of
Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> those Articles which are absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to make Men Christians, are
not in the Epistles, but he saith they are there; yet
what they are may be best discerned in the Gospels
and Acts: <hi>First Vindication of the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>p.</hi> 14. This Point is so fully cleared, and strongly
discoursed in his <hi>Second Vindication, p.</hi> 132, 133, 134. the
Reason of Mankind I think can raise no colourable
Objection against it; I shall refer the Reader thither
for a thorough understanding of the Matter, and
perfect Satisfaction concerning it; unless what this
Author hath undertaken in his Animadversions can
be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are certain Articles in
the Epistles which are not in the Gospels and Acts,
which are absolutely necessary to be believed to
make Men Christian. If this can be proved, then
it will be plain, that it is in the Epistles that we must
necessarily look for some of those Articles, which
are necessarily to be believed to make Men Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
for then they are not all to be found in the
Gospels, and in the Acts, and it will be in vain to
look for them all there, where they are not all to be
found.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Which is the Reason (saith the Author of the
Animadversions) that I give the Title of a Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the Epistles to the former part of these
Papers.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The former Part of these Animadversions
being designed to answer the Reason why the Title,
<hi>A Vindication of the Epistles,</hi> is given to it, we are
not to look for Proofs of their Divine Authority,
that being acknowledged on both sides, or if we
find any thing of that Nature there, how useful so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the said Considerations may be, with Relation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57787:11"/>
to that Matter, it is all besides the present purpose,
which is to prove that the Epistles were writ for this
very purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> to acquaint People with other
Articles than what are set down in the Gospels and
Acts, which are absolutely necessary to be believed
to make Men Christians; or at least, that there are
such Doctrines delivered in the Epistles. If there
be any thing then in this First part of the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
which belongs not to one of these Points,
it is so far foreign to the present Debate.</p>
               <p>This Author seems to suggest in the Third Page
of his Preface, by placing my Name in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
that I have given such an Account of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
the Author of the Reasonableness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had
in publishing his Treatise, as is not consistent with
that Account the Author himself hath given of
the Design he had therein, in the Sixth Page of his
First Vindication, where he saith he <hi>chiefly designed
it for those who were not throughly and firmly Christians.</hi>
                  <q>Of which, saith this Author, I find no Intimation
in the Treatise it self.</q> But a Person may find it
in the Title, especially after the Author hath mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him in the same Place, that he is to learn from
the Title, for whom he chiefly intended it; and
hath in his Second Vindication manifested how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
the Title was to furnish the Reader with a true
and just Account of the Persons for whom his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
was chiefly designed. The Account I gave of
his Design, it's true, was different from that the
Author hath given of his Design in the Place quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but it is very consistent with his: For he gives
an account of the Persons for whom he chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
his Treatise: I gave an Account of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Point he designed to prove and clear in that
Treatise. But I do not remember that I any where
said, that <hi>That was his only Design,</hi> what way soever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57787:12"/>
this Author had to know that <hi>I believe that to be his
only Design,</hi> nor that I have declared that I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
his Treatise <hi>with very great Care and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi>
though this Author is pleased to lay those
Words to my Charge.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>This Author also observes, That I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that there is nothing more required to make
a Man a Christian, than the believing Jesus to be
the Messiah.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I acknowledge I have expressed my self to
this purpose, That nothing is required as absolutely
necessary to be believed to make a Man a Christian
but this, that Jesus is the Messiah; and that a due
believing that Jesus is the Messiah, is the Faith
which doth constitute or make a Man a Christian.
And the Reason why I expressed my Opinion in
that manner was, because Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> did suppose
the Belief of the True and Living God, and had
expresly excluded the Consideration of that Article
out of the Discourse; though whether he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to do so, with Relation to the Author of the
Reasonableness of Christianity, may be fully seen
in that Author's Second Vindication of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But had he (adds this Author) given himself a
little more leisure to consider into what Faith he
himself was baptized, and into what he bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
others, he must have acknowledged that the
explicite believing in Father and Holy Ghost, is
as much required of every one initiated into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
as believing Jesus to be the Messiah: For
the Faith in the Holy Trinity has always been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in order to Baptism.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Whether this Author, or I, have given
our selves most leisure to consider into what Faith
we were baptized, or others are to be baptized, I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57787:12"/>
cannot tell, but I suspect my Apprehensions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Baptism,</hi> are not in every respect the same
with his: which of us hath considered the Matter
with most exactness is not to be determined by me:
nor can the Reader make a just Decision of the
Point, whilst I reserve my own Thoughts to my
self; which I continue to do, that no Addition may
be made to the Points now in dispute. But though
I acknowledge the Faith in the Trinity, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
Belief of the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity
is as much required of every one who is <hi>initiated
into Christianity,</hi> when they understand that Jesus
Christ hath taught it, as the explicite Belief of any
other Doctrine they know he hath taught, is, or
can be; and that the Person who is to administer
Baptism to others, ought explicitely to believe the
Doctrine of the Holy Trinity; yet I am very far
from being certain that every one who is <hi>to be ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
into Christianity,</hi> must necessarily explicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity. I am not
yet convinced that Jesus Christ or his Apostles did
ever require the explicite Belief of the Doctrine of
the Holy Trinity, as absolutely necessary in every
Person who was to be Baptized. It may be my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that a Person cannot be a Christian, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
partaking of the gracious Influences of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son and Holy Ghost (wherein I may perhaps
differ from some worthy, learned and good Men,
as much as I may from this worthy Author about
the Point of Baptism). But I do not perceive any
Ground to conclude that a Person's pertaking of their
gracious Influences, doth necessarily depend on his
explicite knowing and believing all that Jesus Christ
hath revealed and taught, concerning the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:57787:13"/>
                  <p>Indeed (saith this Author) at the first, Men
might be denominated Christians upon the bare
believing Jesus to be the Messias; yet when there
was more revealed concerning him, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
a larger Faith required, they could no
more have continued Christians, if they had not
believed this also, than if they had still been alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Unbelievers.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Question here will be, whether Men
might at first be truly and justly denominated Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
upon the bare believing Jesus to be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah?
I think the bare believing Jesus to be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
was not at any time enough to denominate
Men truly Christians: but tht believing him to be
the Messiah, so as to take him for their Lord, King,
and Ruler, was at first absolutely necessary to make,
and so denominate them truly Christians. And such
a believing him to be the Messiah, I think, will
make Men Christians to the end of the World. But
to speak strictly and properly, it is the due believing
of Jesus to be the Messiah (which consists in Mens
believing him to be the Messiah, so as to take him
for their absolute Lord and King) which makes or
constitutes Men Christians. And it is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
of this Faith, that denominates them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
When more Articles of Faith were revealed,
and those who professed themselves to be Christians,
did know they were revealed, and it was known,
that they did understand that Jesus Christ had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
or taught them, they could not justly retain
the Denomination of Christians, if they did not
own and acknowledge their Belief of them; not
because the Belief of these Doctrines was absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary to continue them Christians, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their refusing to acknowledge them, when it
was known they understood that that Jesus they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57787:13"/>
professed to have received for their Lord, had
taught them, was a Demonstration that they did
not sincerely take him for their Lord, and so had
not that Faith which was absolutely necessary to
make them Christians. It was not their believing
these new Articles, which did continue them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but that did further Evidence they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
or did really believe what was absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to make them Christians.
The continuance of tht Faith which makes a Man
a Christian, continues him a Christian; not his
obtaining a new sort of Faith, or acting and exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the aforesaid Faith regularly, with relation to
new Objects, as they come to be proposed to, and
understood by him.</p>
               <p>This Author makes one Observation more on
what I have writ, which is to this Effect, That I
have been a little too hasty in expressing my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. in
the Words set down in the Two and Fiftieth
Page of my Animadversions. The Reason he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
for this Observation, is delivered in these
Words, <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 4. <q>Since, I suppose,
he will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny that Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> writ within that space,
who maintained the very same Assertion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I do not deny that Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> writ within
these Sixteen Hundred Years; but that he maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the very same Point maintained in <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. is more than I can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.
I received so early, such a Character of
Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Writings from my aged Tutor, the <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mr. Lawson,</hi> as created in me such an Aversion
to that Author's Books, I do not remember that
ever I read half a Score Pages of any thing Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>
hath published. But I dare say, if Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> hath
maintained this very same Assertion that is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57787:14"/>
in <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi>
that the believing that Jesus is the Messiah, so
as to take him heartily for our Lord and King, is
all that Jesus and his Apostles required as absolutely
necessary to make Men Christians, who did believe
in the True and Living God, he maintained a very
great and important Truth: And if he never pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
any Notion less true, and less useful than that,
he could not justly fall under the Censure of any of
those who have employed their Pens against him.
But if Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> or any other Person had writ on
this, or any other Subject, a Book that was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
the best that has been published this Sixteen
Hundred Years, <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.
may for all that, be justly reputed <hi>one of the best
Books</hi> which hath been published within that Space;
and this, for the Reasons I laid down in the Close
of my Animadversions, which I conceive are of
that Nature, they cannot be invalidated by the bare
mentioning of Mr. <hi>Hob</hi>'s Name. And if I am not
mistaken, the latter Reason this Author gives why
he needed not to reflect any further upon any thing
I had propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> because there does not
seem to be any thing very material, which was
not before observed in <hi>the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
&amp;c. or the Author's <hi>Vindication</hi> of it,
doth in some measure justify the Character I gave of
that excellent Treatise. For certainly it cannot be
a Blemish to a Treatise, that it discourses its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
so clearly and so fully, that very material An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
may be brought from the Treatise it self, to
whatsoever is produced by way of Objection against
it. Some Authors write after such a rate, their own
Books may be pertinently made use of to confute
their Notions. But the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. (whoever he is) seems to have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57787:14"/>
this peculiar Excellency and Advantage, that he
treats the Points he discourses of in such a manner,
he fully answers his Adversaries, before they can
make their Objections publick. I write not to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
my self or any one else in Errors or Mistakes,
but to vindicate, and clear (if I can) disguised
Truth, and wrong'd Innocence, and let those who
are contrary minded, know, I cannot be of their
Judgment till they produce other kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against the Book they profess they oppose,
than are fully answered in that Author's Writings,
which they knew were publick, before theirs were
offered to common view. And though there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
very material in these Papers, which has not
been observed before in the Writings of the Author
of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. I shall not
account that a just Prejudice against them: For if
the Answers here propounded be very material to
what is alledged against <hi>the Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
&amp;c. it cannot reasonably be supposed that the
Objections insisted on, should be of any great weight
with me. And my deriving the Answers from that
Authors Writings, I hope may pass with Persons of
Candor, Reason and Discernment, for some justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Value I set on <hi>the Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <head>Observations on the Vindication of
the Epistles.</head>
               <p>THIS Author begins his Animadversions with
that Part to which he gives this Title, <hi>A Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the Epistles:</hi> And he enters on this Part
with assigning Two Reasons why <hi>the Reasonableness
of Christianity</hi> 
                  <q>doth not (as he saith) give such Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to an inquisitive Mind, as might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all Exception against it, whether it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for the Benefit of those who were not
throughly and firmly Christians, or to be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rule of Faith to all sorts of Men?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That Author's Design was to give a clear
and distinct Account of what Articles or Doctrines
are absolutely necessary to be believed to make Men
Christians: And the Treatise gives me full Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
concerning this Matter; because it lays down
all that Jesus Christ and his Apostles have declared
to be thus necessary, and nothing but what they
have declared to be so. And his giving so full and
large Proof, that Christ and his Apostles did require
the Belief of the Articles he hath laid down, and
did not require the Belief of any other Article, as
absolutely necessary to make Men Christians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his Treatise very proper to be published for
<hi>the Benefit of those who were not throughly and firmly
Christians.</hi> For nothing can tend more to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of such Persons, than a clear, distinct, full and
true Information of what is absolutely necessary to
be believed by them, in order to their being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
What this Author understands by <hi>a General
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57787:15"/>
Rule of Faith to all sorts of Men,</hi> I do not know.
The whole New Testament is the General Rule of
Faith to all Christians, as the Author of <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. hath declared. And
the Doctrines he hath insisted on, are the Doctrines
absolutely necessary to be believed by those who are
not Christians, to make them Christians.</p>
               <p>The First Reason this Author gives why <hi>the
Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. does not seem
to give Satisfaction to an inquisitive Mind is, <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it introduces a new Scheme of Belief, in
Opposition to the anciently received Doctrine of
the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here I must observe, it is not opposite to
<hi>the most anciently received Doctrine of the Church:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the very same Scheme Jesus Christ
introduced, and his Apostles constantly kept to, in
admitting of Unbelievers into the Church.</p>
               <p>His Second Reason is, <q>Because it doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the full Sense and Intent of Revelation, which
is the only Reason and Measure of our Faith.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here I must observe, it doth answer the
full Sense and Intent of Revelation, as to what the
Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
after: Because it delivers all that Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
requires to be believed as absolutely necessary
to make Men Christians; and we are not to insist
on any thing as absolutely necessary to be believed
to make Men Christians, but what <hi>Revelation, the
only Reason and Measure of our Faith,</hi> in this Case,
doth declare is absolutely necessary to be believed
to that end. Whoever affirms any Doctrine (though
the Doctrine it self is revealed) is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed to make a Man a Christian, which
Revelation doth not declare to be so, affirms it
without <hi>Reason</hi> (according to this Authors own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57787:16"/>
because Revelation is the only Reason why
we are to affirm any Doctrine is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be believed to this purpose; and so he goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the only Measure of our Faith in this Matter.
The Reason why we are to insist on such or such
Doctrines as absolutely necessary to be believed to
make Men Christians, is, because Revelation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the Belief of them as absolutely necessary to
make Men Christians, not barely because the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
are revealed; for then every Doctrine which
is revealed must be absolutely necessary to be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
believed to make a Man a Christian, because
the Reason assigned for the Particulars we are mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to insist on, extends to every particular which is
revealed, and obliges as much to every one, as to
any one. For make your Catalogue as large as you
will, if you leave out any one Doctrine, or any
Branch of it, that is revealed, your Catalogue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly answer the <hi>full Sense and Intent of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
unless a defective, partial Scheme of Faith,
can answer the full Sense and Intent of Revelation;
or some parts of Revelation have no Sense, and
were revealed for no purpose or Intent: Both which
are equally uncapable of Proof, and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable to suppose.</p>
               <p>This Author declares, <hi>p.</hi> 4. what it is he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to prove in this First part of his Book. His
Words are these: <q>It shall be my business in the
First Place, to prove that there are Doctrines in
the Epistles, distinct from those delivered in the
Gospels or Acts, which are as absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed, and to be made Fundamental
Articles of Faith, as any other Parts of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>
That is, in short, that there are Doctrines in
the Epistles distinct from any delivered in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels
and Acts, which are absolutely necessary to be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57787:16"/>
explicitely believed to make Men Christians. The
Argument he makes use of to prove what he hath
undertaken, is this, (to word it so, as that it may
reach the Point he hath undertaken to prove)
Some of the Doctrines set down in the Epistles
which are distinct from any delivered in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels
and Acts, have been confest (<hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>by the
Church) from the very First Ages of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to be altogether as necessary to be actually (or
explicitely) believed unto Salvation, as any
whatsoever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here I shall observe, that before this Argument
can do the Business for which it is brought, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
must 1. Relate what he means or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
by the Term <hi>Church.</hi> 2. He must prove
clearly, that whatsoever the Church (in the Sense in
which he understands that Term) hath from the first
Ages of Christianity, confest to be absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed to make Men Christians, is so,
and that the Confession or Testimony of that Church,
is the sole, or ultimate Rule, by which the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
concerning what is absolutely necessary to be
believed to make Men Christians, or to Salvation,
is to be resolved and determined. That is, That we
are not to be determined in this Matter by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Christ and his Apostles, but by the
Churches Testimony; at least that it is thus, as to
the Doctrines which are divinely revealed and set
down in the New Testament. 3. He is then to set
down the particular Doctrines he hath a regard to,
in this place. And 4. He must prove that from the
very First Ages of Christianity, the Church hath
confest that every one of those Doctrines is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be explicitely believed to make
Men Christians, or to Salvation. It is not the bare
saying that the Church hath such an Authority;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57787:17"/>
nor the bare affirming such a Matter of Fact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Church, that will prove the Business in
Hand. The explaining and full proving the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
already named, will require some time and
Consideration. And when they are fully cleared,
and substantially confirmed, there will not be any
need to inquire <hi>whether,</hi> or <hi>how the Church was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on?</hi> In the mean time I shall lay down a few
Considerations which I conceive are true, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
with the Judgment of the Author of <hi>the
Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. 1. That which
makes a Doctrine of supernatural Revelation, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to be believed to make a Man a
Christian, is not its being placed in one part of the
New Testament or in another, but the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
that it must be necessarily believed for
that purpose. 2. That our knowing that such a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is absolutely necessary to be believed to make
Men Christians, depends upon God's declaring that
the Belief of it is absolutely necessary to make Men
Christians, let this Declaration lie in what part of
the New Testament soever. 3. That what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to be absolutely necessary to be believed to
make Men Christians, may be better discerned in
the Gospels and Acts, than in the Epistles, though
the same Doctrines are likewise to be found in them.
And this for the Reasons the Author of <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. hath assign'd. 4. The
New Testament comprehends the entire Revelation
the Lord Jesus Christ hath made of the Mind of
God. In which Sacred Writings, our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
declares what Articles are absolutely necessary
to be believed to make Men his Disciples and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or Christians; and in these Holy Scriptures
he hath also delivered, or declared all the Laws of
his Kingdom, by which those he admits for his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57787:17"/>
must be govern'd; so that they are not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
or receive any thing for a Part of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as Christian, but what he hath taught and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in some part of these Holy Writings. 5. The
enquiry is not how many are the Laws of Christ's
Kingdom, or how many Articles he hath taught
and delivered, which those who are his Subjects are
obliged to endeavour to understand, believe and
observe, but what are those Articles he doth require
to be believed, as absolutely necessary to make Men
his Subjects or Christians? 6. All the Doctrines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the New Testament, are equally Divine
Revelations, and are therefore to be received with
equal Degrees of Assent, by all those Christians
who do understand them, and know that they are
revealed or delivered in those Sacred Writings. But
these Doctrines are not absolutely necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make Men Christians. Indeed there are several
Doctrines which I know are delivered in the New
Testament, which have not the like Effect and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on me at present, in proportion to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that other Doctrines have, which I know are
taught there: But this Difference ariseth not from
the Nature of the former Doctrines, which is always
the same and unalterable; nor from my not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them with equal Degrees of Assent, for
I do receive them with equal Degrees of Assent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as firmly persuaded they are Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as the other; but this Difference spoken of
now, ariseth from something else, <hi>viz.</hi> my present
State and Circumstances, or the like.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Now (saith this Author) if several of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
contained in those parts of Revelation,
(<hi>viz.</hi> the Epistles) have all along down from the
Apostles Times, been reputed necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to Salvation, then certainly they ought not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57787:18"/>
to be denied to be absolutely subservient to that
end, without the Proof of one, or all these things
(which are Five in Number).</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is not particular Persons or Churches
reputing things to be absolutely necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to Salvation, that makes them absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to Salvation. In the very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
times of Christianity, even long before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
decease, there were People professing themselves
Christians, and who set up for Teachers in the
the Church, who affirmed certain things were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to Salvation, which were not so;
as is undeniably evident from <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 1. 2. When
this Author shall be pleased to set down plainly, the
Doctrines his Words seem to have a Secret Relation
to, a Judgment may be made, whether they were
justly reputed absolutely necessary to be believed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
to make Men Christians, or not, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
whether Christ and his Apostles reputed
them absolutely necessary or not. 3. If the Church
did originally repute any Doctrines to be absolutely
necessary to be explicitely believed to Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
warrant, the successive continuance of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
cannot make those Doctrines to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary. Length of Time, and reiterated
Applause, cannot advance an original Mistake into
Truth. The Second Concoction will not in this
case, rectify the Error of the First. 4. A Person
who doth suppose, yea, acknowledge that several
Doctrines delivered in the Epistles, which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from any taught in the Gospels and Acts,
have been justly reputed necessary to be believed to
Salvation, may regularly, and with good Warrant
deny that they are absolutely necessary (for that I
suppose) this Author means (for otherwise the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
he draws is not to his Purpose) though he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57787:18"/>
useth the Word Subservient) to be believed to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
without being obliged to prove either one,
or Five Negatives. For many Doctrines may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
justly reputed necessary to Salvation, which are
not absolutely necessary to Salvation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when it is inferred that such and such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
are absolutely necessary to be explicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to Salvation, if they have all along been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
necessary to be believed to Salvation, the
Consequence may be regularly denied, and no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
follow thereupon, that the Person denying it, must
be obliged to prove: 1. <hi>That the Authors of the Epistles
were not divinely inspired.</hi> 2. &amp;c. And for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
I suppose it is that this Author applies himself, in
the Remainder of this part of his Animadversions,
to prove these Five Points: 1. That the Authors
of the Epistles were Divinely Inspired. 2. That
the Apostles had Authority or Commission to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
some things for necessary Articles of Faith.
3. That some of their Doctrines were writ with a
Design that all Christians should be necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to believe them to Salvation. 4. That
there is no Contradiction in the Epistles to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of Scripture. 5. That some of those
Doctrines are of equal Necessity to be explicitely
known to make a Man a Christian, with this, that
Jesus is the Messiah. But First of all, the fullest
Proof imaginable, of every one of these Points,
will not in the least confirm the Proposition or
Argument they are immediately designed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
<hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That all those Doctrines delivered in
the Epistles, which are distinct from any that are
taught in the Gospels and Acts, which the Church
from the first Ages of Christianity, hath confest
to be absolutely necessary to be explicitely believed
to make Men Christians, are absolutely necessary
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57787:19"/>
to be explicitely believed to make Men Christians.</q>
For there is not any Connection between the Truth
of any, or all of these Five Points, and the
Churches Authority, by her continual Confession to
make any Doctrines which are only to be found in
the Epistles, absolutely necessary to be believed to
make Men Christians. If it shall be said that it is
not pretended that the Churches Confession makes
them absolutely necessary to be believed, but disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and proves that they are absolutely necessary to
be believed to make Men Christians. I answer 1.
The Proof of the forementioned Points, is no Proof
at all of the Churches Confession, but must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and is Antecedent to the Churches Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
2. That the Churches Confession doth not
discover or prove that those Doctrines are absolutely
necessary to be believed to make Men Christians:
it discovers or proves no more, but that the Church
did think those Doctrines were absolutely necessary
to be believed explicitely to make Men Christians.
Now when the Question is whether the Church hath
thought right concerning this Matter? that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
must be determined (if she have not Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to make (at least) revealed Doctrines absolutely
necessary to be believed to make Men Christians)
by ascending higher, and seeing what Jesus Christ
and his Apostles have declared is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be believed to make Men Christians: which
is the way the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
&amp;c. took, to discover what Doctrines are
absolutely necessary to be believed to the aforesaid
purpose, without making any Hubbub concerning
the Church in the matter. The Author of <hi>the
Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. hath not writ
one Word, that I can find, that hath any Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the Disadvantage of the Christian Church;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57787:19"/>
but very much that would contribute greatly to her
Honour and Interest, were People generally of the
Mind to attend her greatest Concernments heartily,
without suffering themselves to be swayed by their
own petty Interests, and peevish Humours, which
they sacrilegiously dignify with her Name. She
might enjoy a profound Rest, and become daily
more and more truly Glorious, would other People
let her be quiet, and not disturb her Repose, by a
rude abusing her Name, to justify their espousing
and talking for Matters, both Scripture and Reason
do disclaim. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The exactest Proof of the
Four First Points, will not afford any Proof of
what this Author declares shall be his Business to
prove in this First Part of his Book; <hi>viz.</hi> That
there are Doctrines in the Epistles distinct from
those which are delivered in the Gospels and Acts,
which are absolutely necessary to be believed to
make Men Christians.The Truth of the Four
First Points is agreed on, on both Sides, especially
some allowance being made for that Latitude of
Expression in which the third is laid down: So that
it is only the Fifth and Last Point on which the
Controversy doth depend. It will therefore be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to make any Observations on what this Author
offers for the Proof of his Four First Points, unless
he happens to mistake any thing in <hi>the Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. which he brings in under
these Heads, or misapplies what he hath to say on
these Points, to that Treatise, or some Passages in
it.</p>
               <p>This Author bestows his Seventh Page in setting
down an Objection that hath some Relation to his
Two First Points. I think the Objection is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
expressed, but that I shall pass over, and
only take notice of his speaking of Doctrines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57787:20"/>
to be believed upon <hi>the Absolute Promise of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
This is a Passage I confess, I do not well
understand. I know there are at this time many
amongst us, who make a great Noise in affirming That
Salvation is absolutely promised to some Persons,
and the Stir they have made about or with that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I apprehend, was an occasion of the Author
of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself to search with particular exactness into
the Holy Scriptures, to find out in what Manner
Salvation is there promised: But I do not conceive
that this Author of <hi>the Animadversions</hi> is one of
that Party. Now, I think there is not an absolute
Promise of Salvation in all the Scripture: And that
if there were such a Promise, there could not be
any thing absolutely necessary to be believed unto
Salvation.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>For an Answer to this (<hi>viz.</hi> Objection spoken of
before) it will (saith this Author) be material to
examine First, whether nothing is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to salvation, but what is
declared to be so, or whether any Doctrine, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Salvation is proposed, is singly of it self
sufficient for it? <hi>P.</hi> 8. He immediately adds,
This seems to be a Query of no small Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here I will 1. Propound some Reasons why it
may be justly affirmed that a due believing Jesus to
be the Christ or Messiah, doth constitute and make
Men Christians. 2. I will consider what this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
propounds to be examined. 3. I will take
Notice of what this Author hath here writ upon
this Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I will lay down some Reasons why it may
be justly affirmed that a due believing that Jesus is
the Messiah or Christ, doth constitute and make a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57787:20"/>
Man a Christian. As 1. Because Jesus Christ and
his Apostles did admit Persons to be his Disciples,
and owned them for Christians, upon their believing
this Doctrine, without requiring the Belief of any
other Doctrine to this purpose, provided they did
believe in the True and Living God: as every where
appears in the Accounts given of their admitting
Disciples. 2. Because they have promised salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the due Belief of this Doctrine, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the explicite Belief of any other Gospel-Doctrines
together with this, as absolutely necessary
to Salvation. 3. Because Salvation is not promised
to the Belief of any one, or Number of Doctrines
separately from this Doctrine. 4. Because no other
Doctrine Christ or his Apostles have taught, can be
believed aright, but by virtue of the Persons belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this Doctrine. Let a Man believe all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
delivered in the New Testament upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
purely distinct from this, that they are
Doctrines taught by Jesus Christ, whom he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for his Lord, he does not believe them as a
Christian ought to believe them, nor will his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of them on those Accounts, at all avail him
as to Salvation, by virtue of any Promise in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
He that believes any of these Doctrines with
the Faith of a Christian, or as a Christian is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, does but repeat or re-act his Belief that
Jesus is the Christ, with a precise Determination of
that Belief to those Doctrines as known and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to be taught by Christ. Now if a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe any of these Doctrines as they ought to
be believed, or for that Reason for which they are
to be believed, till he is a Christian, with what
consistency can it be pretended, that the Belief of
any of these Doctrines is absolutely necessary to
make a Man a Christian? Upon what Evidence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57787:21"/>
upon what Authority must a Man believe any of
these Doctrines to make him a Christian? They
are not parts of natural Religion. Will a Man's
believing them in Submission to humane Authority
make him a Christian? If it be said he must believe
them upon Christ's Authority who hath revealed
them, then he must first of all believe that Jesus is
the Messiah or Christ, and so as to take him for his
Lord. If it shall be said that is granted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is affirmed that that Belief is the first Act of
Faith, and the first Step to Christian Faith; but,
that Faith doth not constitute or make a Man a
Christian, till it be compleated and grown up to a
certain Size, by additional Acts of Faith, believing
a precise Number of Articles more. It may then
be ask'd, what we are to call, or what we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by that Faith, of which believing Jesus to
be the Christ, is the first Act? It's said, <q>It is
not Christian Faith, and if it be properly said to
be an <hi>Act</hi> of Faith, what Name soever shall be
given to it, it must be Antecedent to what is but
the Act of it.</q> But how it can be an Act of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, and yet but a Step to Christian Faith,
has some more Difficulty in it. But further, it may
be enquired, if the due believing Jesus to be the
Christ, do not constitute a Man a Christian, how
can the limited exercising of this Faith, with respect
to a certain Number of Doctrines, constitute him
a Christian, when all, or the main Excellency of
his believing those Doctrines, is derived from his
believing jesus to be Christ? Does a Creature's
being endued with Reason make him a Rational
Creature, or his exerting and exercising his Reason
to certain degrees about a precise Number of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?
Again, it may be queried not only what are
those additional Articles, but upon whose Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57787:21"/>
or for what Reason must they be believed, to be
absolutely necessary to be believed to make Men
Christians? 5. Because it is only the due Belief
that Jesus is the Christ, which doth or can constitute
a Person a true Disciple or Subject of Christ. The
Belief of all the other Doctrines in the Bible, taken
separately from this, will not make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
For if it would, a Man might be a Christian
though he did not believe Jesus to be the Christ.
And so believing Jesus to be the Christ, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be the first Act (as is said) of Christian Faith,
nor an absolutely necessary Step to Christian Faith.
Add the Belief of all other Doctrines in the Bible
to the Belief that Jesus is the Christ, they cannot
make the Man a Christian. The Additional Belief
is but Evidence and Proof that he doth believe that
Jesus is the Messias, so as to take him for his Lord:
And if a due belief that Jesus is the Christ, doth
not constitute a Man a Christian, all other Belief is
so far from constituting him a Christian, it will not
amount to a Proof that he is a Christian. A due Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that Jesus is the Messiah or Christ, is the
grand Principle of a Christian's Belief and Practice,
as to all the particular Doctrines of Faith, and
Rules of Good living laid down by Christ in the
whole Scripture. This brings the Person under an
indispensable Obligation to endeavour seriously to
know what Christ hath delivered both as to the
one and the other. This obliges him to believe
whatsoever Doctrines he shall attain to know Christ
hath taught, and to perform and practice whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he shall attain to know Christ hath made his
Duty. It is this that preserves to all the Doctrines
of Faith and Rules of Practice delivered to us in
the Holy Scriptures, their full Force and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Hereby we perceive them to be the Doctrines
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57787:22"/>
and Laws of him we have received for our Lord,
whom we are on that account to believe, and obey
in every thing we understand is his declared Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will now consider what this Author propounds to be examined; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>whether nothing
is absolutely necessary to be believed to Salvation,
but what is declared to be so, or whether any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
upon which Salvation is proposed, is singly
of it self sufficient for it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here are Two Questions, proposed as if they were
but one, differently worded: I will say something
in general touching this Matter, and then speak
more particularly to it. In general I shall observe,
that there is a great difference between these Three
Things. 1. A Doctrine's being declared to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be believed to Salvation. 2. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
being promised to what is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be believed to Salvation. 3. Salvation being
promised to the Belief of something, but not under
this precise Consideration, as absolutely necessary
to be believed to Salvation. To believe in the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
True God, is declared to be absolutely necessary
to Salvation, and it is impossible that a Man should
believe a right, that Jesus is the Messiah, without
believing in the only True God. For a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe that Jesus was sent by the True God,
and is constituted King by him, except he believe
in that God who did send him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this Belief is absolutely necessary to
make a Man a Christian, or to Salvation, yet it
doth not make him a Christian, nor is Salvation
promised to it. Salvation is promised to that Faith
which doth make a Man a Christian, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Jesus to be the Christ or Messiah, so as to
take him for our Lord. But Salvation was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to any upon their believing Jesus to be the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57787:22"/>
Christ, but only those who first of all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
their Belief in the True and Living God:
And therefore those who did not believe in the only
True God, were always instructed concerning the
True God, and called on to believe in him, before
Salvation was promised to them, upon their belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Jesus to be the Messiah. If Salvation is promised
upon the believing of other Points, or to any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Practice, it is not promised to those Matters,
as absolutely necessary to be believed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
but the Promise is made (with respect to
those Matters) to them who do already believe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
to be the Messiah. Some things are absolutely
necessary to Salvation, to which no Promise of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is made. And Salvation may be promised
to some things which are not absolutely necessary
to Salvation.</p>
               <p>More particularly, here are Three distinct Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
to be considered. 1. Whether nothing is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to be believed to Salvation, but
what God hath declared to be so? To this I answer
Affirmatively: For God only hath a right to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and fix the Terms on which he will bestow
Salvation: And what his Determination is, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be known till it is declared: Nor can any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his Determination but himself. The Church
hath not a Right or Authority to declare any thing
in this Matter, but what God hath declared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it. And every particular Person hath Right
to examine whether the Church doth, or hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
as she ought. For that Revelation which is
the Rule by which the Church is to govern her
self in her Declaration about this Matter, is the Rule
by which every particular Person is to examine and
judge for himself, whether the Church hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57787:23"/>
right, and delivers truly what God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in his Determination concerning this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>2. Whether Salvation is promised to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
that is required as absolutely necessary to
Salvation? To this I answer Negatively. If God
hath made the Belief of more than one Article ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to Salvation, the Promise of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is not made to any of them apart, but to
them all in Conjunction. Therefore the Belief of
the only true God, and that Jesus is the Messiah,
must go together, and Salvation is not promised to
one alone, for though the believing Jesus to be the
Messiah cannot be without the former, yet the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
may be without the latter. Moreover there is
something absolutely necessary to make a Man a
Christian, which no Man nor Church can particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
determine what it is. For a Man cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
believe that Jesus is the Messiah, but he
must first have or understand some Evidence and
Proof that he is the Messiah; but Men cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
upon what Proof a Man must necessarily
believe it, because God hath provided Men with
great Store of eminent Proofs, proper to convince
them that Jesus is the Messiah, and hath not bound
up himself that he will not give forth his effectual
Influence and Blessing with any, but one Instance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
that great variety of Argument, with which
he hath furnished Men in order to their Conviction.
Now Salvation is not directly promised to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the Argument proving, but the Article pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
though sometimes the one is put for the other,
and the Belief of the Article proved, is expressed by
believing the Argument which proves it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:57787:23"/>
3. Whether any Doctrine, upon the believing of
which Salvation is promised, is singly of it self suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for Salvation? I answer, Salvation is not
promised to the Belief of any one Doctrine consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
singly in it self; yet Salvation might have
been promised to those who sincerely believe Jesus
to be the Christ, upon their believing certain other
Doctrines, and the Belief of those Doctrines not
be absolutely necessary to Salvation. As a Person
may believe a Doctrine which is absolutely necessary
to be believed to Salvation, and yet have no true
Title to Salvation, because Salvation was never
promised to the Belief of that Doctrine alone. So
Salvation might have been promised to the Belief of
certain Doctrines, and yet a Person might be saved
though he did never attain explicitely to know and
believe those Doctrines, because the explicite Belief
of them is not made absolutely necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The main, if not the whole Excellency and
Dignity of a Person's believing the particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
delivered or taught in the New Testament,
to be believed by Christians, consists in this, that that
Faith is an Act of Submission or Obedience to that
Jesus, they have received to be their Lord. As a
Man may believe in the True God, and yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Jesus Christ, and so may miss of Salvation
because he doth not believe all that is absolutely
necessary to be believed to Salvation, so a Man may
believe several Doctrines taught in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not believe that Jesus is the Messiah, and
so may miss of Salvation, because he does not believe
all that is absolutely necessary to be believed to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
though the promise of Salvation had been
annexed to the Belief of those Doctrines, in them
who do unfeignedly believe that Jesus is the Christ,
and who believe them in obedience to him. But
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57787:24"/>
Salvation is not promised to the Belief of any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which does not suppose Jesus to be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will now take some Notice of what this
Author doth say to these Matters: <q>If this (saith
he) be made the only Rule whereby to judge of
Fundamentals, <hi>viz.</hi> a Doctrine's being expresly
declared to be necessary to be actually believed to
Salvation; we should I fear by this means raise se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Exceptions against a great part of Religion.
<hi>p.</hi> 8.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Question here is, by what Rule we
are to judge what Articles are absolutely necessary
to be believed to make Men Christians, or to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
The Author of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
&amp;c. says, the Rule we must judge of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by, is the Declaration God hath made of his
Determination concerning this Matter, by Jesus
Christ and his Apostles. <hi>No,</hi> saith this Author, and
his Reason is, he fears then Men will raise several
Exceptions against a great part of Religion. I do
not know what Men will do, but the Question will
be, whether they will then raise just Exceptions
against a great part of Religion? Our Fears must
not rob God of his Right. But I am certain, by
keeping closely to God's Declaration, no just Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can be raised against any one Part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion. What this Author saith after, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Matters of Faith, and of Practice, I think
is fully answered in the <hi>Second Vindication of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 83, 84. and thither I refer the
Reader for Satisfaction, if he needs any. I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe that Salvation is not promised in the New
Testament, to any Matter of Faith or Practice, but
but with respect to the Belief of this Article, That
<hi>Iesus is the Messiah.</hi> Let any Man produce a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57787:24"/>
of Salvation to an Unbeliever, (if he can)
upon his believing any other Doctrine, or perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Matter of Practice, considered separately
from his believing Jesus to be the Messiah. Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not promised to any, but those who believe
that Jesus is the Messiah; and when it is promised
to such, with relation to other Matters, the Promise
then hath a respect to that Article, to which it was
primarily promised, and respects <hi>those other Matters</hi>
as <hi>Fruits, Effects</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi> of their sincere belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Jesus Christ; except where the Promise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
not Salvation in General, but <hi>Degrees</hi> of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
or Glory.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If in Matters of Faith (saith this Author) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is to be required for a Fundamental, but what
is so proposed, and to which Salvation is expresly
annexed and promised, it would very probably
make way for a very unintelligible Faith, in
which Christians could not possibly agree.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here the Author seems to speak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Doctrines which those who are Christians
must endeavour to understand and believe; and if
so, it is besides the Question. But that Peoples keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
close to God's Declaration, either as to Doctrines
absolutely necessary to be believed to make Men
Christians, or as to Doctrines they are to believe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
hath a probable tendency to make way
for a very unintelligible Faith, is very strange to me.
Is the surest way to have the most intelligible Faith,
for People to go as far as they can from God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Declarations? There will be some Difference
indeed amongst Christians as to the particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
they believe, some believing more Articles,
some fewer, and this must needs be, till they be
all equal in their Knowledge. Yet in the way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
against, they will every one be obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57787:25"/>
and practise according to the extent of their
Knowledge, and to agree in Faith and Practise, so
far as they do in Knowledge. And let People ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
what Notions they please, concerning what
Articles are necessary to make Men Christians, they
cannot rationally agree any further than they will
this way; unless they must all be stak'd down to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
just one set of Doctrines, without extending
their Endeavours after Knowledge any further.
And if this be a way to prevent Peoples raising <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
against a great part of Religion, I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
it from doing <hi>unsufferable Wrong</hi> to a great part
of Religion. In believing Jesus to be the Messiah,
so as to take him for our Lord and King, we yield
up our selves intirely to him, to believe and practise
whatsoever we shall know he hath taught and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
And therefore we must not suffer our
selves to be coupt up, and confined to a precise
Number of Doctrines and Laws, but must every
one employ our best Endeavours to be continually
increasing and improving in Knowledge, Faith and
Holiness. This believing Jesus to be the Messiah,
doth not imply our explicite believing a certain
Number of Doctrines he hath taught, but it is a
submitting our Faith implicitly to him, believing
that all he hath taught is true, with a Disposition
and purpose to search after, and endeavour to know
what Doctrines he hath particularly taught, and to
believe on his Authority, whatsoever we shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
he hath taught.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>For (saith this Author) if nothing more is to be
believed as (it should be, absolutely) necessary to
Salvation, than what is so proposed, then it will
follow, that no more than the bare Proposition
which is declared to be of that great importance,
is to be assented to. As suppose in that Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

—<hi>He that believeth that Iesus is the Messiah,
hath Eternal Life;</hi> if what is there required to be

then it must be so as it is there proposed, without
any farther Explication of it: because there is no

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Author by assenting to <hi>a bare Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
seems to mean a Person's assenting to, or belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that certain Words he never heard before, nor
understands any thing of the Sence or Meaning of
any of them (that is an insignificant Sound) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and express a real Truth, which is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impossible; for though the Words may be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to him who utters them, and to those who
understand them, they are no Proposition to him,
who never heard, nor knows any thing of them;
and therefore cannot be assented to by him. <hi>By
Explication of it,</hi> this Author here seems to mean,
proper Interpretation; <hi>viz.</hi> declaring in another
Language what the Terms in the said Proposition
did ordinarily signify, amongst them who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to the Language, in which the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was first of all delivered; or declaring by other
Words in the same Language, the several simple I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,
of which those complex Ideas were made up,
for the expressing of which those Terms were used.
Yet in the next Page he seems to understand by
Explication, <q>All those Doctrines which are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Holy Scriptures, that either relate the
Grounds and Reasons (why we are to believe the
Proposition he speaks of) of such a Faith, which
is required to Salvation. And that explain the
Nature and Extent of it.</q> If this Author be of
Opinion, that the explicite Belief of all the Grounds
and Reasons that are delivered in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57787:26"/>
why, or upon which, People ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Jesus is the Messiah, and of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
that is said in Scripture concerning Jesus Christ,
and every Branch of his Office is as absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make a Man a Christian, or to Salvation,
as the belief that Jesus is the Messiah, is, I think it
will require a considerable time to prove clearly the
Truth of that Opinion, and if we may introduce
an account of our Fears in Discourses of this Nature
I may take Liberty to declare, I am afraid this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if it prevail, will <hi>unavoidably fill the World with
endless Wranglings and Distractions.</hi> For I suspect all
People will not presently agree how many the Texts
be, and which they are, which relate all the things
before spoken of, not to say any thing of the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of their sudden Consent to understand eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of the Texts in the same Sense. Or if they
shou'd fall immediately into an Accord about all
these Matters, I suspect the Ground of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
will not be very <hi>intelligible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was never pretended (that I know of) that
Eternal Life is promised to those who shall believe
that this Proposition, <hi>Iesus is the Messiah,</hi> is true,
without understanding the Sense of the Terms of
which it doth consist. To believe a Proposition, is
not for a Person to believe he hears a Sound, but
to be satisfied of the Truth of what is affirmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
denied in the Proposition; which a Man cannot
be, unless he understands the Sense of every part of
the Proposition. <hi>For a Man cannot possibly give his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to any Affirmation or Negation, unless be understand
the Terms as they are joyn'd in that Proposition, and has
a Conception of the Thing affirmed, or denied, as they
are there put together. But let the Proposition be what
it will, there is no more to be understood than is expressed
in the Terms of that Proposition.</hi> Second Vindic. of

Proposition, Jesus is the Messiah, was first of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the Jews, and consists of Terms which
were very common and familiar amongst them,
which had a determined setled signification amongst
them. The one was the Proper Name of a Person,
the other ordinarily stood for the Description of a
Person they lived in expectation of, according to
the Account <hi>Moses</hi> had given them of him a long
time before. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the 20. and <hi>Act.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They did not need any Interpretation of
the Proposition. And People of another Language
needed no other Interpretation of it, than what
was necessary to furnish them with the Knowledge
of the Sense in which those People to whom the
Proposition was first delivered, understood those
Terms. Whosoever doth duly believe that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
doth oblige himself to <hi>hearken to,</hi> that is, to
believe and obey whatsoever this Jesus hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so far as he shall obtain the Knowledge thereof,
and to endeavour seriously to know what his Mind
and Will is: Which Faith makes a Man a Christian,
and hath the Promise of Eternal Life made to it.
The Proposition doth not comprehend in it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
Account of all the Matters of Faith which a
Christian is to endeavour to know and believe, nor
is the explicite Knowledge of them necessary to a
Man's believing that Proposition: But his believing
of it, brings him under an Obligation to endeavour
to know them all, and to believe explicitely what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he shall attain to know Jesus hath taught;
which is to be the great Work and Business of the
Remainder of his Life, when he is a Christian.
Those Jews, and <hi>Lewd Fellows of the baser sort,</hi> at
<hi>Thessalonica,</hi> who set themselves against <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi>
understood that their preaching that Jesus was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57787:27"/>
the Christ (for that was the great Point they opened
and alledged in the Synagogue there) amounted to
this, that he was the Person they persuaded the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to receive for their Lord and King. For how
malicious soever their intent was, in accusing them
before the Ruler, it is most plain from their Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they clearly apprehended that <hi>Paul</hi> by
preaching that Jesus was the Christ, did mean that
they were to take him for their King; <hi>saying that
there is another King, one Iesus,</hi> Act. 17. 7. <hi>Vid. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

Scripture must be looked upon as sufficient to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
upon the Belief of which, eternal Life is
promised, even the very Scripture will hardly be
found reconcilable to it self. For though in some
Places Salvation is promised to those who believe
Jesus to be the Messiah; yet in others it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be Life Eternal to know the only true God,
<hi>as well</hi> as Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. Both
of which Places, if they must be understood in
their limited Sense, will be almost found contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory

other. <hi>p.</hi> 9.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Propositions here spoken of, as they
are delivered in the Scripture, are in effect the
same. For it is not possible for a Man to believe
that Jesus is the Messiah, without believing antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
in the only True God. The Word of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Christ is not sent to any but those <hi>who
fear God, Act.</hi> 13. 26. But I deny that it is any
where in Scripture declared to be Eternal Life to
know the only True God, <hi>as well</hi> as Jesus Christ
whom he hath sent: That is, either of them sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57787:27"/>
The Text of Scripture which comes nearest
to these Words is <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. where the Knowledge
of the only True God, taken apart from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Jesus Christ as sent by him, is not declared
to be Eternal Life. But the Knowledge of both is
declared to be Eternal Life. I wave a particular
considering what this Author saith, <hi>p.</hi> 9, 10. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the true Notion of <hi>believing in Christ, when
alone required to make a Man a Christian:</hi> Because
the plain Truth of the Matter we are discoursing of
consists in this; <hi>viz.</hi> That the sincere Belief of all
those Doctrines Christ hath declared, are absolutely
necessary to be believed to Salvation, is of it self
sufficient to Salvation. But this is so far from <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
that it doth include a necessity of believing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doctrines, if the Person is allowed space to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Knowledge of more Doctrines which Christ
hath revealed, and that he hath revealed them. Yet
if the Person who sincerely believes the aforesaid
Doctrines, should dye before he could obtain the
Knowledge of any other Doctrine Christ hath
taught, he will receive the Salvation promised to the
Belief of those Doctrines he doth believe; Christ
knows his Sincerity, and will not fail to perform the
Promise he hath made to him. There are many, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
very many Articles Christ hath revealed, which
those who are Christians are necessarily obliged to
endeavour to know, and then explicitely believe;
and as many of these Doctrines as they do attain to
understand, whether they be delivered in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels,
or Acts, or Epistles, are Fundamental to them.
But the Explicite Belief of these Doctrines is not
absolutely necessary to make Men Christians, or to
Salvation. <hi>Our Faith is true and saving, when it
is such as God by the new Covenant requires it to be:
But it is not intire and consummate till we explicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57787:28"/>
all the Truths contained in the Word of God. For
the whole Revelation of Truth in the Scripture, being the
proper and entire Object of Faith; our Faith cannot be
entire and consummate, till it be adequate to its proper
Object, which is the whole Divine Revelation contained
in the Scripture.</hi> Second Vindic. of <hi>the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

               <p>This Author <hi>p.</hi> 11. distinguishes betwixt <q>Truths
which are only to be believed upon the general
Ground of Faith, which is the Veracity of God;
and those of a higher Nature, which have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Tendency to the Salvation of Mankind,
and the Method by which our Saviour has obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it for us: And these latter sort of Truths (he
saith) are to be explicitely believed by all, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their Salvation: And the Reason he gives
for this, is, because the only End for which he
hath revealed these Truths, is the Eternal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and Happiness of Mankind.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This seems to be a Distinction without a
Difference; for seeing they are all Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Ground and Reason of our believing them
is the very same, and every Way equal, <hi>viz.</hi> because
God hath revealed them. If it be revealed that some
of these Doctrines are absolutely necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make Men Christians, or to Salvation;
we must believe them to be so, and that the Ground
or Reason of that Belief is Divine Revelation. But if
Men will believe them to be absolutely necessary to
be explicitely known, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in order to Salvation,
and God hath not revealed any such thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, their Faith in that case will want a just
Foundation or Reason. But it's said, These <hi>Truths
of a higher Nature have an immediate Tendency to the
Salvation of Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ's observing the Methods appointed
him by the Father, in order to his obtaining Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Mankind, had undoubtedly their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Tendency to his obtaining Salvation for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
But the Doctrines which relate what those
Methods were, have not thesame Tendency to the
Salvation of Mankind; nor can a Person's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
those Doctrines which declare that Christ
hath observed these Methods, and thereby obtained
Salvation for Mankind, be properly said to have
an immediate Tendency to the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
But that which should be proved is this, that
Christ or his Apostles have revealed that the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Belief of all those Doctrines which declare what
was necessary on Christ's part, in order to his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Salvation for Mankind, is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to make a Man a Christian, or to a Person's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entitled to, and partaking of the Salvation which
was so obtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But 'tis said,</hi> These respect the End for which he has
revealed any thing to us, and that is only the Eternal
Benefit and Happiness of Mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If this be only the End for which God hath
revealed any thing to us, and therefore these are
absolutely necessary to be believed to Salvation, this
will bring in all the other Truths to be absolutely
necessary to be believed to Salvation; and so the
general Direction here laid down to distinguish fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Truths, will be of no use. For those
Truths, being things God hath revealed to us, and
the Eternal Benefit and Happiness of Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the only End for which he hath revealed any
thing unto us, they must equally respect the same
End, and consequently be equally necessary to be
explicitely believed in order to that End. But I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
the Author's Meaning was thus; That the only
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57787:29"/>
End for which God revealed those Truths of a
higher Nature, is the Eternal Benefit and Happiness
of Mankind. That is (to bring it home to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
purpose) the only End why God revealed those
Truths, was to make the explicite Belief of them
absolutely necessary to Salvation. And if this were
proved, the Controversy would be at an End. But
I think the great Reason and End why God hath
revealed those Doctrines which declare the way and
Method how our Saviour did obtain Salvation for
Mankind, was, that Christians might know and
believe the way, how the Lord Jesus Christ did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and purchase Salvation for Sinners, and that
they might make such use and improvement of these
Truths, as he particularly directs, or their own
Natures are proper to suggest. Some Doctrines may
be of greater consequence to be explicitely known
and believed by those who are Christians, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others may which are revealed. But the Point
in discourse is not concerning weighty, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Truths, with respect to those who are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
but concerning Doctrines absolutely necessary
to be explicitely believed to make Men Christians.
See <hi>Second Vindic. of the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 87, 88. and 172, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Salvation
of Mankind was obtained by Christ's observing such
and such Methods, we know only by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.
But notwithstanding our Salvation was
obtained in such ways, and we are certain of the
same from the Testimony of Christ, we are not to
affirm that the explicite Belief of the Doctrines
which declare these Truths, is absolutely necessary
to make Men Christians, or to Salvation, without
Christ's Warrant. The ways and Methods related
in these Doctrines, were necessary to be observed
by Christ, in order to his obtaining the Salvation of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57787:29"/>
Mankind, and so might several others, for ought
we know, which are not revealed. But it will not
thence follow that the explicite Belief of every
thing which necessarily pertained to Christ in order
to his obtaining Salvation for Mankind, or of every
thing of that Nature which is revealed, is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary to be believed, in order to our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
from him, the Salvation which he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
There is no more absolutely necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in order to Mens partaking of that Salvation,
than what Christ absolutely requires to be believed,
in order to his dispensing it unto Men. Our belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
explicitely the several Steps Jesus was to take
for the obtaining of Salvation for Mankind, has
not the same Relation, to our receiving that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from him, on the account of what he hath
done and suffered, as his doing and suffering those
things had, to his obtaining Salvation for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
He has by certain Methods obtained to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Right to dispence Salvation to those who shall
unfeignedly take him for their Lord and King. But
his Right to bestow Salvation on Persons, doth not
depend on, nor is limited to their explicite believing
every Doctrine which relates any of the Steps, he
was indispensably obliged to take and observe, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his obtaining and being invested with that
Right.</p>
               <p>In Matters of revealed Religion, Revelation is
the Ground or Reason of our Faith, let the Matter
revealed be what it will; of greater or less impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And where the Reason of our Assent is the
same, the Act must be the same.</p>
               <p>I agree with this Author, <hi>p.</hi> 13. That <q>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Miracles was not immediately to give Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to particular Doctrines, but to testify in
general that those who wrought them had such a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57787:30"/>
Commission from God as they professed.</q> And
in my Judgment, this is no contemptible Argument
to prove, that the due believing Jesus to be Christ
doth make Men Christians. His Miracles did not
immediately and directly, but only consequentially
prove the particular Doctrines he taught. But they
did most eminently prove he was the Messiah; and
they were wrought for this purpose to induce Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to become his Disciples, or Christians, or to
own and acknowledge him to be the Messiah. If
those Persons whose Faith did answer the Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Miracles, were Christians, I think it
cannot handsomly be denied, that the Faith which
made them Christians, was a Belief that Jesus was
the Messiah.</p>
               <p>Yet if it shall be clearly proved that the Explicite
Belief of any one Article distinct from this, <hi>That
Iesus is the Messiah,</hi> is required in any part of the
New Testament, as absolutely necessary to make a
Man, who acknowledges and believes in the True
and Living God, a Christian, I will acknowledge
that something absolutely necessary to be believed to
make a Man a Christian, is omitted in <hi>the Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. and I have Reason from
that Author's Books to believe that he will do the
same. But as that Doctrine must be known, before
it can be proved to be absolutely necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make a Man a Christian; so I must know
what it is, before I can be satisfied that it is such a
Doctrine. And it may very reasonably be desired
of them, who affirm that there are more Doctrines
absolutely necessary to be believed to make Men
Christians, that they would draw out a just Scheme
of them. No, saith this Author, <q>It will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to our present purpose, if we can produce
any Doctrines, that are absolutely enjoyned to be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57787:30"/>
believed by all Christians, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 16.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is quite from the present purpose;
for the enquiry is not what Doctrines are enjoyed
absolutely to be believed by all Christians? but
what Doctrines are declared by Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
to be absolutely necessary to be believed to
make Men Christians? Yet I do not think it an easy
Task to prove a certain Number of Articles abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be believed by all Christians.
But if that could be done, it would signify little to
the present purpose. It is acknowledged that there
are very many Doctrines which those who are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are obliged to use their best Endeavours to
understand explicitely, and then believe; and that
some of these Doctrines are not expresly delivered
in the Gospels, and also that some of those Doctrines
which are taught in the Gospels and Acts are more
fully expressed and explained in the Epistles. But
the Proof is yet wanting, that the explicite Belief
of every one of these Doctrines, and the fullest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations
of them is absolutely necessary to make
Men Christians. And before they can all be proved
to be Doctrines which are absolutely necessary to
be believed for this purpose, their Number must be
precisely determined, and a particular Account
must be given of every one of them: For can any
thing be more absurd, than to pretend to prove
that People must necessarily believe, and believe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
no one knows what, to make them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?</p>
               <p>But supposing some Person will undertake to
draw out a full and just Scheme of the Doctrines he
will affirm, are absolutely necessary to be explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believed to make Men Christians, without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his Proof, that the Belief of every one of
them is absolutely necessary, and that there is not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57787:31"/>
one more absolutely necessary to be believed for
that purpose (for I doubt either his Collection or his
Proof will not immediately satisfy all Parties) I will
propose Two or Three Questions to be considered,
which I think not altogether impertinent to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
purpose. When a Man is convinced that Jesus
is the Christ, and that it is both his Duty and his
Interest to receive him for his Lord, to believe and
do whatsoever he shall attain to know he hath taught
and commanded, must he delay and forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him for his Lord, till he hath sought out, and
learned a certain Number of his Doctrines? If he
must not so delay, but immediately take him for his
Lord, and openly avow and prosess that he doth
believe Jesus to be the Messiah, and owns him for
his Lord, what Denomination belongs properly to
him, upon his making this Profession? The Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
which belonged to him formerly, does
not (I suppose) properly belong to him, now he hath
renounced publickly his former Masters, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
he is peremptorily resolved to cleave to and
follow Jesus Christ, without any Reservation. If
it shall be said, he must defer his Resigning up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Christ, till he hath learned a certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or (perhaps with equal Reason) all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
Christ hath taught, not only in the Gospels
and Acts, but in the Epistles too; I would humbly
ask, for what Reason must he so long defer the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of himself to Christ? I suppose, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath Assurance he shall live long enough to
do that, after he hath taken some or all of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
to task, and hath had them under his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
Must he first of all fit in Judgment upon
Christ's Doctrines, and see whether they are reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and fit, and convenient for him to assent to?
and that he shall act wisely and prudently to take
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57787:31"/>
the Author of them for his Lord? If so, how shall
it be made appear that such a Person receives him
for his Lord, as Christ orders? and consequently
that he is a Christian in the Gospel Sense? Is his
believing those Doctrines before he takes Christ for
his Lord, a believing them as a Christian should and
must believe them, purely for his sake, or because
he hath taught them? seeing he must first know
and believe them, before he adventure to receive
him for his Lord, and trust him with his Faith?
In this case his believing these Doctrines, seems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Reason of his taking Christ for his Lord,
than Christ's Authority the Reason of his believing
those Doctrines. Our blessed Saviour tells us plainly
with what Disposition we must receive him for our
Lord, so as if any thing he shall require us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
or obey, cannot be acknowledged or perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
without exposing us to the greatest temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
and Hazards, we must sustain and
encounter them, and deny our selves to the laying
down of our Lives, rather than relinquish our Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to him. But I do not find that he any where
requires we would go to work with his Doctrines,
and then, if we like them, come and submit to him,
and take him for our Lord. Besides, how Men
can be said to believe these Doctrines as taught by
him who is the Messiah, or Christ, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him to be the Christ, and have yielded up
themselves to him to believe what he hath taught,
is not very intelligible to me; nor how a Man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
any thing Christ hath taught, purely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath taught it, can make him Christ's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple:
It may discover that he is Christ's Disciple,
but it cannot constitute him Christ's Disciple.</p>

If this demand of a just Scheme of all the Articles
that are absolutely necessary to be believed to make
Men Christians (if more than are set down in <hi>the
Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. are absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary)
be not satisfied, prove what you please of
the necessity of believing more Articles, you get no
more by it, than to overthrow the Notion you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
without advancing one more useful; and you
leave People under an utter uncertainty, whether
they are, or ever shall be Christians, how many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
soever they do, or may explicitely believe;
and what Persons are to be admitted and owned for
Christians, yea, whether there were ever any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in the World, at least since the Apostles Days.
People may make what Noise they please with the
Word CHURCH, but this Notion, if stuck to,
will serve the <hi>Church,</hi> as those did her Lord, who
cloathed him in <hi>Purple,</hi> and cried <hi>Hail</hi> to him in
Derision. If a Hundred Articles are absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be explicitely believed to make Men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and you can name but Ninty Nine of them,
he that shall believe those Ninty Nine, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
know and believe the other one, will fall
as really short of being a Christian, as another who
believes but one of the whole Number. And if this
should be the Case of her, that's called the Church,
she is perfectly unchurch'd, and not one of her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
is a Christian, nor can ever obtain a just Title
to those Characters, till they have recovered that
one Article from which they have strayed. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easy, according to the Notions offered by them,
who oppose <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. to
prove that they are not Christians. But that which
I cannot comprehend is this, For what Reason
they take so much Pains to prevail with others to
believe, that they are not what they profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57787:32"/>
to be. For my part, I do hope, and will
believe they are Christians, in spite of all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to the contrary; unless I had as sure Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that they are not sincere in their Profession, as
they give of the Mistake of their Judgment in the
present Point.</p>
               <p>This Author certifies he will endeavour hereafter
to shew there are <q>Some Doctrines in the Epistles
distinct from those contained in the Gospels or
Acts, which are of that Nature, without the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of which, though we may grant Men might
be saved before they were known, yet when they
were divulged, they could no more be stiled true
Christians without the Belief of them, than if
they had not at all believed, <hi>p.</hi> 17.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> When our belief of a Doctrine is grounded
purely upon the Nature of the Doctrine, we believe
it only as we are rational Creatures, and do imploy
our Reason about the Doctrine it self, considering
it's Nature, and not as Christians, for the only
Ground of our Belief, as Christians, is Divine su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Revelation. And let the Nature of the
Doctrine be what it will, Revelation is the Ground
and Reason of our believing it. If you will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
produce Doctrines absolutely necessary to be
believed to make Men Christians, because of the
Nature of them, you must fetch them from Natural
Religion, and they are to be judged of as to their
Nature, and the Reason of our believing them, by
Natural Reason, without any regard to Revelation;
which is a Notion that will do Christianity, I doubt,
but little Service. Hitherto it hath done no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Hurt.</p>
               <p>The divulging of more Doctrines to be believed
by Christians, as they should attain the Knowledge
of them, did not make more Doctrines absolutely
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57787:33"/>
necessary to be believed to make Men Christians,
than were asolutely necessary to that purpose before
they were divulged: For if it did, every new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
when it was divulged, became a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
to be explicitely consented to, in order to
any Man's admission into the <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi>
and consequently there were so many <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</hi>
Yet these other Doctrines, when they were
divulged, were necessarily to be believed by those
particular Christians, who did understand and know
them, and so they are now; not to make them
Christians, but by Virtue or Reason of that Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they are under by being Christians, to believe
whatsoever they shall know their Lord hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Difference between those who were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
before these Doctrines were divulged, and
those who become Christians since, is this: They
were obliged by their being Christians, or believing
Jesus to be Messiah, to believe whatsoever he
had or should reveal, when they should know the
same, now his Revelation is compleated, those who
believe him heartily to be the Messiah, are thereby
obliged to believe whatsoever he hath Revealed, as
they attain the Knowledge thereof. For a more
clear and full understanding of these things, see

to consider an Objection, or rather an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion
of the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
&amp;c. since it intimates that he believes as
much of the Epistles, and in as true a Sense as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man whatsoever.</q> And then relating some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
in <hi>p.</hi> 299. of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi>
&amp;c. afterwards saith, They do not seem altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unexceptionable, <hi>p.</hi> 18. I shall observe that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57787:33"/>
the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. doth in <hi>p.</hi> 298.
begin his Answer to an Objection concerning the
Epistles, or to this Question: <hi>Whether the Truths de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the Epistles may be believed or disbelieved by a
Christian without any Danger?</hi> To which he answers,
<hi>That the Law of Faith being a Covenant of Free Grace,
God alone can appoint what shall be necessarily believed by
every one whom he will justify; what is the Faith which
he will accept, and account for Righteousness, depends
wholly on his good Pleasure. For it is of Grace and not
Right that this Faith is accepted; and therefore he alone
can set the Measures of it.</hi> Where we have the most
Rational Evidence for that Point, that (I think)
Words can express. Afterwards, in <hi>p.</hi> 299. he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
directly to the Question, affirming that <hi>the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parts of Divine Revelation, are Objects of Faith,
and are so to be received; they are Truths, whereof
none that is once known to be such, may or ought to be
disbelieved,</hi> &amp;c. Yet notwithstanding, he affirms
the Doctrines in the Epistles, are <hi>Divine Truths, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weighty to us now,</hi> and <hi>which no Christians who
know them, may disbelieve;</hi> This Author Saith, <hi>these
Passages are not altogether unexceptionable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For though these allow the Truths contained in
the Epistles, to be Objects of our Faith; yet they
do not suppose them, or any Parts of them, to be
more so, than any other Places of Scripture,
which have no Relation to the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and which we are only bound to believe
to be true, upon the Veracity of God that reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. <hi>p.</hi> 18.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi>
&amp;c. teacheth, That <hi>the Truths contained in the
Epistles, are Objects of our Faith;</hi> because they are
Divine Revelations, or <hi>Divine Truths.</hi> And this
Author, <hi>p.</hi> 11. teacheth, That <hi>the only End for which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57787:34"/>
God hath revealed any thing to us, is the Eternal Benefit
and Happiness of Mankind.</hi> The Author of the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness,</hi>
&amp;c. doth not detract from the Honour
due to any part of Divine Revelation: But asserts,
That as they are all equally Divine Revelations, so
they are all equally Objects of our Faith, when
known, and have all a Relation to the Salvation of
Mankind. But how this Author will reconcile his
teaching, That <hi>the only End for which God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing to us, is the Eternal Benefit and Happiness
of Mankind;</hi> with his saying, That <hi>some Places of
Scripture have no Relation to the Salvation of Mankind;</hi>
I cannot tell, without a very singular Account of
what is meant by Doctrines having a Relation to the
Salvation of Mankind. Some Doctrines acquaint
us with the Gracious Purpose of God towards Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and with the Ways and Methods how Jesus
Christ obtained Salvation for Mankind, which may
be said to have <hi>an Historical Relation</hi> to the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mankind. Some Doctrines are absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be explicitely believed to make and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
Men Christians, and entitle them to that
Salvation: Which Doctrines may be said to have <hi>a
Conditional Relation</hi> to our Salvation. There are
Doctrines which those who are Christians must
endeavour to understand, and explicitely believe, as
they attain to know them. Such are those which
belong to the First Head, and a great many more
delivered in the New Testament. These have not
an <hi>Immediate Relation</hi> to our Salvation: But they
may be said to have a <hi>Consequential,</hi> and <hi>Obediential
Relation</hi> to our Salvation. The Doctrines we are
now discoursing of, are those which pertain to the
Second Head. And if any Man think there are
Doctrines in the Epistles distinct from those laid
down by the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57787:34"/>
are absolutely necessary to be explicitely believed
to make Men Christians, and entitle them to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when he shall set down a List of them, and
produce his Proof that every one of them, is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be explicitely believed to make
Men Christians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Judgment may be made of
them: But till this is done, the distinction of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Truths, to be believed upon God's Veracity;</hi> and
<hi>Truths of a higher Nature,</hi> will be of little or no use
unto me.</p>
               <p>I shall here further observe, That 1. It is certain
the Doctrines which relate what Christ hath done,
and suffered, have not the same Relation to the
Salvation of Mankind, the Obedience and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Christ had. The Doctrine which instructs
us what was paid to obtain Salvation for Mankind,
is not the Price it self, with which that Salvation
was purchased.</p>
               <p>2. The Belief of these Doctrines hath no Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Salvation of Mankind: The most that
can be pretended with any Colour, is only that the
Belief of these Doctrines hath a Relation to the
Salvation of the Person who doth believe them, or
to whom they are delivered and made known.</p>
               <p>3. The Relation the Belief of these Doctrines
hath to his Salvation, who doth know and believe
them, is the very same, which the Belief of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doctrines delivered in the New Testament,
hath to his Salvation who doth know and believe
them; which consists in this, That it is an Act of
Submission and Obedience to Jesus, whom he
hath taken to be his Lord. Whatever those Matters
be, which notwithstanding they are revealed in the
New Testament, some are pleased to Term <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Matters,</hi> a sincere Christian is as much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to believe them, when he knows they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57787:35"/>
there, as he is to believe any other Matters
which are revealed there.</p>
               <p>For 4. The Reason of my believing any Doctrine
as I am a Christian, is, Divine Revelation, and
not the Nature of the Doctrine, that is, of the
Matter taught: And therefore my believing one
Doctrine, hath the same Relation to my Salvation,
that my believing another Doctrine Christ hath
taught, hath to my Salvation: they being equally
Acts of Obedience to Christ, and the Ground and
Reason of each Belief being the very same. Yet I
will acknowledge, that if our Belief of these
Doctrines (this Author hath a respect to) had the
same Relation to our partaking of Salvation, the
Obedience and Sufferings of Christ (which were
the real Price, and a proper purchasing of Salvation
for Mankind) had to the purchasing of Salvation
for Mankind, the Belief of them would be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to Salvation. But then I must add,
we should hereby as properly purchase our own
Salvation, as Jesus Christ did Salvation for Mankind,
which is a Notion I cannot easily be reconciled
to.</p>
               <p>5. If a Judgment is to be made from the Nature
of Doctrines, what Doctrines are absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed to make Men Christians, or to
Salvation, then this Necessity of believing them to
this Purpose, must be obvious to the Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Mankind; and every Man must judge for
himself (by considering the Nature of these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines)
which and how many are absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to Salvation: which is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that as it lays aside Christ's and his Apostles
Authority to determine the Matter; so it will not
do the Church any great Service, without pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that one certain Man, or a Number of Men, is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57787:35"/>
to make this Judgment from the Nature of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
Christ and his Apostles have taught, and all
others must rest satisfied with, and depend wholly
on his or their Determination. This indeed may
have a Tendency to raise humane Authority to a
great height, in the most important Business of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but then it will be no Advantage to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Doctrines: for hereby People will be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to take them for Doctrines absolutely necessary
to be believed, not from their perceiving that such
a necessity arises from their Nature, but from bare
humane Authority. Nor can they be certain that
he or those who have judged them to be absolutely
necessary to be believed to Salvation, have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in their Judgment, by the Nature of their
Doctrines, and not by their own arbitrary Pleasure,
till they have resolved the Matter themselves, by
exercising their own Reason about the Nature of
the particular Doctrines, which shall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to, rather imposed on them.</p>
               <p>It plainly appears by what the Author of <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. hath writ, that though
he doth not think the Epistles the most proper parts
of the New Testament to be consulted, in order to
our discerning which be the Doctrines Christ and
his Apostles did require to be believed as absolutely
necessary to make Men Christians, or to Salvation,
yet that he thinks the Doctrines contained in the
Epistles, are Fundamental Articles, to be actually
believed by Christians now, as they obtain the
Knowledge of them. And that they are to make
such use of them, as they shall understand they
ought to make of them, either by considering their
Nature, or what they find the Scripture doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
concerning the same. <hi>See Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p. 300. Second Vindic.</hi> of it, <hi>p.</hi> 201.
and 319.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57787:36"/>
                  <p>But, saith this Author, These Doctrines which
have a Relation to the Salvation of Mankind, are
to be believed upon another Ground, besides that
of mere Revelation. <hi>p.</hi> 19.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Upon what Ground are they to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
besides the Veracity of God who revealed
them? Is that Ground better or worse? doth it lay
a greater or less Obligation on People to believe
them, than Divine Revelation does? I expect not
to meet with a better Reason, why I am to believe
any of Christ's Doctrines, than this, that he taught
them. Those who will not acquiesce here, may
wander where they please for Satisfaction, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they will not go about to compel others to rove
with them. Moreover, are not those places of
Scripture, where these Doctrines lie, Historical?
declaring the Way and Method how Jesus obtained
Salvation for Mankind. And is there any way for
People to know, that what is declared in those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
had a Relation to the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
but Revelation? It had no natural Relation to
the Salvation of Mankind. How is it possible then
to know from its Nature, that it was graciously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to have a Relation to that End? We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know any thing more from the Nature of a
thing, than the Nature of the thing is fitted to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.
If it be said, that the Discourse is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Nature of the Thing treated of in the
Doctrine, but concerning the Nature of the Doctrine
it self. I answer, we can learn no more from the
Nature of the Doctrine than the Doctrine doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver:
Therefore if the Doctrine do not declare
that the Belief of it is absolutely necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we cannot learn any such thing from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Doctrine, because the Nature of the
Doctrine doth not deliver any such thing. Besides,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57787:36"/>
the Doctrine it self being a Divine Revelation, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation is the only Reason and Ground of
our believing it: And the Nature of that Doctrine
consist in this, that it is a Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p>In the next Place, this Author considers the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of our Saviour intrusted in his Apostles
which is exprest in their Commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19,
20, 21. Which Commission as it invests them with
as full a Power of teaching whatsoever was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation, so it lays as great a Necessity
upon others of believing them, as if Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had taught in his own Person. <hi>p.</hi> 19, 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Very true: But all that Jesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
did teach, was not, nor is not absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be explicitely believed, to make Men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
or to Salvation; only so much of it as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be believed, as absolutely necessary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
And the same is to be said as to the Apostles.
Our Saviour intrusted his Apostles with Authority
to <hi>Disciple</hi> People to him, and upon their avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him for their Lord, to Baptize and externally
admit them into his Church, and then to teach
them the other Doctrines he had authorized
them to divulge, as the Laws of his Kingdom, and
Matters they were to learn, and having learned,
must necessarily believe. But he did not intrust
them with an Authority to make <hi>a New-Covenant</hi>
with People, and to require the Belief of more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
as absolutely necessary to make them Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
or to Salvation, than he himself had required
as absolutely necessary to be believed for that purpose.
The Epistles are part of that Revelation Christ hath
given to be the Rule of all Christians Faith. But no
other Doctrines are absolutely necessary to be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
believed to make Men Christians, or to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
than those, on the believing and owning of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57787:37"/>
which, Christ and his Apostles did admit those Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,
to whom they preached, into the Church
and Kingdom of Christ; if our Saviour himself did
understand the Covenant of Grace, and the Terms
on which People were to be admitted into it; or if
the Apostles did understand their Commission.
For they neither required the explicite Belief of
those Distinct Doctrines they have delivered in their
Epistles, as absolutely necessary to make Men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
in their Preaching to Unbelievers; if we
may credit the Relation given of the Method and
Tenour of their Ministry, in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
Nor do they in their Epistles any where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the explicite Belief of these Doctrines as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to be explicitely believed to make
Men Christians. They have in their Epistles deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
many Doctrines which Believers or Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are to be pressed to endeavour to understand,
and explicitely believe on hazard of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which (I conceive) they had pressed on those
who were converted, before they writ their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
as well as they did then, and afterwards. But
they do not any where in their Epistles teach that
these Doctrines are absolutely necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
explicitely to make Men Christians, or to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
See <hi>Second Vindic. of the Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 76, 83, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 23. this Author saith something concerning
the Covenant of the Gospel, but gives not a clear
and distinct Account (in my Judgment) of that
Covenant, and the Conditions thereby made abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary for our obtaining Happiness, though
he truly saith, <hi>This is fully done in the Covenant of the
Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57787:37"/>
The Covenant of the Gospel, in short, (I think)
is this: That all those shall have Eternal Life, who
do so heartily believe Jesus to be the Messiah, or
Christ, as to receive him for their Lord, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Purpose and Resolution to be absolutely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by him, so far as they shall obtain the
Knowledge of his Pleasure, let what Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
Difficulties, or Hardships soever happen to be
in their way, and that they will seriously apply
themselves to know his Pleasure. Eternal Life is
the Benefit or Blessing here Promised by Christ.
The Condition he appoints to be complied with,
or performed on our Part, in order to our being
entitled to receive that Benefit from him, is not an
explicite believing a certain Number of particular
Doctrines, he, or his Apostles should teach, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a believing him to be the Messiah, or Christ,
so as to take him absolutely for our Lord and
King.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And as the Conditions are necessary to be
known (saith this Author) before we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them (which is very true, and undeniably
certain,) so God has taken sufficient care to give
us a full Revelation of them; first in a large Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Method that Christ made use of, for
the purchasing of our Redemption, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
which he wrought for the Confirmation of
his Mission and Doctrine. <hi>p.</hi> 23.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. God has given us a large History of
the Method Christ took by his Order, to purchase
our Redemption, that is, to purchase to himself a
Right to publish the aforesaid Covenant, and to
perform what is there promised, to them who shall
comply with, and perform the Conditions there
expressed. But neither the Method, nor the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
believing of it, is made the Condition on our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57787:38"/>
part, of the Covenant. The actual observing of
that Method, was Christ's part, in order to his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
or purchasing to himself the Right before
mentioned. And seeing he hath revealed that he
did take this Method for this End, it is an Article,
<hi>a Fundamental Article,</hi> to be believed by every one
who hath received him for his Lord, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
entred into Covenant with him, or with God
through him, when he knows that he hath revealed
it. 2. The History of the Miracles Christ wrought,
is a mighty, proper, and powerful Inducement to
us, to believe that he is the Messiah, and a very
good Introduction to our taking him for our
Lord.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> In a more full and clear Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation,
by the coming of the Holy Ghost, of
all those things, which were required of us to be
believed.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Holy Ghost was sent, or poured forth
on the Apostles, to inable them to work Miracles
to prove their Mission by, or from Christ, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the same gracious Declaration Jesus Christ had
made before, and to admit those who should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Jesus for their Lord, into his Kingdom, upon
their professing the same, and acknowledge them
for his Subjects, and to instruct and teach them,
and leave to the Church, a particular, compleat Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and Body of all the Laws of Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which must be studied, believed and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his Subjects, as long as they live. These are
not the Conditions which are absolutely necessary
to be explicitely believed, or consented to, to make
Men Christians, but they are the Laws of Christ's
Kingdom, which those who receive him for their
Lord and King, are to endeavour to learn, and as
they attain to know them, explicitely believe and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57787:38"/>
observe; which is a good, and full Employment for
them, as long as they live, after they are Christians,
let their Lives be lengthened to ever so great an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
But the Holy Ghost was not given to the
Apostles, to empower them to make a <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
with People, by making more Articles abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be believed to Make Men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
than Christ himself had made so; though
they were to produce more Proof and Evidence of
what he had made absolutely necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
than was given before; and were to furnish
Christians with a more compleat Body of the Laws
of that Kingdom they were Members of, than was
before published. See <hi>Second Vindic. of the Reasonab.
p.</hi> 89, 90, 325, 330. It may therefore with great
Truth, and I think, for that Reason, without any
absurdity be affirmed, that all things which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to be explicitely believed to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
are fully and clearly contained in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels.
See <hi>Second Vindic. of the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 73.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 30. This Author discourses concerning the
Apostles Creed; and saith, That The Articles of
that Creed are not to be looked on as the only
Fundamentals, unless we also firmly believe the
natural Consequences and Conclusions from them,
and the frequent Explanations of them which are
set down in the other Parts of Revelation. That
is, those Explanations of them which are set in the
Epistles distinct from what is said of them in the
Gospels and Acts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I will wave taking Notice of several things
which might be observed here, from the Generality
and Extensiveness of the Expressions here used:
And shall only put this Author in mind, that the
Question he should peremptorily answer to, is this;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57787:39"/>
Whether all that is absolutely necessary to be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
believed by Christ's and his Apostles Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to make Men Christians, be contained in
that Creed? If those who answer this Question
Negatively, be in the Right, let them talk what
they please of the great Esteem and Veneration
they have for <hi>this Creed,</hi> and <hi>the Church of England,</hi>
there is no help for it, but both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must unavoidably fall under a very ugly Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
for the more full clearing of which, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to what this Author hath further writ on this
Subject, I shall refer to the <hi>Second Vindic. of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonab.
p.</hi> 74, &amp;c. 77, 163, 169, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 31, and 32. This Author offers considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in answer to a Passage he quotes out of <hi>p.</hi> 297.
of <hi>the Reasonab. of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. I shall here only
observe, <hi>First,</hi> That these Considerations are
grounded upon Two great Mistakes: 1. A Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
that the Force of the Argument he opposeth,
depends upon the time when the Gospels and Acts,
and when the Epistles were writ; <hi>viz.</hi> which were
writ first. Whereas the Force of the Argument
lies in this: That those Truths delivered in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
cannot be absolutely necessary to be explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believed to make Men Christians, which were
not revealed till after the Decease of many who
were Christians. By the Epistles we understand
what Doctrines the Apostles were intrusted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
Christians in; but supposing the Acts, and
every one of the Gospels had been writ after all the
Epistles, they acquaint us most clearly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what were the Doctrines which Christ and his
Apostles proposed as absolutely necessary to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
believed by Unbelievers to make them
Christians. 2. A Supposition that the Author of
<hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. rejects the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57787:39"/>
from being part of that Rule of Faith, that
Christ hath given to Christians; for which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perceive the least Ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> that this Passage this Author pretends to
answer, hath the full Evidence of Demonstration,
with respect to the Words immediately before it.
Having declared that the Authors of the Epistles
were inspired from above, and writ nothing but
Truth, and in most Places very weighty Truths to
us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He adds, <hi>But yet every Sentence of theirs
must not be taken up and looked on as a Fundamental
Article necessary to Salvation, without an explicite Belief
whereof, no Body could be a Member of Christ's Church
here, nor be admitted into his Eternal Kingdom hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
Where we see what he means by Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Articles, in the very next Sentence, which is the
Passage reflected on by this Author, and delivered
in these Words; <hi>If all, or most of the Truths declared
in the Epistles were to be received and believed as Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles, what then became of those Christians
who were fallen asleep (as St.</hi> Paul <hi>witnesses in his First
to the Corinthians, many were) before these things in the
Epistles were revealed to them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this Passage in</hi> the Reasonableness of Christianity,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 294. The Epistles being all written to those who
were Believers and Christians, the Occasion and End of
writing them, could not be to instruct them in that which
was necessary to make them Christians. <hi>This Author
replies in these Words:</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>This seems rather to strengthen than lessen the
Force of the Argument, That the Apostles had
taught those same Doctrines for Fundamentals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which they afterwards communicated as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Depositums of their Faith, <hi>p.</hi> 33.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57787:40"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Supposing they had taught the very same
Doctrines before, to the Christians or Churches
they afterwards writ to, and so they were Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
to those Christians who had been instructed
in them; yet there is no force in the Argument
that these Doctrines are absolutely necessary to be
explicitely believed to make Men Christians; or
were so to them, till it be proved, that they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
these Doctrines to be explicitely believed
to make them Christians.</p>
               <p>In answer to another Passage quoted out of the
same Page of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.
this Author propounds this Question; <q>How can
it be proved, that all those the Epistles were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to, understood all the Fundamentals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Question is, whether they were
Christians, though they did not understand all those
Doctrines you call Fundamentals here? If they
were Christians, then those you call Fundamentals,
were not absolutely necessary to be explicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make them Christians. If any shall say,
they were not Christians, to whom the Apostles
writ their Epistles, they may, if they please, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
my want of Complaisance, in declaring I shall
chuse to believe the Apostles rather than them.</p>
               <p>Again, saith this Author, <q>May there not be
supposed to be some less knowing amongst them?</q>
               </p>
               <p>In answer to which, I ask, Were those less know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Persons, Christians? if not, how came they to
be concerned in the Epistle? or how came they to
be Members of the Church to which the Epistle
was writ? The latter part of the Question, <q>And
some who would not throughly believe several
Doctrines of Christianity, without such an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57787:40"/>
the Apostles had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> seems not to bear a
propitious Aspect to what this Author formerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
as <hi>the way to distinguish Fundamental Truths
from other Parts of Divine Revelation.</hi> What this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
further saith on this Subject, is no more than
what I think is sufficiently answered in my Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
<hi>p.</hi> 26, 27. But I do not perceive how it
will follow from what this Author hath said, that
it cannot be better discerned by consulting the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
and Acts, what are the Articles Christ and
his Apostles propounded as absolutely necessary to
be explicitely believed to make Men Christians,
than the Epistles: And if that do not follow from
his Discourse, nothing follows from it, that is to the
purpose against <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.
Nor will it follow <q>The Apostles were unfaithful
to their Trust, or that they clog Mens Faith with
unnecessary Points of Belief, because they have
taught several Doctrines which are not absolutely
necessary to be explicitely believed to make Men
Christians, but which Christians must labour to
understand, and which will then be necessary to
be explicitely believed by them.</q> The Apostles
Fidelity to their Trust, is not to be judged of by
Mens prejudicated Fancies, and therefore Persons
had need take heed of determining that <q>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
ought certainly to be blamed for Writing
such Doctrines in their Epistles, as are not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be explicitely believed to make
Men Christians.</q> It is no Argument of an <hi>unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Christian,</hi> but the Duty of a good Christian, <hi>to
embrace the Doctrines delivered in the Epistles,</hi> when he
knows them, and that they are delivered there, <hi>as
firmly as any other Doctrines whatsoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:57787:41"/>
                  <p>But (saith this Author) if it can be proved that
the great and principal End of the Writing of
their Epistles, was to deliver several Doctrines
that should be necessarily believed to Salvation by
all who were converted to the Faith, we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged
to believe them as such, <hi>p.</hi> 35.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Very true: But then 1. If what you sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
here, was the great and principal End of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Epistles, the Cause is clearly given up to
the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.
For then the great and principal End of the writing
of their Epistles, was not to deliver several Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
absolutely necessary to be explicitely believed
to make Men Christians, or Converts to the Faith.
2. It will not be easy to prove that all that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
must necessarily explicitely believe every Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
delivered in the Epistles, though the Doctrines
are necessarily to be believed by all Christians who
do understand them. This Author then proceeds to
prove, what he hath declared, to be the great and
principal End of writing the Epistles, was really
so, by producing many Places out of them: All
which I may pass over without any Observation,
because it is not pretended that they prove any thing
more, than that that those who are Christians must
necessarily believe them. But because this Author
sometimes infers, That <hi>the explicite Belief of them is
absolutely necessary to Salvation;</hi> I will briefly intimate
what I conceive to be the proper import of those
Places of Scripture he quotes: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. speaks
not barely of Christians, but Persons who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(at least) to be inspired. But take it of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
all who did know what he had writ, or that
he had writ things, were to believe explicitely or
implicitely, that the things he writ were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God, because they knew he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57787:41"/>
full Proof of his Apostleship; and in the same
manner are Christians now to acknowledge the
same. 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 1. &amp;c.</hi> Is a very plain Account
how he had preached to them, that Jesus was the
Messiah, and what sorts of Proofs he had propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for their Conviction, and that they had belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this Gospel, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s also that this was the Faith by
which they were saved and made Christians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the believing of which, whatever else they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
would not avail them to Salvation. <hi>Vid. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Vindic. of the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>p.</hi> 269. The Apostle in his Third Chapter of this
Epistle had declared, that Jesus Christ is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
without borrowing other Articles to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop
it, (some proof of which he here minds them
of) and that all the other Articles of the Christian
Religion, are Superstructures erected on that
Foundation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. hath been formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
<hi>Vid. Second Vindic. of the Reasonab.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi>
303, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. Is a Motive to <hi>Timothy</hi> to
take care to behave himself in the Church of God,
as he ought. 1 <hi>Th.</hi> 4. 1. Is a Direction to Christians
to take heed of entertaining the Doctrines which
false Teachers would obtrude on them; certifying
they might justly conclude those to be false Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who did deny Jesus Christ to be real Man.
The 14th and 15th Verses are express, that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Jesus to be the Son of God, or the Messiah,
doth make a Man a Christian. Whether believing
him to be the Son of God, be a distinct Act here
from the believing him to be the Messiah, may be
considered when we come to the place where it is
to be shewed. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. Doth not, considered
strictly, declare any thing more than that they did
know and own the Truth of what he had writ in
the former Verse concerning his Conversation.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57787:42"/>
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 15. shews that Believers or Christians
must take care to hold fast whatever Doctrines they
have been instructed in, and fully assured are
Christ's Doctrines. Not one of these Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
considered by it self, nor all of them consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, do prove that the Apostles enjoyned
the explicite Belief of all that they writ in their
Epistles as absolutely necessary to Salvation. These
and innumerable other Places of Scripture, are of
great use to those who are of the same Judgment
with the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi>
&amp;c. to shew them that are Christians, that they
ought to set a very great value on the Writings of
the Apostles, that they ought to be very diligent
in endeavouring to acquire as distinct a Knowledge
as they can, of the Doctrines they have delivered in
their Epistles, that they ought to take great care to
retain and hold fast what Doctrines they have
learned from their Writings, and that they must not
entertain any Doctrines for Articles of their Faith,
but what Christ and his Apostles have taught.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And (saith this Author)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would be absurd to
imagin that the Apostles should fill their Writings
with any of the Doctrines of Christianity, if they
did not impose a necessity upon Men of believing
them, <hi>p.</hi> 37.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> True, if Christians when they know they
have writ them, should be at liberty not to believe
them. But would it be absurd to imagine they
should fill their Epistles to Believers or Christians,
with Doctrines of Christianity, if they did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an absolute necessity on Unbelievers to believe
them all explicitely to make them Christians? Is
every particular Doctrine that is to be be believed,
to be explicitely known and believed by Unbelievers
to make them Christians? so that when once they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57787:42"/>
are Christians, there is nothing more for them to
endeavour to know and believe?</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And here (adds this Author) it is not material
whether the Epistles were written to those who
were already Christians, and whether designed
to teach them any Doctrines, to instruct them in
what was necessary to make them Believers; but
it is sufficient that they could not continue true
Christians or Believers, without acknowledging
the Doctrines there delivered for fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith, and necessary to be believed by all
Christians.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I am not certain that I comprehend what
this Author means by <hi>Material</hi> here, and in some
other Places. But I think the Apostles would have
thought it very impertinent for them to attempt,
and utterly impossible to teach those who were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
any Doctrines they were ignorant of, which
were absolutely necessary to be explicitely believed
to make them Christians, or Believers. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Sense which I put on the Word <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi>
on such occasions as this, I conceive it very
material, whether the Persons the Epistles were
writ to, were Christians, before they did explicitly
know and believe the Doctrines the Epistles were
designed to instruct them in, for if they were, the
explicite Belief of those Doctrines, could not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to make them Christians. How
Christians were under a necessity of believing them,
when they understood them, hath been formerly
shewed. But they might continue good Christians
without acknowledging they were necessary to be
believed by all Christians. It was sufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that all Christians ought to endeavour
to know them, and that they are necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57787:43"/>
by all Christians, when they understand
them to be Doctrines taught by the Apostles.</p>
               <p>To what this Author hath further writ in this
Page, I will only say these Two things; 1. That
those to whom the Apostles writ their Epistles, did
profess to believe all that was absolutely necessary
to be believed to make Men Christians, otherwise
they would not have writ to them under the Name
of Christians. 2. That there are very few, if any
Christians, who have a perfect Knowledge of all
the Articles of Faith delivered in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and yet other People may be very good
Christians, and take the Epistles for a part of the
Rule of their, and other Christians Faith.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 38. This Author appears not willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<q>That the Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians, Galatians,
Thessalonians</hi> and <hi>Philippians,</hi> were writ upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Occasions, because they were designed for
whole Provinces, and obliged a great Number e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with those Churches they were sent to.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That which made the Epistles oblige Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
who were out of the Provinces, made them
oblige all the Christians in the Provinces; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
passing over Metropolitical Controversies, I
will take Notice of these few things: 1. All the
Epistles were designed for the use of the whole
Church of God, in that and all succeeding Ages;
yet they might be writ upon particular Occasions,
and for that Reason be directed immediately to
those particular Churches or Persons, who were
more especially concerned in those parts of them,
which have a respect to the particular Occasions of
their being written. 2. It will be very hard to give
a rational and satisfactory Account of many Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians, &amp;c.</hi> if there
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57787:43"/>
was no particular occasion of writing them to
those Churches. Some may be apt to suspect
they have Ground to think the Apostles were
not well advised (which is a Jealousy, those
who believe they were inspired, should not be
forward to suggest) in writing several things
which are to be found in these Epistles, if there
was no particular Occasion of writing them to
those Churches to which they were sent, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
addressed. 3. That which makes the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
oblige all Christians, is this, that they are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelations; and therefore all who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
they were writ by inspired Persons, and are
of Divine Authority, must be obliged by them:
for their being writ on particular Occasions does not
lessen or impair their Authority. 4. What is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
limited in these Epistles to the particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
on which they were writ, did not then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
any directly and immediately, whose Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
were not the same, and they will oblige all
whose Occasions are the same, to the End of the
World.</p>
               <p>This Author further takes notice, That <q>The
First Epistle of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> is directed to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 39.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> From that, I think we may rationally ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
that it can directly concern none but those
who are Christians; and that its main design could
not be to instruct them in the Doctrines absolutely
necessary to be believed by them, in order to their
becoming Christians.</p>
               <p>This Author in <hi>p.</hi> 44. doth acknowledge, That
<q>The general Design of the Epistles was to settle
and strengthen Men in the Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:57787:44"/>
And if so, must they not be in the Faith, that is,
Christians, before they could be setled and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Faith? And is not the Design of
them the same still? <hi>viz.</hi> not to teach Articles ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to be explicitely believed to make
Men Christians, but to settle and strengthen those
who are Christians, in the Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But (saith this Author) it cannot be denied
that the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth contain some
Doctrines absolutely necessary to be believed to
Salvation by all Christians, if this may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the same Faith was required after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
both from Jew and Gentile, <hi>p.</hi> 39.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is wholly foreign to the present Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
For the Enquiry is not about what is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or may
be necessary for Christians, or Persons after they
are converted, to believe? But what Doctrines are
absolutely necessary to be explicitely believed to
make Men Christians? Yet because this Author
frequently speaks of some Doctrines being <hi>absolutely
necessary</hi> to be believed to Salvation, by all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
some of which Doctrines are not to be found
any where but in the Epistles; I will propose Two
or Three short Questions to be considered by the
Reader: 1. Must every Christian explicitely believe
these Doctrines? 2. Can any Christian explicitely
believe a Doctrine he knows nothing of? 3. If he
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ust know the Doctrines proposed to be believed,
and must know that Jesus Christ hath taught them,
before he can be obliged to believe them; how can
any Doctrine be absolutely necessary to be believed
by Christians to Salvation, when there are Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
necessary to his being obliged to believe them?
There are Doctrines absolutely necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make Men Christians, because without
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57787:44"/>
believing them they cannot be Christians. But there
cannot be any other Doctrines absolutely necessary
to be believed by one who is a Christian; for by
being a Christian, he is obliged not to believe any
Doctrine, but upon certain Conditions. He must
explicitely know the Doctrine, before he believes it,
and he must know that it is a Doctrine which Jesus,
whom he hath taken for his Lord hath taught. A
Christian is not to believe Doctrines at all adventure,
nor upon every ones Word, who has a mind to
thrust Doctrines upon him. His believing a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
must be an intelligent, rational Act of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and Obedience to his Lord. All the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
any Christians (whether before Jews or
Gentiles) can be obliged to believe, are laid down
in the New Testament. They are not limited to
one particular part of those Sacred Writings. And
all Christians must endeavour to know as many of
them as they can, and then believe them. But
there is not a precise Number of Doctrines set down
in any one Part of Scripture, as absolutely necessary
to be believed by any Christian, or beyond which
a Christian is not to endeavour to extend his
Belief.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 47. This Author by way of Reply to what
he hath quoted out of the <hi>First Vindication of the
Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 14. where that
Author declares the Reason why he did not go
through the Epistles to collect the Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> propounds certain Questions,
whereof the principal is this: <q>But how are these
Fundamental Points to be found in the Gospels
and Acts, better than in the Epistles?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though I think a very solid, strong, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
and invincible Answer is given to this and the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57787:45"/>
other Questions, in those very Lines this Author
hath quoted out of the <hi>First Vindic.</hi> from which he
hath taken occasion to propose these Questions;
yet because the same Author hath expressed himself
more largely concerning this Matter, in his <hi>Second
Vindication of the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. I
shall refer the Reader to <hi>p.</hi> 141, 142. of that Book,
where I think he may find as compleat Satisfaction
to these Queries, as can reasonably be desired. But
since this Author doth here, as well as in several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, speak of Truths revealed, or delivered,
or taught in the New Testament, <q>Which he saith,
have no respect to Man's Salvation, and which
are things indifferent;</q> I shall take leave to ask a
few Questions. For what End were those Truths
taught in the New Testament, which have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to Man's Salvation? Which be those Truths
Christ hath taught, which have no respect to those
Peoples Salvation, who do believe them purely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they know he-hath taught them? Is it indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
whether Christians believe, or do not believe
any thing which they know Jesus Christ hath
taught? Are they to govern themselves in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to, and believing of what Christ hath
taught, by the Apprehensions they, or other Men
shall be pleased to cherish, of the Respect or no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
his Doctrines have to Man's Salvation? Will
not such a Notion, if it take place, make shrewd
Work when dexterously managed, both with the
Truths which are taught, and the Rules of Practice
which are laid down in the New Testament? As
for those Truths which have a nearer, or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Connexion with what is absolutely necessary
to be explicitely believed to make Men Christians,
the Reader may advance himself much, both in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57787:45"/>
Knowledge and Piety, by an attentive serious peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
what the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi>
&amp;c. hath writ concerning the same, in his
<hi>Second Vindic. of the Reasonab.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 74, 75.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Terms of Salvation (saith this Author) are
as plainly and clearly set down in the Epistles, as
in the Gospels, <hi>p.</hi> 47.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Those Doctrines which are absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to Salvation, may be as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and clearly set down in the Epistles, as in the
Gospels, and yet not be as clearly distinguished in
the former, as in the latter, from other Doctrines,
which are not absolutely necessary to be explicitely
believed to Salvation.</p>
               <p>This Author hath (I think) in his 50th Page,
overturned all that he hath writ against <hi>the Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. in this First part of his
Book; especially if he will allow that the Persons he
speaks of, before he comes to the middle of that
Page, were Christians, before they explicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
every particular Truth they were taught, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Lives. For if they were, the Question
will not be, how many Articles they did believe in
all? But what those Articles were, the Belief of
which, made them Christians? If they were not
Christians, till they did explicitely believe the very
last Articles which were taught them during their
Lives, their Belief of those Articles, joyn'd to those
they had learned before (whatever they were)
made them Christians: And if they did not every
one happen to learn and believe the very same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
in the last place, or one that made each Man's
Faith exactly the same, the explicite Belief of one
Article made one Man a Christian, and the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Belief of another Article made another Man a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57787:46"/>
Christian, which is utterly impossible. For no Man
can be a Christian, without that which is absolutely
necessary to make a Man a Christian.</p>
               <p>Could I meet with a Passage in <hi>the Reasonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. which I could justly think to
have a Tendency to impair the Divine Authority
of the Epistles, or lessen Peoples Esteem for them,
I hope I should as heartily dislike it, and be as ready
to caution People against it, as another Person,
notwithstanding I make so great account of the
Book it self. And though I have writ so many
Pages, in order to the clearing some Mistakes (as I
conceive) in this First part part of the <hi>Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
on <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. yet I
fully concur with the worthy Author of them, in
what I apprehend was his principal Design. There
are many very excellent and useful things in this
part of his Book. He writes very well, and like a
very good Man; and had not his misapprehending
<hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. led him out of
his way, and somewhat bewildred him, his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
(according to my Judgment) would have
been without a Blemish; unless his using sometimes,
a greater Latitude in his Expressions, than is rigidly
justifiable, may be reckoned one, notwithstanding
it is but a keeping Pace with the most Applauded
and Learned Writers.</p>
               <p>Our enjoying the Epistles as well as the Gospels,
and Acts, is a Mercy for which we can never be
sufficiently thankful. May we all set a just Value
on them, read them attentively, study them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
and make that Improvement we ought, of
our being favoured with so inestimable a Blessing;
then we shall reap singular Benefit from them, and
one End aimed at in <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi>
&amp;c. will be greatly advanced.</p>

               <head>Observations on the Reason of
Christ's coming into the World.</head>
               <p>THE Title this Author hath given to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part of his Animadversions is, <hi>Of the
Reason of Christ's coming into the World.</hi> I will pass
over this Part very briefly, because this Author
seems to find fault with some Passages in <hi>the Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. on purpose to take Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to discourse of Christ's Satisfaction; whereas
the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. hath laid down
very good Reasons (I think) why he did not think
it proper, for him to insist on that point, in his
Book.</p>
               <p>I do not find that the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi>
&amp;c. hath declared it was his Design to discourse
of the Reason of Christ's coming into the World,
in the Pages this Author hath chosen to Animadvert
on, in this part of his Book. The true Reason of
Christ's coming into the World (I think) was the
Father's Appointment. A very true and excellent
Account is given in <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. of the
great End for which Christ came into the World,
though not in the Pages to which this Author doth
here confine himself. In these Pages, the Author
of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. takes notice of the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ's coming into the World, and of
<hi>what Men are restored to by Iesus Christ.</hi> These Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
may perhaps be properly enough called colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral,
or concomitant Ends of his coming into the
World, because particularly intended; but they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57787:47"/>
comprehend not the whole End of his coming into
the World. It is agreed on both sides, that <hi>Bliss
and Immortality were lost by</hi> Adam<hi>'s Fall:</hi> Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. saith, is
restored by Christ to all Men, but Eternal Bliss is
not restored by Christ absolutely to any Man. (I
meddle not with the Case of those who dy in their
Infancy) and what is absolutely necessary in order
to any Man's obtaining by Christ, a claim of Right
to Eternal Bliss, is the Subject of a great part of <hi>the
Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Obedience, and Sufferings of Christ, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
I conceive, be properly called the Reason of
his coming into the World, nor the End thereof,
any otherwise than a Means is called a Subordinate
End. But though I said Christ's restoring Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
to Man, was agreed on both sides, yet this
Author seems to be dissatisfied with the Account
the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. hath given of
it, and if I apprehend him aright, because he doth
not include Bliss, in his Notion of Immortality.</p>
               <p>Now this I think is the Truth of the Case, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
as lost by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Transgression, is resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to all Men by Christ, in that he will raise them
all from Death. And he hath purchased Eternal
Bliss for them, on the Terms the Author of <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness,</hi>
&amp;c. hath given a large and full Account
of from the Testimony of Christ and his Apostles.
That is, that all who heartily take Jesus for their
Lord, and Faithfully obey and follow him, shall
at the Resurrection be everlastingly blessed. The
great and famous <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who was never reputed
an Enemy (that I know of) to Christ's Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath more than once declared it was his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that Christ came into the World to purchase
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57787:47"/>
Immortality for Mankind. I have not his Works
by me, and therefore can neither relate his Words,
nor refer particularly to the Places, but I think I
may depend upon it, that my Memory doth not
fail me, as to his Notion. But without laying any
stress upon his Authority, I ask what can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for Mens being Immortal, any other way
than by Christ, by those who acknowledge that Sin
hath brought Death upon all Men? If the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
be the Fruit of Christ's Undertaking, and
Performance, how could it have been possible for
guilty Man to suffer, after he was dead, if Christ
had not come? The Discourse is concerning Men,
not concerning separate Spirits.</p>
               <p>This Author, <hi>p.</hi> 57. makes the Reasons of Christ's
coming into the world, and the End of his coming
to be the same, and saith, <q>It was to make Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for the Sins of the whole World, and to
restore Mankind to the Favour of God by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our stead, and being made Sin for us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Satisfaction it self, was not the ultimate End of
his coming into the World. His Sufferings and
Death were parts of the way and means, by which
he was to obtain what was the End of his coming
into the World. His Death, and his Resurrection
too, had a Relation to a further End, <hi>viz.</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Lord both of the Dead and Living, Rom.</hi> 14. 9.
In his Sufferings and dying, he had an Eye and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to what was the great End of his Undertaking
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. that his Death had a Relation to this,
is most evident from <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, to the 12th. He
hath purchased Immortality for Mankind absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But he hath not purchased Pardon and Bliss for
Men absolutely, but upon certain Conditions, <hi>viz.</hi>
their believing in the True God, and in him as sent
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57787:48"/>
by him; so as to take him unfeignedly for their
Lord and King. So that the true End of Christ's
coming into the World, was to obtain to himself a
Kingdom, or to be a King, and to have a Right to
dispence and confer Pardon and Eternal Blessedness
on those who should become his sincere Subjects;
which I think is as plain as can be, if we will take
his own Word for a Proof of it. <hi>Pilate therefore
said unto him, art thou a King then? Iesus answered,
thou sayest that I am a King; to this End was I born,
and for this Cause came I into the World, that I should
bear Witness unto the Truth, every one that is of the
Truth heareth my Voice.</hi> Th. 18. 37.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 60. This Author hath these Words concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ's satisfying for our Sins: <q>We do not
mean that Christ suffered the same Punishment,
which we should have done, but only that the
Dignity of his Person made his Sufferings equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to the Eternal Punishment of a whole World
of Sinners.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ's Satisfaction is a very great and
weighty Point: But either I, or many who have
writ concerning it, are under some Mistakes, with
Reference to it. I conceive Christ did not satisfy
the Law for Sinners, which they had broken: For
had he suffered the same Punishment which they
should have suffered, that would not have satisfied
it, because it required <hi>Personal Punishment alone,</hi> and
did not run, that the Offender or another should
suffer it. And <hi>Equivalent Sufferings</hi> could not satisfy
it, because there was no such <hi>Proviso</hi> in the Law.
Christ's Satisfaction, I conceive, did not consist in
his Sufferings being <hi>equivalent</hi> to the Eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a whole World of Sinners, by reason of
the <hi>Dignity of his Person:</hi> For if the Dignity of his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57787:48"/>
Person made his Sufferings equivalent to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Punishment of a whole World of Sinners, the
<hi>Degrees</hi> of his Sufferings could not signify any thing
to his making <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> the Dignity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was the same, whether his Sufferings were
greater or less, and could confer the same Vertue to
one, as to many Degrees. The laying the whole
Stress of Christ's Satisfaction on the Dignity of his
Person, I suppose was that, from whence some took
occasion to vent, that ungrounded dangerous Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(which still infects too many) <hi>That one Drop of
Christ's Blood was sufficient to save many Worlds of
Sinners:</hi> Which makes the greatest parts of Christ's
Sufferings utterly useless, as to Satisfaction; and
in the natural and just Consequences of it, throws
most horrid Aspersions both on God, and Christ.</p>
               <p>I conceive the Satisfaction of Christ, consisted in
his perfect fulfilling the Law that pertained to him as
Mediator here upon Earth, antecedently to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
All the Instances and Degrees of which
Obedience and Sufferings were appointed by his
Father, with infinite Wisdom, and for most good
and wise Reasons. That his Obedience and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
had the Virtue and Efficacy of making Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for Sinners, provided they should comply
with the Terms he should propose to them, was
from the Father's appointing and accepting them
for that Purpose; as well as for several other Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
they had by the same Appointment a Relation
to, both with respect to Christ himself, and those
who should believe in him; not to say any thing of
the respect they had to all Mankind, and the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
that redound therefrom to all Men.</p>

               <p>THE Title given to this Part is, <hi>What we are to
believe concerning Christ.</hi> This Author saith,
<hi>p.</hi> 65. That <q>The Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c.
and Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> agree so exactly concerning the
necessity of believing this one Article only, (<hi>viz.</hi>
that Jesus is the Christ) and in the Method they
have taken for the Proof of it, by citing several
Texts from the Preaching of our Saviour, and his
Apostles in the Acts, and no further, that they
only differ so much as a Copy does from an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
Yet this Author is so <hi>ingenuous,</hi> he grants
This can be no good Reason for rejecting what
the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.
hath asserted, if his Doctrine be otherwise found
agreeable to the whole Tenour of Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I desire no more but that these Words may
be added, <hi>so far as it discourses concerning what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of</hi> the Reasonableness, <hi>&amp;c. was enquiring after,</hi>
viz. <hi>what Articles are absolutely necessary to be explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believed by one who acknowledges the true God, to
make him a Christian.</hi> A few Days ago, I acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
met with a Book, entituled, <hi>Hobs's Tripos;</hi> and
perceiving that one part of it was entituled <hi>De Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore
Politico,</hi> I was so curious as to read that Part,
to see whether he did there treat of Religion, and
what he did say concerning it. In the Sixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Second Part of it, I found him discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
very agreeably to what this Author quotes out
of the Eighteenth Chapter of his Book <hi>De Cive.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> doth proceed, in this Book I speak of, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57787:49"/>
than the <hi>Acts,</hi> citing several Texts out of the
<hi>Epistles.</hi> And if I reach his Sense and Design, Mr.
<hi>Hobs</hi>'s Notion is vastly different from that laid down
in <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s
Notion seems to be this; <hi>That one who is a Christian
cannot be necessarily obliged to believe any more Articles
than this, that Iesus is the Messiah.</hi> That one who is
a Christian, is necessarily obliged to believe as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Articles, as he can attain to know are taught in
the Holy Scriptures, is the Notion of the Author
of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I think Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Discourse is neither consistent
with it self, nor with that, he intended it should
support. His Expressions are many times so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
they comprehend enough to overthrow all he
aims at. He seems willing that several Distinct Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
should be absolutely necessary to be explicitely
believed to Salvation; though how his bringing in
the Belief of the Scriptures amongst them, can be
consistent with what he principally designed, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
my Reach. But when he comes to prove his
<hi>Fundamentals</hi> (as he calls them) he produceth no
Scriptures, but what particularly teach this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that <hi>Iesus is the Christ,</hi> and therefore at last
concludes, this is the <hi>only Fundamental Point of Faith.</hi>
But if he would have spoken exactly and truly, he
should have said, The only Point, <hi>absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
to be explicitely believed by those who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the only True and Living God. <hi>Though other
Points</hi> (saith he) <hi>may be true, they are not so necessary
to be believed, as that a Man may not be saved,
though he believe them not.</hi> As to the former Part of
this Assertion, I shall take Notice, that he only
saith, <hi>They may be true.</hi> But the Author of <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness,</hi>
&amp;c. saith, <hi>They are Divine Truths;</hi> and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57787:50"/>
that <hi>they must be received with stedfast Faith,</hi> &amp;c.
As to the latter part of Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Assertion, I
shall observe, that the Point is not, whether a Man
may not be saved, though he believe them not;
But 1. Whether the Belief of them is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Salvation, in him who doth know they are
taught in the Holy Scriptures. 2. Whether a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
subject may without hazard of his Salvation,
do Actions in Obedience to his Sovereign, which
imply a Denial of them, notwithstanding he
knows they are revealed in the Scripture? Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>
declares for the affirmative. <hi>p.</hi> 214. Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> saith,
<hi>the Belief of that Point</hi> (viz. That Jesus is the
Christ) <hi>is sufficient for the Salvation of any Man
whosoever he be, p.</hi> 208. That is, let a Man know
ever so many Doctrines delivered in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that they are taught there, he is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to believe them. <hi>Nothing</hi> (saith he) <hi>is truly a
point of Faith, but that Iesus is the Christ, p.</hi> 110. The
Author of the Reasonableness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> delivers the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
contrary Truths. And these are Notions
which cannot possibly consist with a Person's belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Jesus to be the Christ, so as to take him hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
for his Lord and King. Yet Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> saith,
<hi>Christian Faith consisteth in acknowledging our Saviour
Christ to be King of Heaven; and therefore we must
endeavour to obey his Laws, p.</hi> 211. But it seems
believing what our Saviour hath taught, was not
(with Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>) any part of our Obedience to him.
The contradictory of this, is what the Author of
<hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. hath delivered most justly
for the Truth. Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> seems to lay much stress
on this, <hi>that the Controversies of Religion (amongst
Christians) are about Points unnecessary to Salvation;</hi>
by which I conceive he means, unnecessary for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57787:50"/>
Christians to believe. But a Points being contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
doth not make the Belief of it unnecessary.
Men may raise and maintain Controversies about
what Points they please; but I am obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what I do know Jesus Christ hath taught, and to
endeavour to know as many more Doctrines which
he hath taught, as I can, and to believe explicitely
as many as I shall attain an explicite Knowledge of,
let other People dispute and make as many Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
about them as they please. Controversy
may occasion and engage Christians to enquire
more accurately, whether Christ hath said any
thing concerning the Points and what he hath taught
concerning it. And what a Christian understands
Christ hath taught concerning it, he is necessarily
to believe, let those who controvert it, say what
they will.</p>
               <p>I find Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> was for a <hi>Publick Conscience,</hi> and
for <hi>Peoples transferring their Right of Iudging in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, to another.</hi> Which Notion agrees
well enough with that of a great many Persons in
the World. He differs from them in this, That he
is for having the Right transferred to the <hi>Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
p.</hi> 214, 215. Perhaps he was then, or had
a mind to be in Favour with the Civil Magistrate.
Those who are willing to part with their <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and put them forth to <hi>Trust,</hi> no doubt, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to place them where they think it will be
most for their own <hi>Advantage.</hi> But I think there
cannot be a Notion more contrary to what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. delivers, than this is.
Many more Particulars might be mentioned, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that what is laid down in <hi>the Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. hath no Agreement with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> advanced, but stands at the very
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57787:51"/>
same Distance from them, the Doctrines delivered
by Christ and his Apostles do, but I think these are
enough to satisfy any indifferent and impartial Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 66. This Author proposeth to examine
<q>Whether the Son of God, and Messiah, or Christ
always signify the same in Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is not the Question to be examined,
with respect to what the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi>
&amp;c. doth assert. But whether the Son of God, and
the Messiah or Christ, do always signify the same,
when they are used either alone, or together, in
those Places of Scripture, which declare what it is
the due believing whereof doth constitute or make
People Christians? or which relate what Christ
and his Apostles did propose to People acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the True God, to be believed to make them
Christians, and upon their believing of which, they
did own and acknowledge them for Christians?
That these Terms, when thus made use of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
do signify the same, I think the Author of
<hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. hath proved very clearly and
fully in that Book, and in his <hi>Second Vindication</hi> of
it, they very plainly appear to signify the same
with St. <hi>Paul</hi> on such occasions. For soon after his
Conversion, 'tis said, <hi>he preached Christ in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
that he is the Son of God, Act.</hi> 9. 20. That
which he proposed to be believed was this, That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> or that Person who was
eminently known by the Name Christ, is the Son
of God. Now in <hi>v.</hi> 22. it is said, <hi>he confounded the
Iews</hi> (the Persons who opposed this Doctrine) how
did he confound them? By <hi>proving this is the very
Christ.</hi> Now if the Son of God, and the Christ, or
Messiah, did not here signify the same, his proving
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57787:51"/>
that the Person he preached of, was <hi>very Christ,</hi>
could not be a Proof, and such a Proof as would
confound the Jews, that he was <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
I acknowledge the Son of God, is an Expression
that denotes our Saviour's Divinity, in very many
Places of Scripture, even in all those where it is
made use of, in declaring and teaching that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Doctrine. But the Author of <hi>the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
&amp;c. was not enquiring in how many Senses,
that Phrase, the Son of God, was used in Scripture,
but what its Sense and Meaning is, in such Places
of Scripture, as I before spoke of. <hi>The Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
&amp;c. neither treats of our Saviour's Divinity,
nor enquires how many things Christians must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to know, and then believe, concerning
Christ. But it lays down the Articles which Christ
and his Apostles have taught, are absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be explicitely believed to make Men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
by Virtue of their believing of which aright,
they will be necessarily obliged to employ their best
Endeavours, to attain to a sound Knowledge of
what Christ hath taught, and to believe our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Divinity, and the other Doctrines which are
delivered in all those Sacred Writings, which make
up the entire Rule of Christian Faith, when they
know that they are taught there.</p>
               <p>This Author urges, That <q>
                     <hi>The Son of God</hi> is of
a larger Signification than the Christ, or Messiah,
in <hi>Iohn 20. 31. But these things are written that ye
might believe that Iesus is the Christ, the Son of God,</hi>
&amp;c. Because the Design of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel was
to assert the Divinity of Christ, against those
that opposed it. Now if those Phrases mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same, then St. <hi>Iohn</hi> himself does not assign
the true (I suppose he would say, the compleat,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57787:52"/>
or full, and adequate) Reason for his writing
that Gospel; for it appears that he had certainly
another End in it, than barely to prove Jesus to
be the Messiah. But if they mean differently,
and <hi>Son of God</hi> does there denote Christ's Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then we have in that forementioned Passage,
the whole Intention of the Apostle, assigned for
his writing that Gospel, namely, to shew that
Jesus was the Christ, and that he was God,
<hi>p.</hi> 68, 69.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I acknowledge St. <hi>Iohn</hi> did design in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to assert the Divinity of Christ, and that he
hath proved his Divinity at large, in his First Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as this Author most truly declares) and I think
he hath very clearly taught it, in other Parts of
his Gospel too. I think likewise, it is past doubt,
that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in writing his Gospel, did design to
instruct People in several other Doctrines, besides
Christ's Divinity, as he hath actually done; for I
cannot be persuaded, that those other Doctrines
were dropt there by Chance; so that to shew that
Jesus was the Christ, and that he was God, could
not be the <hi>whole Intention</hi> of the Apostle, in writing
that Gospel. Further, I think this Author and I are
agreed, that the Miracles our Saviour wrought,
were not <hi>immediate Proofs</hi> of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> he
taught, but of <hi>his Mission,</hi> or that he was the <hi>Christ.</hi>
Moreover, <hi>the Son of God,</hi> denotes something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
our Saviour's Divinity, or being God, in those
places of Scripture, where it is used for the Proof
of that Point; but St. <hi>Iohn</hi> is not giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in this Passage, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 31. of his whole
design in writing that Gospel, but of the Reasons
why he did so largely relate the <hi>Signs and Miracles</hi>
which Christ did; which Signs and Miracles did
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57787:52"/>
not prove any thing more, directly and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than that he was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Thus <hi>the Christ,</hi>
and <hi>the Son of God,</hi> seem here to signify the
same.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 73. This Author saith, That <q>What
might be sufficient to denominate a Man a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or a Christian during the actual Ministry of
Christ, would not truly entitle any one to that
Character after our Saviour's Assention, and for
this Reason, because we do not find from the
whole History of the Gospel, that any of those
who believed on our Saviour, had a just Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him, or what was the true End of his
coming into the World.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The direct contrary appears by the Acts
of the Apostles, where we constantly find the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
propounding just the same Articles Jesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
did, to be believed, in order to Peoples being
Christians, or denominated Believers. And if
Christ admitted Persons during his Ministry, into
the same Covenant People are admitted into since
his Assention, what was sufficient before for that
purpose, must be so after his Assention. But what
this Author means by a <hi>just Knowledge</hi> of Christ,
and the true End of his coming into the World, I
must not undertake to determine; therefore I shall
only ask, Whether they had a <hi>true Knowledge</hi> of
Christ, and the End of his coming, so far as was
absolutely necessary to make them Christians? If
they had, their not knowing any thing more than
what was then revealed, and made known to them,
in order to their being Christians, cannot be a
good Reason why what was sufficient to warrant
their being denominated Christians, should not be
sufficient to warrant Persons being denominated
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57787:53"/>
Christians now, unless together with the Proof that
there are more Articles revealed now, than were
then, there be also as clear Proof that all, or some
of these latter Articles, are now required to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
believed for that Purpose.</p>
               <p>But (saith this Author) <q>It is natural to infer
from <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8. that the Apostles had not
yet attained to that clear Knowledge of him,
and the Design of his coming, which it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
they should be endewed with, <hi>p.</hi> 74.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> They had not all that Knowledge of
Christ, and of his Design, which it was necessary
they should be endowed with, in order to their
own Advantage, and to their giving the World
that entire and compleat Revelation, Christ would
make of his Will by them. But it cannot be infer'd
that they had not all that Knowledge which was
absolutely necessary to make them Christians: were
there no Christians upon Earth, after Christ's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention,
till after the Descent of the Holy Ghost?
or were not the Apostles Christians, till they were
endeued with a clear Knowlededge of all those
things Christ would make known, for the Benefit
of his Church, and which they were gradually
to instruct People in, and commit to writing for
the use of future Ages? Can no Man be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
till he hath an explicite Knowledge of every
Particular, in the fullest import of it, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the Scripture, and hath a respect to Jesus,
as the Messias? Which is the true Notion of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Jesus to be the Messias, absolutely necessary
to make Men Christians, that he is the Person God
hath sent to be our King and Saviour, whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Laws we are conscientiously to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to learn, and believe and observe, as we attain
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57787:53"/>
to know them; O, That he is the Person sent
from God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who hath taught these and these
particular Doctrines, neither more, nor fewer (and
so as touching his Precepts) every one of which,
we do actually believe and practice? Can no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be a Christian now, till he hath as expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
and full a Knowledge of every thing Christ
hath taught and revealed, as that Apostle ever had,
who was endowed with the largest measure of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation?
whatever he did know this way, had a
respect to Jesus as the Messiah: And the very last
Information he had this way, acquainted him with
something concerning the Messiah, which he did
not so clearly and fully know before; so that he
could not form <hi>a just and adequate Rule of Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him,</hi> till he knew that.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It will not (saith this Author) alter the case, by
saying, That those who died then in that Faith,
were undoubtedly saved; for that would be no
more an Argument, than the proving that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a Jew was saved before Christ's coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World, by Virtue of Christ's Mediation,
in the Observance of the Mosaick Law, he
might be equally capable of Salvation now, in
the Profession of that Religion, <hi>p.</hi> 74.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> What this Author hath delivered in these
Words, would afford room for many Remarks:
But I shall only observe, That believing that Jesus
is the Messiah, was not absolutely necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
before he came into the World; nor was
any thing more absolutely necessary to be believed
to Salvation, under the Mosaick Dispensation,
than God had made absolutely necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
for that purpose, under it. But at the
coming of our Saviour, a New Covenant being
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57787:54"/>
substituted in the Place of the Mosaick Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it was under a New Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
and taking Jesus to be the Messiah our
King, and submitting to his Law. If that Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
were not abrogated, but did still continue
the way of Salvation, nothing more would now be
absolutely necessary to be believed to Salvation,
than what was made so by that Constitution. And
if the Christian Dispensation were to be abrogated,
and another to come into its room, whereby some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
distinct from what is contained in the Gospel,
or Christian Dispensation, should be made absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary to be believed to Salvation, the Belief of
every thing delivered in the New Testament, would
not, when the Gospel Dispensation was at an end,
be sufficient to Salvation. But the adding of more
Revelations, which are to be studied, and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
believed when known, doth not alter the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
or make more absolutely necessary to
be believed to Salvation, or to interest a Person in
that Dispensation, than was at first absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to that Purpose; any more than every
new Law made in a Nation, doth alter the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of that Government, and make something
more absolutely necessary to be known, and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
assented to, to make a Person a Subject of
that Government, than was absolutely necessary to
that Purpose before. Will any serious considering
Christian affirm, that Jesus Christ will reject any
Person, who by the gracious Influence of the Holy
Ghost, is effectually brought to receive him with
all his Heart, to be his Lord and King, and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavours to fulfil that Engagement? people
are generally very willing to believe that Jesus has
died for them, and satisfied for their Sins, and they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57787:54"/>
can be contented to own him for a Prophet, to
furnish them with Notions; but they are not so
easily prevailed with to give Substantial Evidences,
that they do heartily take him for their King. Were
they generally brought to a sound Belief and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of his <hi>being their King,</hi> they would
make a much better Improvement of what he hath
delivered in the Holy Scripture concerning his
<hi>Priesthood,</hi> and his <hi>being a Prophet,</hi> than they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
do, notwithstanding the great Zeal they
pretend to discover for those <hi>Offices.</hi> The Courses
they ordinarily allow themselves in, are evidently
and utterly inconsistent with their receiving Jesus
unfeignedly for their <hi>King,</hi> and their preserving a
Sense of that Relation upon their Spirits, whatever
way they have got to reconcile them to the
Notions they entertain concerning his other <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For (saith this Author) we are to direct our
Faith and Practice according to the most full
and clear Revelation of God's Will, and to believe
that to be necessary to Salvation, which appears
from the full extent of Revelation, to be requir'd
in order to it, <hi>p.</hi> 74.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Those who are Christians are to direct
their Faith and practice according to the fullest
Measure of the Knowledge they can attain, of
what God hath revealed; that is, They must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
explicitely, and actually perform whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they can attain to know Christ hath taught,
and made their Duty. And in order to their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the clearest and fullest Knowledge of
their Lord's Will, they must take care they do not
confine themselves to a certain Number of Articles
and Precepts of Mens collecting, but must diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57787:55"/>
read and study the entire and compleat Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Christ hath made of his Fathers Pleasure in the
Holy Scriptures, Yet we are not to believe any
Article is absolutely necessary to Salvation, but
what he hath revealed to be so; for if we do, we
transgress our Bounds, and go further than the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
extent of Revelation reaches, as to that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and consequently do that, which we have no
warrant for in Divine Revelation. It doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that because Christians are not to believe any
thing as an Article of the Christian Faith, but
what is taught in the New Testament, and must
endeavour to know as many of the Doctrines which
are taught there, as they can, and believe every one
as they attain to know them, therefore every Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
delivered in the New Testament, is absolutely
necessary to be believed to make Men Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But (saith this Author) if all that was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to Salvation, or to denominate
Men truly Christians, was the bare believing Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
to be the Messiah (the believing Jesus to be
the Messias, so as to take him absolutely for their
King) why should our Saviour promise the Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Holy Ghost, to instruct them (<hi>viz.</hi>
his Disciples) farther in what they ought to believe
concerning him? <hi>p.</hi> 75.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Our Saviour did not promise the Holy
Ghost to instruct them in what they were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to make them Christians (for they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
when the Promise was made to them, or how
could they be his Disciples?) but in such Matters
as they must believe, when instructed in, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of their having received him for their Lord,
and as other Christians must endeavour to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
and then believe on the same Account.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57787:55"/>
To what purpose did they oblige themselves in
taking Jesus for their Lord, to believe whatever
he should teach them, if they knew and believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
all that they should ever be obliged to believe?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Author thinks he hath Reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from <hi>Act. 10. 43. &amp;c.</hi> That we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by believing Jesus to be the Messiah, in
this and almost all other Places, the full extent
and meaning of those Words, as they are explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by this, and other Apostles in all Parts of
Scripture, because they were all of them inspired
by the same Holy Ghost, and therefore must all
have the same Meaning. And that therefore the
believing Jesus to be the Messiah, as it is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
for a Fundamental of our Faith, must
comprehend the full Sense, that is given of it in
Scripture, <hi>p.</hi> 76, 77.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If I comprehend the Force of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
arguing here, it is thus: The Apostles, by
the Term <hi>Messiah,</hi> did understand all those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Doctrines they have delivered throughout the
Holy Scriptures, concerning that Jesus of whom
they preached, so that by Peoples believing Jesus
to be the Messiah, they meant their believing expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
every one of those Doctrines. This Notion
now is built upon this Supposition, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
when they preached Jesus to any, they did
particularly acquaint them with every one of those
Doctrines, and then promising them Pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
if they did believe Jesus to be the Messiah, they
declared to them, that by believing Jesus to be the
Messiah, they meant the explicite believing of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of those Doctrines they had proposed to
them. The Reason given for this Supposition, is
(as I apprehend) this, They were all inspired by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57787:56"/>
the same Holy Ghost, and therefore must all have
the same Meaning; that is, I suppose, they must
all understand the Term Messiah in the same Sense,
<hi>viz.</hi> as signifying precisely every one of those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.
Many Remarks might be made on this
Occasion. I will only observe, 1. That the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is perfectly precarious, without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
at all from Scripture. Several of these
Doctrines might be propounded as very proper
Inducements, to believe Jesus to be the Messiah,
but that is not the Point in Discourse, but whether
the Term Messiah did with the Apostles, signify
just such a set of Doctrines. 2. The Holy Ghost
was not given to the Apostles to teach them the
Meaning of the Term Messiah, for they understood
it very well before; nor did they in preaching to
the Jews, use the Term Messiah, in a Sense they
never heard of before, and which would therefore
need a particular Explanation; but as a Term so
common and so distinctly understood amongst
them, as the Term in any Nation is commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the Inhabitants, which expresseth, and
signifieth their Supream Governour. All the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
understood the Term Messiah in the same
Sense, and used it in the same Sense, in which
those who heard them did commonly understand
it. Their Business was not to preach and explain
New Terms, nor to tack New Meanings unto
Old Terms. 3. In their preaching to Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
they insisted on such Considerations as were
most proper to convince them, that Jesus was the
Messiah, according to the known and common
Meaning of the Term, and not such as did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
prove the Truth of a certain Number of
New Doctrines, which they were Strangers to,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57787:56"/>
and which must make up a New Sense for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Word. 4. We have good Warrant from the
Scripture to believe that the Apostles were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
at once, but gradually, in the Doctrines
concerning Jesus, which are delivered in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Parts of Scripture, and therefore they could
not mean every one of these Doctrines, constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the Term Messiah, for they could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
their Hearers at first, with any more of
these Doctrines, than they were at that time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in, and if they added more Doctrines
when they were instructed in more, as the Sense in
which they understood the Term Messiah, they
used it then in a New Sense and Meaning. It may
be said, but now we have a full Account in the
Scripture, of the full Meaning in which the Term
Messiah is to be used, and consequently what is to
be understood by believing Jesus to be the Messiah,
taking the Term Messiah, to signify every one
of the Doctrines delivered in the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Jesus, and therefore these are to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
out of the Scripture, and Persons must now
explicitely believe every one of them, in order to
their believing Jesus to be the Messias, in the full
Sense given of it in Scripture. 'Tis very true, all
the Doctrines we are to believe concerning Jesus,
are set down in the Scripture. But it may be ask'd,
seeing all these Doctrines are not set down in any
one place of Scripture together, for this End, to
whom is the Office of collecting them for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
committed? And what assurance shall People
have, if uninspired Men may undertake it, that
their Collection is compleat? For if any one Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
be omitted, distinct from what shall be in the
Collection, those who shall believe every one of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57787:57"/>
those Articles which shall be proposed to them,
will not believe that Jesus is the Messias, in the full
Sense given of that Term in Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
according to this Notion, will not be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
It may further be enquired, whether those
who shall believe explicitely every one of these
Doctrines, will be obliged to endeavour to know
and believe any more Doctrines? If the Answer be
No, then either these are all Doctrines which are
delivered in Scripture, or there are some Doctrines
taught in the Scripture, which Christians are not
obliged to endeavour to know, though they have
Opportunity to understand them, or to believe
them, though they do know them. If the Answer
be, Yes, it may be asked, how that comes about?
Perhaps it will be said, because amongst the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
before spoken of, this is one, That Jesus is
our King, and therefore to testify our Submission
and Obedience to him, we are to endeavour to
know and believe other Doctrines. This indeed is
a way whereby they may acquire some assurance
to themselves, and give Evidence and Proof to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that they believe Jesus to be their King, but
not (according to the Notion we are now discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of) that they believe him to be the Messiah,
or that they are Christians. How comes it to pass,
that seeing the explicite Belief of every one of the
other Doctrines is equally necessary to make them
Christians, with the Belief of this, only a part of
that Faith which makes them Christians, must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
and govern them after they are Christians?
Whence is it, that some Doctrines delivered in
Scripture, must be believed in Obedience to Jesus,
and others not, whilst he is equally the Teacher of
them all.</p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:57787:57"/>
This Author saith, That <q>Though no more is
set down, <hi>Act.</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 37. but that the Eunuch belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, yet no
doubt there is more implied: For <hi>Philip</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
him in the Christian Religion, from that
Chapter of <hi>Isatah, (viz.</hi> which the Eunuch was
reading) which Doctrines were, no doubt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
as absolutely necessary to be believed.
Besides, since <hi>Philip</hi> baptized him, no doubt but
he did it in that Form which Christ himself en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined,
in the Name of the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost; and then it will follow that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and Confession of the Three Persons was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<hi>p.</hi> 77, 78.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not at all doubted, but there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
absolutely necessary to be believed by an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer,
in order to his becoming a Christian,
besides that, the due believing whereof, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
him a Christian. For a Man cannot believe
a Proposition to be true, without some Proof and
Evidence that it is true. Now the enquiry is not
what Arguments and Proofs are absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be believed to bring a Man to the due Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of what is absolutely necessary to be believed
to make him a Christian. That is a Question no
Man can possibly determine, by assigning one in
particular, or a precise Number. For the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Proofs, and Evidences are many and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and God has not limited himself to make
only one of them effectual, nor obliged himself
that he will not give forth his Blessing, but with
a certain Number of them in conjunction. He
that doth duly believe all that is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed to make Men Christians, is a
Christian, whether he was brought to this Belief,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57787:58"/>
by the Belief of more or fewer Arguments. There
are Truths to be believed antecedently to a Man's
believing what is absolutely necessary to be believed
to make him a Christian, and there are Truths to
be believed by him after he is a Christian, the due
believing of which, are Proofs and Evidences that
he doth believe what is absolutely necessary to be
believed to make Men Christians. But it is not
the Belief of the one sort, or the other sort of
these Truths, nor of both together, which is the
<hi>Faith</hi> that constitutes Men <hi>Christians;</hi> but only the
Belief of that, to which the Belief of those other
Truths, hath an Antecedent, or Consequential
Relation. How many Doctrines the Eunuch was
instructed in, or what those Doctrines were in
particular, we cannot tell, because they are not
revealed to us; but what it was, upon the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of which, he was owned for a Christian, and
Baptized, is expresly declared, and we have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe, that if the explicite Belief of more
Articles had been required of him, as absolutely
necessary to make him a Christian, they would
have been set down and expressed in his Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I think also, it is more than probable that the
Eunuch was baptized <hi>in the Name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> unless it can be proved, that
that Form was in those Days confined, or appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to the Apostles, who were intrusted with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost.
Whatever Articles the Eunuch did explicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
at present, he was by believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> obliged to endeavour to know expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
and believe as many more as he could, both
concerning <hi>the Father, the Son,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghost,</hi>
even all that was, or should be revealed concerning
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57787:58"/>
them, which I think reaches the whole extent of
the New Testament.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p. 78, &amp;c.</hi> This Author undertakes <q>To
shew that the Gospels and Acts are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to our Author's Scheme of Doctrine, and
this he will do by shewing, they do require much
more to be believed concerning our Saviour, than
barely that he was the Messiah.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here this Author proves very well, and learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Divinity of our Blessed Saviour, and on that
Account we cannot set too high a value on his
Book. He also mentions some other Doctrines,
very clearly delivered in the Gospels and Acts. But
the Reason why he offers these things in Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
was his mistaking the Design of that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
The Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. did
not propose to enquire how many Doctrines are
delivered in the Gospels and Acts, concerning our
Saviour, but what Christ and his Apostles did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
as absolutely necessary to be explicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make Men Christians. Reckon up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as many Articles as you please, which are
clearly and expresly taught in the Gospels and
Acts, yea, in all the New Testament, this will
not affect, or make any thing against the <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. unless withal you prove
that Jesus or his Apostles, required the explicite
Belief of all, or some of them, which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from this, that <hi>he is the Messiah</hi> whom we are
to take for our Lord and King, to make Men
Christians.</p>
               <p>Whereas this Author saith, <q>That the most
Learned amongst the Jews did appropriate the
Title <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to their expected Messiah, and also
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57787:59"/>
believed he should be God. So that this may be
a very good Reason for our Saviour, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
requiring no more to be believed in their
preachings amongst the Jews, than that Jesus was
the Messiah, since if they once firmly believed
that they must necessarily believe him to be God,
<hi>p.</hi> 78, 79.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I shall only observe, 1. That the Sense of the
Term <hi>Messiah</hi> is here acknowledged to be very
different, from what this Author has before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Apostles meant by it.</p>
               <p>2. That here is no Supposition that the People
did not know what was meant by <hi>Messiah,</hi> and
therefore must have it either interpreted or explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, but an Acknowledgment that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Apostles did use the Term, according
to the familiar and commonly known meaning of
it amongst the Jews.</p>
               <p>3. That supposing the Jews did generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>the Messiah should be God,</hi> yet they must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that <hi>Iesus of Nazareth</hi> was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could believe him to be <hi>God.</hi> And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this only, that he was the Messiah, which was
propounded to be believed to make them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
it must be a right believing of this, that did
make them Christians; how near a Connection
soever their believing any thing else, which they
knew and believed concerning him who should be
the Messiah, might have with their believing Jesus
to be the Messiah. Supposing they did generally
believe that their expected Messiah should be God,
yet those who believed other Persons to be the
Messiah, and consequently believed them to be
God too, were not Christians. So that it was
not the believing a Person to be the Messiah,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57787:59"/>
nor a believing that Person to be God, that
made People Christians, but a believing <hi>him</hi> to
be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who really was the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But as we are obliged to know who was the
Author of our Being, so also must it be equally
a Crime not to know clearly, who, and what he
was, that could be the Author of our Salvation,
<hi>p.</hi> 87.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In answer to this, I shall only say, That we are
obliged to endeavour to know as much as we can,
of that God, who is the Author of our Being.
This holds true as to all Men, and so Christians
are obliged to endeavour to know as much as they
can of him, who is the Author of their Salvation.
It is a Crime to be <hi>wilfully Ignorant</hi> of any thing,
that is revealed of him who is the Author of our
Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There could be no Reason (saith this Author)
for the defending his Divinity (<hi>viz.</hi> our Saviour's)
with so much Care and Concern (as St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
did defend it) if it was not absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be believed to make a Man a Christian, or
if there was no Danger in believing him to be
only Man, <hi>p.</hi> 87.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Reason we have to defend Divine
Truths, when opposed and denied by Persons, is
not to be taken barely from the End for which
they are to be believed, but also from their Nature,
<hi>viz.</hi> because they are Divine Truths, and therefore
Truths to be believed, and which may by no means
be denied.</p>
               <p>2. He that believes Jesus to be the Messiah,
does not therein believe him to be <hi>only Man;</hi> he
believes him to be Man, but not <hi>only Man;</hi> for
that is not propos'd to his Belief, when it is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57787:60"/>
to him, to believe that Jesus is the Messiah.
And by believing him to be the Messiah, he obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
himself to believe whatsoever he shall attain to
know is revealed concerning him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Believing in Christ (saith this Author) if it
mean any thing, must be interpreted of every
thing that Scripture has required to be believed
concerning him. So that this we may be certain
is a Fundamental, that as Christ is the Author
of our Salvation; So that Revelation is the just
Measure of our belief in him, and that we
must not believe either more or less of him, than
we are warranted by Scripture, <hi>p.</hi> 92.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Revelation is the just Measure of what
we are to believe concerning Christ. So that a
Christian, let his Advances in Knowledge be ever
so great, must no believe any thing concerning
him, but what he is warranted, or at least appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
upon mature Consideration, he is warranted
by Scripture. But that a Man cannot be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
till he doth explicitely believe every thing
the Scripture doth warrant People to believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Christ, is a Notion the Scripture doth not
any where warrant. Were this Notion true, no
Man can be a Christian, whose Knowledge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing relating to Christ, is not every way
equal to that, of the most learned, sagacious, and
understanding Person, in the whole Christian
World, or that ever was, or ever will be in the
World. Nay, according to this Notion, it may
be justly questioned, whether ever there was a
Christian since the Apostles Days. For there may
be Ground to question, whether any uninspired
Man did, or will attain to a just and adequate
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57787:60"/>
Knowledge of every thing the Scripture doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
concerning Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But it will probably be objected (saith this
Author) to all this, that though it is granted,
that there are several Articles to be believed by
those who are throughly Christians, yet there
was no more required by our Saviour himself,
or his Apostles, to make a Man a Christian, or
in order to his Admission into Christianity, than
the believing Jesus to be the Messiah, and that
this is all which the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. contends for.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Objection is not proposed in its full weight,
but that I need not insist on, for if the Answer
reach it, as it is here laid down, it will serve the turn.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In answer to this (saith this Author) it may be
observed, First, That the forementioned Articles,
as well as others that might be named, are of the
same Nature with that one Article of believing
Jesus to be the Messiah, and are a Repetition of
it in all its Branches, <hi>p.</hi> 92, 93.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Answer is not at all satisfactory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is wholly concerning another matter, than
that treated of in the Objection. The Objection is
concerning what our Saviour and his Apostles have
required to be believed to make Men Christians.
The Answer is concerning the Nature of Articles.
Moreover, it is not easy to understand what is
meant here, by several distinct Articles being of the
<hi>same Nature with this, That Iesus is the Messiah.</hi>
This Author hath formerly distinguished betwixt the
Nature of several Doctrines, and their being Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelations. Now, consider several particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Doctrines singly in themselves, and abstractedly
from their being Divine Revelations, they are not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57787:61"/>
of the same Nature one with another, how can
they then be every one of the same Nature with
this, that Jesus is the Messiah? I agree with this
Author, that a Person's believing explicitely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
particular Doctrines Jesus hath taught, for this
Reason, because he knows, that Jesus who is the
Messias, hath taught them, is a Repetition of his
Belief of that Article, the Ground and Reason of
his believing every one of the other Doctrines.
But if his believing certain particular Doctrines,
be but a Repetition of his believing that Jesus is
the Messiah, how can the repeated, or rather li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
exercise of that Belief, as to particular
Branches or Doctrines, make Men Christians, if
the due believing Jesus to be the Messiah, do not
constitute Men Christians? Besides, the Reason of
our believing Jesus to be the Messiah, is quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the Reason why we believe these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But Secondly, there was more required even
to make a Man a Christian, than the Belief of
Jesus being the Messiah; for our Saviour himself
required the believing in the whole Trinity:
For this was the Commandment which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
gave his Disciples, <hi>That they should teach all
Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. i. e.</hi> They
should first instruct them in whom they were to
believe, and then baptize them into that Faith,
<hi>p.</hi> 93.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The command was to <hi>Disciple all Nations,</hi>
that is, not first instruct them in the particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
those who believe Jesus to be the Messiah,
must believe upon his Authority, when they know
he hath taught them, but by propounding such
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57787:61"/>
Considerations and Arguments as are most proper
to convince and satisfy them that Jesus is the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
bring them to own him to be Messiah, so as
to take him for their King and Ruler, by engaging
themselves without any Reservation to learn of, and
obey him. And then they were to baptize them
in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
after which, they were to teach them the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
they were to believe and do, by Virtue of their
having taken him to be their Lord, which Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
comprehend the whole Revelation Christ hath
made, concerning the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost. That is, the whole Doctrine delivered in
the New Testament.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 95. This Author saith, He will <q>Examine
the Reasonableness of that Article of Faith, the
Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.
hath insisted on, and set down in the largest
Terms, <hi>p.</hi> 301.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What this Author means by the Reasonableness
of that Article, is not very plain. I suppose he
doth not mean, that he will examine whether it is
reasonable a Man should believe that Article. If
he means the Reason why that Author hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
That this is the only Article absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be explicitely believed, by those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in the True God, to make them Christians,
that Reason is clearly this, because our Saviour and
his Apostles have not required the explicite Belief
of any other Article but this, for that purpose.
Yet because the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c.
observed, <hi>That the Almerciful God seems herein to
have consulted the Poor of the World, and the Bulk of
Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:57787:62"/>
This Author, <q>For a clearer Examination of
this, proposeth certain things to be considered.
<hi>First,</hi> supposing God either had, or should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
any thing to Mankind, and make the Belief
of it a Condition of Salvation, which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Man could not comprehend, and we had
all the Evidence the thing was capable of, that
the Revelation proceeded from God, would this
<hi>Incomprehensibleness</hi> of it, be a sufficient Plea for
our rejecting it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No: But 1. There is a great difference
betwixt an Article's being absolutely necessary to
be explicitely believed to Salvation, and an Article's
being absolutely necessary to be explicitely belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
when known, by Reason of a Person's belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what is absolutely necessary to be explicitely
believed to Salvation. The Difference is as great
as betwixt an absolute Necessity, and a conditional
Necessity. There are Articles which the Reason
of Man cannot comprehend, the Belief of which
is necessary to those who know Christ hath taught
them, yet the explicite Belief of them is not made
absolutely necessary to Salvation. Nor can the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
Belief of any Number of particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
taught in the New Testament, be properly
said to be the Condition of Salvation; for if it
could, he who should explicitely believe them all,
could not be obliged to believe one more. The
Condition of Salvation, <hi>Now,</hi> is believing Jesus
to be the Messiah, so as to take him without Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Limitation to be our Lord and King. And
hereby we are obliged to believe as many Doctrines
as we can attain to know he hath taught. So
that a true Christian never believes so many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
but he is still under the same Obligation
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57787:62"/>
to believe more, when he attains to know more,
and that Christ hath taught them. It is in Matters
of Faith as in Matters of Practice, let a Man do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so many things which Christ commands, if he
obstinately allow himself in the wilful Violation of
any one Command he knows Christ hath enjoyned
him, he is not a sincere Christian. So let a Man
believe ever so many Articles, if he obstinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to assent to any one Article, he knows Christ
hath taught, he is not a true Christian. His obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
wilful Refusal to believe that one Article, is
a plain Demonstration he hath not <hi>that Faith,</hi> which
is <hi>the Condition of Salvation;</hi> and that the <hi>Assent</hi> he
gives to those other Doctrines, hath some other <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</hi>
A sincere Christian's believing particular
Doctrines when known, is the genuine and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Fruit and Effect of that Faith, which is the
Condition of Salvation. These Acts of Faith, are
but a partial, limited exerting of that Faith which
made him a Christian, and is the Condition of
Salvation, in such Proportion as his explicite
Knowledge doth reach, attended with a prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and readiness to extend it further, as he shall
attain to know more of his Lord's Mind. This
true and sincere believing Jesus to be the Christ,
so as to take him for our Lord and King, is the
Faith which is the Condition of Salvation. And
hence it is, that <hi>this Faith</hi> doth avail, and is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
to the Salvation of them, who are Honest,
and Cordial, notwithstanding they happen to be
ever so much beneath others in natural and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Accomplishments.</p>
               <p>2. Should God now reveal any more Articles as
absolutely necessary to be explicitely believed to
Salvation, than what Christ and his Apostles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57787:63"/>
as absolutely necessary to be explicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to Salvation, whether the Reason of Man
could comprehend them or not, they would alter,
and make a <hi>New Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. had
of his own Head declared that no Article is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be explicitely believed to make Men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but this, <hi>That Iesus is the Messiah,</hi> and for
this Reason, because God could not reasonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the Belief of any Article, as absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation, but what illiterate and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men can comprehend, there would have been
just Ground to examine and contradict what he
had said. For this had been an intruding on God's
Right and Prerogative, and a presumptuous prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
to him.</p>
               <p>But 4. The Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c.
doth expresly declare, that <hi>what is the Faith God
will accept, depends wholly on his good Pleasure, p.</hi> 298.
So that he might have made the Belief of Articles,
which the Reason of Man cannot comprehend, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>5. The Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. did
search the Scriptures, to find what are the Articles,
the Belief of which God hath made absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation, and he hath given a full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what he found there concerning this
Matter.</p>
               <p>6. It is an eminent Demonstration of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention
and Goodness of God towards Man,
that whereas he might have made the explicite
Belief of incomprehensible Articles, absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation, he hath not made the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Belief of any, but that plain and intelligible
Proposition, the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57787:63"/>
hath set down as absolutely necessary to Salvation.
This Discovery of the Divine Condescention and
Goodness, ought to be taken Notice of, by those
who have a Sense of it; and the Reflection the
Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. hath made on
this Occasion, is so pertinent and so pious, I do a
little wonder that Pious and Good Men, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with themselves, to make invidious Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why all this Concern for the
Illiterate, and Men of weak Capacities, as though
it would be so very prejudicial to them, to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to believe what they cannot comprehend?
<hi>p.</hi> 96.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If God is pleased to shew his Concern for
the illiterate, and Men of weak Capacities, it is
very fit that Writers and Good Men should take
Notice of it. And though we are obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
explicitely whatsoever we shall attain to know
God hath revealed, be matters discoursed of ever
so much above our Comprehension; yet it may
be very prejudicial to the illiterate Men, and some
<hi>Offence</hi> against Jesus Christ, to require of them the
Belief of Articles they cannot comprehend, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to their Salvation, when Jesus
Christ doth not require the explicite Belief of any
such Articles, as absolutely necessary to that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
and more particularly because it is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
their Faith to some other Authority than
his, who is their only Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For the Misteries of Religion, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,
are equally so to all, <hi>p.</hi> 96.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Very true; But some learned Men can say a
great many things, whether they understand
what they say, or not, concerning the Mysteries
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57787:64"/>
of Religion, which illiterate Men cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.
And their Authority may as well oblige
them to believe their incomprehensible Speeches,
as absolutely necessary to Salvation, as Mysteries,
which Jesus Christ hath not made absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to that purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But lastly, since our Author is of Opinion,
that it would be very advantageous to Mankind
in general, to have only such a Religion as is
very easy to be understood by all sorts of Men,
we ought to consider how very intelligible his
Rule of Faith is, if compared with that of our
Church, and how agreeable his one Article is,
to the Comprehension of Vulgar Capacities,
<hi>p.</hi> 98.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To this, the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi>
&amp;c. hath given a very full Reply (I think) in these
Words: <hi>He should have remembred that I speak not
of all the Doctrines of Christianity, nor all that is
published to the World in it; but of those Truths only
which are absolutely required to be believed to make any
one a Christian,</hi> &amp;c. First Vindication of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 30.</p>
               <p>Here I expected some Discovery, that our
Church had taught somewhat contrary, or exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
different, touching this Matter, from what
is delivered in <hi>the Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. concerning
it. But that Comparison is not pursued. I shall
therefore say no more, but that our Church doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the explicite Belief of all that Christ and
his Apostles have made absolutely necessary to be
believed to make Men Christians, and presses to
a serious, dilligent care, and endeavour to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
as much as may be, of what Christ and
his Apostles have taught, without limiting People
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57787:64"/>
to a precise Number of Articles, beyond which
they must not dare to stir; and if she had not done
so, I should not have that high Esteem for her, I
most justly have.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Author bestows his 99th Page, and most
of the Two following Pages in shewing that
this Proposition, <hi>Iesus is the Messiah,</hi> is not easy
to be understood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I will not undertake to declare what his Design
is, in this, I suppose he doth not make a Question,
whether the Belief of that Proposition, is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary to make Men Christians, and therefore
that it must be understood. For he contends, That
there are many more Propositions, together with this,
equally necessary to be explicitely known and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make Men Christians. So that he doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
but acknowledge that the Belief of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is absolutely necessary. Now this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is like easy to be understood, whether the
due believing of it, doth make a Man a Christian,
or the explicite believing of a great many more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
together with it, be absolutely necessary to
make a Man a Christian. For I suppose it will not
be denied, that it is as easy to understand this one
Proposition, standing alone, as to understand this
same Proposition when it is joined with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others which are also to be believed. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the explicite Belief of more Propositions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from this, that Jesus is the Messiah, absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary, together with the explicite Belief of
it, to make Men Christians, doth not make that
Proposition more easy to be understood, than it
would be, if the explicite Belief of those other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
were not made absolutely necessary to make
Men Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:57787:65"/>
The Way this Author takes to shew that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is not easy to be understood, is by suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<hi>an inquisitive, labouring, illitera'e Man,</hi> who
knows many things which are delivered in the New
Testament, and who understands what it is for
<hi>Books to be Divinely inspired,</hi> but is ignorant what is
meant by a <hi>Saviour,</hi> asking several Questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Proposition; and another much more
Ignorant than him, answering to every one of these
Questions. I neither like the Questions, nor the
Answers, as they are set down in these Pages, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall only observe</p>
               <p>1. That whoever will reply directly to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Question, must unavoidably give an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Answer. Wherefore when Questions are
not rightly propounded, he that puts them, must
be made sensible of his Mistakes, and assisted to
form them aright.</p>
               <p>2. That if a Person is Inquisitive concerning the
Sense of this Proposition, That Jesus is the Christ,
or only Saviour of Sinners, and doth acknowledge
the true God, make him but throughly sensible of
his own Sin and Guilt, and he will then easily
understand what is meant by a Saviour. Then his
Inquiries will be, how he may be satisfied that the
Person discoursed of, is by God's Appointment, the
only Saviour of Sinners? and on what Terms he
may with good warrant expect Salvation from him?
To which Questions there are very proper, clear,
and plain Answers to be given.</p>
               <p>3. Most of the Questions proposed in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Pages, when rightly formed, must have such
Answers made to them, as Christ doth authorize us
in the Scriptures, to give to them. But what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
can you expect his Answers will have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57787:65"/>
with them, who are not truly convinced, and
therefore do not really believe he is the Messiah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Convince your Querist, though roughly, of that,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Jesus is the Christ or Messiah, so that he
does truly receive him to be his Lord and King,
and then you will find him in a fair way, and very
well disposed to receive Satisfaction, when you
make him perceive that your Answers to his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
are the very same which Christ himself
has given to them, or such as he doth warrant
you to offer for Peoples Satisfaction in those
Cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Author concludes his Book with observing,
That</hi> those Parts of <hi>the Reasonablenes of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
&amp;c. which treat of the Necessity of Revelation,
the Conditions of Repentance, Good Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> seem
to carry an Air of Piety along with them, and to be
writ with such Strength of Iudgment, as may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that the Author had thought more upon them,
than upon any other parts of that Treatise.</p>
               <p>As I think those parts of <hi>the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
&amp;c. here approved by this Author, have
a very pious Relish, and are writ with a Strength,
Vivacity, and Fineness, very much above what is
common; so I fully concur with this <hi>Worthy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
in all, or most of the Points he hath treated
of in his Book, which I have not made some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
on, in these Papers. I will conclude with
taking Notice, that as we are very apt to Imagine
a Person hath thought well on a Point, when he
treate it to our liking; so we are very prone to
fancy he is defective, or in an Error, when his
Discourse upon a Subject, is not such as we
would have it to be. Yet the Mistake may really
be in our selves, and may arise from our having
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57787:66"/>
not exactly enough considered the Matter, when
we impute Neglect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Remisness in Study to him
whose Sentiments are opposite to ours. In such
a Case, People are not to be concluded by the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of those who are for the one side, or the
other, but ought to descend into, and impartially
weigh the Merits of the Cause.</p>
