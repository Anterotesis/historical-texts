            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the 22 Chapter of this Prophecie verſ. 12. makes mention of a day wherein the Lord of Hoſts doth call to weeping and to mourning. And beloved, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is no day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are without Sin, and ſo confequently no day wherein we ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo now; yet there are four ſpeciall dayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Lord God expects this duty from us, <hi>viz.</hi> The day of any heynous wickedneſſe comitted by our ſelves or others. The day of any grievious judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether perſonall or national inflicted. The day wherein the wicked proſper and the ungodly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:133485:3"/>
triumph. Finally the day wherein any of Gods emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and faithfull ſervants are ſnatch't away by death; It is not many dayes ſince there was ſuch a day amongſt us; and of ſuch a day my Text ſpeaks of; and the want of a due ſence and ſorrow, and Mourning when ſuch a day comes, is that which the Prophet bemoans in the words of my Text. <hi>The rightous periſheth &amp; no man layeth it to heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Text is a ſorrowfull and dolefull complaint in every part and clauſe of it, and looketh 2. wayes.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Upon the good, and bemoans their miſery.</item>

            <p>It complains of the Righteous, that their perſons are deſtroy'd. It complains of the wicked, that their hearts are hardned. The former complaint is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from grief, the latter is from grief mixt with anger, both are very vehement and fervent. witneſs the reiteration of the words in both parts. The former in three clauſes. <hi>The Righteous periſh. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull men are taken away. The Righteous are taken away from the evil to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The latter in two clauſes, <hi>no man laying it to heart, none conſidering it.</hi> In which we may ſee what an holy paſſion our holy Prophet was in; and I pray God grant that we may reſemble him in grief and ſorrow, when we heare both of the righteous, and of the wicked.</p>
            <p>Firſt of the complaint the Prophet makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Godly. <hi>The Righteous periſh, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull men are taken away. The Righteous are taken away from the evil to come;</hi> And this complaint
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:133485:3"/>
concerning the righteous you have it firſt propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and then mitigated. Firſt 'its propounded in the two clauſes, (which are for ſubſtance and ſenſe one and the ſame) <hi>The Righteous periſheth, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men are taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But withall ſecondly, The complaint is in the latter part of the verſe, leviated &amp; mitigated, where 'tis ſaid. <hi>The Righteous are taken away from the evil to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look upon the matter of the complaint it ſelf as ſet down in theſe two clauſes. <hi>The Righteous periſh, and mercifull men are taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Where you have ſet before you both their diſpoſition and their condition.</p>
            <p>Their diſpoſition is very good. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is ſeemingly very bad. Their pious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their miſerable condition. The Characters of the one, <hi>viz.</hi> their diſpoſition are theſe two, <hi>Righteous, and mercifull men.</hi> The other <hi>viz.</hi> their condition is ſet forth in theſe two Characters, <hi>Periſhing, and taking away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt we will take the Character, that ſets down their diſpoſition. <hi>The Righteous and mercifull men,</hi> thoſe that the Prophet bemoans are ſaid to be <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and mercifull men.</hi> The firſt word is ſingular in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>

               </gap> where Interpreters, gloſſing upon the Text, ſuppoſe it to be ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Prophet points at, and the gloſſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it of Chriſt himſelf, whoſe paſſion he foreſaw, and conſequently foretells: and theſe titles moſt ſtrictly and fully belong to him who is called the Son

of Righteouſneſſe, <hi>Malachy</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 2. All others are but ſtars of righteouſneſſe, &amp; their lights borrowed from him: he it is who is compleatly righteous, and of him it was verified, he periſhed and was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, none laying it to heart. But we muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it to Chriſt; for although the firſt word be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, the ſecond is plurall. The mercifull men, and men of mercy, which is meant of thoſe righteous ones that were cut off &amp; diſtroyed by <hi>Manaſſes</hi> that fill'd <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with bloud. But that you may ſee how juſtly theſe Characters belong to thoſe perſons; take them a ſunder; firſt he call's them <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>ſervants of God.</hi> Miniſters or others may have this name given them in a qualified ſenſe, <hi>for there are none righteous, no not one,</hi> (ſave him that I named even now) not but that it may belong to them too, for they are Righteous, really, interpretatively and comparatively.</p>
            <p>They are righteous really, in as much as their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are juſtified before God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is called by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, The Lord our Righteouſneſſe.</hi> Ierem. 23. v. 6. who is ſaid to <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us with a robe of righteouſneſs</hi> Iſa. 63. who is ſaid by <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>to be made to us righteouſneſs, and that we are righteouſneſs in him.</hi> Thus they are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous becauſe juſtified, and not onely ſo, but alſo becauſe their natures are renewed after the Image of God, that is cretaed in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, in which reſpect they are partakers of the Divine nature: and alſo righteous in ordering their lives according to the rule of the word, which all
<pb facs="tcp:133485:4"/>
Gods ſervants ſets before them, and ſeek to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording thereunto, that they may give God his due, and men their due; and thus it is true of the ſervant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of God, they are righteous really. And Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively they are ſo, for as much as God is pleaſed to accept them notwithſtanding their weakneſſes, When <hi>Abraham</hi> was to offer up his Son <hi>Iſacak,</hi> it is ſaid, he offered his ſon, in regard he was willing to do it, it was therefore Interpretatively ſo. So the ſervants of God in as much as they are lovers and followers of God, and ſtrive after righteouſneſſe, not allowing themſelves in any wickedneſſe, making conſcience of all known duties, ſo that God accepts them as perfectly righteous.</p>
            <p>And comparatively they are righteous, though not abſolutely, yet comparatively in reſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as it's ſaid of thoſe Worthies St. Ambroſs ſpeaks of. The righteous if compared with the wicked of the world are Worthies, ſo they are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous compared with the ungodly.</p>
            <p>In the foregoing Chapter verſ. 12. the Prophet ſpeaks of certain Epicures and others, which ſay, <hi>we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong Drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more aboundant.</hi> So in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſinners, the ſervants of God may have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of righteous, and not righteous onely, but merciful men, or as the Hebrew hath it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> men of mercy: which may admit of a double conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether taken in a paſſive or active ſence; In a paſſive ſence they are men of mercy: or as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word will further carrie it men of good
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:133485:5"/>
will or favour, they are men to whom God bears a ſingular favour, an eſpecial love; There is a Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropie which God hath to all men, and though he hates the work of their hands, yet he loves the work of his own hands: but God here ſpeaks of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and good will, which he hath to his ſervants, and you have it fully and ſummarily ſet down in the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalme latter end; <hi>The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield, the Lord will give grace and glory,</hi> &amp;c. And according to this conſtruction it may be taken: the Prophet Iſaiah ſpeaking of the righteous, how that they are taken away by men of crueltie, intimates though they are hated by the wicked, they are men of love, in reſpect of God: whilſt the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches and reviles them, yet God loves them, though they periſh and are taken away we muſt not think that God hates them, they are his favorites. Some men think God ſhould not let the wind blow upon his ſervants: but it is not that of a mother, but a fatherly love, with which God loves his children, nor was <hi>Benjamin</hi> the leſſe beloved becauſe the Cup was found with him. The righteous they are ſtill men of mercy, yet I rather conceive we ought to take it in the active ſence, they are men that love mercy and ſhew mercy, and to this I encline in regard of that paralell place the 7. Micah. 2. <hi>The good man is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed from off the earth,</hi> &amp;c. So here men of mercy, that is, men that are practiſers and lovers of mercy. Mercy is a condolencie of others miſery, and withall an endeavour to deliver them out of it, ſo that there is both pittie and bountie, bowels of mercy and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:133485:5"/>
works of mercy, thus a righteous man is a mercifull man: the wiſe man joines them both together Prov. 21. and 21. And indeed they never goe aſunder: our Saviour hath coupled them together, <hi>bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled,</hi> then it followes bleſſed are the mercifull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The righteous have bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, their inwards are troubled at the miſerie of others, and hence their heads conſult which way they may do them good: the liberal man deviſes charritable things upon his bed, and their hearts ake for their brethren, they inquire how, what, which way, to do them good, they are ſtil going out of their doores in mercy, their eyes behold which way they may do acts of mercy, their ears liſten to their complaints, and their hands are ready to relieve; it would be too much time ſpent to let you ſee how this ſpiritual River overflowes, by giving and forgiving, by vouchſafing to our Brethren ſpiritual and corporal Almes, that concerne their ſouls and bodies, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all thoſe injuries they do againſt us: and thus it is true, they are men of mercy as for the wicked, Solomon ſaith, their very mercies are cruel, when they pretend mercy it is in crueltie, nay they ſhew mercy that they may be wicked, but the righteous he ſhews mercy even to his beaſt, it runnes down even unto them, and hence it is here called merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, or men of mercy: but now look upon the complaint it ſelf, and that ſets forth their ſeeming miſerable condition,</p>

            <p n="1">1. There is a periſhing that befalls neither the Righteous nor the wicked: a periſhing of totall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and annihilation. The Pſalmiſt ſaith: Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are like the beaſts that periſh. Senſuall men are ſo in their diſpoſitions, but not in their natures: the beaſt periſhing diſſolveth into his firſt being to nothing, and happy were it, if it were ſo with the wicked, that there were annihilation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And then there is a periſhing that befalls the wicked and not the Righteous: the memory of the wicked ſhall not, but it ſhall not be ſo with the juſt; No dying, no marrying can obliterate their names: but the wicked, their names periſh, &amp; which is worſe there is a periſhing in the Soul, and it is that periſhing which is oppoſed to good, to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good, the Righteous is ſcarcely ſaved, it is not almoſt, they do not periſh hereafter, but the wicked periſh Eternally. But then,</p>

3. There is a periſhing that is common to the Righteous with the wicked: will you know what it is? Underſtand it either of the miſeries of this life (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>if I periſh, I periſh.</hi> Whatever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard we run or fall into, it may be termed a periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or chiefly, periſhing by death, this is common to all: the Prophet <hi>Michael</hi> tels us <hi>the good man is periſhed out of the Earth;</hi> that is he dies: when he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth it is a Relative to periſhing in this world, in this preſent life. So when the Righteous die he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, therefore it was that the Prophet made uſe of this word, to let them ſee what the wicked thought, that the Righteous periſheth, it is not ſo in reallity, and that we might not be troubled at the harſhneſs of the phraſe in the firſt clauſe. Go on to the ſecond, Taking away. God hath given moſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers double; two hands, two feet, two eyes, two eares, that if one faile the other may ſupply, &amp; ſo the ſpirit of God gives two phraſes often in Scripture, that if the one be obſcure, the other may make it plain ſo it is here, leaſt the one ſhould be too hard, here is another to explain it, when he ſaith, Periſh, he means onely taking away from the ſociety of men, that is aIl, as we may very well read the words, the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men are gathered, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> will carry it, they periſh not but rather are gathered to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as that expreſſion in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> the body goes to the grave, and the Soul to heaven, or to him that gave it, it is that they may be gathered to the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels, to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect, to the beatificall viſion; all this is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:133485:7"/>
meant in this one expreſſion, taking away. And the Summe is, the Righteous ones, &amp; the mercifull ones were taken away by death, periſhed from the earth. And ſo this is true in reſpect of a naturall death, the Righteous as well as others periſh, becauſe of the ſame nature and conſtitution, and alſo the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the ſame corruptions that are in them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt die and periſh as well as others, but that which the Prophet aimes at is periſhing in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſenſe, and the phraſe taken away hints as much, <hi>they are taken away and cut of</hi> (as 'its ſpoken of the <hi>Meſsias) from the land of the living.</hi> Theſe candles do not go out of themſelves for want of that which ſhould give them life, but are blown out by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wind; and very well it may be ſo, becauſe of their enemies, <hi>David</hi> ſaith; the wicked watch the Righteous, and why do they watch him, but to take advantage to ſlay him, and this many times befalls the godly ones, and that in great wiſdome, even that the glory of Gods power may appeare, his power in ſuſtaining and upholding them, when by death he brings them to himſelf, eſpecially ſtrengthning them in the hour of a violent death, and his power will appear, in <hi>raiſing of their vile bodies,</hi> that ſhall be in the duſt: in raiſing them, <hi>when their vile bodies ſhall be changed and made like the glorious body of Christ,</hi> &amp; he will have it ſo that their graces may appear, &amp; that their faith may be more eminent: if God ſhould tranſlate them as he did <hi>Eliah</hi> from earth to heaven, there would be ſomething to appear of glory, but nothing of ſtrength, and therefore that the faith
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:133485:7"/>
and courage of his ſervants may appear, he thus takes them away, and chiefly that they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Chriſt, and that he may make the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers like unto the head, and go, as he did, by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death, they muſt drink of the brook and after lift up their heads, therefore this is a juſt complaint, <hi>the Righteous periſh, and mercifull men are taken away.</hi> The conſideration of this may ſerve partly to inform, partly to inſtruct. Firſt to inform us, That there is another world, and day of judgement, that there is a time wherein God will put a difference between the godly and the wicked, between him that ſwears, and him that fears an oath, between him that ſerves him, and him that rebells againſt him: I ſay there muſt be a time of retribution (or he could not be a Righteous and mercifull God) when there muſt be a recompence to godly men, you ſee how the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous periſh as well as the wicked, you ſee the ſame lot befalls the one, as well as the other, it aſſures us therefore that there is another day comming, when it will appear that there is a reward to the godly.</p>
            <p>And it ſhould, ſecondly inſtruct all righteous ones that they ſhould make uſe of this kind of death, for the glory of Gods name, and the good of his own brethren. How ſhould all of us <hi>Magistrates, Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People</hi> approve our ſelves in the diſcharge of our duty, and eſpecially <hi>mercifull men</hi> by ſhewing mercy, multiplying mercy, when the <hi>mercifull man is taken away,</hi> then all is taken away there is no more <hi>work,</hi> nor <hi>almes,</hi> nor <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> for us to do in the grave where we are a going.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:133485:8"/>
and further it ſhould inſtruct us, that we ſhould make uſe of, and make much of the <hi>Righteous men,</hi> that are in the midſt of us, becauſe they muſt <hi>periſh</hi> and <hi>be taken</hi> from us: theſe candles muſt go out, nay they may by a bluſtering wind be blown out, make uſe of them while you have them. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> bids us, <hi>walk in the light while you have the light:</hi> ſo do you, whilſt Gods righteous <hi>ſervants</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> are amongſt you, make the beſt uſe of them you can (as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid, <hi>Me you ſhall not have alwayes with you:</hi> ſo theſe you ſhall not have alwayes with you, therefore endeavour to reap all the <hi>benefit,</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> from them you can. Finally let us not think the worſe of them becauſe they are <hi>taken away,</hi> we are ready to be frighted, becauſe of the trouble that befalls them, but let us remember, that the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> whatever trouble incompaſſes them, they are delivered from it by death, nay that <hi>taking away</hi> of theirs, is a benefit to them, for it is <hi>a taking away from the evil to come.</hi> And that leads me to the other branch, which mitigateth the complaint in the cloſe of the verſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The righteous are taken away from the evil to come. Taken away from the evil to come</hi> is a phraſe which admits of a double conſtruction, we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of being <hi>taken away from the evil to come</hi> upon themſelves, they are taken away from thoſe future evils that (if they had continued longer upon earth,) ſhould have befallen them, thus they are <hi>taken away</hi> from</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. From Poenall evils, from thoſe miſeries and troubles that do befall them in this world: <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God delivers them out of all:</hi> Pain, penurie, aches, ſickneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when the <hi>righteous is taken away,</hi> he is <hi>taken away</hi> from all theſe. But that which is the principal mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word is, <hi>They are taken away from the evil of the place wherein they live,</hi> from the common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie that is to ſeize upon the people: therefore you find in the 26. Iſa. 20. where the Prophet ſaith <hi>Come my people, enter thou into thy Chambers, and ſhut thy doors about thee, hide thy ſelf as it were for a little moment untill the indignation be overpaſt:</hi> ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe <hi>little doors</hi> and <hi>moments, places</hi> and <hi>Chambers,</hi> to be meant of the grave, yet there God hides his people, he puts them in the grave where they are quiet: when he intends to ſend a bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempeſt, and a ſtorm upon the earth. Thus God prepares a <hi>Zoar</hi> for <hi>Lot</hi> when he brings deſtruction upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> and an <hi>Ark</hi> for <hi>Noah,</hi> when he brings a deluge upon the world: ſo God prepares a grave for the righteous, when he intends to bring evil upon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:133485:9"/>
the earth: but this is not alwaies ſo, for God will ſomtimes keep them in the midſt of trouble, he ſets a mark upon their forehead, as in the 9. Ezek. 4. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, go through the midſt of the City, through the midſt of Ieruſalem, and ſet a mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foreheads of the men that ſigh &amp; that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</hi> And ſometimes God makes them ſharers and ſufferers in the evils, becauſe they have not mourned for the ſinnes of the <hi>times</hi> and <hi>places</hi> where they live; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God makes them partakers of the miſerie; but God many times <hi>takes them away from the evil to come.</hi> Thus Joſiah is taken away from the evil that was to come upon the Jews: and St. Auſtin's prayers were heard, God taking him away before <hi>Hippo</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, whereof he was Bp: and Luther was taken out of the world before the deſolation came that fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Germany:</hi> thus is Gods dealing in the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of his ſervants, and that upon a double account.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The chief account why he takes them away, is, that they may not keep of the evil that is to befall any people: for the <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>mercifull men</hi> are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:133485:9"/>
the <hi>Chariots</hi> &amp; <hi>horſmen</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that do defend the places where they live; the <hi>Angel</hi> told <hi>Lot</hi> he could do nothing againſt the Citie until he was out of it: &amp; you know what God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Let me alone,</hi> &amp;c. A good man (as it were,) ties Gods hands that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring evil upon a place, one righteous man may do more with God by prayer, then a thouſand men by armes: there is a great prevalencie in the prayers of the righteous, And when God will bring evil upon a place, he firſt takes away the righteous, that they may not keep it off: as when a man will take down a houſe, he firſt takes away the pillars and ſupporters thereof: ſo when God intends to deſtroy a people, he remooves the pillars that ſupport them; God takes away the righteous, as on the one hand they may not ſee; ſo on the other hand they may nor prevent the evils he intends to inflict.</p>
            <p>To wind up this in a word of uſe. Look on the one hand as there is little Cauſe for the wicked to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over the righteous when they are taken away, <hi>(Rejoyce not over me, O mine enemy)</hi> ſaith the Church; I ſay little Cauſe have the wicked to rejoyce for the taking away of the good, becauſe it is a ſad preſage to the bad. The <hi>Righteous being taken away, if ſuch things be done to the green tree, what shall be done to the dry: If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where shall the wicked appeare;</hi> If that the righteous be taken away from the evil to come, it is that the evil may come upon a place: it is an undeniable conſequence if God deal ſeverely with his own: the wicked muſt exſpect his cup to be filled to the full. If theſe periſh for a time, thoſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:133485:10"/>
for ever: therefore let not the wicked triumph, and as there is no reaſon why the wicked ſhould rejoyce, ſo no cauſe why the friends of the righteous ſhould be too much troubled when they periſh by what hand ſoever? for all the righteous ſervants of God when they are to be taken away, ſay to us (as our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> ſaid to the Woman, <hi>weep not for me,)</hi> weep not for us, weep for your ſelves, and as they are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from evil, ſo they are received unto good; they are taken from a Priſon to be ſeated in a Palace; they are taken from a Wilderneſſe to be tranſplanted into a Garden; they are taken away from earth and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Heaven; no reaſon therfore to weep for them, but for your ſelves: the evil to come cannot light on them; but on us; but let them not be diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by us, we are not to be ſtupid under ſuch a divine providence, leaſt we incurre the ſin which the Prophet here complaines of: and ſo I come to the complaint of the Prophet againſt the wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing their obſtinacie, the righteous periſheth and no man layeth it to heart: &amp; mercifull men are taken away, none conſidering that the righteous are taken away from the evil to come: no man layes it to heart, no man conſiders it; the phraſes which the Prophet makes uſe of, are very emphatical.</p>
            <p>The firſt phraſe according to the Hebrew is, <hi>no man puts it upon his heart;</hi> and the latter, <hi>no man doth underſtand or ſeriouſly weigh,</hi> or dewly conſider: ſo that one phraſe hath reference to the affections, the other to the judgement: no man laies it to heart, ſo as to affect it, no man conſiders, it ſo as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:133485:10"/>
it, and theſe two well agree together, and the one infers the other: that which a man laies to heart, he will conſider, if the heart be affected, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will be imployed: a man cannot but revolve that which he is cut and ſtrucken with; by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it we lay it to heart: <hi>While I Muſe the fire kindled:</hi> there is an affection in the mind toward the object, if it be of delight it brings joy, if ſadneſs it brings ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and theſe two phraſes are very fruitfull expreſt here, <hi>no man lays it to heart, no man conſiders it,</hi> And obſerve what the ſin is that the Prophet charges with, and complaines againſt: it was not a ſin of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, no, it was a ſin of omiſſion; it was neglect of duty: it is as horrid impiety to omit what God commands us to do, which he forbids; Remember we do provoke God as much by omitting to do good, as by doing thoſe things he hath forbid. Many men pleaſe themſelves pharaſaically.</p>
            <p>When the ſinfull neglect of any known duty, being judgement, as ſoon as the doing of a known ſin, I ſay it is the not doing of our known duty makes us culpable, and that ſin here charged on us is not the rejoycing, and triumphing when the godly are taken away, but the not laying it to heart that argues a man to be in the depth of wickedneſs, to come to ſit in the ſeat of the ſcorners, to deride at the calamities of the godly, and make their tears his drink, and their ruins his play and ſport, this is the depth of wickedneſſe when men rejoyce at the miſeries and ruins of the righteous, but it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, or laying to heart the miſeries of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

of God that is here onely meant, though you will find that a great ſin, the not laying to heart their being taken away. One would think it but a a ſmall thing, but you will find it a great ſin, not to lay it to heart when the rightous are taken away. For 1. take notice it is the periſhing of the righteous. <hi>When any man dies, the living will lay it to heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon:</hi> And ſhall not the living lay it to heart, when not an ordinary man but a good man, one of the Prophets of God and thoſe righteous, mercifull and eminent ones are taken away. Shall ſuch ſtars fall from the firmement, and no eyes behold it? no heart conſider it? Put thoſe altogether, it was the righteous that is periſhing: and beſides, when we conſider, it was not an ordinary but a violent death. When a good man dies naturally, the living will lay it to heart, much more when cut of, when he might have lived lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and then conſider all oportunities of doing good is taken away, and when not an ordinary perſon, and that not by an ordinary death, periſhing, and more then ſo, <hi>taken away,</hi> and when this <hi>periſhing and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the righteous</hi> was a prediction that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned themſelves of their ruin, their judgements, was at hand, and ready to overtake and overthrow them, and they not to conſider it: &amp; adde to this that this ſhall be ſo, and that there ſhould not be a man to conſider it, not as if there was none at all; there were ſome though, the number be but very ſmall that did bemoan and lay this thing to heart, yet it is uſuall in Scripture to expreſſe where there is but a few, as if there was none at all, as in the 53 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.

            <p>And as it is a ſin againſt them, ſo likewayes it is an evil againſt our ſelves, it argues a ſtupid mind, a ſecure heart, and an obdurate ſpirit that is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with ſuch providentiall diſpenſations againſt us, eſpecially when it preſages judgement and miſery to come upon a people, and yet it ſhould not work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.

            <p>I beſeech you in the fear of God, let us learn to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the contrary, and to lay to heart the miſeries, diſtreſſes, and periſhings of the ſervants of God; but eſpecially when they die by a violent death, the Sun daily ſhines and noe man regards it, but when once it is in an Eclipſe, then every eye will be upon it, neither do men mind the high mountains when ſtanding, but if it chance to fall then every eye conſider it, and ſhall we not take notice of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes of Gods faithfull ſervants, and ſo lay them to heart by remembring to regiſter the deeds of Gods faithfull ſervants. How, and when taken away, and withall bemoaning, and bewailing both the miſeries they ſuffer, and the Calamities we are like to ſuffer, by reaſon they are <hi>taken away from the evil to come,</hi>

and by imitating their vertues following their graces, ſetting before us their exemplary lives, and treading in their ſteps, ſo as to prepare for dying, for ſuffering, in the like or any other kind, that death may not find us unprovided: and if we do live to prepare for the evil to come, judgement is at hand. Let us be making our peace with God by repenting of our own, and the ſins of the land, that when the evil comes it may not come upon us unprepared, and though we be taken away, we may be but taken to the fruition of Glory and happineſſe; and that I may not be guilty of this ſin, I here declaime againſt it. I dare not but ſtir up my ſelf and you, ſadly and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſtir up you and me to lay to heart this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull man of God, this righteous man that hath been lately taken from us, I hope none will envy his Character: if we look no further then his death, it was a violent death, but as for the cauſe of his death it concernes not me, it muſt be referred to that great day, the day of judgement, I hope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence to any here, I may look to the manner of his death, the righteous are ſaid to be bold as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and hath hopes in his death, and what is this but the ſerene conſequence of a well led life, that made him meekly bold, and humbly confident, and chearful at his diſſolution: of all acts of mercies none is greater then that of forgiving enemies, which that he did, witneſſe thoſe lines, thoſe excellent lines read at his interrment, or thoſe gracious charitable words, and prayers he uttered upon the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> which proclaims him a man full of grace &amp; mercy,
