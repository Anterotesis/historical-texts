            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> TO THE Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>IT was in Obedience to the desire of an <hi>Honourable Friend</hi> that this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Discourse</hi> was written; that it was confined to such narrow lounds; and that it is now Published. He thought it requisite that such <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics</hi> as are not at leasure to read <hi>Volums</hi> of <hi>Controversies,</hi> should be instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how to give a rational Account to Modern <hi>Sectaries, why they are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics?</hi> and he thought also that to justifie such their Profession, a long <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> would not be necessary. This occasioned the following <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Question</hi> proposed in the <hi>Title:</hi> which <hi>Answer,</hi> if rational and satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will prevent or rather determine, all other particular <hi>Questions</hi> about <hi>Religion,</hi> the debating of which furnishes the world with <hi>Books</hi> to fill great <hi>Libraries.</hi> But what fate soever shall befal this <hi>Answer</hi> in the esteem of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> certain it is that the method of it is unquestionably useful, by which is shewed that the <hi>Controversie</hi> about the <hi>Church</hi> is first of all to be seriously debated: because what <hi>Party</hi> soever shall be able to give convincing <hi>Proofs</hi> that their <hi>Church</hi> is the same, or a true <hi>Member</hi> of the same <hi>Church</hi> which we believe in the <hi>Creed,</hi> shall thereby evince that all accusations laid against her are false and groundless, and all separation from her damnable. And on the other side it will be to no purpose to examine the Tenets of a Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prejudged to be a false <hi>Church,</hi> that is, to want the inseparable <hi>Marks</hi> of a <hi>true Church,</hi> signifyed by these words in our <hi>Creeds, One, Holy, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic and Apostolic Church,</hi> denoting <hi>Unity of Faith, Sanctity of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Universality and uninterrupted Succession of Teachers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors from the Apostles,</hi> to be necessary <hi>Signs</hi> of a <hi>true Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for as much as regards the following <hi>Discourse,</hi> if any one shall think fit to undertake a <hi>Reply</hi> to it; he may please to take notice, that (unless he intend to make quarrels useless and endless) the only <hi>proper Reply</hi> will be his <hi>Answer</hi> to another like Question, which he may suppose to be proposed to him by a <hi>Catholic,</hi> viz. <hi>How can a Protestant think himself safe in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which never was incorporated in any Church whatsoever existent before the</hi> (pretended) <hi>Reformation?</hi> This <hi>Question,</hi> if seriously and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally resolved, and especially if the <hi>Resolution</hi> of it be justifyed by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of</hi> (by us all approved) <hi>Antient Catholic Doctors,</hi> it will then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be esteemed of considerable force against this following <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Why are you a Catholic?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this renewed Impression, the Author thought expedient that such a <hi>Second Question</hi> should be proposed, as by a <hi>Catholic</hi> to a <hi>Protestant,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding reciprocally of him, <hi>Why are you a Protestant?</hi> To which Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion an Answer is framed, the most suitable to <hi>Protestants</hi> grounds, that the Author could devise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49046:3"/>He is not ignorant that this fashion of writing <hi>Controversies Dialogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi> is oft obnoxious to exceptions, and not unjust suspicions of partiality and prevarication: For indeed we sometimes see <hi>Dialogues,</hi> in which the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> (who may make their pretended <hi>Adversaries,</hi> to speak as they themselves please) do put foolish <hi>Answers</hi> into their mouths, and then laugh at them: presuming thereby to have gained a Victory.</p>
            <p>But such a poor shift as this the <hi>Author</hi> protests against. The allegations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Roman Church</hi> brought in by the <hi>Protestant,</hi> are, in the <hi>Authors</hi> opinion, the most considerable that are to be found among <hi>Protestant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertists,</hi> which allegations <hi>he</hi> is permitted also to deliver in a Stile, for its sharpness, becoming a Protestant now <hi>a la Mode.</hi> True it is, the <hi>Author</hi> could not possibly make him answer pertinently and directly to the <hi>Question.</hi> But whose fault is that? No such Answer, with tolerable satisfaction, as far as the <hi>Author</hi> could inform himself, could be found <hi>in rerum natura.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if any <hi>Protestant Reader</hi> shall dislike the <hi>Author's</hi> introducing his <hi>Protestant</hi> sometimes relenting, or convinced that some <hi>Catholic Doctrines</hi> are too oft falsly and maliciously represented by <hi>Adversaries,</hi> the <hi>Authours</hi> excuse must be, that he having according to his conscience demonstrated so much, his duty was to shew his <hi>Adversary</hi> a rational, honest man, that is, such a one as will be satisfyed with reason: and indeed with no other is he willing to treat.</p>
            <p>However, if this do not content the <hi>Reader,</hi> he may do well to frame a better <hi>Protestant Answer</hi> to the general <hi>Question [Why are you a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant?]</hi> But except such his <hi>Answer</hi> be indeed precisely pertinent, and proper to the clearing his <hi>Church</hi> from the Charge of <hi>Schism,</hi> either by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that she is indeed a true Member, incorporated into the <hi>Body</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, believed in our Common Creed; Or that she is innocent, and not chargeable with <hi>Schism,</hi> though she be not, yea abhors to be, so incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he would do much better to save his labour. No other Answer can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent: No excursions into Invectives against any other <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> will be at all to the purpose. Except therefore the pretended <hi>Answer</hi> be qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as hath been said, he must give the present <hi>Author</hi> leave to protest against it, as <hi>no Answer</hi> at all; notwithstanding which Protestation the Protestant may, and probably will, take leave to think and proclaim it unanswerable.</p>
            <p>Now the rather to invite <hi>him</hi> to undertake such a just, though unusual, and hitherto unpractised a <hi>Task,</hi> the Author does here freely acknowledg, that was a principal end of his Writing and Publishing this <hi>Discourse:</hi> for the truth is, the World has been too long, and too much, abused with imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies and malicious <hi>Buffo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ries,</hi> to the perverting of Souls, encrease of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,</hi> and shame of our <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another considerable <hi>Motive</hi> also of composing this short <hi>Discourse,</hi> was a desire in the <hi>Author</hi> to take occasion to deliver briefly the <hi>Catholic Church's Doctrines,</hi> as they are in themselves, and freed from the curious fancies of <hi>School-men,</hi> and misprision of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> to the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the good of Souls</p>

Is it not an Obligation imposed on those who live respectively in any of these, to be subject to the peculiar Government and Laws there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished? This appears plainly, in that wheresoever any one obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuses such submission, he is esteemed and treated as a Rebel, a Fugitive, an outlawed person, and utterly deprived of all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and emoluments belonging to the said Body.</p>

                  <p>Apply this then to <hi>God's Church. St. Paul</hi> says expresly, it is <hi>one Body:</hi> your <hi>Creed</hi> obliges you to call it <hi>One:</hi> The Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to a <hi>City at Unity in it self:</hi> and to a <hi>well ordered Army with Banners,</hi> under which all Soldiers are reduced in their ranks, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Generals command, signifyed by subordinate officers. Such a society is Gods Church: It is the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> which if once divided cannot stand. But by his promise it (and no other Kingdom besides it) shall stand for ever; and therefore it shall never be <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> but all its members shall continue in their order. Now what makes such Order; but obedience to Government and Laws? Can you Imagine any other, excluding this?</p>

                  <p>I must confess, I cannot, For it is plain, that where every one will be a Law to himself, there can be no <hi>Order</hi> nor <hi>Unity,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confusion and endless Divisions.</p>

                  <p>First then, Sir, I am a <hi>Catholick</hi> because I believe that <hi>Christ the Author and Finisher of our Faith</hi> is infinitely both <hi>good, wise</hi> and <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent.</hi> His <hi>goodness</hi> inclined him to come down into this world to save mankind, by establishing a Church upon earth, which should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main till the end of the world, and in which the way to Heaven should be so taught, as not only the Wise and Learned, but the Poor, Simple and Ignorant also should by Faith and Obedience be made partakers of Eternal Happiness.

                  <p>The <hi>general</hi> efficacious <hi>means</hi> to accomplish this, are first, <hi>The revealing his whole will to his Church;</hi> which we acknowledg to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently done in <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> as to all <hi>points</hi> absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation, though in all those <hi>points</hi> not so clearly to every one, that without a <hi>Teacher</hi> their sense may not be mistaken: Neither doth <hi>Scripture</hi> make an express discernment of what <hi>points</hi> are necessary. And secondly, The assisting of this his Church with fidelity and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant performance of her duty in declaring all necessary Divine Truth manifested to her, to her Subjects; with a command, that all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans should obey and submit to what she shall teach or enjoyn them.</p>
                  <p>God having thus revealed his whole Will to his <hi>one Catholic Church,</hi> it necessarily and evidently follows. 1. That <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Error,</hi> in any Points of Christian Doctrine necessary to Salvation, is damnable. 2.

Some</hi> absolutely deny <hi>Freewill,</hi> whilst <hi>others</hi> exalt the power of it so high, as to affirm <hi>Divine Grace</hi> unnecessary to its best Operations. <hi>Some</hi> affirm our Nature to be so incurably polluted by <hi>Original Sin</hi> as that all the best actions of the Regenerate are <hi>Mortal Sins; Others</hi> will acknowledge no <hi>Original Sin</hi> at all. <hi>Some</hi> affirm <hi>Baptism</hi> necessary to Salvation, even of <hi>Infants: Others</hi> reject <hi>Infant-Baptism:</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists</hi> assert, that <hi>Infants</hi> without <hi>Baptism</hi> are sanctified by their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faith:</hi> and that some <hi>Infants</hi> dying, though baptized may be damned. <hi>Some</hi> believe mans Soul to be mortal, and that it perisheth with the Body, not having any Knowledg or Sentiment after death: <hi>Some</hi> confine <hi>God</hi> to a determinate place in Heaven, and also deny his <hi>Prescience of future Contingents. Lastly some</hi> deny an <hi>Eternity of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Hell.</hi> Surely you will not deny most of these to be contrary to <hi>Fundamental Doctrines</hi> of our <hi>Faith:</hi> yet all who maintain these <hi>Tenets,</hi> and all Sectaries who contradict them, do ground themselves upon <hi>express Scripture,</hi> which to you seems so clear. You cannot be more confident that you have light on the true sence of <hi>Scripture,</hi> than they of a contrary sense, and only <hi>self-love</hi> and <hi>selfe-esteem</hi> determine both the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>Can it then be prudence in any man to hazard <hi>Eternity</hi> upon his own sence of <hi>Scripture,</hi> the half of which perhaps he never read?

                  <p>Truly, Sir, I do not know through what <hi>Spectacles</hi> you look upon this <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>Protestancy,</hi> which hath been indeed the constant Principle of all <hi>Ancient-Herities.</hi> But to me it appears most horribly gastly, and only fit to be acknowledged the invention of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the foul Spirit of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>contention,</hi> who presents to unwary <hi>Christians</hi> once more this <hi>fruit of the Tree of the knowledg of good and evil,</hi> to be aspired to by our own endeavors, and contrary to <hi>Gods</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore (as hath been said) there are but those <hi>two ways</hi> to arrive at the knowleg of <hi>Divine Mysteries</hi> contained in <hi>Scripture</hi> (yet so contained as that the Texts in which they are contained are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be miss-understood) <hi>viz.

                     </hi> I have enforces me to chuse this latter way, because thereby I shall avoid inconstancy, otherwise unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: as I am taught by <hi>St. Paul,</hi> who sayes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That therefore <hi>God placed in his Church Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers for the edification of the Body of Christ:</hi> a Succession of which is to last <hi>till we all meet in the Unity of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> This Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God did, says he, <hi>To the end we should not be like children, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, through the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of men, and cunning of such as would circumvent us with errour:</hi> the only remedy whereof, in the Apostles judgment, is, submission to Authority. To which submission also I am obliged by an express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>God</hi> [<hi>Obedite praepositis vestris,</hi> &amp;c.] Heb. 13. 17. <hi>Obey them that are set over you, and submit your selves, for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account</hi>—And <hi>Reason</hi> thus divinely enlightned, obliging me to submit to <hi>Authority,</hi> I should renounce the same <hi>Reason</hi> utterly, if I should not prefer that Society which (by an evident Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from the foresaid Apostles and Pastors) makes the best claim thereto; yea, which alone claims an Authority obliging the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that is the <hi>Catholics Church;</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> whereof is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the greatest in the world.

themselves; yet there is not any one of them which dares assume to themselves that <hi>eminence</hi> of <hi>Authority</hi> which manifestly appears in her.

Consequently he has chalked out a way to Heaven, in which the Ignorant and Simple may walk securely: And in what other way can these walk, but in that of <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</hi> This doubtless is that way foretold by the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 35. 8. saying in Christs Kingdom, <hi>There shall be a high way—and it shall be called a holy way.

                  <p>But this is most unreasonable, because though it were true, that the <hi>Church</hi> from which they separated were indeed guilty of teaching <hi>Errors,</hi> yet are <hi>Protestants</hi> justly and unanswerably charged with <hi>Schism</hi> in a high degree, in as much as they remain divided, not from the <hi>Roman</hi> only, but all <hi>Patriarchal</hi> and all other <hi>Churches</hi> existent before their <hi>Separation:</hi> So that if there be such a Crime as Schism, they are manifestly guilty of it: and by consequence it would be damnable in any one to joyn in their <hi>Communion.</hi> To make this charge good against them, it will be fully sufficient to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the <hi>confession</hi> of all <hi>Christians,</hi> (and of <hi>themselves</hi> (also

                  <p>It was indeed a <hi>Title</hi> full of arrogance, and therefore justly condemned by St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in the <hi>Notion,</hi> in which he conceived it might be understood, as if the <hi>Patriarch</hi> pretended thereby to be esteemed the only legitimate <hi>Bishop</hi> in the [Eastern] <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For thence it would follow, that all other <hi>Bishops</hi> were only his <hi>Substitutes,</hi> acting by his commission, and removeable by him at pleasure: Whereas they claim a reception of their <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> immediately from <hi>Christ</hi> alone.

was that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> condemned in that <hi>Patriarch,</hi> and abhorred to accept himself, as plainly appears by his <hi>Epistles.</hi> But yet that he had a <hi>Superintendence</hi> over the whole <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>Supreme Pastor</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to receive and judge <hi>Appeals</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> from all Parts <hi>in causis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joribus;</hi> to oblige all <hi>Prelates,</hi> even <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> to the Profession of the Faith established in Councils, and the observance of the <hi>Churches Laws,</hi> and to impose <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures</hi> on all Transgressors of them, this St. <hi>Gregory</hi> challenged, and to this the <hi>Prelates</hi> both of the <hi>Western,</hi> and <hi>Eastern Churches</hi> also submitted, as appears by many <hi>Epistles</hi> sent by him, and <hi>Answers</hi> received from several <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and other <hi>Prelates</hi> in the <hi>East.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Prophesies</hi> themselves are thus expresly set down in the <hi>Old Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,</hi> and acknowledged by <hi>Protestants</hi> to regard the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> The Prophet <hi>Isai</hi> writes thus: <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. 2, 3. <hi>The Lord shall rise upon thee, and his Glory shall be seen upon thee.</hi> ver. 5. <hi>And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightness of thy rising</hi>—ver. 10. <hi>The abundance of the Sea shall be converted unto thee: the</hi>

                  <p>Now, Sir, consider the force of illgrounded prejudices.

to be a <hi>Conversion,</hi> but rather a <hi>Perversion,</hi> and therefore wonder that they do not to this day see those Prophecies accomplished, which were made above two thousands years since, In so much as <hi>Castalio</hi> Professes, <hi>The more I do peruse the Scriptures, the less do I find these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi>

For mine own part, I do sincerely protest to you, that unless I would renounce all other <hi>Guides</hi> to eternal Happiness, but an over-weaning <hi>Fancie</hi> of mine own abilities, or blind <hi>passion</hi> against all <hi>Guides</hi> establish'd in <hi>Gods Church:</hi> if <hi>Divine Revelation, consent of Antiquity, manifest Reason, and even experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by outward Sensation</hi> may be fit to guide me, I must not be a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi> I must of necessity be a <hi>Roman Catholic.</hi> For <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> (interpreted also by consent of <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi>) informs me, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath established on Earth a <hi>visible Church,</hi> which is, <hi>one holy</hi> and <hi>Catholic,</hi> the <hi>common Mother</hi> and only authentick <hi>Teacher</hi> of all <hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; that</hi> this <hi>Church</hi> shall remain such to the end of the World: and <hi>that</hi> whosoever is not a true faithful <hi>Member</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> is thereby cut off from the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and shall be eternally separated from <hi>Him. Again,</hi> evident <hi>Reason</hi> shews, that no Person, or <hi>Society,</hi> can be esteemed a <hi>Member</hi> of any <hi>Church</hi> any other way, than by believing its <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and being subject to its <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> In the <hi>third place,</hi> the <hi>testimony</hi> of our <hi>Senses</hi> assures us, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49046:15"/>
not any of our <hi>Modern Sects</hi> do assent to the <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the <hi>Laws</hi> of any <hi>Church</hi> at all (and consequently not of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi>) which had a being at their first (pretended) <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> therefore upon these <hi>grounds</hi> it evidently follows, that all the said <hi>Sects</hi> are manifestly guilty of <hi>Schism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover, since</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> is that <hi>Church</hi> of which the <hi>first Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> once were <hi>Members,</hi> and by <hi>reforming</hi> made a <hi>separation</hi> from it, and <hi>since</hi> the <hi>same Church</hi> does constantly profess the same <hi>Doctrines</hi> which were once held by the <hi>Universal Body of Orthodox Christians;</hi> and again, <hi>since</hi> there is not any <hi>visible Church</hi> upon earth to which all <hi>marks</hi> of the <hi>true Church</hi> assigned in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and by the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> can be so applied, and whereto the <hi>Antient Prophecies</hi> and the <hi>Promises</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> have been so perfectly accomplished, as the <hi>Roman;</hi> it will evidently <hi>follow,</hi> that the <hi>present Roman Catholic Church</hi> ought to be acknowledged that <hi>one Holy Catholic Church,</hi> which we confess in the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> and <hi>by consequence</hi> whatsoever <hi>Doctrines,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Faith</hi> professed in this <hi>Church,</hi> are taught by <hi>Protestants,</hi> they are thereby, without any particular discussion, <hi>legitimately prejudged</hi> to be <hi>formal Heresies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> being by all (even by <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> themselves) acknowledged most dreadfully wasting <hi>Crimes,</hi> of which I cannot possibly be guilty whilst I adhere to the <hi>Roman Catholic Church,</hi> nor avoid the guilt of them by forsaking its <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</hi> I conceive I have, without any necessity of engaging in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Disputes,</hi> given you rational <hi>Grounds</hi> enabling me to afford a sufficient <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Question</hi> first proposed by you, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>There are certain illustrious <hi>marks</hi> assigned by the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> to distinguish the true <hi>Catholic Church</hi> from Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> such are <hi>Unity; Succession, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality, Converting of Nations, Miracles,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>propterea</hi>] The Prophets have spoken more obscurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christ, than concerning the Church. The reason hereof I conceive to be, because they foresaw in Spirit, that men would make divisions and parties, and that they would not much dispute about Christ himself, but that they would raise great contentions about the Church. Therefore that was more plainly foretold, and more openly prophecyed concerning which, greater contentions would in succeeding times be raised to the end a heavier judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should befall those who saw [<hi>the Church</hi>] and yet fled out of it.</p>

They being cut off from the compacted Body of the Church of Christ, and by holding a part being deprived of the whole, will not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the whole earth, over which the glory of Christ, is spread. O Heretical Madness! Thou believest with me that which thou doest not see: and thou deniest that which both thou and I do see.

               <p>Saint Augustine <hi>informs us that a</hi> certain acquaintance of his deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Disciples of Catholic Faith, by which men were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe [<hi>the Church</hi>] not being taught by <hi>demonstrative</hi> Reasons
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49046:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what was true. <hi>To satisfie this Friend, he wrote his Book</hi> De Utilitate<note place="margin">Id de Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate.</note> credendi [Ecclesiae] <hi>in which he writes thus,</hi> It is fitly instituted by the Majesty of Catholic Discipline, that those who come to Religion, should before all other things be perswaded to believe [<hi>the Church</hi>] But you will say, were it not better that Reason should be employed to move me, which without any temerity I might follow withersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it leads me? Perhaps it might be so: But since to come to the knowledge of God by Reason is a matter of so great importance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficulty, do you think that generally all men are capable of searching into the Reasons by which mens minds may be brought to a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Divine Mysteries? Or are the greatest number of men such? or but a few? I suppose you will answer, But a few. If so, do you think that the knowledg of Religion is to be denyed to all the rest, who have not so piercing a Judgment?——It is a miserable thing to be deceived by Authority; but it is much more miserable not to be moved by it. If Gods Providence does not preside over human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, there will be no cause why we should trouble our selves about Religion—We ought not therefore to despair that some Authority is constituted by God, by which those who walk doubtfully may be raised up to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Puto si quis Sapiens extitisset</hi>—] I conceive that if there were extant<note place="margin">Aug. de Unitate Eccl. c. 19.</note> a wise man to whom our Lord had given his Testimony, [viz. <hi>that he should be directed by him:</hi>] and if that man were consulted by us concerning this controversie, we should not at all doubt to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he enjoyned us, least we should be adjudged to oppose our selves, not so much to that man himself, as to our Lord Jesus Christ, by whose Testimony he is recommended. Now such Testimony doth our Lord afford to his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haeretici qui cum in unitate</hi>—] Heretics, who though they be not<note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. 41.</note> in Catholic Unity and Communion, yet Glory in the title of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are compelled to oppose Orthodox Believers, and they have the boldness to attempt the seducing unskilful Christians by force of disputing and Reasoning, whereas our Lord came with a peculiar Medicine against this, when he enjoyned (<hi>not reasoning, but</hi>) Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all people. But Heretics are forced to take the way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by reason, because they see themselves in a most abject Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if their Authority be compared with Catholic Authority. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they endeavour to prevail by a pretence and promise of Reason
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49046:19"/>
against the most unshaken Authority of the firmly established Church. This is the uniform, and, as it were, regular temerity of all Heretics. But the most clement Emperor of our Faith has fortified with the Citadel of Authority his Church, both by numerous Congregations of People and Nations, and the Chairs of his Apostles; He also by a few piously learned and truly Spiritual men has armed his Church with most copious provisions of invincible Reason. But the more secure and rational Discipline is, That those who are ignorant or infirm should be received within the Castle of Faith (<hi>depending on Authority</hi>) that they may be defended by those who can combate with the weapons of most powerful Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Noc nos ipsi tale aliquid auderemus asserere</hi>—) Neither durst we affirm<note place="margin">Aug. de. Baptismo cont. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. l. 2.</note> any such thing (viz. <hi>that Hereties ought not to be rebaptized</hi>) if we were not strengthned by the unanimous Authority of the universal Church: To which Authority, no doubt, <hi>Cyprian</hi> (<hi>who held the contrary</hi>) would have submitted, if in his time the truth of this question had been established by the examination and decision of a Plenary Council.</p>

For though the success of examining Scriptures should not be such, that each party should have no advantage over the other; yet due order requires that that should be first proposed, about which at present we are to dispute, <hi>viz.</hi> to which of the parties (<hi>the preaching of</hi>) Faith belongs: who have right to the Scriptures: from whom, and by whom, and when, and to whom that Discipline has been delivered by which men are made Christians: For where the Truth both of Christian Discipline and Faith shall appear to be, there also will be the Truth of Scriptures and Expositions, and all Christian Traditions.</p>

Hereto we answer, (according as we have received from Holy and learned men before us) that they must be very careful to interpret Scriptures according to the Traditions of the Universal Church, and according to the Rules of Catholic Doctrine.</p>

And by consequence that when they are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally restrained to different particular Senses by interpretation of <hi>Catholic writers,</hi> such Interpretations are not necessarily to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by you: And much less are other Doctrins, by inference drawn from them, to be esteemed Points of <hi>Catholic Faith,</hi> but only Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of particular Divines, which do not oblige to Assent.</p>

                     <hi>Sir, Truth</hi> and a <hi>Good intention</hi> make me confident, that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace,</hi> which is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> will accompany them. Whereas therefore you say, That <hi>Roman Doctrines are apparently,</hi> or evidently <hi>contrary to Scripture:</hi> I desire you to take into consideration that the same <hi>Roman Church,</hi> at the same time, both proposed the <hi>Belief</hi> of those <hi>Doctrins</hi> to your first <hi>Reformers,</hi> and also gave them the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> testifying that they were the infallible <hi>Word of God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly it was far from being evident to <hi>her</hi> that her <hi>Doctrines</hi> did evidently contradict <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> Now you will not surely deny but that in the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> there are men as learned, and those in a far greater number, than among <hi>Protestants,</hi> Men, I say, who also make the <hi>Scriptures</hi> their principal study, and have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished almost innumerable <hi>Commentaries</hi> on them; again, <hi>Men,</hi> of whom a great number live sequestred from the world, in an assiduous Practice of Spiritual <hi>Prayer,</hi> and therefore not likely to have their judgments perverted by worldly interests: Yet not any one of these does see, or but suspect that the <hi>Faith</hi> they profess is contradicted by <hi>Gods Word:</hi> on the contrary, they invincibly demonstrate, that the <hi>Church</hi> has been, as the only <hi>Depository</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> so likewise of the <hi>true Sence</hi> of it: How comes then that to be evident to you, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49046:23"/>
is invisible to them? Which way went the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> from the whole <hi>Church,</hi> to inhabite a debauched <hi>incestuous Fryer,</hi> or a <hi>stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Pichard,</hi> upon whose credit doubtless you have taken up your <hi>Evidence?</hi> If they could have shewed you in <hi>Scripture</hi> such passages as these, <hi>The Pope is not the Supream Bishop and Visible Head of the Church: Bread by Sanctification does not become the Body of Christ; We ought not to confess our sins to Priests: Purgatory is a meer humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It is an injury to Christ to desire Saints, but none to desire Sinners, to pray for us,</hi> &amp;c. Such <hi>sayings</hi> indeed as these might have justifyed your charge against the <hi>Church,</hi> that she contradicts <hi>Scripture.</hi> But where are such sayings to be found, except it be in the <hi>Heretical Writings,</hi> of your <hi>Reformers?</hi> On the contrary, some <hi>Points</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to those are found litterally contained in <hi>Scripture;</hi> and to elude them you are foced to have recourse to <hi>figurative sences,</hi> and the rest are conveyed to us by the same <hi>Authority,</hi> by which we receive the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self, Yea by the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> justified as consonant to <hi>Scripture:</hi> and however I suppose you will not say, that <hi>silence</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivolent to express contradiction. The utmost that you can say is, that perhaps you can produce now and then some scattered <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> from which you can make a shew of arguing against some <hi>Tenets</hi> of the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> But what will that avail you, since <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> (as hath been said) will not excuse you for omitting a necessary <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> and incurring the horible guilt of <hi>Schism.</hi> Where now do you see an evidence that the Church contradicts <hi>Scripture?</hi>

                  <p>Now the necessity of such a <hi>standing Authority</hi> in <hi>Gods Church</hi> is thus grounded. The <hi>absolutely Supream Ecclesiastical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> against which can lye no <hi>Appeal,</hi> is confessedly residing in a <hi>lawful General Council,</hi> by which all <hi>Debates</hi> whatsoever may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, all necessary <hi>Laws</hi> enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it being a matter of infinite difficulty, especially since the division of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> to bring together so vast an <hi>Assembly</hi> from all Regions, and yet <hi>Unity,</hi> essential to the <hi>Church,</hi> being always to be preserved, which cannot be done without a <hi>supereminent Goverment</hi> always existent, hence it is come to pass that the <hi>supream Bishop</hi> and <hi>Successor</hi> of the <hi>Prince of the Apostles,</hi> has even from the beginning been acknowledged this <hi>supereminent Governor</hi> through all the whole <hi>Church,</hi> to take care that the common established <hi>Laws,</hi> former <hi>Definitions</hi> and <hi>Decisions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> be every where observed and professed; to prevent any innovations in <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and also to end <hi>Controversies</hi> among <hi>Catholics</hi> (if any arise) at least by silencing contentious <hi>Disputes</hi> till a <hi>General Council</hi> may further consider them: by which all Schisms are prevented; and also <hi>Heresies,</hi> that is any <hi>Doctrines</hi> that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by this supream <hi>Pastor</hi> contrary to former <hi>Church-definitions</hi> perpetually crushed: and lastly to judg <hi>in causis majoribus;</hi> when quarrels arise among <hi>Patriarks, Metropolitans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus stands the case; and now I appeal to your own Conscience, whether you can imagine any other <hi>Expedient</hi> for preserving a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity in Gods Church:</hi> And whether if you were appointed, and also enabled, to frame such a <hi>Church</hi> as was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily to continue always <hi>One Body,</hi> Reason it self would not dictate the same Order to you. <hi>Experience</hi> shews that all <hi>Divisions</hi> both in the <hi>West</hi> and <hi>East</hi> are to be ascribed to mens renouncing <hi>Obedience</hi> to this <hi>Common Governor.</hi>

                  <p>Truly Sir, I cannot but acknowledg that to preserve <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> in so vast a Body as the <hi>Church</hi> is, there must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be a <hi>Government;</hi> and if <hi>Government</hi> then <hi>Subordination</hi> and consequently an established <hi>Supream Governor.</hi> And now methinks reflecting upon <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi> I see clearly that such an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49046:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Government</hi> was settled in the <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves. For if, as some among us pretend, the same <hi>Apostles</hi> had intended no <hi>Supereminence</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> above <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and no degrees of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among <hi>Bishops,</hi> it could not possibly have happened, that a few unarmed <hi>Bishops,</hi> not assisted by <hi>Secular Power,</hi> should, so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the <hi>Apostles,</hi> have subdued such a world of <hi>Presbiters,</hi> formerly supposed their equals, to their <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> and no marks be left in any antient <hi>Writers</hi> to shew that those <hi>Presbyters</hi> resisted, or so much as complained against such an <hi>usurpation</hi> and <hi>tyranny.</hi> And the like may be said touching the <hi>Subordination</hi> of simple <hi>Bishops</hi> to <hi>Metropolitans, Primate, Patriarks;</hi> and of all these to the <hi>Supream Pastor:</hi> Though probably those <hi>Titles</hi> came into the <hi>Church</hi> in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriour ages. Therefore upon due consideration I cannot deny but my aversion to such and so qualified an <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as you say is moderated by the <hi>Churches Decision,</hi> is very much abated.</p>

                  <p>No, <hi>Sir,</hi> You go too fast: For, though I am perswaded that our first <hi>Reformers</hi> with all their <hi>Rhetoric</hi> should not have drawn me with them out of the <hi>Church,</hi> upon this <hi>Motive</hi> of opposing such an Authority in the <hi>Pope,</hi> as has been acknowledged by <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> and the ordinary <hi>Exercise</hi> of it to be regulated by approved <hi>Canons,</hi> since, I suppose such <hi>Authority</hi> regards only <hi>Ecclesiastical Affairs.</hi> But your <hi>Church</hi> will not be contented with this: for she will extend it also to <hi>Temporal matters,</hi> even to the disposing of <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> deposing of <hi>Princes,</hi> absolving <hi>Subjects</hi> from their natural <hi>Allegiance</hi> expresly commanded in Holy Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Where do you find that our <hi>Church</hi> invests the <hi>Pope</hi> with such an <hi>Authority?</hi>

                  <p>I cannot distinctly tell you that: but of this I am assured that the <hi>Pope</hi> challenges it, and as by <hi>Divine Right.</hi>

                  <p>How do you ground such an assurance? you will not surely esteem this to be an irrefragrable <hi>Proof</hi> thereof, because some of his <hi>Predecessors</hi> have challenged it, when as for above a thousand years
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49046:25"/>
before them not any precedent <hi>Pope</hi> ever pretended to it.</p>
                  <p>But let it be supposed that the present <hi>Pope</hi> did now challenge it: Will you not live in a <hi>Community</hi> in which the <hi>Governor</hi> challenges more then you will grant to be his due.</p>

                  <p>No truly: especially if that <hi>Authority,</hi> to which he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, endangers the ruine of <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> or the utter banishment of <hi>Peace</hi> every where. For such an <hi>Authority,</hi> I am sure, was never established on earth by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who is the <hi>Prince of Peace.</hi> And that which makes me assured hereof is this, because if Christ had had such an intention of dissolving the <hi>Frame</hi> of all <hi>Civil Government</hi> through the world, he would have left in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Tradition,</hi> most express proofs of such his will, in a matter of that infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: whereas the quite contrary rather appears.</p>

                  <p>You say well. But will you run out of the <hi>Church</hi> in case a <hi>Pope</hi> should chance to challenge more then his due, when perhaps no obligation lies upon you to submit to such <hi>Authority</hi> challenged by him, or to acknowledg the justice of it?</p>

                  <p>What I acknowledg or disacknowledg is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.

                  <p>Then, it cannot be denyed that (besides that <hi>Temporal Power</hi> indeed belonging to the <hi>Pope</hi> within his own <hi>Dominions,</hi> of which he is now the <hi>Temporal Soveraign</hi>) several <hi>Popes</hi> in former times have both Challenged, and actually exercised an unlimitted <hi>Temporal Iurisdiction</hi> over other <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires.</hi> Which <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> if it hath not been expresly acknowledged as just, yet it hath been sometimes submitted to by <hi>Kings,</hi> either obnoxious and unable to resist, or desirous to make use of it for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage against Enemies or Rebels. Several examples hereof remain in our <hi>Records,</hi> particularly during the <hi>Raigns</hi> of <hi>King Iohn</hi> and <hi>Henry the third.</hi> But generally <hi>Princes,</hi> when freed from such exigences, have resolutely and stoutly resisted such pretentions of the <hi>Roman Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we now descend to latter times, and cast our view on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of <hi>Christendom,</hi> we shall find <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>states</hi> so far from admitting such an exorbitant forrain <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> to be exercised or
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49046:25"/>
acknowledged within their <hi>Dominions,</hi> that not any of them will permit <hi>Rescripts, Bulls</hi> or <hi>Mandats</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> though regarding even Ecclesiastical affairs (unless touching private inferior persons) to be published, and much less executed within their <hi>states,</hi> till ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and approved in their respective <hi>Councils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay more then this: even the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Reformation</hi> prescribed by the <hi>General Council of Trent,</hi> as far as they are suspected to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon the <hi>Temporal Power of Princes,</hi> have always been refused to be admitted in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> not only knowing, but expresly allowing such refusal; as appears by the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the eight sent to King <hi>Henry the fourth,</hi> at his reception into the <hi>Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Perron in Ambass.</note> and recited by <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> in his Epistles: in which <hi>Bull</hi> we find this <hi>Clause; His Majesty shall effectually take order that the Council of Trent he published and admitted in all things, Excepting only (at your must earnest Supplication and Petition) those things, if there be any such, which cannot be put in execution without a real disturbance of public tranquility.</hi>

                  <p>In the <hi>Eucharist</hi> the first matter of <hi>Dispute,</hi> and ground of the rest, is the <hi>Catholic Doctrine touching the Real Presence of our Lords Body on the Altar after Consecration of the Symbole,</hi> thus declared in the <hi>Council of Trent, I prosess that in the most Holy Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist is present truly and substantially the Body and the Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Iesus Christ: And that there is made a Conversion of the whole Substance of the Bread into his Body, and of the whole substance of the Wine into his Blood: Which Conversion the Catholic Church calls Transubstantiation.</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>Article</hi> of our Belief is to us solidly established on the Words of <hi>Institution. THIS IS MY BODY:</hi> which Words without any figurative explication are repeated alike by three <hi>Evangelists</hi> and the <hi>Apostle Saint Paul:</hi> therefore we believe, following universal <hi>Tradition,</hi> that our <hi>Lord</hi> sincerely meant as he spake; and because we believe so, we are hated.</p>

                     <hi>say, that Christ the only begotten Son of God ought not to be adored in the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist with the Supream Worship (Latria) even external—And that his Adorers are Idolaters, let him be Anathema.</hi>

                  <p>Now the Doctrine touching the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> being once esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, will sufficiently justify this: for certainly it is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but our <hi>Duty</hi> to adore <hi>Christ</hi> whereever he is truly present. And consequently this <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Adoring our Lord in his Sacrament</hi> is by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49046:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the same <hi>Universal Tradition</hi> delivered, and ordained in all <hi>Publick Liturgies,</hi> both of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and other <hi>Oriental Churches.</hi>

                  <p>But the great, and too willing mistake of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> is, that they impute to us the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Visible Elements:</hi> Whereas the proper <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>Worship</hi> is not any Visible thing, Nay, we do not terminate our Worship percisely in the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> which we beleive invisibly present: The proper <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>worship</hi> is the <hi>Person of Christ God and Man</hi> veiled under the <hi>Visible Elements.</hi> So that in case it should happen through some incapacity in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or defect in the manner or matter, that the Elements should not be effectually consecrated, and yet we, (beleiving <hi>Christs Body</hi> to be <hi>Sacramentally present,</hi>) should so worship him, in this indeed would be a circumstantial mistake, but here would be no <hi>Idolatry,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any fault in us, the <hi>Errour</hi> being supposed undiscoverable by us. The reason is, because the Belief of the <hi>Presence of Christs Body</hi> is truly grounded on <hi>Divine</hi> Revelation; and not a fond fancy such as was that of the <hi>Manicheans</hi> worshiping <hi>Christ</hi> as peculiarly present in the <hi>Sun,</hi> or of the <hi>Isrealites</hi> conceiving <hi>God</hi> to be peculiarly present in the <hi>Calves at Bethel.</hi> And to this you may see <hi>Daille</hi> yeilding his consent, in his <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, the eleventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>It is observable with what strange and unreasonable partiality the <hi>Calvinists</hi> treat <hi>Catholics</hi> in this <hi>Point:</hi> They give their judgment that there is no dangerous Venome in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter, and therefore have <hi>Synodically</hi> granted them admission to their <hi>Cene</hi> which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> scorn. Now the <hi>Lutherans</hi> profess the <hi>Real Presence</hi> of <hi>Christs Body</hi> together with the <hi>Bread:</hi> and some of them acknowledg <hi>Adoration</hi> due to him there. So that to a <hi>Calvinists</hi> consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the same, or a worse <hi>Doctrine</hi> held by a <hi>Sectary</hi> looses all its poyson: it is only dangerous to believe what the <hi>Church</hi> teaches. Yea those very <hi>Calvinists</hi> acknowledg also, that if <hi>Christ</hi> be in such a special manner really present, <hi>Adoration</hi> would be due to him.

                     <hi>Protestants</hi> set themselves against this <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> upon a meer mistake of the <hi>Term,</hi> which they will needs affirm to imply an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molation:</hi> and thereupon argue, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> manifestly<note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 26.

                  <p>But this pretended <hi>Contradiction</hi> will quickly vanish, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that though the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> made by <hi>Christ</hi> did accomplish all sorts of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Oblations</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> yet the forementioned <hi>Divine Authour</hi> in a special manner compares it to that great <hi>Anniversary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> of general <hi>Propitiation,</hi> in which after the killing of the beast, the <hi>High Priest</hi> alone, and only once every year, carryed the <hi>Blood</hi> into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and there sprinkled it before <hi>God.</hi> In like manner did our <hi>Saviour</hi> after his bloody <hi>Sacrifice</hi> on the <hi>Cross,</hi> ascending into<note place="margin">Ib. 12.</note>

                  <p>The last Subject of <hi>Protestants</hi> quarrels against the <hi>Church,</hi> with relation to the <hi>Holy Eucharist, is her Ordaining to the Laity, Communion under one Species only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is acknowledged that, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> instituted this <hi>Sacrament</hi> in both <hi>Species,</hi> so for many ages together, it was, in <hi>public Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> received accordingly: I say, in <hi>Public Communions:</hi> for in other private occasions, as in <hi>Sickness,</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> and generally among the devout <hi>Inhabitants of Desarts,</hi> it was otherwise: yet these, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in <hi>One Species</hi> only, did not esteem themselves deprived of any vertue pertaining to the integrity of the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> And the reason is, because they generally believed (as the Church has now declared) that <hi>it is most true, that as much is contained in each Species, as under both: for whole and entire Christ does exist under the Species of Bread, and under every particle of that Species: in like manner whole Christ does exist under the Species of Wine, and under its parts</hi> (when separated) Upon this ground the <hi>Church</hi> without intending the least prejudice to her <hi>Children,</hi> has thought fit, for avoiding many inconveniences and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49046:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
irreverencies which did frequently occur by the negligence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of such vast multitudes of <hi>Communicants</hi> receiving the <hi>Blood</hi> also, that all, excepting the <hi>Priest</hi> who celebrated, should content themselves in <hi>Public Communions,</hi> as from the beginning <hi>Christians</hi> did in Private, with our <hi>Lords Body</hi> only under the <hi>Species of Bread,</hi> which is not obnoxious to the like inconveniencies, considering that hereby they should not be loosers of any part of the <hi>Blessing.</hi>

                  <p>This regards the <hi>Holy Eucharist</hi> considered as a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> But as it is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> both the <hi>Species</hi> are necessary to the constitution of it, it being ordained to represent the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> by shedding his <hi>Blood:</hi> Which representation is made by <hi>Consecreating</hi> and <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> both the <hi>Body and Blood separatly.</hi>

                  <p>The next <hi>Catholic Doctrine</hi> severely censured by you, as an invention of the <hi>Clergys ambition,</hi> is the <hi>Obligation imposed by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church on her subjects to Confess their Mortal sins, and to submit to satisfactions for them; according to this Canon, Whosoever shall deny Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Confession to have been instituted by Divine Law, or to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to Salvation: or shall affirm that the manner of Confession secretly to the Priest alone (which the Catholic Church from the beginning hath allways and still doth observe) is disagreeing from the institution and command of Christ, and that it is a humane invention; Let him be Anathema.</hi>

That only such a Power of conferring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences has been left by our Lord to his Church as from ancient times has been practised and approved by former Synods, intending those that are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually cited to that purpose,</hi> as the <hi>first</hi> of <hi>Nicea,</hi> Can. 11. of <hi>Neocaesare</hi> Can. 3. of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Can. 1. and 2. the <hi>Fourth</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> Cap. 75. and of <hi>Agdes,</hi> Can. 6. in all which <hi>Synods</hi> we only find this, that it was always lawful and usual for <hi>Bishops</hi> to remit to their <hi>Penitents</hi> some part of those <hi>Canonical Penances</hi> which were inflicted for certain crimes, in case the life and laudable conversation of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49046:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Penitent</hi> did seem to deserve so great a favour; or if by such <hi>indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> they thought requisite to encourage weaker <hi>Christians</hi> in times of <hi>Persecution</hi> to suffer for the <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence appears that whatsoever beyond this we read in the <hi>Catholic Writers,</hi> as thouching the remission of any pane due to Sin in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>God,</hi> or after death in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or touching certain clauses in the <hi>Bulls</hi> of some <hi>Popes;</hi> or touching the <hi>Churches Treasure</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Merit of Christ alone, as some, or of the <hi>Merits</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> joyned to those of <hi>Christ,</hi> as others conceive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not any of these are necessary <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Catholic Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus in effect the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> requires no more to be assented to, but what is taught and practised by every <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> upon <hi>Earth.</hi> All <hi>Sects,</hi> even <hi>Fanatics</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> denounce <hi>Censures</hi> against <hi>Delinquents.</hi> Must all those <hi>Censures</hi> alwayes have their full effect? Is no mercy to be extended to humble, contrite <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents?</hi> Shall no difference be made between Sinners converted, and those that are remorsless? This is contrary to humane Nature and the practise of all mankind.

                  <p>First then, it is acknowledged that the <hi>Church</hi> teaches,<note place="margin">Council. Trid.

                     <hi>as as a Recompence which is faithfully rendred to their Good Works and Merits, by vertue of that Promise.</hi> Fourthly <hi>although in Holy Scriptures so much is attributed to Good Works, that Iesus Christ himself promises that a Cup of cold water given to the poor shall not fail of a Reward, and that the Apostle testifies that our light and momentary tribulation worketh fur us a far more exceeding, eternal weight of glory; Yet God forbid that a Christian should either trust or glory in himself, and not in the Lord,</hi>

                     <hi>who of our selves, as of our selves, can do nothing, by our Lords coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who gives us strength, can do all things: Thus man hath nothing in himself for which he can glory, but all our glorying is in Christ, in whom we live, in whom we merit, in whom we satisfy, bringing forth fruits, worthy of Repentance, which fruits take their vertue from him, are offered to the Father by him, and accepted of the Father for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus are we instructed by the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> and<note place="margin">Can.

               <sp>
                  <p>The next <hi>Point</hi> censured by you is the <hi>Churches Doctrine</hi> touching <hi>Invocation of Saints:</hi> thus expressed in the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Sess. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>It is good and profitable to call upon the Saints, and to have recourse to their prayers, aid and assistance, whereby to obtain from God many benefits by the Merits of his Son Iesus Christ, who is our Redeemer and Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Point</hi> I shall briefly offer to you these considerations; 1. That it is a general <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>Gods Church</hi> from the begining, and not contradicted by sober <hi>Protestants,</hi> that glorified <hi>Saints</hi> do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly Pray for the Militant <hi>Church</hi> on earth. 2. It is unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that we may desire to receive benefit in particular by such their <hi>Prayers.</hi> 3. That it contradicts all reason and modesty in our <hi>Adversaries</hi> to charge the addressing our <hi>Petitions</hi> to them for that purpose with the horrible crime of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> since we do no otherwise beg the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> then we do that of our sinful Brethren alive, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging <hi>God</hi> alone to be the Author and fountain of all good.</p>

with any shew of reason affix to this our Practice is, that it may be esteemed <hi>superfluous,</hi> in case it can be demonstrated, that <hi>Saints</hi> at such a distance cannot hear nor know our <hi>Requests</hi> in particular.

But <hi>lastly,</hi> if it be the <hi>Church</hi> her self, and not some private <hi>Catholic Writers,</hi> that you would question about this Subject; observe, that in her public <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Mass,</hi> celebrated on all the <hi>Feasts</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> she continually addresses her <hi>Petitions</hi> directly to <hi>God</hi> alone, desiring him to grant us such special <hi>Blessings</hi> by the <hi>Intercession</hi> of such and such <hi>Saints.</hi> Now it cannot be doubted but that <hi>Charity</hi> and mutual assistance among fellow members of the same Body is very acceptable to <hi>God</hi> whensoever and wheresoever performed. We are taught to <hi>beleive a Communion of Saints:</hi> we doubt not of their Charity to us: our <hi>Communion</hi> therefore with them must be to testify our joy for their <hi>Happiness,</hi> and our assurance that their <hi>Intercessions</hi> for us are more prevalent with <hi>God,</hi> then the <hi>Prayers</hi> of our living imperfect Brethren: Therefore since we may and ought, on occasions to beg these, and to desire <hi>God</hi> to hear them for our good, much rather surely ought we to do the same with regard to the glorified <hi>Saints.</hi> I leave it therefore to your conscience whether you can judg that a separation from <hi>Gods Church</hi> on this quarrel can be justified.</p>

                  <p>I readily enough grant, that in such a Case the man must neither profess, nor do any thing against his present conscience: And consequently, I do not say, he must separate, but if the <hi>Church</hi> for his obstinate disobedience shall cast him out, he must be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. But the truth is, his case is deplorable, for every way he is exposed to extreamest danger. If he conforms against Conscience, he sins mortally by damnable <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> If he refuses to conform, that is, to submit his private <hi>perswasion,</hi> or <hi>Suspicion,</hi> to the <hi>Teaching</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> [I mean, the <hi>Catholic Church</hi>] his sin is yet more heynous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rebellious <hi>Disobedience</hi> to the highest and <hi>most Divinely establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Authority</hi> upon Earth, from the guilt of which <hi>Disobedience</hi> no dictates of consoience, how unpretended soever, can acquit him.

So that a full <hi>perswasion,</hi> or it seems, but <hi>suspition</hi> that any <hi>Heretical Doctrines</hi> are <hi>Orthodox,</hi> will excuse all Heretics, even the most blasphemous, from all guilt and danger, and moreover, at the end of the account the <hi>Governours</hi> and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Teachers</hi> appointed by <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Church,</hi> in case the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate such <hi>Orthodox Hereticks,</hi> must alone be esteemed <hi>Heretics</hi> and <hi>Schismatics,</hi> only for teaching Truth and doing their Duty.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, if he who called <hi>Schism</hi> a <hi>Theological Scar-crow</hi> had intended to apply that Expression to single divided <hi>Churches,</hi> whose birth has perhaps been within mans memory, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Church of England</hi> (some Fundamental <hi>Doctrines</hi> whereof,

to my knowledge, he did not assent to, and whose <hi>Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> he did not approve) his <hi>Assertion</hi> may be justified to be grounded on Reason. For who can tell how a <hi>Seperation</hi> from any of them can be called <hi>Schism;</hi> or <hi>Tenents</hi> contradicting their <hi>Heresies?</hi> They all mutually favour one another with the Title of <hi>Pure Reformed</hi> and Sufficiently <hi>Orthodox Churches:</hi> So that in which soever among them any one shall live, and from which soever of them any one shall think fit to depart, as liking another better, this, according to their common grounds, must be accounted a matter in a manner, indifferent, and however there is in it no danger of incurring the guilt of <hi>Schism,</hi> so it be done with an <hi>unpretended Conscience.</hi> It seems therefore to me an Act unjust and unsuitable to the grounds of <hi>Pure Reformation</hi> in some late <hi>Prelatical Writers,</hi> who charge with the Crime of <hi>Schism</hi> their tender Conscienced <hi>Orthodox Brethren</hi> for deserting their <hi>Communion:</hi> as it was anciently in the <hi>Donatists,</hi> those <hi>Arch-contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of <hi>Schisms</hi> for doing the same to the <hi>Primianists, Maximianists</hi> and <hi>Rogatists,</hi> subdivided <hi>Sects,</hi> Spawned from them.</p>
                  <p>It is plain therefore that among all <hi>Reformed Congregations, Schism</hi> is a meer <hi>Scar-crow,</hi> and the like may be said of <hi>Heresie:</hi> And the reason is, because both <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> must include an opposition to that <hi>Church</hi> only which can justly challenge an <hi>Authority</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min what <hi>Doctrins</hi> are true and necessary to be believed by all <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and to oblige all under penalty of <hi>Anathema's</hi> to joyn in her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:</hi> Which <hi>Authority</hi> only belongs to the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> and which is not so much as pretended to by any <hi>Reformed Congregations.</hi>
