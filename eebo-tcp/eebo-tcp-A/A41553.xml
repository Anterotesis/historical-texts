            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Roman Catholicks, &amp;c.</head>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECTION I. Their Divine Service in an Vnknown Tongue.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. MAY not the Seventh Commandment be as easily
reconciled to Adultery, as the Service of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church in an unknown Tongue to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. where
the Apostle Five several Times expresly prohibits it, and gives so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pregnant Reasons for the Inhibition?</p>
               <p>2. If the various Gestures and Ceremonies practised by the Priest
at Mass be sufficient to excite Devotion in the Spectators, may not a
dumb Priest be as useful for that effect; especially he who babbles
with a Stentorian Voice, as he who speaks in an unknown Language;
since one who cannot speak at all, may be as mimical as he who can
speak more Languages than ever <hi>Ioseph Scaliger</hi> did, or as many as
were at the Confusion of <hi>Babel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Since it's possible that the Priest may be so Diabolical as to be
practising Conjuration in an unknown Language instead of Devotion,
or may be cursing his Congregation in lieu of blessing them; would
not Reason, without the Apostolick Authority, perswade us of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of understanding his Language, that we may say <hi>Amen</hi> to what
he says?</p>
               <p>4. Since the Priest in these publick Offices is the Mouth of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in offering up their Tribute of Honour and Adoration to God; if
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61787:3"/>
the Congregation understand him not, how can he more justifie himself,
than if he did celebrate the Service in a Tongue himself knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of, and which neither the one nor the other did understand?</p>
               <p>5. Since it's given as the principal Reason of the <hi>Roman</hi> Service in
Latin (by the <hi>Rhemish Annot.</hi>) that Christians where-ever they travel
may find the same Service and Priests officiating in it, as at home; it
may be demanded, if for the sake of some few that travel, the many
that stay at home should be left destitute; and for one Man's Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
a Thousand be exposed to eternal Perdition; for there will
not be one to a Thousand who understand Latin in the Christian
World?</p>
               <p>6. Since in the Service in an unknown Tongue the People are wholly
left to the Ability and Sincerity of their Priest, Is not the case of that
People very lamentable? For if the Priest wants the former, he may
through Ignorance turn the most Solemn Part of their Service into
Ridicule and Nonsense, or Blasphemy: And if he want the later, he
may use a Spell for Prayer, or the antient Charm of the <hi>Valentinians
Abracadabra,</hi> for <hi>Ave Maria;</hi> nay, instead of Baptizing in the Name
of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may do by the Person, as a <hi>Iew,</hi> under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a Priest, is said to have done by a certain Man, in this last
Age, who Baptized him in the horrid Name of the Devil; there being
nothing so absurd or wicked, which according to this case, may not
be practised.</p>
               <p>7. Since Scripture, the Reason of the Thing, the Fathers and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church for about Seven Hundred Years together, are for
the Expedience and Necessity of having God's Publick Service in a
Tongue understood by the People, may it not justly be enquired with
what Effrontory the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath Anathematized all those
who believe the necessity of having God's Solemn Worship in a known
Tongue; as if <hi>Trent,</hi> (because a City of the <hi>Alps</hi>) were transformed
into <hi>Mount Ebal,</hi> whence they might curse that great Doctor of the
Gentiles in the first place?</p>
               <p>8. Is it not evident from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. that in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Judgment they
deserve to be reckoned Mad-men, who Pray to God in an Unknown
Tongue?</p>
               <p>9. Is it not probable that the Romanists have borrowed their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in an Unknown Tongue, from some Heathens? who (as <hi>Clemens
Alexandrinus</hi> reports) thought those Prayers most effectual, which
were uttered in a Barbarous Language; or from their Neighbours, the
old <hi>Cusleans</hi> (of whom <hi>Varro</hi> testifies) that their Priests did scarcely
understand their own Sacred Rites.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61787:3"/>
10. Since the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy is so agreeable to the undoubted parts
of the most antient Liturgies, (it being a Form which hath all those
parcels of the Roman Offices that were known and used in the first
Three Centuries, but wants all the Innovations and Coruptions of the
present Mass) May we not truly and pertinently challenge all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to produce any publick Platform (or Solemn Church-Service) so
constant to the purest Primitive Devotions?</p>
               <p>11. Since the Famous Bishop of <hi>Condam</hi> hath most cunningly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
a palliative Cure (by soft and smooth Words) as to many
Practices in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which stand in need of Amputation,
yet both in his Exposition and Exhortation, he still passeth by their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in an Unknown Tongue; Is it not, because he had no Tongue of
his own, to answer for that Practice, which is so directly repugnant to
Scripture and Antiquity, having despaired (it seems) to find either But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Oyl to cicatrise or soften that Wound?</p>

               <head>SECT. II. Their taking away the Cup from the People.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. SInce the Council of <hi>Constance, Anno</hi> 1418. made it an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Faith, That the Laity ought to receive the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
only in One Kind (<hi>non obstante</hi> of the Institution of Christ, as it
was then acknowledged, and the constant Practice of the Catholick
Church above a Thousand Years) Wherefore may they not Christen
the Laick's Children only in the Name of the Holy Ghost, leaving out
the Father and the Son by the way of Concomitancy, it being as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to Baptize as to Communicate by halves, and no less certain, that
since the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity partake of the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Nature, where one is, all the rest must be; suppose the Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Eucharist could not be disparaged by that Emblem of the
Effusion of Christ's Blood, which is necessarily required in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>2. Since the principal Reason assigned by <hi>Gerson</hi> (for that Canon of
the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> which abstracts the Cup from the People)
is the Danger of spilling of the Blood of Christ; may it not
pertinently be demanded, Wherefore may not Laicks in this Age
have as steddy hands as the Ages foregoing that Council? Or if Priests
are the best Supporters of a Chalice, Why may they not hold the Cup
to Peoples Heads, as well as put the Bread into their Mouths? (Not to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61787:4"/>
speak of that Infallible Prescience Christ behoved to have of that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Inconvenience, if we believe him to be God as well as Man.)</p>
               <p>3. Since it is also one of the Reasons assigned by <hi>Gerson,</hi> wherefore
the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> prohibited the Cup to the People, lest the
Consecrated Wine long kept should be converted into Vineger: How
can that Fear consist with Transubstantiation, for it is not Blood but
Wine which turns into Vineger?</p>
               <p>4. With what Effrontory can any Romanist pretend, that the words
of St. <hi>Iohn, chap.</hi> 6. are to be understood of the Eucharist, since the
Mutilation of that Sacrament is thereby expresly condemned; for a
Man cannot be said to drink when he eats?</p>
               <p>5. Since the Eucharist is an Emblem of the Effusion of Christ's Blood;
How can they be said to drink of that Cup which is the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ's Blood shed for us, who do not drink at all? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
there was Truth in Transubstantiation, and in that of Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy

as a Reason of that Sacrilegious Mutilation, may it not pertinently
he demanded, Why is not the Bread taken away also, because some
Persons have been found, who could never tast of any kind of Bread?</p>
               <p>7. It it may be farther enquired, if it were a civil Apology at an
ordinary Feast (when there are very many invited) that the Host should
say, He had provided neither Bread nor Wine, in regard one of the
Guests cannot taste of the former, and another cannot drink of the
later?</p>

of the Eucharist in the Face of any particular Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving the Consecrated Cup to all the Communicants, doth it not
evidently follow, that the Catholick Church behoved to have been in
an Error so long, or that the present Roman Church hath degenerated
from the Doctrine and Practice of the Catholick Church for so many

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. SInce there is no Christian Church (unless it be a Society of
Blasphemers under the Notion of a Church) that pretends
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61787:4"/>
to more Infallibility than Christ and his Apostles, Upon what account
should the <hi>Roman</hi> Church require more implicit Faith from its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
than Christ and his Apostles did from their Hearers? For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
these were unquestionably endued with an infallible Spirit,
and the Gift of Miracles, yet they still remitted their Hearers to the
search of the Old Testament, that they might find by their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Industry, the Doctrine of the Gospel, consonant to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Oracles and Mysterious Types of our Saviour's Incarnation and
Passion, and were commended for doing so.</p>
               <p>2. If the Scriptures are so unintelligible, that an honest man cannot
find out the meaning of them, without the Infallible Interpretation of
the Church, even in those things which are indispensably necessary to
our Salvation, (for we are still ready to say with one of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
That as they have Flats wherein a Lamb may wade, so they
have Depths wherein an Elephant may swim) I would desire to know,
whether Christ and his Apostles preached intelligibly to their Hearers?
If not, to what purpose did they preach at all? By what means were
Men converted to the Faith? If they did, How came these Sermons
to be so unintelligible now they are written, which were so intelligible
when they were spoken? For the Gospels contain a plain History of
what Christ did and said; and the Apostles wrote the same things to
the Churches when they were absent, which they preached to them
when they were present; and we reasonably suppose, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
that the Churches should as much understand what they wrote,
as what they preached; and therefore that they generally used the
same Form of Words in their Writings, and in their Preachings; and
this makes it a great Riddle, How one should be very plain and easie
to be understood, and the other signifie nothing without an Infallible
Interpreter.</p>
               <p>3. Where the <hi>Turkish Alcoran</hi> is permitted in <hi>English,</hi> viz. at <hi>Rome,
(Vid. Indic. Libr. prohibit. Alexandr. 7.)</hi> and the Bible in <hi>English</hi> ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

better?</p>
               <p>4. Why may not an implicit Faith in the Scripture save a Soul, as
well as in the Church; and why may not the one free from Heresie, as
well as the other?</p>
               <p>5. Since our Saviour recommended the reading of the Scriptures to
Laicks, and the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> commended them for doing so, and
that the Primitive Fathers pressed it as a Duty on all Ranks of Persons;
Must not the Reasons of the Roman Church (in prohibiting the Laicks
to read the Word of God, or to have the Bible translated into their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tongue) be exceedingly weighty, if they can preponderate all
these Authorities?</p>

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61787:5"/>
6. Since it is well known from Ecclesiastical and Secular History,
that the greatest Heresies and Schisms in the Christian Church, and
which gave it the greatest and most lasting Trouble, had their Rise
from Men in Holy Orders (who were accounted great Clerks in their
time) such as <hi>Marcion, Paulus Samosatenus, Arius, Eunomius, Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
Macedonius, Photinus, Nestorius, Eutiches, Pelagius,</hi> and many
others; <hi>Novatius</hi> also and <hi>Donatius,</hi> who rent the Catholick Church
by long lasting Schisms, were Men in Holy Orders; not to speak of
<hi>Lucifer</hi> and <hi>Meletius:</hi> Is it therefore a solid Reason to with-hold the
Scripture from the ignorant Laicks for fear of their broaching Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
or Schisms, seeing the sad Experience of the World doth rather
teach, that the learned Clergy should be restrained therefrom?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. DOth not the Roman Church in picturing of God not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
act directly contrary to Sacred Scripture (where it is
so frequently forbidden) but also to the very Nature of God, who is
an infinite Spirit, and can no more be represented by a bodily Shape,
than a Thought can? And how can their Practice be re reconciled to
that Canon of their Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which determined it not
only unlawful, but also absurd and impossible to make an Image of
that Being which is spiritual, invisible, and incomprehensible?</p>
               <p>2. If any Man can reconcile the Worship of Images to the Second
Commandment, may it not also be imagined that he can make Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Perjury, Murther, Theft, and False-witnessing to become Vertues?</p>
               <p>3. How can any Man that hath the use of Reason imagine, that the
Antients were clear for the Worship of Images, since it is most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the Writings of the most Primitive Fathers, that they all
condemned the making of any kind of Image (as unlawful) much more
the placing of them in Churches, and most of all the adoring of them?</p>
               <p>4. Since in the <hi>Ierusalem Talmud</hi> there is no mention of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of Christians (tho frequently of that of the Heathen) because
it was written about Two Hundred Years after Christ: But in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish
Talmud,</hi> which was compiled about Five Hundred Years
after Christ's Nativity, there is scarce a Page therein, wherein
they do not inveigh against the Idolatry of Christians, and terms their
Churches <hi>Beth-havora-zada,</hi> the Houses of Idolatry: May we not
(in consideration of the infinite Malice of the <hi>Iews</hi> against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61787:5"/>
Religion) most rationally conclude (tho it be from a Negative
Argument) that the placing of Images in Churches began not any
where during the Two First Centuries, and (if we believe both Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and Ecclesiastical History) not till about the End of the Fifth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
(tho they were worshiped no where by publick Authority till
after the Days of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great) not to speak of that Canon of
the Council of <hi>Elliberis,</hi> and that Epistle of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> (translated by
St. <hi>Hierom</hi>) which positively holds forth, that in the Fourth Century
it was judged simply unlawful to have any Image in a Church, whether
painted or graven.</p>
               <p>5. May not Garlick and Onyons (the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Deities) be justly
accounted Gods right worshipful, when compared with the Nails, the
Thorns, the Chips, and Shreds, and many other Objects of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Adoration?</p>
               <p>6. Since the Governing Part of the Roman Church teacheth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth
the People to worship Images with an inferiour kind of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
(as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> phraseth it) is it not (in some sense)
charitably done by them, not to let them know the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(by expunging it out of their Chatechisms) that the People
may not become guilty of sinning against so plain a Law?</p>
               <p>7. Since the Romish School-men have devised many Distinctions of
Religious Worship, (no where to be found in Sacred Scripture) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
the Imputation of Idolatry to the Adorers of Images, Saints and
Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (such as <hi>Latria, Dulia, Hyperdulia;</hi> a Relative and Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Worship; a Mediate and Immediate; a Direct and Indirect; a Supreme
and Subordinate; a Sovereign and Subaltern; a Transitive and Final; a
Proper and Analogical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) May it not justly be demanded, if any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Person can rationally imagine, that ignorant Laicks are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
warned by these Beacons to shun the Rocks of Idolatry, when their
greatest Clerks controvert among themselves about the proper import

from the contrary Sentiments of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine, Vasquez</hi>

               <p>8. Since Miracles are especially necessary to convince Unbelievers, and
that many Miracles were Recorded before the Reformation, but few or
none after it; Is it not an Argument sufficient to make a wary Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that there were few real Miracles at any time, since the settlement
of Christianity? And that only the Superstitious Credulity of former
Ages was apt to be abused with such Pretences? (well-meaning Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
being easily wheedled thereby into a Golden Dream of great
Advantages redounding from the Adoration of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in regard
that there is far more need of them since the Reformation (when so

many dis-believe the Roman Religion) than was before, when all the

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. WHen Romanists pray to Saints departed to pray for them,
it may be pertinently inquired, that these Saints do either
hear their Prayers, and become acquainted with their Desires, or they
do not? If they do hear all those Prayers that are put up to them at
the same time by innumerable persons through all the World, what's
this but to ascribe to them that Omnipresence and Omniscience which
is peculiar to God alone; especially if it be considered, that their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
are not only Verbal, but also Mental, <hi>(Voce vel mente suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care,</hi>
being decreed by the Council of <hi>Trent)</hi> yea, it is necessarily
implyed in every Prayer that is made to them, that they not only hear
it, but also know the disposition of the heart, from whence it proceeds;
otherwise the Hypocritical Supplicant must be supposed as likely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their favours as the sincerest Votary: if they do not hear their
Prayers, then its very absurd and ridiculous, (and a great abuse of
that reason God hath given Men for other ends than to trifle with)
to pray to them: As for that imaginary Glass of the Trinity, it may
be further demanded, if the glorified see all things therein, or but
some? if all, then they must share in God's incommunicable Property,
which is to be the searcher of the Heart; if but some, what assurance
have we that they see those things whereof we stand most in need? so
that we cannot pray in Faith.</p>
               <p>2. Since the learned Men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (such as <hi>Bellarmin,
Valentia, Horstius,</hi> and many others) conclude their Books with Praise
to God, the blessed Virgin, and Jesus Christ; may it not be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
demanded, if they give her not only an equal part with God
in their Praises, but by placing her before Christ, seem to give some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of preheminence above him?</p>
               <p>3. Since its acknowledged by the most part of the Popish School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that the Invocation of Saints and Angels was not enjoyned in the
Old Testament, because of the Limbo wherein these Fathers were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ's Resurrection; so that not being admitted to the Beatifical
Vision, they could not hear those Prayers upon Earth: It may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
demanded, 1. What should have restrained the Worship of
the Angels at that time, who since their Creation enjoyed that blessed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61787:6"/>
Vision; they being represented in the Old Testament as the constant
Attendants and Retinue of God, and the great Ministers of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and therefore they were as capable of Divine Worship in the
time of the Law as they are now, and it may be, a little more; for the
Law it self was given by the Ministry of Angels, and their Appearances
were more frequent and familiar; and the World seemed to be more
under the government of Angels then, than it is now, since Christ is
made the Head of the Church, and exalted above all Principalities and
Powers? 2. What Evasion can they find, who are of Opinion, that the
glorified Saints at all times did know the Petitions put up to them from
Earth, not by the Beatifical Vision, but by special Divine Revelation?
3. Since the generality of the Fathers of the three first Centuries were
of Opinion, that the glorified Saints shall not enjoy the Beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
till the day of Judgment, it may be pertinently enquired, if these
Fathers practised or believed the necessity, or expediency of Saint-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;
no fewer than Eighteen of the Fathers, being of this Opinion,
by the Romanists own confession?</p>
               <p>4. What is more in the <hi>Apostrophe</hi> of <hi>Greg. Nazianz.</hi> to his Sister
<hi>Gorgonia,</hi> or S. <hi>Ierom</hi> to his devout <hi>Paula,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustin</hi> to his
Mother <hi>Monica;</hi> than in these <hi>Apostrophes</hi> frequently found in Sacred
Writings to insensate Creatures; <hi>Hear O ye Mountains the Lord's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie:
Praise the Lord ye Dragons, and all Deeps,</hi> &amp;c. And who will
infer from hence, that the insensate Creatures were hereby invok'd
and addressed unto; yet we must carefully distinguish betwixt the
Speeches of some particular Fathers, and the general Doctrine of the
Church, betwixt what they express in Rhetorical Strains to move Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and what they lay down in plain terms to inform the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
betwixt what results from the heat of their popular Orations,
and what in cool and deliberate Debates they set down for the Truth
of Christ; for its generally confest, that the Fathers oft-times hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize,
particularly St. <hi>Chrysostom;</hi> and we must not take their flights
of Fancy for the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
               <p>5. If these words <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10. taken out of <hi>Deut. 6. 13. Him only
shalt thou serve;</hi> are to be understood only of the highest degree of
Religious Worship as a part of the whole, and distinguish'd from a lower
kind; this superiour degree being <hi>Latria,</hi> and the inferiour degrees
<hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> and <hi>Dulia</hi> (as the Romanists term them) it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
how could that have been a sufficient Answer to the Devils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?
for he might thus have replyed to the Son of God, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Soveraign and Almighty Power of God as well as you (the
same acknowledgment being insinuated by himself, St. <hi>Luke chap.</hi> 4. 6.)
therefore I desire not thou shouldst Worship me as God with <hi>Latria,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61787:7"/>
but only with <hi>Dulia,</hi> a lower kind; thy Heart, the most elevated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of thy mind may be reserved to God, its only the outward act
I challenge of thee, that thou wouldst only fall down and Worship me,
or by falling down, Worship me; which our Saviour simply refused
notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>6. Since the chief argument whereby the Primitive Fathers used to
prove the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, and of the Son, against the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Arians;</hi> was the Catholick practice of the Church
in praying to them: what force could have been in that argument,
had they believed that any Creatures (tho never so highly exalted in
Nature and Condition) might have had that Honour payed unto
them?</p>
               <p>7. Since the Catholicks did frequently accuse the <hi>Arians</hi> of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
for praying unto Christ (whom they conceived to be no more
than an excellent and good-like Creature) had the Catholicks at the
same time practised the Invocation of Saints, might not the <hi>Arians</hi>
have returned the Charge with greater force upon themselves; for if
the Catholicks had replyed as the Romanists do now, that though they
did pray to the blessed Spirits, yet they did it not with that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
Direct, and final Prayer, nor with those sublimest thoughts and
intentions of Honour wherewith they did address to God, but only with
indirect, subaltern, and relative Prayer, and with no higher Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Honour to them, than what is proportioned to the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of their finite Nature: Since the <hi>Arians</hi> might have returned
upon them with great advantage, by saying, <hi>Sirs, With the same due
Limitations we Invocate the Man Iesus Christ, who</hi> (as the Scripture as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us) <hi>is exalted above all Angels, Principalities and Powers, and every
Name which is named in Heaven and Earth; so that tho we may not Honour
the Son in the same high degree as we do the Father, yet the Scripture enjoyns
us to do it with that same kind of Honour:</hi> Which is more than can be
said in defence of that Honour and Invocation you offer to Saints and
Angels.</p>
               <p>8. Since the fancy of making the Court of Heaven resemble Princes
Courts on Earth, hath brought forth that voluntary Humility of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping
Saints and Angels, at least this excuse of the <hi>Romish</hi> Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
that its out of an humble sense of their own unworthiness, and
an awful regard to the infinite Majesty of God, that they address not
immediately to himself, but by the Mediation of Saints and Angels
these Courtiers and Favourites of Heaven; may it not be pertinently
demanded, What wise Man on Earth, who is abundantly satisfied of
the readiness and ability of his Prince to help him, and hath free
leave given him, on any occasion, to come immediately unto him, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61787:7"/>
is frequently invited for that effect) will choose to wave this freedom
of his access, and will apply himself to some inferiour Officer or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
to make his Address? This is our case; God hath invited all
that are in Trouble to come immediately unto himself, and hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
promised to grant all their requests who seek him with their
whole Hearts; and hath appointed his own Son (God with himself)
the Master of Requests, from time to time to receive all the Petitions
of his Subjects; and both the one and the other are infinitely more able,
and infinitely more willing to Hear and Succour them, than the best,
the wisest, and most powerful of all created Beings: And shall we now
be afraid to take that Liberty which God hath given us? Shall we call
that Impudence, which God hath made our Duty? And whilst we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Humility, shall we forfeit our Allegiance, and distrust his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and suspect the goodness of his Nature, for fear of being found
too faucy, and too bold with his Person?</p>
               <p>9. Since <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. we are expresly forbidden to hearken to any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
tho a Worker of Miracles, who teacheth the Worship of any
other Being beside the one Supreme God; may it not pertinently be
demanded, if Christ and his Apostles had taught the Worship of Saints
and Angels, had it not been a just Reason for the Unbelief of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> notwithstanding of all the Miracles wrought by them?</p>
               <p>10. If Ten thousand Miracles should convince a Christian of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of Praying to Saints departed, whilst he hath such a plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Law against believing all Miracles upon any such account: For
if ever real Miracles were wrought at the Tombs of Martyrs, it was
in Testimony of the Truth of Christianity, for which they suffered,
not to betray any to a Superstitious or Idolatrous Worship of them: tho
there is most forcible reason to doubt of many of those pretended Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
if ever they were <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> and to fear that many of
them were but Satanical Illusions.</p>
               <p>11. Can there be a solid Reason assigned why Sacrifice as well as
Prayer may not be an Act of inferiour, as well as superiour Worship,
since the Heathens offered Sacrifice to their Inferiour Demons as well as
to the Supreme?</p>
               <p>12. Since the Roman Doctors grant that the difference betwixt
Supreme and Subordinate Worship doth not consist in the outward Act,
and that all the outward Acts may belong to both kinds (Sacrifice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excepted by them, which the Spirit of God notwithstanding makes
inferiour to Prayer) now it may be demanded, since the Law did forbid
the external acts of Worship without any regard to the Intention of the
Worshipper, doth it not appear from this, that this Idolatrous Worship
was to be punished with Death, <hi>Deut. 13?</hi> and therefore it must be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61787:8"/>
such external Idolatry as falls under the Recognizance of Humane Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures,
which Intention doth not, unless a Man had confessed his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
               <p>13. When can it be shewn that those Fathers (whose Authority is
urged by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the Invocation of Saints) do dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieally
and positively assert the Lawfulness of Praying to Saints and
Angels, since many Fathers of the same Age do positively deny the
Lawfulness of it; is it not a plain Argument, that it was not the
Judgment and Practice of the Church, and a good reasonable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
that these Fathers (in their Apostrophes and Prosopopeia's)
never intended any such thing in what they said, how lyable soever
their Words may be to be expounded in such a sense?</p>
               <p>14. May it not easily be imagin'd, wherefore the late Latin Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) of the <hi>35th</hi> Canon of the Council of
<hi>Laodicea,</hi> instead of its prohibiting the Faithful to call on the Name
of Angels, have put in <hi>Angulos (corners)</hi> contrary to all the Greek
Copies, and Fathers that writ them, and so have made nonsense of
that excellent Canon? but <hi>veritas non quaerit Angulos:</hi> And the mischief
of these Prevaricators is, that there is no resemblance in the Greek
(which is the Original Language of the Canon) betwixt the words
which signifie Angels and Angles.</p>

               <p>2. Is it possible to find an account of Indulgences in the Primitive
Times, in any other sense, than that of relaxation of Penances inflicted
upon scandalous Persons by the Governours of the Church?</p>
               <p>3. Since the most Primitive Fathers by a purging Fire for Sinners,
do generally understand the Fire of Conflagration in the last Day;
with what face can it be pretended that they believed the Romish Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
where poor Creatures suffer the Torments of Hell for a time?</p>
               <p>4. Since the Greek Church never believed the Roman Purgatory;
how can it be said with any colour of Truth, that it is a Catholick
Tradition of the Universal Church, seeing the extent of the Greek
Church is nothing inferiour to that of the Roman? The same Question
may be proposed concerning the Pope's Supremacy, the Mutilation of the
Sacrament of the Eucharist, Service in an unknown Tongue, the Celibacy
of the Clergy, and many other particulars in Controversie at this time.</p>
               <p>5. If we were to understand 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. of Purgatory; I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of those Glossators, how they reconcile the Doctrine of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles, Confessours and Martyrs, the Blessed Virgin, with
the Thief on the Cross, that they went immediately to Heaven, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice
at least; since the Apostle tells us there, that every man's Work
must be tryed by Fire, of what sort it is; which note of Universality
in the Eyes of a Puny Logician, comprehends the whole Race of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. With what Confidence can the Roman Church boast of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Behalf of Purgatory, or Indulgences, seeing it is not able
to produce any one Prayer (publick or private) nor one Indulgence,
for the Delivery of any Soul out of Purgatory, in all the Primitive
times, or out of their own ancient Missals or Records?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. SInce the most eminent of the Roman School-men, such as
<hi>Scotus, Durandus, Alphonsus a Castro, Suarez, Vasquez, Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ado,
Biel, Canus, Occam, Cajetan,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself, confess that
the Doctrine of Transubstantion cannot be evidently proved from
Scripture; and that there is no absolute necessity of understanding our
Saviour's Words in that Sense; may it not be pertinently demanded,
is there not a great deal of reason to understand them otherwise,
seeing that strange Sense is so directly repugnant to the Senses of all
that are endued with an animal Life?</p>
               <p>2. Since there be so many parallel places in Scripture, which every man
understands in a figurative, and not in a strictly literal and absurd Sense;
as where the Lamb is called the Passover; Circumcision God's Covenant;
the Church Christ's Body; the Rock which followed the <hi>Israelites,</hi> called
Christ; Christ calls himself the Door, the true Vine (which the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> would mightily have triumphed in, if he had said, this is my
true Body) wherefore may we not also understand these Words, <hi>This
is my Body,</hi> in a Metaphorical Sense, especially considering, that it is
impossible to make Sense of the whole Words of the Institution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more Figures than one?</p>
               <p>3. Can it rationally be presumed, that any sensible Man, who had
never heard of Transubstantiation being grounded on these Words,
<hi>This is my Body,</hi> would upon reading the Institution of the Eucharist,
ever have imagined any such thing to be meant by our Saviour in these
words; but rather, that this Bread signifies my Body, and this Cup
my Blood, and this which ye see me now do, do ye hereafter for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of me? Far less would it have entred into any Mans Mind (not
blinded with gross Error or Prejudice) to have thought that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
did literally hold himself in his Hand, and did eat himself, and that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61787:10"/>
he gave away himself from himself with his own Hands; especially if
it be further considered, that our Saviour having pronounced these
words, <hi>(This is my Body which is broken, and my Blood which is shed)</hi>
before his Passion, this could not be true in a literal Sense; for his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was then unbroken, and his Blood unshed, unless they will say that
Propitiation was made before Christ suffered: Nor could the Apostles
understand these words literally, since they both saw and tasted what
he gave them to be Bread and Wine; and that it was not his Body
which was given, but his Body which gave that which was given:
Whence any rational Man may infer, that St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Phrase (in
his Enarrations on the Psalms) <hi>Christus portavit se manibus suis,</hi> is to be
understood figuratively, according to his own Rule for interpreting
Scripture, given <hi>Lib. 3. de Doctr. Christ. cap.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>4. May not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as well conclude from 1 <hi>Cor. 10.

then into the natural Body of Christ, by the participation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,

or to forbid that which is profitable to others, its figurative: for Example,</hi>
Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye

its a Figure, commanding us to Communicate of the Passion of our Lord, and

               </p>
               <p>6. Since <hi>Bellarmin (in lib. descript. Eccles. an. 118.)</hi> tells us, that <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasius
Rabertus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Corbey,</hi> was the first who did write seriously
concerning the Truth of Christ's Body and Blood in the Eucharist; it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61787:10"/>
may be demanded very pertinently, if any of the Fathers before him
wrote in jest concerning such a sublime Mystery?</p>
               <p>7. Since some of the Fathers have as high Elegies of the Sacrament
of Baptism, as of the Eucharist; notwithstanding the Popish School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
grant there is no substantial Change made in that consecrated
Water, and yet that the Divine Blessing accompanying the Institution,
it may be effectual to the washing away of Sin, and Spiritual Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
what reason can be given why the Elements of Bread and Wine in
the Lord's Supper may not by the same Divine Blessing accompanying
this Institution, make all the worthy Receivers Partakers of all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Comfort designed to us thereby, without any substantial Change
made in those Elements, since our Saviour hath told us, that verily the
Flesh profiteth nothing?</p>
               <p>8. If the Canibals be abhorred as Inhuman for eating the Flesh of
their Enemies, must it not be great Inhumanity to eat the Flesh of a
Friend, and the best in the World? If none can read without horrour,
the Stories of <hi>Tereus, Thyestes,</hi> and <hi>Harpagus,</hi> their eating of their
own Children, (though ignorantly) how much more horrible must it
be to feed upon the very Body of the Son of God (that was Born of
the Virgin) knowingly? (<hi>Deum suum primo conficiunt, deinde devorant;</hi>
said <hi>Averrhoes,</hi> justly deriding that prodigious Doctrine, which a little
before his time began to be publickly taught in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church)
and with what Face could the Primitive Apologists upbraid the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
with one of their Gods, who did eat his own Children, if the
Christians had believed at that time, that they did Eat their own God?
and that no such thing being then objected by the Pagans to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
is to a Wise Man instead of a Thousand Demonstrations, that
no such Doctrine was then believed: for the Impiety and Barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the thing, as it is believed and practised in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
is not in truth extenuated, but only the appearance of it, by being
done under the Species of Bread and Wine; for the thing they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
is really done, and they believe, they verily Eat and
Drink the Natural Flesh and Blood of Christ: And suppose a man
should eat his Son in a Pasty (where the Figure of the Body is so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
that it cannot be easily known to be human Flesh; or so minced
and aromatized, that the Taste can no more discern what it is, than
<hi>Minodoe</hi> could tell of what Ingredients the fifty Dishes at the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s
Table were compounded, though his Curiosity led him to taste of
them all) yet if the Father know it, it can no ways excuse him from
unnatural Barbarity.</p>
               <p>9. How can any Romanist ascertain himself free of Idolatry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Divine Revelation? For if Transubstantiation be not true, by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61787:11"/>
their own Confession, they are certainly guilty of the most damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Idolatry in the World, in Worshiping a piece of Bread as God;
and suppose such a change could be, they can never be certain that it
is, since according to the Councils of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> the Validity
of the Consecration depends on the Intention of the Priest, which
cannot be known assuredly without Divine Revelation: neither is it
sufficient to excuse them from Idolatry, that they intended to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God, and not a Creature; for so all the Idolatry that ever was
in the World may be excused, which was nothing else but a mistake
of the Deity; and upon that mistake, a Worshiping of something,
that was not God, as God.</p>
               <p>10. Suppose a Miracle were produced to prove the Truth of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
may it not be demanded, to what purpose is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
seeing we cannot believe the Miracle, unless it be obvious to
some of our Senses? and then the Argument for Transubstantiation,
and the Objection against it, would just ballance one another: so
that in this case, a Miracle would signifie nothing, because that would
be to prove to a man by something that he sees, that he does not see,
what he sees.</p>
               <p>11. If the Senses of all mankind may be deluded, what Evidence
have we for the Passion and Resurrection of Christ? (Suppose we had
seen them with our Eyes, and not only heard of them with our Ears)
for if in the matter of Bread and Wine, all our Senses (save one)
are deceived, why might not one have been deluded in reference to
the Humiliation and Exaltation of Christ; so that we might have
as easily mistaken an Image for a living man upon the Cross, as to
imagine a piece of Bread to be the true Body of a man, and that
a living Human Body is to be found in every Atome thereof?</p>
               <p>12. Whereas its said in the Institution, that Christs Body is broken
for us, and yet the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is, that it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into Wholes, and not into Parts; doth not this clearly imply a
Contradiction, that Christ's Body is broken and not broken, at the
self same time, or that it is whole and not whole.</p>
               <p>13. Doth it not involve horrible Impieties, to imagine that the
glorified Body of our Saviour, should be contracted to the Crum of a
Wafer? That he should be perfectly deprived of Sense and Reason?
That he should not be able to defend himself against the Assaults of
the most contemptible Vermine? That if the Stomach of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant
chance to be overcharged with Wine, that he should be Vomited
up again; or if he have a <hi>Lienteria,</hi> that he should go wholly to the
Draught?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61787:11"/>
14. Since the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. tells us expresly, That the Fathers
did eat the same Spiritual Meat, and Drink the same Spiritual Drink
which we do; may it not be pertinently demanded, if the <hi>Manna,</hi> and
Rock which followed them, were Transubstantiated into the Body and
Blood of Christ? Or may not Believers under the Gospel, feed upon
Christ in a Spiritual and Mystical Sense (as the Fathers did under the
Law) without any Transubstantiation of the Elements?</p>
               <p>15. Since our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. saith, <hi>That he who Eats his Flesh, and
Drinks his Blood, hath Eternal Life;</hi> how can this be applyed to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
unless any be so absurd as to imagin, That all who
partake of those Consecrated Elements shall be saved?</p>
               <p>16. Since the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophers have (by irrefragable Reasons)
demonstrated, that the Nature of all real Bodies must needs consist in
extension, or (as they phrase it) the having <hi>partes extra partes;</hi> (it
being simply impossible to conceive an indivisible Atome, (or least par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of matter) which is laid on a plain, to touch it in all parts, but
that the Superiour Portion thereof, must be without the contact of that
plain (where there is no penetration) if therefore Christ's Body be
reduced to an indivisible point by Transubstantiation, it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
demanded, if this Opinion doth not reduce the Body of Christ
to the Nature of a Spirit; and consequently, is a worse Heresie than
the Phantastical Body of the <hi>Marcionites?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. Since divers of the ancient Fathers improved the Doctrine of
the Eucharist in order to the Confutation of the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heresie,
had it not been perfect non-sense in them to have avowed from such a
Topick (if they had believed Transubstantiation) which did apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afford a great Instance to the <hi>Eutychians</hi> against them?</p>

and if it have Life it must be killed: it may be
demanded, if Christ be truly and properly Sacrificed (as the Romanists
will have it) is he not truly and properly put to Death as oft as the
Priest says Mass? which is directly contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. &amp; 11. <hi>Cap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Whereas the Apostle argues the perfection of Christ's Sacrifice
above those of the Law, because those were offered year by year, but
the Sacrifice of Christ's Body was offered once for all; if Christ be daily
Sacrificed in the Mass, must not the Sacrifice of Christ be much more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61787:12"/>
defective than those of the Law; since one Sacrifice of Expiation for
the whole Congregation of <hi>Israel,</hi> was thought sufficient for the whole
year? whereas the Sacrifice of Christ's Body is repeated every day;
yea, for one single person, he may be Sacrificed a Thousand times
over, if we may believe the Doctrine of that Church.</p>
               <p>3. How could that be a Propitiatory Sacrifice at the first Institution,
which was previous to Christ's Death? unless they will say, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
was made before Christ suffered: though with divers of the
ancient Fathers, we are still ready to acknowledge the Eucharist to be
a Commemorative Sacrifice; and its possible, that the Error of the
Romanists had its rise therefrom.</p>

that neither the Bishop, nor that Church, would have ever consented
to the Abolition of a Sacrament, for the sake of such a Scandal as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in the mis-management of it; or if they had done so, much
less can it be imagined that the greatest part of the Christian Church

as a Sacrament, had been the Doctrine and Practice of
the Catholick Church in all Ages (though for a Thousand years after
Christ we find no such thing) how can the Practice of the Roman
Church be reconciled to the Doctrine of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> or S. <hi>Mark</hi> (for
these are their Scripture-pretences) who manifestly shew us, that the
design of that Anointing was the recovery of the Patient; (the gift
of miraculous Healing not being ceased in the days of S. <hi>Iames</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Romanists do not practise that Ceremony, till all hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
is past?</p>

                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. OF those who magnifie the Tradition of the Church so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as to imagin that the very Credit of the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
thereon, or that it gives the Scripture its Authority (which is
as much as to say, that Man gives Authority to Gods Word) it may
be demanded, What if the Church should have concealed or taught
otherwise of those Writings, than as of the undoubted Oracles of
God, would she not have erred damnably in her Tradition?</p>
               <p>2. Since Tradition in the Roman Church is taken in, to supply the
Imaginary defect of Scripture, and the Authority thereof to supply
the defect of Tradition; doth it not hence follow, that neither Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
nor Tradition, signifie any thing without the Churches Authority?
And consequently, it must needs be the Rule of their Faith; that is,
<hi>They believe themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Since the Doctrine of the Millenaries was unanimously received
as an Apostolick Tradition in the <hi>2d</hi> and <hi>3d</hi> Centuries of the Church,
meerly upon the Authority and Antiquity of <hi>Papias,</hi> who lived pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after the Apostles; (and yet by St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and many of this
present Age, looked upon as an Imposture) and if both <hi>Irenaeus</hi> for his
asserting that our Saviour suffered about the Fiftieth year of his Age,
and <hi>Clem. Alexandrinus,</hi> that he died for the Sins of the World about
the Thirtieth year of his Age, are judged exceedingly mistaken, (and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61787:13"/>
not without good ground) notwithstanding they both pretended an
Apostolick Tradition, as having conversed with Apostolick Men; <hi>(Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
having written <hi>An.</hi> 180. and <hi>Clemens 190.)</hi> And in fine, since in
that famous contention about <hi>Easter</hi> (which miserably afflicted the
Church in the days of <hi>P. Victor,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by dividing the
Eastern Christians from the Western; one pretending Oral Tradition
from S. <hi>Iohn</hi> and S. <hi>Philip,</hi> and the other from S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi>)
may it not be pertinently demanded, What stress can be laid upon a
pretence of Apostolick Tradition sixteen hundred years after Christ,
(suppose it were now become Universal) but especially, when it is
but the particluar Tradition of a particular Church?</p>
               <p>4. What greater certainty can be given, of the uncertainty of Oral
Tradition (as it is contradistinguished from the Scripture) than this
consideration, that of all Christ said (and no doubt he spoke much
in point of Morality, which is not expressed in the Gospels) nothing
is found in any Authentick Record (save the Scriptures) except that
one expression preserved by S. <hi>Hierom, Be thou never merry, unless thou
see thy Brother living in Charity;</hi> for which notable expression, we have
the sole Authority of S. <hi>Hierom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Since its evident from the penult of S. <hi>Iohn's</hi> Gospel at the end,
as also the close of the last Chapter, <hi>That our Saviour did many great
things, which are not recorded in Holy Scripture;</hi> is it not a great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the great incertainty of Oral Tradition, that none of all
those Miracles not found in Scripture, are conveyed to us by any
warrantable Record? the Legends which contain some of those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Miracles, being rejected as Fabulous by the best Criticks of the
Roman Church.</p>

Where was your Church before</hi> Luther? May it not as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
be demanded, Should a Revolt happen from the Reformed
Church of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Romanism</hi> again, (which God forbid) where
was your Religion before 86, or before such a time? Would they not
answer, at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> also; only kept under, and obscured
by Hereticks? And Christianity, though not so visible, yet was purer,

was inserted by the Latin Church, into the Creed; and if they know
not the <hi>Aera</hi> of their Truths, how can it be rationally expected that
we should design the precise times when all their Errors began, since
its in the Night Season, that the Adversary Sows his Tares in the Field
of the Church?</p>
               <p>3. It may be demanded, what more pertinency (amongst Disputers)
is in that old <hi>Thred-bare Question, Where was your Church, or Religion,
before</hi> Luther; than in this amongst Husbandmen, Where was the
Corn before it was Weeded? For if our Forefathers under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
embraced the true Faith, we have it still; the Faith not being
removed, but the Corruption.</p>
               <p>4. Since the Church of <hi>England</hi> obligeth none to believe any thing
as necessary to Salvation, but what is plainly proved from holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and intirely holds the Apostolick, <hi>Nicene,</hi> and <hi>Athanasian</hi>
Creeds; and obeys more Canons of the first general Councils, than
those of <hi>Rome</hi> do; and approves that Exposition of Scripture, which
hath the consent of the Fathers of the four first Centuries: Yea,
holds all that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> held necessary for Salvation for
five or six hundred years together; so that a Romanist may turn
Protestant, without adding any Article to his Faith; but a Protestant
cannot turn Romanist, without the addition of many new ones, or
novel Inventions, which have neither Foundation in Scripture, nor
genuin Antiquity: May it not then be most rationally concluded,
that the Protestant way is the surest and safest, because both sides
agree therein; and that their Church was, long before Papacy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the World?</p>
               <p>5. Since its impossible to produce any genuin Work of any of the
Fathers, who lived within Four Hundred Years after Christ, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
asserts the practice or the lawfulness of Prayer in an unknown
Tongue, of taking away the Cup from the People, or with-holding
the Scriptures from the Laicks, or Adoring Images, or having them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61787:14"/>
in Churches, the Pope's Infallibility or Supremacy, Indulgences (in the
Sense of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth) the Doctrine of Merit, (in the Sense of
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) that there are neither more nor less than Seven
Sacraments, the necessity of the right Intention of the Priest for the
Validity of a Sacrament, Transubstantiation, the Limbo of unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
Infants, Private Masses, the Popes deposing Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may it
not more pertinently be demanded of the Romanists, Where was Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
before <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, than they can enquire of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
Where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Since its impossible to find any of the Primitive Fathers (or any
Christian Writer a thousand years after Christ and more,) who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
all the Twelve new Articles of Faith, which <hi>P. Pius</hi> the Fourth
hath added to the Apostolick Creed; may it not be pertinently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of the Romanists, Where was your Faith to be found intirely
before the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> And is not the Modern Papacy younger
by many years than <hi>Martin Luther</hi> himself?</p>
               <p>7. Since not one of the Twelve new Articles of the Creed of P. <hi>Pius</hi>
the Fourth is to be found in any ancient Creed or Confession of Faith
generally allowed in the Christian Church, (whence it is evident that
they are Innovations destitute of Primitive Authority) may we not more
pertinently demand of them, Where was Papacy when those Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
were framed? than they can enquire of us, Where was your
Church before <hi>Luther?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Since every true Reformation necessarily pre-supposeth Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Errors to have been before it, what Advantage can the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists
have in charging our Reformation with Novelty? For if a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Reformation be made, the thing justifies it self, and a Reformation
must begin sometime, and when ever it begins, it is certainly new:
Besides, it ought to be considered, that this Objection of Novelty lyes
against all Reformation whatsoever; tho never so necessary, and tho
things be never so much amiss: So that tho our Reformation was as late
as <hi>Luther,</hi> our Religion is as antient as Christianity it self; for when
the Additions which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made to the antient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, and their Innovations in Practise are par'd off, that which
remains of their Religion is ours; and this they cannot deny to be
every tittle of it the antient Christianity: And what other Answer, I
pray, could the <hi>Iews</hi> have given to the like Question, if it had been
put to them by the Antient Idolaters of the World, Where was your
Religion before <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Moses?</hi> Or what other Answer could the
Primitive Christians have given to those Pagans, who pretended Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Antiquity and Universality for their Polytheisme, but the very
same in substance, which we now give to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61787:15"/>
if any be so fond as to brand the Protestant Religion with Novelty,
because of some negative Articles (in opposition to the Corruptions
of the Roman Church, which by accident are become a part of our
Faith, occasioned by their Errors) they may as well tax the Primitive
Church with Novelty, because the renouncing of the Doctrines of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism</hi>
at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Macedonianism</hi> at the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
of <hi>Nestorianism</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and of <hi>Eutychianism</hi> at <hi>Calcedon,</hi>
came a part of the Catholick Religion after the rise of those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies.</p>
               <p>9. But, (to shut up this Point) if to Pray without Understanding,
to obey without Reason, and to believe against Sense, be the surest
Evidences of the Antiquity of a Church, then I pray where is that
Protestant to be found, who is so contentious for Priority, as not to
yield (upon these accounts) the Precedency to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all Christian Societies in the World?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. IF the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be infallible, wherefore are they
so uncharitable to the World (at least to their own Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
as not to give an infallible Comment on Scripture, but suffers
her Doctors to write as fallible Comments, and in many things as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to each other, as any Protestant Divines do? And I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what good Infallibility does, if an infallible Church has no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
means of understanding Scripture, than the Comments of fallible
Men, that is, no better means then every fallible Church hath?</p>
               <p>2. When the Doctors of the Roman Church vye Reasons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with us Hereticks, and dispute from Scripture and Antiquity,
(especially in order to the establishing that beloved <hi>Palladium</hi> of their
Churches Authority and Infallibility, which those cross-grain'd Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
deny) do they not appeal from the Infallibility of the present
Church, to every Man's private Reason and Judgment, as much as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Protestant does? For its against the very Principles of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
to imagin that the Churches Authority can be a sufficient Topick
to prove it self.</p>
               <p>3. If a visible uninterrupted Succession be the Mark of such a true
Church, as is the infallible Interpreter of Scripture (as some Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
aver) wherefore is not the <hi>Greek</hi> Church an infallible Interpreter
of Scripture, since she hath as visible and uninterrupted Succession
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61787:15"/>
from Christ and his Apostles to this Day, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
has? yea, if we consult the Catalogues of their Patriarchs of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
and <hi>Antioch,</hi> we shall not find so many Chasma's occasioned (in
those Lists) by Schisms, as in the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Since P. <hi>Zachary</hi> deposed <hi>Virgilius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Saltzburge,</hi> as an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,
because he truly maintained, (tho in a very ignorant Age)
the Doctrine of Antipodes; may it not be pertinently demanded,
may not he who can mistake Truth for Heresie, also mistake Heresie
for Truth? as no doubt P. <hi>Liberius, Vigilius,</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> did.</p>
               <p>5. Since its confessed by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (and divers other eminent Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
for that Church) that the Popes Canonizations are doubtful and
subject to Error; may it not be pertinently demanded, if his Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
should chance at any time to mistake (as I am pretty sure he
hath done more than once) in what a pitiful case are the Members of
that Church, who are obliged to invocate such mistaken Saints?
Would not that be Idolatry?</p>
               <p>6. Since in the first and last Ages of the Church, there were many
Schisms and Heresies, which (if we believe <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived in the
Second Century) were as wild and extravagant as any of later date;
now if the Fathers who lived in these Primitive Ages believed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the Roman Church at that time, may it not be pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demanded, Was there no Prudence amongst them all in going so far
about by their endeavours to bring those Hereticks and Schismaticks
to the Touch-stone of the Scripture, and next to that, to the most Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
and Catholick Tradition? whereas how short and easie a Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to all Debates might have been fetched hence, had they had the
same Apprehension of the Authority and Efficacy thereof, by referring
all Controversies depending to the determination of the Roman Church
(the Mother and Mistress of all) and that infallible Conduct setled
therein? But not one word of that, which makes it more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that such holy and wise men knew no such thing; only when they
make their Appeals to her after the express word of God, its in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with many other Churches, especially those of Apostolical Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
as is evident from <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> when
they had to deal with such Persons.</p>
               <p>7. How can any rational man imagin that the Popes or Roman Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
(which they account General) are infallible, even when they are
confirmed by Popes, unless Errors become Truths, and Contradictions
be reconciled when determined by a Pope and Council? Since P. <hi>Vigilius</hi>
not only confirmed the Fifth General Council, which formerly he
had condemned, but General Councils confirmed by Popes have made
Definitions and Decrees plainly contradictory one to another: Thus
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61787:16"/>
the Sixth General Council confirmed by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the First, defined
that Marriage was dissolved by Heresie: And the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
confirmed by P. <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, that it could not be so: The Council
of <hi>Constance,</hi> confirmed by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth, decreed, that a
General Council was superiour to the Pope: The last <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
under P. <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, condemned this Decree; so did it the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of P. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth, who ratified the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> as a
true General Council.</p>
               <p>8. How can any doubt that General Councils confirmed by Popes,
may err? since it is so manifest they have actually erred, by making De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
so apparently contradictory to the Plain Words and Sense of Holy
Scripture, that no impartial Person can any more question it, than he can,
whether Theft be forbidden by the Eighth Commandment: So did the
Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> confirmed by P. <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Trent,</hi>
by P. <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, the former in the Decree for Laicks Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in one kind only, notwithstanding (as themselves acknowledge)
that Christ instituted the Sacrament in both kinds, and delivered it in
both to his Disciples: The later in decreeing, that Divine Service
should not be in the Vulgar Tongue, in plain Contradiction to what
St. <hi>Paul</hi> prescribes in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. not to speak that the Pope's Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Doctrinal Definitions, is but a meer Ceremony; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any man to make that become true, which is false; or
that which is false, to become true.</p>
               <p>9. Since from the fitness of an infallible visible Judge for the Militant
Church, the Romanists are apt to pretend that God hath actually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
such an one, without which, God (say they) had not made
sufficient Provisions for the Assurance of Man's Faith, and for the Peace
and Unity of his Church (or, as it is with a strange kind of Civility
expressed in their Canon Law, <hi>Aliter Dominus non videretur fuisse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretus,</hi>
otherwise our Lord had not seem'd to be discreet) may it not
be very pertinently urged from this Topick of Humane Appearance,
that it had been yet more useful for the Church, that not only the first
Patriarch, but all of them, had been infallible; yea, and all the Bishops,
and Presbyters of the Church; and if all men had been infallible,
certainly the Church of God should never have been troubled with
any Error whatsoever, but the experience of the World demonstrates
that it is not so.</p>
               <p>10. If it be a fit Argument always to conclude that God hath done
such a thing, because the generality of Men judge it expedient to be
done; may it not be pertinently demanded, where is that man, who,
consulting with Flesh and Blood (I mean Humane Reason) who would
not have thought it very fit, that our Saviour, after his Resurrection,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61787:16"/>
should have publickly taught the People of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> in the Temple, as
he used to do, that all the Inhabitants of that great City, (yea, all the
Males throughout the Land being obliged to be there also at the Feast of
the Passover) might by an ocular Demonstration be convinced that our
Saviour was not an Impostor, when he said he would rise again the
third day? yet the infinite Wisdom thought it not fit, <hi>For his ways are
not as our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts,</hi> Isa. 55. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>11. Since it is no less behoofful for the Purity of the Militant Church,
to be secured from Vice, than from Error, by some infallible means;
and whereas the former is not pretended to by any, is it not very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to put the Romanists to it, to shew from Scripture who this
Infallible Visible Judge is who is invested with that Power, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
especially when it is considered that our Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
in the Church is now become our greatest Controversie? Besides
that, it would puzzle any man to give a good reason why God
should take more care to secure men against Errors in Belief, than
against Sin and Wickedness in their Lives.</p>
               <p>12. If an infallible visible Judge be such an adequate means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin
all Controversies in matters of Religion, which happen in the
Militant Church, (as the Romanists pretend) how came it to pass that
there were so many Schisms and Heresies too in the Apostles times,
when those who govern'd the Church were certainly guided by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Spirit?</p>
               <p>13. Can the fiercest Bigot of Popery prove from Holy Scripture, that
the Pope is infallible (in the Popish Sense of the World?) I know
that some fly the Absurdity, by hiding the Pope in the Church; but
if the Church be Infallible, it is so as its representative in General
Councils, or diffusive in the whole Body of Christians; and then what is
Infallibility to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> more than to any other particular
Church? And how shall that which is common to all, give power to
one over all? And what is it to the Pope above another Bishop or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch?</p>
               <p>14. Since the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath determined that Infants should
not be Communicated, because they cannot examine themselves, nor
discern the Lord's Body; who can doubt but that Popes, with their
Councils, and Roman Church, have erred in their Belief and Practice
of the Communion of Infants long ago, it being past all doubt that for
some Hundreds of Years it was so in the Roman Church?</p>
               <p>15. Was not the Apostle to blame, to say there must be Heresies
and Divisions among you, and not to tell them, there must be also
an infallible Judge among you to obviate such pertinacious Errors and
Schisms, if so be that God had appointed any such infallible visible Judge
to be for ever in his Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61787:17"/>
16. If the many Dissentions in the Protestant Churches (as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
make this infallible visible Judge always necessary, how is it
that this sole Remedy is found so ineffectual against the Divisions in the
Roman Church, and that there are so many Differences there about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
it self, the manner and subject of it? so that many Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
(not of the dullest brains) being ashamed of it, have betaken
themselves to Tradition instead thereof.</p>

               <p>2. Had not the <hi>African</hi> Churches as good reason to decline the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Authority of the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Churches of <hi>Cyprus</hi> to
reject the Jurisdiction of the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> (from which libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
at last by the Third General Council) since they had still a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat
of their own; and were no more within the Roman Patriarchat,
than <hi>Cyprus</hi> was within that of <hi>Antioch?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Since all sober Persons <hi>hinc inde,</hi> acknowledg a Primacy of Order
in St. <hi>Peter</hi> (either for his Age, or his being first called to be an Apostle,
or for his Zeal, or some other reason best known to his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster)
it being impossible that any Society should remain long without
Confusion (far less that it should continue well ordered) which hath
not one appointed to be the Mouth thereof; it may therefore be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
demanded if any Romanist can produce any place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which imports a formal Jurisdiction in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which was not at
some other time vouchsafed on the Catholick Church, at least on the
rest of the Apostles?</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Dato sed non concesso,</hi> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had a Primacy of Jurisdiction
over all the General Members of the Catholick Church; wherefore
might not this have been a personal Priviledge and intransmissible to
any Successor, no less than the <hi>Gradus Mosaicus</hi> was to any other Prophet?</p>
               <p>5. Upon what Grounds do <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and others call Christ's Ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of these Words, <hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> the peculiar Priviledge of St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> above all the rest of the Apostles, since St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61787:17"/>
of <hi>Alexandria</hi> call it the peculiar Penance of St. <hi>Peter</hi> for denying
his Lord and Master, which none of the rest had done?</p>
               <p>6. Since the Primitive Fathers by Rock in the <hi>16th.</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
generally understand either Christ himself, or that excellent Confession
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where then doth his peculiar Prerogative lye in these
Words?</p>
               <p>7. Suppose our Saviour did mean by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he said, <hi>On this
Rock will I build my Church,</hi> (alluding to his Name by way of Emphasis,
not Exclusion) I pray, where is yet the peculiarity of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
since if we believe either St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Revelation,
the rest of the Apostles were Foundations as well as he? for I hope
none will call him the <hi>Chief Corner-stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Since the generality of the ancient Fathers look upon <hi>Peter</hi> (both
in his Excellent Confession, and Promise made to him, as personating
the Catholick Church) and that what our Saviour there promised, was
after his Resurrection fulfilled, as we may read, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21, 22, 23.
Where, I pray you, is St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s special Priviledge above the rest of
the Apostles, since our Saviour said to them all alike, <hi>As my Father
sent me, so send I you:</hi> (and I suppose S. <hi>Peter</hi> could not have a Sublimer
Mission than our Saviour) and breathed upon them all, and said, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ye the Holy Ghost, whose Sins ye remit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>9. But what ever Sense these Words of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> may have, or these
of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> doth it not evidently appear, that what our Saviour
promised to St. <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 16. was given to the Catholick Church, at
least to the rest of the Apostles as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. in
the same words of <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. our Saviour himself having expounded
the Power of the Keys, by that of Binding and loosing?</p>
               <p>10. Since after that Promise made to St. <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 18. we find the
Apostles (more than once) controverting for Superiority; may it not
very rationally be presumed that H. Jesus (the Wisdom of the Father
and Prince of Peace) having taken notice of that Ambitious Debate,
would once have undeceived them, by telling them, that tho the Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potical
Power of the Gentile Kings or Governours should be far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from them, yet their minds should be at rest, because he had
already invested St. <hi>Peter</hi> with a Paternal Authority or Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction over them, when he promised to him the Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven; but since in our Saviour's reproof we find no
such Insinuation, may it not be pertinently doubted if ever he meant
any such matter?</p>
               <p>11. I would demand, how the ensuing particulars can be reconciled
to a formal Jurisdiction of S. <hi>Peter</hi> over the rest of the Apostles, 1. The
Care of all the Churches being committed to every one of them <hi>in soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61787:18"/>
2. St. <hi>Peter</hi> was sent by the Apostles and Elders at <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
to <hi>Samaria</hi> (he that gave the Commission having rather the Authority,
than the Person commissionated.) 3. His being called to an account
for conversing with <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion in <hi>Caesaria,</hi> and other Gentiles,
by those at <hi>Hierusalem, velut vehementur infensi</hi> (as S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> phraseth
it.) 4. If St. <hi>Peter</hi> was then Supreme Governour, wherefore did not
the controverting Christians at <hi>Antioch</hi> address first to him in order
to the indicting of a Council? 5. Wherefore did St. <hi>Iames</hi> preside
therein, and by his Verdict determine the Controversie (if we believe
<hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi>) and not St. <hi>Peter,</hi> on which account, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was the first Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and of the Christian
World, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> positively asserts that St. <hi>Iames</hi> was invested by our
Saviour with a Superiority over all the Apostles. 6. Wherefore was
not that Decree issued forth in the Name of <hi>Peter,</hi> if he was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of the Church? 7. Why was St. <hi>Paul</hi> so immethodical to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Iames</hi> before <hi>Cephas</hi> or <hi>Peter;</hi> and so arrogant as to say, that he
was, in nothing, inferiour to the chiefest Apostles (for if St. <hi>Peter</hi>
was his Superiour, he came short of him in something, which is very
material, and that is Authority.) 8. Was not St. <hi>Paul</hi> a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
Vassal to rebuke his Lord and Master for Judaizing; and so
solemnly, that both Jews and Gentiles were witness to the Reproof?
9. How could St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> say that the rest of the Apostles were the
same that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was, <hi>pari consortio praediti honoris &amp; potestatis?</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
How could <hi>Eusebius</hi> aver (in his Old Editions, before they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi>) that <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Princes of the Apostles, and that these three were equal?</p>
               <p>12. Since P. <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, with the consent and approbation of
the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council (which they account General) declares that our
Blessed Saviour did institute St. <hi>Peter</hi> (and his Successors in the Roman
See) his Vicars, to whom, by the Testimony of the Book of Kings,
it was so necessary to yield Obedience, that whosoever would not,
was punished with Death: (thus <hi>Binius Concil. Tom.</hi> 9.) it may be
pertinently demanded, if they have Five Books of the Kings, for in the
Vulgar Version (which have four of that Name) there is not any Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
which insinuates any such matter?</p>
               <p>13. If the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was invested <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> with an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Jurisdiction over the Catholick Church; or if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
either in its Head or Members, severally, or in all conjunctly, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with an infallible Spirit; how comes it to pass that all the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Apologists were guilty of such a Supine Negligence (from <hi>Iustin
Martyr,</hi> the first of them, who lived, <hi>Anno</hi> 150. to <hi>Theodoret</hi> inclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who dyed about the middle of the Fifth Century) as never to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61787:18"/>
that most admirable Prerogative of the Roman Church above all
the Societies in the World, since some of them descend to many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
Particulars, which are long ago obsolete and out of date in all the
<hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. If it be a sufficient Answer for the Silence of the Apologists, to
say, that they are so succinct, that they had no room for such a matter?
For though it is easily granted, that of <hi>Asianus, Melito, Quadratus,</hi>
and <hi>Aristides,</hi> we have but Shreds in <hi>Eusebius;</hi> and that <hi>Athenagoras,
Tatian, Theophilus, Antiochenus, Minutius Foelix, Cyprian ad Demetrianum,
I. Firmicus Maternus,</hi> are very brief; not to speak of many Orations
written by the Fathers against <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, the Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
in general (which are also reckoned among the Apologists, and
are yet briefer) yet the two Apologies of <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue
with <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Jew, all the Works of <hi>Clem. Alexandrinus,</hi>
save his <hi>Paedagogus,</hi> the larger Apologetick of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> with his lesser
<hi>ad Scapulam,</hi> and some Books against the Jews and Gentiles, the eight
Books of <hi>Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus,</hi> the seven Books of <hi>Arnobius contra
Gentes,</hi> and so many of <hi>Lactantius</hi> his Institutions, <hi>Eusebius de demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratione
&amp; praeparatione Evangelica, S. Augustin</hi> his 22 Books <hi>de Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Dei, Theodoret</hi> his 12 Books <hi>de curandis Graecorum affectibus;</hi> all
these are pretty Voluminous: yet <hi>ne gru quidem,</hi> not the least word or
insinuation of any such prodigious privilegeof the Roman Church,
either in its Head or Members.</p>
               <p>15. What greater Elogy could have been given by any of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> than that which S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> applies to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that
he was the Light of all the Churches, the Foundation of the Faith, the
Pillar and Ground of Truth?</p>
               <p>16. Might not the Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> have claimed by virtue of
Succession, a Superiority over all the Organical Members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, as well as the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> since it is certain, S.
<hi>Peter</hi> resided seven years at <hi>Antioch;</hi> and it cannot be proved from any
Authentick Record, that he was one year at <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. May not the Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> (which is the Mother of us
all) with better reason claim an universal Monarchy over the Church,
by virtue of Succession; since the unquestionable Head of the Church
dyed there? And S. <hi>Iames</hi> the Lord's Brother, was unquestionably
the first Bishop of the Christian World; whence <hi>Epiphanius</hi> concludes,
that the Principality over the Church was due to him, and not to St.
<hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. Since its granted by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and others, that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
at <hi>Rome</hi> was but accidental (there being no Scripture Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
or Catholick Tradition for it) can the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61787:19"/>
of his See, pretend to S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Spirit and Power, upon better
grounds than <hi>Vibius Rufus</hi> did to the Genius of the Great <hi>Caesar,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he bought his Chair?</p>
               <p>19. Could any of the Fathers have Complemented the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> with an higher Hyperbole, than <hi>Synesius</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Cyrene,</hi>
did his Patriarch <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (none of the best of men,
for he was a great Persecutor of S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>) by calling his Advice
a Divine Response, and an Heavenly Oracle?</p>
               <p>20. Can any Instance be given of any Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who before
the famous Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> presumed to exercise any proper Act of
Jurisdiction, without the proper Bounds of his own Patriarchat, called
the Suburbicarian Churches, except P. <hi>Victor;</hi> who for attempting
to Censure others without his own Precinct, was severely reprehended
by <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> and P. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who was justly censured by S. <hi>Cyprian?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. Since to be the ultimate Object of Appeals (or <hi>dernier besort,</hi>
as the French phrase it) is the Essential Privilege of all Monarchs, is
it accountable, that the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> believed the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s
Supremacy over the Catholick Church, when it determined, that all
Appeals during the Intervals of general Councils, should be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the Provincial Synods, or by the respective Patriarchs; and
that there should be no Appeal from the one to the other?</p>
               <p>22. If the Churches of <hi>Africa</hi> believed the Popes Supremacy to be
<hi>jure divino,</hi> how could 217 Bishops in the <hi>6th.</hi> Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
(whereof S. <hi>Austin</hi> was one) have opposed Three Popes successively
in the matter of Appeals to <hi>Rome;</hi> and condemned all those as Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
who did thus Appeal; and made a formal Separation of
their Churches from the <hi>Roman,</hi> upon the account of its Illegal and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Incroachments?</p>
               <p>23. If that Separation was unjust, how comes S. <hi>Augustin</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
over all the Christian World, and at <hi>Rome</hi> too, an eminent
Saint? since he died, (as the Romanists think) in actual and unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Schism: since S. <hi>Augustin</hi> denied the Popes Supremacy in matter
of Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> no less than <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth of <hi>England,</hi> might
not <hi>P. Coelestin</hi> as justly have Excommunicated S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> as P. <hi>Paul</hi>
the Third, did <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth of <hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>24. Since by many of the Epistles of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Mauricius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> its appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that he declares all those Prelates who usurp the Titles of
Oecumenical Patriarch, Universal Bishop, and Head of the Catholick
Church, to be the Forerunners, or Harbangers of Antichrist; may it
not be pertinently demanded, if all those Popes who from <hi>Boniface?</hi>
the Third inclusively, have affected those Titles, do not stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61787:19"/>
by the Judgment of their Predecessour as Antichristian?</p>
               <p>25. If it be the Popes Prerogative (as the Romanists pretend) to
assemble all the general Councils, how did it chance, that during a
Thousand years after Christ, and more, there was not an Oecumenical
Synod in <hi>Italy,</hi> no not in all the West, (unless that of <hi>Frankford</hi> be
accounted one, which was indicted by <hi>Charlemain</hi> against the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
at <hi>Nice</hi>) and that they were very desirous to have one in <hi>Italy,</hi>
is most evident from the Letters of P. <hi>Leo</hi> the First, (none of the
meanest spirited Popes) to <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Younger, his Sister <hi>Pulche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
the Emperour <hi>Marcianus, Valentinian</hi> the Third, with <hi>Eudoxia</hi>
the Empress; whom he did Supplicate on his Knees, with many Tears,
(thus he phraseth it) for a Council to be holden in <hi>Italy</hi> against the
<hi>Eutychians;</hi> but could never obtain his desire, as to that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>26. If the Emperours were nothing else but the Popes <hi>Mandatarij</hi>
in the indicting of Councils (as some term them) what could be the
reason that P. <hi>Vigilius,</hi> being personally in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> would not
Countenance the <hi>5th</hi> general Council, assembled there by <hi>Iustinian</hi> the
Great, till he was haled thereto by the Authority of the Emperour,
and forced to obey the Mandat of his pretended <hi>Mandatarius,</hi> in
condemning the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> which by a former Constitution he had
approved?</p>
               <p>27. If the Confirmation of a general Council by the Pope, be so
necessary, that all its acts are invalid without it, (as some Romanists
pretend) how could the Patriarchs of <hi>Constantinople</hi> be so irregular,
as to possess the place in all succeeding Councils (where they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
which the <hi>2d</hi> and <hi>4th</hi> general Councils had allotted to them,
notwithstanding of all the Protestations of P. <hi>Leo</hi> the First, and his
Successors, against those Council Acts?</p>
               <p>28. Since the Bishops of the Primitive Church were promiscuously
termed Popes, (from the old Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ใ in non-Latin alphabet ใ</desc>
                  </gap> which signifies a
Father) their Episcopal Sees, Thrones, and Empires; and themselves,
(how small soever their Diocess were) were also called Princes (if
we believe S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and S. <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Poictiers</hi>) all were
termed the Successors of the Apostles, and equal as to the intrinsi
Power of Bishops, whether it were the little Bishoprick of <hi>Eugubium,</hi>
compared with that of <hi>Rome; Rhegium</hi> with that of <hi>Constantinople;
Tanis</hi> with <hi>Alexandria;</hi> (if we give Faith to S. <hi>Hierom</hi>) therefore
it may pertinently be demanded, What solid Grounds had <hi>Hildebrand</hi>
to Monopolize those Titles to the Bishop of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>29. If the Romanists can produce any Authentick Author for the
Decretal Epistles of all the Popes, from <hi>Clemens</hi> to P. <hi>Sirvius,</hi> (that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61787:20"/>
is to the middle, at the least, of the <hi>4th</hi> Century) though they have
made up a considerable part of the Canon Law, before <hi>Riculfus</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who lived 500 years after those Popes were dead.</p>
               <p>30. Since the Belief of an Infallible Headship in the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
is with many Romanists, the reason why they receive their Articles
of Faith; must it not then be the fundamental Article of all others?
And ought it not to be the best attested by some plain places of
Scripture; and not leave by its silence this sole visible Vicegerent of
Christ, to the Suspicion of bearing witness to himself?</p>
               <p>31. Since the Pope receives his Office with an Oath, to observe the
Apostolick Canons (as they are termed) with the Canons of the Eight
first general Councils; and notwithstanding, it is evident from the
35 and 36 Canons of the Apostles, (or the 33 and 34 Canons, as <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
hath them) that these are directly against the Popes Supremacy,
as also the 6 and 7 Canons of the First general Council; the 9, 17,
and 28 Canons of the Fourth general Council: the Fifth, in condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sentence of P. <hi>Vigilius,</hi> (in favour of the <hi>tria Capitula</hi>) tho he
was very vehement in the cause: the Sixth and Seventh, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
P. <hi>Honorius</hi> of Heresie: the Eighth and last, by imposing a
Canon upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and challenging Obedience thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
(<hi>viz.</hi> its Condemning a Custom of the Sabbath Fast in Lent)
may we not very rationally hence conclude, that the Fathers during
eight hundred and seventy years after Christ, knew no such thing as
the Popes Supremacy by Divine Right, or any Right at all, seeing
they opposed it: And that they did not believe the Infallibility of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they had no Tradition of either that Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
or Infallibility, that it is in vain to plead Antiquity in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or Councils, or Primitive Church, for either: and that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of these eight general Councils, being the sense both of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and the professed Faith of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the
Popes Authority must needs stand Condemned by the Catholick Church
at this day, by the ancient Church, and the present Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
her self, as she holds Communion (at least in Profession) with the
ancient? And in fine, how can the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> escape the charge
of Heresie? for he who believes the Popes Supremacy, denies in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
the eight first general Councils, (at least in that point) and
that's Heresie; and he who believes the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> believes
the Article of the Popes Supremacy; therefore he who believes the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> doth not believe the eight first general Councils,
and therefore is guilty of Heresie: And how can any Pope evade the
Brand of Schism, (the foulest that ever the Church groaned under)
aggravated with the horrid Crime of Perjury; since the Pope (as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61787:20"/>
such) professeth to believe, and sweareth to govern the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Canons of the first General Councils, yet openly
claims, and professedly practiseth a Power condemned by them all:
thus, <hi>quatenus</hi> Pope, he stands guilty of Separation from the ancient
Church; and as Head of a new and strange Society, draws the Body
of his Faction after him into the same Schism, in flat contradiction to
the ancient Church, and to that solemn Oath by which also the Pope,
as Pope, binds himself (at his Inauguration) to maintain the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Practice thereof.</p>

Princes being those Wolves which are to be driven away as hurtful
to the Flock) may not such a <hi>Lyncean</hi> Eye by a like kind of Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
find this other Mystery in the Words, that all Christians are
Fools, because Sheep are silly Creatures?</p>
               <p>4. Since the Doctrine of Deposing Power in Popes (by which I
mean not only their excommunicating absolute Monarchs, but also
the exposing their Dominions as a just Prey to the first Invader) is so
scandalous to the Christian Religion in the Eyes of all sober Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
and hath been found so mischievous to many Sovereign Princes;
wherefore was not that destructive Doctrine condemned by some Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council, they having had many which they account such, since
the Fourth Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, where
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61787:21"/>
it was certainly defined, let them call it an Article of Faith, a Point
of Discipline, or what they will.</p>
               <p>5. Since it is evident from <hi>Baronius, Binius, Platina, Onuphrius,</hi> and
many others, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> (nick-named <hi>Hildebrand</hi>) did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> Emperor of <hi>Germany:</hi> P. <hi>Paschal</hi> the <hi>2d,
Henry</hi> the <hi>5th. Alexander</hi> the <hi>3d, Frederick</hi> the <hi>1st. Innocent</hi> the <hi>4th,
Frederick</hi> the 2. <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8th, Philip</hi> the Fair of <hi>France: Iulius</hi> the
<hi>2d, Lewis</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> with him who was King of <hi>Navarre</hi> at that time;
(on which putrid Title <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick seized on his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
and that <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> did also excommunicate <hi>Henry</hi> the
<hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> And <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> King <hi>Iohn,</hi> (Six years before the
Resignation of his Crown into the Hands of that Popes Legat;) may
it not be justly doubted, if they who can confidently aver that never
any Pope presumed to excommunicate an absolute Prince, did ever
read those Histories, if so be they have put in Print what they did
think?</p>
               <p>6. Whether that place, <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 2. 13. which is quoted by P. <hi>Innocent</hi>
the <hi>3d.</hi> in his arrogant Epistle to the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> doth
prove that the Pope is as much greater than the Emperor, as the Sun
is greater than the Moon? which strange Comparison is inserted by
<hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>9th.</hi> into the Body of the Canon-Law; and ever since
continued in all the Editions of that Law.</p>
               <p>7. If <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great imagined himself superiour to the Emperor
<hi>Mauritius,</hi> and not rather much his Inferiour, when he wrote to that
Emperor, that in Obedience to his Commands he had published one of
his Laws, which himself judged scarce agreeable to the Law of God?</p>
               <p>8. If (according to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) it can
properly be called Rebellion to resist and dethrone a deposed Prince,
or if it can be termed true Loyalty to defend him? Since the deposing
Doctrine doth import, that when a Prince is deposed by the Authority
of their Church, they absolve their Subjects from their Fealty; and then
it is no Rebellion to take up Arms.</p>
               <p>9. Since the deposing Doctrine hath been decreed and practised by
their Popes and General Councils, and that no Pope or Council since
<hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> hath ever condemned it; and that the Jesuits do still
maintain it, (their greatest Champions, <hi>Bellarmin, Suarez, Becan,
Gretzer, Mariana, Sanctarellus,</hi> and many others, having expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
for it) yea, tho the present Pope (who is not the worst of the
Pack) did lately censure some other Jesuitical Doctrines (as great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities)
yet he thought fit to let the deposing Doctrine escape
without Censure; may we not justly admire how some of this Age
have the Effrontory to out-face all Mankind (who have Eyes in their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61787:21"/>
Heads, and Skill enough to read the Decrees of their Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils)
by saying that the deposing Doctrine is not the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of a nameless Party?</p>
               <p>10. As for those who Found their Loyalty upon this Supposition,
that the deposing Doctrine is not the Doctrine of the Roman Church,
doth not this Hypothesis afford a shrewd Suspicion, that if it were the
Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or ever should be so, or they should
ever be convinced that it is so, then they would be for the deposing of
Princes, no less than those, who at this Day believe it to be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
thereof?</p>
               <p>11. May it not be justly doubted, whatever some little inferiour
People in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> think of these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
while the Governing part of the Church believes otherwise, as
they certainly do, at this day (if the Pope and his Adherents are the
Governing Part) Princes have no security that Popes will not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
and exercise this Authority, but their want of Power to do it,
which is wholly owing to the Reformation; for till Princes had Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
who valued not the Popes Authority, they themselves were the
Popes Vassals, and must necessarily be so again, could they extinguish
this pestilent Northern Heresie (as they phrase it) the great Fault of
which is, that it hath given Strength and Security to Princes, by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Popes Pretensions.</p>
               <p>12. Since the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> owns the <hi>4th.</hi> Council of <hi>Lateran</hi>
for a General Council, <hi>Sess.</hi> 39. (where the deposing Power is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
declared as any thing can be, unless Men will quibble upon
Words, and make Nonsense of them) and that P. <hi>Martin</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi>
in his Bull for the Confirmation of the Council of <hi>Constance, Sess.</hi> 45.
gives the Sense of the Proposition of that Council, <hi>Sess.</hi> 15. may
it not be very pertinently asserted, that the said Council condemns
only the killing of a Tyrant, and not of an Heretick; and the killing
of a Tyrant, who is not condemned and deposed, not of one who is
excommunicated for Heresie; for that last Clause, without expecting
the Sentence and Command of a Judge, supposes that it may be a very
lawful and meritorious Act to kill such Princes as are deposed by Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Judges, that is, by the Pope or Council; which is the only Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that ever pretended to judge or depose Sovereign Princes; and
therefore when <hi>Suarez</hi> was urged with this Decree, he answered,
<hi>Defens. Fidei, lib. 6. cap. 4. Where do you find in the Acts of that Council,
that this extends to Princes excommunicated or deposed by the Pope?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. If we may take and leave of the Roman Councils what we
please, and be good Catholicks still; wherefore may we not reject
the Decrees of their Councils about Transubstantiation, Purgatory,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61787:22"/>
Indulgences, the Invocation of Saints, and Worship of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and continue as good Catholicks as they are, who renounce the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their Councils as to the deposing Power?</p>
               <p>14. Since P. <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>5th. (Anno 1606.)</hi> by a Breve written to the
<hi>English</hi> Catholicks, declared and taught them, as Pastor of their Souls,
that the Oath of Allegiance, established by <hi>Parliament, (3 Iac. 1.)</hi>
cannot be taken without violating the Christian Faith, and injuring
the Salvation of their Souls, as containing many things which are
manifestly contrary to Faith and Salvation: Now, (as the Author of
the First Treatise against the Oath of Allegiance, called, The Jesuits
Loyalty, well observes) there are not in it <hi>(multa)</hi> many things to which
this Censure is possibly applicable, unless this be one, that the Pope
hath no Power to despose the King, or absolve his Subjects from the Oath
of Allegiance; now when in Obedience to the Pope, the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
have to this day obstinately refused this Oath (some very few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
who were Anathematized at <hi>Rome</hi> for doing so) is there not
reason to suspect, that they are not clear in this Point? and that they
who will not abjure so pernicious a Doctrine, may be perswaded to
practise it when time serves, and then let any man judge what security
there is of their Loyalty?</p>
               <p>15. As for those Loyal English Romanists, who will not allow the
Deposing Doctrine to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though
they acknowledge it to have been Decreed by Popes and Councils,
because all the Ages before <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, were positively against
the Deposing Doctrine, that this was a Doctrine brought in in the <hi>11th</hi>
Century, against the Judgment and Practice of Ten before, and that
all the Fathers were against it; must they not needs go upon these
Principles, 1. That Popes and Councils may, and have decreed such
Doctrines as are contrary to Scripture and Catholick Tradition?
2. That no good Catholick is bound to own such Doctrines, though
decreed by Popes and Councils? 3. That this Doctrine (although so
decreed) is not the Doctrine of the Catholick Church? 4. That
men are good Catholicks, not by adhering to the Doctrine of Popes
and Councils, but to the Scriptures, expounded by Primitive and
Catholick Tradition? These are indeed the better Subjects, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to those Principles; for those are the very Principles on which
our Reformation is founded, and by which we justifie our selves against
the Innovations of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But though these Principles
will justifie the Reformation, yet they will not prove, that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Doctrine is not taught by the present Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. But to shut up all these Queries concerning that vile Deposing
Doctrine, I desire only to be informed, what Roman Catholick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61787:22"/>
who had all the Power in their hands, would have suffered a
Protestant Prince to Succeed quietly to his Throne? We know how
it fared with <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> (notwithstanding the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Paris,</hi> burnt <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Book) and what <hi>Henrician</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
in those days signified; but our Church teaches better; and
the True Sons of the Church practise better; and we hope they shall
never have reason to repent of what they have done.</p>

would free this miserable person from all danger of Death, or mutilation of

of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> about Reformation?</p>
               <p>2. Since <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth hath determined, that it is indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably
necessary for all men, to believe the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the
Oecumenical Patriarch, the Universal Bishop, the Visible Head and
Monarch of the Catholick Church, the Infallible Doctor of its Faith
and Manners, S. <hi>Peters</hi> Successor, and Christs Sole Vicar upon Earth,
(which Arrogant Titles are now become a part of their Canon Law,
and occur frequently in the sixth Book of the <hi>Decretalia</hi>) may it
not be pertinently demanded, Where was their Charity to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
before the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, (who dyed in the <hi>7th</hi>
Century) seeing there is no Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> found, who did assume,
or claim those insolent Epithets before that time?</p>
               <p>3. What difference can be assigned betwixt the old Donatists and
the present Romanists? since the former confined the True Church
of Christ to <hi>Africa,</hi> (yea, to that Corner of it, which was <hi>ex parte
Donati.</hi>) and the later to <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Let us suppose a man to walk as Conformably to the Precepts
of the Gospel, as ever any of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> (Christ only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
would it not argue the height of uncharitableness, to Damn
that man in our Imaginations, because he cannot believe the Popes
Supremacy to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> for want of Divine Revelation; since
the best Logician in the World cannot deduce it from any place of
Scripture, <hi>per decimam sextam Consequentiam?</hi>

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61787:23"/>
5. Because some moderate Protestants grant, that he who is under
Invincible Ignorance of the Corruptions of the Roman Church, and
makes Conscience to live up to his Light, may through the infinite
Mercy of God be saved, (though he live and die in that Society;)
hence to argue, that its best to joyn in Communion with the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein (by consent of both parties) Salvation may be had;
doth the force of that Argument, in the eyes of sober persons,
amount to any more than this, Come over to us, for we have less
Charity than ye? whereas a good Christian (who understands the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Holy Religion) will be ready to answer, I will rather
stay in that Church which enjoys most of that supernatural Quality,
which is Essential to Christianity.</p>
               <p>6. Because a man thinks that his Neighbour (who is of a strong
natural Constitution, highly couragious, and very temperate) may
be preserved from Death in a Pesthouse; doth it hence follow, that
he believes his Neighbour is in as safe a condition, as he who lives
at a great distance from any danger of Contagion?</p>
               <p>7. If it be a solid Argument to comply with that Tenet, wherein
both parties are agreed, wherefore doth not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> embrace
the Protestant Doctrine of Christs Presence in the Eucharist? for all sober
Christians in the World acknowledge that he is really present, tho in a
Spiritual and Mystical manner: To this the Romanists have superadded
their mode of Transubstantiation, and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> their Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation;
therefore its safest to Acquiesce in that wherein all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
parties are agreed: the same may be urged as to many other
particulars, even all their Superadditions to the ancient Creeds.</p>
               <p>8. It may be further demanded, if there be any Solidity in this
Topick, have not the <hi>Cerinthians,</hi> the <hi>Samosatenians,</hi> the <hi>Arians, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians,
Photinians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> the better of the Orthodox by that
way of arguing, since its acknowledged <hi>hinc inde,</hi> by all, that Christ
was truly a man, made like to us in all things, <hi>Sin only excepted?</hi> but
the fallacy of this Topick is so evident, that it is lost labour to insist
any more upon it.</p>
               <p>9. Can it consist with Charity, to call those Schismaticks, who are
not <hi>fugitivi sed fugati;</hi> and to Anathematize them every year (on
<hi>Manday Thursday</hi>) as Hereticks, who believe the whole Scriptures of
God in the sense of the Primitive Church; and who embrace all the
Creeds of the four general Councils that were first in order?</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Did not the leading party in the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>discover
themselves to be Physicians of no value, and Men of no Charity, by
using their utmost endeavours to perpetuate that deplorable Breach
in the Visible Church? which I account better express'd in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61787:23"/>
words of the History thereof, which are as followeth.</hi> This Council,
desired and procured by Godly Men to re-unite the Church, which began to
be divided, hath so established the Schism, and made the Parties so Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that the Discords are irreconcilable: and being managed by Princes
for Reformation of Ecclesiastical Discipline, hath caused the greatest defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
that ever was since Christianity did begin; and hoped for by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
themselves, to regain the Episcopal Authority, (for the most part
usurped by the Pope) hath made them lose it altogether, bringing them into
much greater Servitude: on the contrary, feared and avoided by the See
of <hi>Rome</hi> (as a potent means to moderate the Exorbitant Power thereof)
mounted from small beginnings, by divers degrees, to an unlimited Excess,
it hath so established and confirmed the same over that part which remained
subject to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. Since its evident from unquestionable Records, that the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> (I mean all of that persuasion) amounts not to the third
part of Christendom (if all the Protestants, of whatsoever denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
the Greek Church properly so called, with all those Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> which are neither of the Roman nor Greek
Communion, be reckoned upon) it may be demanded, with what
Charity the Romanists monopolize to themselves the Title of the
Catholick Church?</p>
