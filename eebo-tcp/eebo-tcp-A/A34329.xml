            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>WAS a false and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Character which was
given by the great <hi>Scaliger,</hi>
of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, That
<hi>they were a People Cruel and
Inhospitable, perfect Self-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers,
and Contemners of
all the World besides.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Temper and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> For if we consider ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Nature of our <hi>Laws,</hi> or the Genius
of our <hi>Religion,</hi> which are founded both of
them upon the Rules of <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi>
we must needs conclude the <hi>Temper</hi> of
the <hi>English</hi> to be a perfect Contradiction to
both these, if it is not <hi>treatable</hi> and <hi>human.</hi>
They may indeed sometimes be <hi>fierce,</hi> but
then 'tis in their own <hi>Defence:</hi> And if they
are <hi>inhospitable,</hi> 'tis only to such as would
make a Prey of their <hi>Civility.</hi> For how many
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53447:3"/>
               <hi>Strangers</hi> quit their Native <hi>Soil,</hi> to enjoy the
Pleasure of a more Indulgent <hi>English Clime?</hi>
And <hi>Foreign Merchants</hi> crowd our <hi>Streets</hi> in
such Numbers, as if <hi>London</hi> were the <hi>Mistress</hi>
and universal <hi>Patroness</hi> of <hi>Traff<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck</hi> through the
World. But if men approach them in an
<hi>hostile</hi> way, there is no reason they should
meet with <hi>Hospitality,</hi> or be treated otherwise
than with a <hi>Martial English Bravery,</hi> which is
highly necessary for their own <hi>Defence</hi> and
<hi>Preservation:</hi> For their main <hi>Bulwark</hi> is their
Native <hi>Valour;</hi> and their <hi>Men of War,</hi> their
only <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Pyrenean Hills.</hi> And to say
that <hi>they are Self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Admirers,</hi> is very weak, since
if they should not love themselves, they ought
to be <hi>hated</hi> of all the World besides. I only
wish their <hi>Conjugal Love</hi> were as sincere and
genuine, as is their <hi>Friendliness</hi> to <hi>Strangers,</hi>
and as little liable to Exceptions as their <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</hi>
Then many silent <hi>Complaints</hi> against
<hi>Matrimonial Infidelity</hi> would cease; then would
not those Solemn, Sacred <hi>Ties</hi> be so wilfully
<hi>violated</hi> and <hi>prophan'd,</hi> so frequently made an
occasion to <hi>Lewdness,</hi> and sacrific'd so impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to all <hi>Immodesty</hi> and <hi>Lust.</hi> For how
often is <hi>Marriage</hi> made only a Cloak to <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53447:3"/>
And that dazzling <hi>Beauty</hi> which before
commanded <hi>Respect</hi> and <hi>Admiration</hi> by its <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,</hi>
is under that <hi>Religious Cover</hi> expos'd
a <hi>Prostitute</hi> to every wanton <hi>Eye.</hi> Would but
the <hi>Modesty</hi> of our <hi>Women</hi> keep pace with the
<hi>Fortitude</hi> of our <hi>Men;</hi> and the <hi>Bashfulness</hi> and
<hi>Purity</hi> of Those, equalize the <hi>Courage</hi> and
<hi>Hardiness</hi> of These, how valuable should we
be at <hi>Home,</hi> as well as formidable <hi>Abroad!</hi>
Then would it be difficult to determine which
of these two Qualities would most recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
us to the <hi>Esteem</hi> of the World; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we should more be fam'd for a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Lucretia's,</hi> or for a standing Race of
<hi>Heroes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Women will be apt to say,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> That
were there no <hi>Attacks,</hi> there would then be no
<hi>Victory:</hi> Did not the <hi>Importunities</hi> of the <hi>Men</hi>
provoke the <hi>Modesty</hi> of the <hi>Women,</hi> there would
be no <hi>Surrender</hi> of their <hi>Chastity:</hi> And how is
it possible for such a weak <hi>Defence</hi> as Women
are qualified to make, to be able to withstand
their repeated <hi>Onsets?</hi> But yet as weak as it is,
without <hi>Consent</hi> the general <hi>Attempts</hi> would be
very fruitless and unsuccessful, and no more
than the storming a Wall of <hi>Brass</hi> with <hi>Tennis-Balls.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53447:4"/>
It is an Observation upon this <hi>Island,</hi>
That no <hi>Continent</hi> has been oftner, perhaps,
<hi>conquer'd,</hi> than it has been: And yet the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>
takes notice, That it had always a <hi>Hand</hi>
in its own <hi>Conquests;</hi> and by the means of
some corrupt <hi>Party</hi> within, was basely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
to its own <hi>Overthrow.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> And let the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
but guard their <hi>Honour</hi> with inward <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,</hi>
and not harbour in their Minds a
<hi>Treacherous Passion</hi> to yield to Amorous <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and <hi>Insinuations,</hi> and they may still brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintain their <hi>Ground,</hi> and fairly defy all
<hi>Onsets</hi> and <hi>Surprizals.</hi> But since the Weak
Sex have render'd themselves much weaker,
by the frequent Conquests that are made over
them; and the Malignity of their Effeminacy
ripens daily towards an Universal Contagion,
it will be very necessary to represent the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Mischiefs of this spreading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Evil: That
the Piety and Wisdom of the Nation may
prescribe such proper Remedies as may retard
at least, if not totally prevent all the Danger
of it; and that as well in the Men, who are
equally guilty, as in the Female Sex.</p>
            <p>In <hi>India</hi> formerly an <hi>Elephant</hi> was esteem'd
and allow'd as a valuable <hi>Gift</hi> to a Married
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53447:4"/>
Woman, to debase her self, and corrupt her
<hi>Chastity.</hi> And <hi>Solon</hi> is recorded to have been
the first in <hi>Greece,</hi> who by his Laws permitted
Women to <hi>prostitute</hi> themselves for <hi>Necessities</hi>
of Life. 'Twere well that our Women were
to be bounded only by these <hi>Laws:</hi> We might
then expect some Abatement of their Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
either by the <hi>Rarity</hi> of that <hi>Animal,</hi> or by
<hi>confining</hi> that Sin to such only as are in <hi>Want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may not by our <hi>Silence</hi> be any
longer accessary, as it were, to this odious
<hi>Vice,</hi> which is now grown so universal, let us
consider a-while those various fatal <hi>Mischiefs</hi>
which attend it. And those are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lust diseases the Body.</note> Such as are the <hi>Natural</hi> Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Effects of it; some of which have so
near an Affinity to <hi>Corruption,</hi> that they forestall
a <hi>Natural Dissolution,</hi> and prevent the <hi>Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of the <hi>Grave:</hi> And render the Person that
is distemper'd so very <hi>loathsome</hi> and <hi>offensive,</hi>
that as they were formerly too <hi>familiar</hi> with
<hi>others,</hi> so they are scarce able now to <hi>converse</hi>
with <hi>themselves:</hi> They look as if they were
spawn'd from the <hi>Dead-Sea,</hi> or were a Limb
of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> So long has <hi>Reason</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53447:5"/>
lain asleep, and <hi>Conscience</hi> been check'd and
aw'd to <hi>Silence,</hi> that the very <hi>Body</hi> now is
forc'd to serve as a <hi>Monitor</hi> to the <hi>Soul,</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
its place, and take its turn to conduct the
Mind to <hi>Reformation,</hi> and to endure several
<hi>Corporeal Pangs</hi> and <hi>Throws,</hi> for Neglect of
<hi>Anguish</hi> and <hi>Remorse</hi> of <hi>Spirit.</hi> But this nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous
<hi>Evil</hi> does not always rest here, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
descends to a loathsome <hi>Offspring,</hi> and
corrupts the very <hi>Innocence</hi> of <hi>Childhood:</hi> It
intails such <hi>Sickness</hi> and <hi>Diseases</hi> upon <hi>Posterity,</hi>
as make them wish themselves unborn, or
that they had been stifled at the <hi>Birth.</hi> So de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
a <hi>Blessing</hi> is this which the vicious <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
propagates to the <hi>Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly if this Lustful <hi>Fire</hi> be not
<hi>quench'd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wantonness emasculates the Age.</note> or else be timely not <hi>restrain'd,</hi> 't will
soon <hi>emasculate</hi> the <hi>Age,</hi> consume the <hi>Strength,</hi>
and melt down the <hi>Courage</hi> of the Nation.
'T will serve instead of a Thousand <hi>Enemies</hi>
to foil and overthrow the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> when it
has brought our Men to be as Lascivious as
<hi>Satyrs,</hi> and as Impotent as <hi>Pygmies.</hi> A <hi>French</hi>
Army will not be half so <hi>Formidable</hi> as some
Hundreds of <hi>English Messalina's,</hi> who will top
upon the greatest <hi>Gallantry,</hi> and sink the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53447:5"/>
               <hi>Braveness</hi> of our Spirits more than all their
<hi>Legions</hi> and <hi>Battalions.</hi> If we design to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
our Martial <hi>Valour,</hi> for which we are now
renown'd through the World, we must keep
at a Distance from <hi>Venus</hi> Tents. An Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<hi>Hero</hi> resembles a Ball of Wildfire, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
in the Air without any Resistance or
Execution: He is truly qualified for Gallant
<hi>Atchievements;</hi> but those tender <hi>Indearments</hi> he
meets with in the <hi>Fair Sex</hi> exhaust all his
<hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and render him very insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
and useless.</p>
            <p>'Twas a most excellent Observation of

            <p>When the vanquish'd <hi>World</hi> had nothing left

themselves to put their <hi>Money</hi> in a Bag

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53447:8"/>
late memorable Instance among our <hi>Nobility</hi>
here at Home, besides many more less-Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Examples which might be produc'd:
For <hi>within Three Years which happen'd between the
late Duke's</hi> (Norfolk's) <hi>Death, and the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the new Duke and Dutchess, she run him out
by Extravagant Expences 30000 l. above his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
to pay which, oblig'd him to sell his Life,
2400 l.</hi> per Ann. <hi>out of his Estate in</hi> Suslex
<hi>and</hi> Yorkshire. <hi>[See the Duke of</hi> Norfolk's
<hi>Case.]</hi> This is one main <hi>Reason</hi> among the
rest, that men in this discreet Age, as they
call it, keep at so great a <hi>Distance</hi> from the
Ties of <hi>Wedlock,</hi> that with the <hi>Essenians</hi> they
will rather chuse to extinguish the Succession
of Men, than beget them in a <hi>Married State;</hi>
or if they do, 'tis rather for the Love of
<hi>Wealth</hi> than of the <hi>Woman,</hi> and so make a
<hi>Marriage</hi> of <hi>Bodies</hi> without <hi>Souls.</hi> And when
they are tied together thus very <hi>loosely,</hi> and
the Married Pair, as to any Cordial <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Affection,</hi> continue still in a <hi>Single State,</hi> what
tolerable degrees of <hi>Indearments</hi> and <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
can possibly be expected from them;
since they vow'd that with their <hi>Mouth</hi> which
their <hi>Mind</hi> disown'd, and tied that with the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53447:8"/>
               <hi>Tongue,</hi> which they never consented to with

<hi>Discords,</hi> of such <hi>Broils</hi> and <hi>Dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in several <hi>Families,</hi> which are perfect <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomies</hi>
of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> and nothing but <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series</hi>
of <hi>Feuds</hi> and <hi>Discontent;</hi> which render a

<hi>Matrimonial Engagements,</hi> and the wretched

should be the general <hi>Motto</hi> of this loose Age,
<hi>Gall. Ele.</hi> 1.
<q>
                  <l>Et mihi dulce magis resoluto vivere collo.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>Nothing agrees more with my Mind,</l>
                  <l>Than Liberty that's unconfin'd.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But that which highly aggravates this
<hi>Crime,</hi> and renders it far more unpardonable
in the <hi>Married</hi> Persons, is, that they are under
a most solemn <hi>Contract,</hi> and indissoluble <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
to the contrary; and yet they venture
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53447:9"/>
without <hi>Restraint,</hi> and resolutely <hi>break</hi> all
those holy <hi>Bonds</hi> asunder. So that what is
remark'd of the happy <hi>Situation</hi> of our <hi>Island,</hi>
That in respect of <hi>Commerce</hi> it enjoys this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Advantage of lying <hi>open</hi> to all the
Parts of the <hi>World,</hi> may with <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion</hi>
be pronounc'd of the unhappy <hi>Temper</hi>
of our loose <hi>Gallants,</hi> who expose themselves
so commonly to all Strangers, and drive so
general a Traffick with all kind of People:
For Confirmation of which, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justly pronounce it to be true in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
we need but observe the strange Diversity
of <hi>Children</hi> that are often seen in one and the
same <hi>House,</hi> and are thought all to belong to
the same <hi>Parents.</hi> This <hi>Child</hi> is naturally as
<hi>Fair</hi> as that Lady whom <hi>Horace</hi> describes to
be endow'd with a <hi>vultus nimium lubricus aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci:</hi>
That other is a perfect <hi>Dowdy,</hi> and as
Black as any <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Here you may see
one <hi>Plump,</hi> and shap'd like a <hi>Dutch Skipper:</hi>
There another <hi>Tall,</hi> and <hi>Slender-wasted,</hi> like
the <hi>Monument.</hi> One is <hi>Sanguine,</hi> another is
<hi>Pale:</hi> Here's a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> and there's a <hi>Giant:</hi>
This is <hi>Surly,</hi> and that is nothing but <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance.</hi>
They are all as <hi>like</hi> one another,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53447:9"/>
as a <hi>Peasant</hi> is a <hi>Lord;</hi> and as <hi>like</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi>
as a rough <hi>Tartar</hi> is a smooth <hi>Italian:</hi> So that
if you consider the <hi>Children</hi> all distinctly, you
would really fancy that half <hi>Europe</hi> had clubb'd
to make up one <hi>Family.</hi> But herein Charity
advises us not to pass our Judgments rashly;
because such Diversities may sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from Legitimate Congress. And this
unlawful <hi>Freedom</hi> not only <hi>corrupts</hi> the <hi>Strain,</hi>
and allays the <hi>Lineal</hi> current <hi>Descent</hi> with spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

               <note place="margin">Conjugal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious to the Family.</note> but derives
likewise a lasting Mark of <hi>Infamy</hi> upon the

their <hi>Repute</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> in the World. Now
if Men are so careful of preserving the <hi>Breed</hi>
of their <hi>Beasts</hi> pure, especially such as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for any <hi>Excellence,</hi> that they will not
endure a <hi>Mixture</hi> from any of a <hi>different kind,</hi>
for fear of altering of the <hi>Strength</hi> or <hi>Shape;</hi>
or abating of some good and eminent <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
should not then as tender a <hi>Regard</hi> be had
for <hi>Families,</hi> for securing them from being
<hi>adulterated</hi> and <hi>stain'd</hi> with <hi>False Amours,</hi> and
<hi>Illegitimate Conceptions,</hi> and being made a
<hi>Medley</hi> of contrary Humours, and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Genius's</hi> and <hi>Dispositions?</hi> And no <hi>Parent</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53447:10"/>
that had the least <hi>Respect</hi> either for he <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
of the <hi>Family,</hi> or the <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
of the <hi>Children,</hi> but would chase rather
a thousand times to dye <hi>Childless,</hi> than have
th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m brought into the World with such a
Train of <hi>Miseries</hi> attending them.</p>
            <p>We may add to this the hainous <hi>Injustice</hi>
which is done to the next <hi>Heir,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It deprives the next Heir of his Right.</note> of cutting
him out of all his <hi>Pretensions,</hi> and <hi>robbing</hi> him
of all those <hi>Privileges</hi> and <hi>Profits,</hi> to which he
had an undeniable <hi>Claim:</hi> Whereby a <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
of the best Family may be supplanted by
an obscure Person of the <hi>meanest,</hi> if the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
prove unchaste and false, for want of
<hi>Issue</hi> from the <hi>Marriage-Bed.</hi> And this I am
afraid is none of the least Reasons of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<hi>Degeneracy</hi> of some <hi>Ancient Families</hi> in
the Nation. 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Men</hi> in
these Cases are no more excusable than the
<hi>Women,</hi> they are equally as guilty of <hi>Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Inconstancy</hi> as their <hi>Wives;</hi> but then the
<hi>Husband</hi> cannot bring in an <hi>Illegitimate Child</hi>
into the Family; he cannot by that means
strike out the next <hi>Lawful Heir,</hi> and basely
<hi>deprive</hi> him of his <hi>Birthright.</hi> This is wholly
owing to the unlawful Familiarity of <hi>Wives,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53447:10"/>
and is an <hi>Evil</hi> in them of the first <hi>Magnitude,</hi>
being compounded both of abominable <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery</hi>
and <hi>Injustice.</hi> And therefore to preserve
the <hi>Succession</hi> in a right Line, that no base
<hi>Child</hi> may deprive the Lawful <hi>Heir</hi> of his
just <hi>Privileges,</hi> 'tis an Ancient Custom in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Places of the <hi>East,</hi> as well as in <hi>Africk,</hi>
That the <hi>Heirship</hi> of Families runs all along
on the <hi>Mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s</hi> side, as being least liable to
<hi>Sophistry</hi> and <hi>Imposition.</hi> So that if once the
<hi>Nativity</hi> be allow'd, the proper <hi>Father</hi> is never
question'd. In <hi>Rome,</hi> formerly, Three of
<hi>Lepidus's Relations</hi> were born with a <hi>Cartilage</hi>
upon the Right Eye, as a distinctive <hi>Mark</hi> of
that <hi>Family</hi> to which they belong'd. And
were all the <hi>Families</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to be trac'd at
the same rate, and every <hi>Child</hi> in the Nation
affix'd to its Genuine <hi>Father,</hi> what a Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Brood</hi> would be found in some <hi>Houses,</hi>
that are now <hi>destitute</hi> of <hi>Children?</hi> And how
many Persons that <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>educate</hi> Variety of
<hi>Children,</hi> as their own, would then be really
left almost <hi>Childless?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides these odious <hi>Civil</hi> Consequences,<note place="margin">Religious Mischiefs.</note>
there are Abundance of <hi>Religious</hi> Evils which
this Conjugal <hi>Libertinism</hi> produces, which was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53447:11"/>
a Vice so detestable among the <hi>Iews,</hi> that

And were this <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>England</hi> as frequently

and mightily increase the Accounts of <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>

have been possess'd with so irreconcilable an
<hi>Odium</hi> and utter <hi>Detestation</hi> against all <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

            <p>At <hi>Pulo, Condore,</hi> and <hi>Pegu;</hi> at <hi>Siam, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinchina,
Cambodia,</hi> and <hi>Guinea,</hi> the Natives
are so obliging to <hi>Strangers,</hi> as to offer them
the Use of <hi>Women,</hi> though not of their <hi>Wives.</hi>
And yet what <hi>Heathens</hi> disavow'd, is very
shamefully practis'd by <hi>Christians;</hi> and what
the <hi>Husband</hi> is utterly averse to, That the
<hi>Wife</hi> chuses, against all the <hi>Laws</hi> of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53447:13"/>
Endearments, the natural <hi>Violence</hi> of
whose <hi>Lust</hi> breaks too often through all the
various and strong <hi>Restraints</hi> of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
which by a Wise <hi>Providence</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
as <hi>Bars</hi> to their <hi>Chastity,</hi> and plac'd as
<hi>Guardians</hi> to their <hi>Modesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Five hundred and twenty Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Rome</hi> was built, before ever that renown'd
and flourishing <hi>City</hi> heard of a <hi>Divorce</hi> among
her People. And when <hi>Spurius Carbilius</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd
his Wife upon the account of her <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,</hi>
for he had no Argument against her of
<hi>Matrimonial Impurity,</hi> yet he receiv'd a sound
<hi>Reproof</hi> for that Action; and was told, That
the <hi>Desire of Children</hi> ought to give place to
<hi>Conjugal Obligations: Val. Max. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 1.
'Tis not either for the <hi>Barrenness</hi> of the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
or the Natural <hi>Coldness</hi> of the <hi>Men,</hi> that
<hi>Divorces</hi> are so much requested among us, as
for their loose unlawful <hi>Behaviour</hi> to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Those Natural unavoidable <hi>Infirmities</hi>
do plead for <hi>Excuse,</hi> and are sometimes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
where the <hi>Affections</hi> are entire and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
But this <hi>Matrimonial Inconstancy</hi> is a
Vice of that <hi>Malignity,</hi> that it <hi>poysons</hi> the <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of the most <hi>Cordial,</hi> and <hi>cools</hi> the most
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53447:13"/>
               <hi>Sanguine Husband</hi> or Wife into <hi>Indifference,</hi> and
oftentimes <hi>Aversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Almighty <hi>was so averse to unlawful</hi>
Issues <hi>under the</hi> Mosaical <hi>Dispensation, that
he declares,</hi> Deut. <hi>xxiii.</hi> 2. A bastard shall not
enter into the congregation of the Lord; even to
his tenth generation shall he not enter into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the Lord: <hi>That is, as the</hi> Hebrew
<hi>Doctors expound it,</hi> Never. <hi>And the</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>which they give for it, is this, That Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
might be deterr'd from such</hi> Marriages <hi>as
would leave an indelible Mark of</hi> Infamy <hi>upon
Posterity. And the Wise Son of</hi> Syrac <hi>has in
few words express'd the several great</hi> Evils <hi>that
attend the</hi> Violation <hi>of</hi> Matrimonial Fidelity, <hi>in
the Woman particularly,</hi> Ecclus. <hi>xxiii.</hi> 22, &amp;c.
Thus shall it go also with the wife that leaves her
husband, and brings in an heir by another. For
First, She has disobey'd the law of the most
High. And Secondly, She has trespass'd against
her own husband. And Thirdly, She has play'd
the whore in adultery, and brought children by
another man. She shall be brought out into the
congregation, and inquisition shall be made of her
children. Her children shall not take root, and her
branches shall bring forth no fruit. She shall leave
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53447:14"/>
her memory to be curs'd, and her reproach shall
not be blotted out. And they that remain shall
know, that there is nothing better than the fear of
the Lord, and that there is nothing sweeter than
to take heed to the commandments of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now since the <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of the
<hi>High Court of Parliament</hi> have done such <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
for the <hi>Safety</hi> of the Nation, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
<hi>Difficulties</hi> that seem'd <hi>insuperable</hi> in
Time of <hi>War,</hi> and have since appeas'd all
the <hi>Publick Clamours</hi> of <hi>Discontent</hi> in time of
<hi>Peace;</hi> surely it would not be a <hi>Matter</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
their <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Consideration,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the Numerous <hi>Mischiefs</hi> which this
too common <hi>Conjugal Inconstancy</hi> produces;
and prescribe such <hi>Antidotes</hi> as might timely
put a stop to it. What a <hi>Glory</hi> will this add
to all those Mighty Things which they have
already done? And how many Thousand
<hi>Families</hi> in <hi>England</hi> will think themselves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to call them for ever <hi>blessed</hi> for it? And
<hi>blessed</hi> they must needs be, who make their
<hi>Authority</hi> a <hi>Terror</hi> to all <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and take care
that <hi>Vice</hi> should never trample upon their
<hi>Power,</hi> nor a <hi>Wickedness</hi> so <hi>daring,</hi> so <hi>mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53447:14"/>
and <hi>odious</hi> as this, should ever pass any
longer without a due <hi>Censure,</hi> and just <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Were this <hi>Effeminate Liberty</hi> but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
<hi>suppress'd</hi> by their Wise <hi>Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
what a lovely <hi>Alteration</hi> would it produce
throughout the whole <hi>Kingdom!</hi> And how
many <hi>Injur'd</hi> Persons, whose <hi>Tempers</hi> are now
dejected with private <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Discontent,</hi>
would then have them turn'd immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a pleasant <hi>Chearfulness</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction?</hi> Our
<hi>Men</hi> would then be more <hi>Hale</hi> and <hi>Vigorous,</hi>
more <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Hardy</hi> than now they are, and
not be <hi>enervated</hi> with <hi>Effeminacy,</hi> and <hi>subdued</hi>
with sharp Pains and Diseases of <hi>Lust;</hi> nor
yet be <hi>rack'd</hi> with violent and impetuous <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
deriv'd from the deprav'd <hi>Appetite</hi> of the
<hi>Parent.</hi> How many <hi>Estates</hi> might then be
<hi>sav'd,</hi> that now are <hi>wasted</hi> and <hi>consum'd</hi> by
Prodigal Expensive <hi>Lewdness?</hi> And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Families</hi> live like <hi>Brethren</hi> in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
that are now only the <hi>Nurseries</hi> of <hi>Iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy</hi>
and <hi>Discontent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And were these formidable <hi>Difficulties</hi> of
<hi>Marriage</hi> but remov'd, and the <hi>Wife</hi> safe in
the <hi>Love</hi> of her <hi>Husband,</hi> and <hi>He</hi> in the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
of his <hi>Wife,</hi> and the <hi>Legitimacy</hi> of her
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53447:15"/>
Offspring, and not expos'd so desperately to
the <hi>Falsity</hi> of her Love, and the <hi>Unlawfulness</hi>
of her Progeny, the <hi>Taxes</hi> then that are laid
upon <hi>Batchelors</hi> would sensible <hi>decay</hi> and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,</hi>
and those upon <hi>Marriage</hi> as apparently
<hi>increase</hi> and <hi>multiply.</hi> Men then would enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Thoughts of <hi>Wedlock</hi> with the same
Honourable <hi>Esteem</hi> as that Solemnity gain'd
at its <hi>first Institution;</hi> which would no more
be look'd upon as a State of <hi>Slavery,</hi> but
<hi>Freedom;</hi> as fit for Man even in his State of
<hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Perfection;</hi> and a <hi>Blessing</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to <hi>inhance</hi> the <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>multiply</hi> all
the <hi>Comforts</hi> and <hi>Delights</hi> of Life. But such
a happy <hi>Change</hi> as this can never in <hi>England</hi> be
expected, till those Wise Resolutions which
inspir'd the <hi>August Assembly of the Nation</hi> to
surmount such <hi>Hardships</hi> as seem'd <hi>unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
animate them again to establish such an
<hi>Act</hi> against this dissolute Matrimonial <hi>Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
as may <hi>restrain</hi> the Married Persons
within Bounds of <hi>Modesty;</hi> which is the only
means of promoting that Honourable <hi>Estate,</hi>
which is now so wretchedly <hi>neglected;</hi> and of
<hi>reviving</hi> its decay'd <hi>Felicities</hi> and <hi>Comforts.</hi> For
now the <hi>Impunity</hi> of it has encourag'd its <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53447:15"/>
to that degree of <hi>Assurance</hi> and <hi>Boldness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</note>
as if the <hi>Offenders</hi> were really <hi>Lawless,</hi> and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brav'd</hi>
the <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>Civil Constitutions,</hi> and the
<hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Legislature</hi> to restrain them. For
effecting which, it might not be amiss to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
such a <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> as might render
<hi>Divorces</hi> less <hi>chargeable</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> than now
they are. For since all <hi>Divorces,</hi> with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of <hi>Marrying</hi> again, proceed from the
<hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> therefore if either
there chance to be no <hi>Sessions</hi> for some time;
or if there be, the <hi>Parliament</hi> has no <hi>Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
of dispatching such <hi>private Concerns;</hi> or if
the Person <hi>injur'd</hi> be a Man of no <hi>Application,</hi>
or be destitute either of <hi>Money</hi> or of <hi>Time</hi> to
go through with such a weighty <hi>Affair;</hi> in all
these Instances he must be forc'd to <hi>Silence,</hi>
and privately to struggle with his inward <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
and his <hi>Grief,</hi> because he is not qualified
for a <hi>Deliverance</hi> from the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of them.
And therefore since our <hi>Saviour</hi> assures us, and
the most Judicious <hi>Casuists</hi> attest,<note place="margin">Divorces lawful upon the account of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> That upon
the account of <hi>Fornication</hi> it is really lawful
both to <hi>divorce,</hi> and to <hi>marry again,</hi> Matth.
5. 32. why should not some more <hi>Easy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi>
be thought of, than now is <hi>practis'd,</hi> for

               <hi>relieving</hi> the Party <hi>injur'd</hi> and <hi>oppress'd?</hi> For
sometimes <hi>Divorces</hi> have taken up the space of
<hi>Four Years</hi> before they were accomplish'd; as
that of the Lord <hi>Ross,</hi> which continued from
66 to 70. and that of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk's</hi>
much longer. And certainly 'twere more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable,
that the speedy <hi>Dispatch</hi> of the <hi>Iewish</hi>

free for any body else;</hi> upon just <hi>Conviction,</hi>
were <hi>allow'd,</hi> than such as are so <hi>Tedious</hi> and

            <p>Since therefore the happy <hi>Constitution</hi> of our

it will not, I hope, hereafter suffer this which
