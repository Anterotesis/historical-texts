            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Chriſtian and courteous Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T cannot be unknown to any, except ſuch
as are ignorant of Satans devices, and
altogether ſtrangers to the Hiſtories
of former times, that when the Church
commeth out of Idolatry, and out of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſervitude and grievous preſſures of conſcience, all her
ſtorms are not over her head, but ſhe begins to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
and afflicted more then before with hereſies,
ſchiſmes, and home-bred diſturbances. Which through
the manifold wiſdome and over-ruling diſpenſation of
God, who worketh all things according to the counſel of
his will, is <hi>Englands</hi> lot this day, that this may be to
thoſe in whom the Lord hath no pleaſure, <hi>a ſtone of
ſtumbling, and a rock of offence, that they may
goe and fall back ward, and be broken; &amp; ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and taken:</hi> that others, <hi>who are approved,
may be made manifeſt;</hi> yea, that <hi>many may be
purified, and tried, and made white;</hi> and that in
the iſſue God may have the greater glory in making a
ſoveraign remedy out of poyſonfull Ingredients, and his
<pb facs="tcp:123900:3"/>
people may ſay, <hi>bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael
who only doth wondrous things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now will the Sectaries be contented (as Chriſts
witneſſes in former times were) to be examined and
judged according to the word of God, and if they be
found to be what they are accuſed to be, then to ſuffer
accordingly? Nay, if ſo, they fear they ſhall run too
great a hazard. Therefore they cry out for toleration
and liberty of conſcience, hereby going about not only
themſelves to fiſh in troubled waters, but to improve at
once the manifold advantages of ſympathiſing with the
principles of the moſt part of men amongſt us; for as it
is a common plea and bond of union among all hereticks
and ſectaries, how many ſoever their diviſions and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſions
be among themſelves;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> the Review of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> yea, they give (in this)
the right hand of fellowſhip to the Prelaticall and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
party, for they alſo put in for liberty of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
and as carnall and prophane men deſire nothing
more then that they may not be compelled to any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
duty, but permitted to doe what ſeem good in their
own eies. So liberty of conſcience is a ſweet and taking
word among the leſſe diſcerning ſort of godly people,
newly come out of the houſe of bondage, out of the popiſh
and Prelaticall tyranny; I ſay the leſſe diſcerning ſort,
becauſe thoſe of the godly who have their ſenſes exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to diſcern good and evill, know that liberty of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb facs="tcp:123900:3"/>
and ſchiſme is no part of the liberty of conſcience
which Chriſt hath purchaſed to us at ſo dear a rate.
But is there no golden book and taking bait for the
Magiſtrate? yes ſure; for his part he is told that he may
puniſh any breach of peace or civill juſtice, or a treſpaſſe
againſt the State and againſt civill authority, but
yet not put forth his power againſt any man for hereſie
or ſchiſme, being matters of religion and of conſcience.
As if both Polititians and Divines had been in a great
error when they ſaid that the end and uſe of Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is to make <hi>bonum hominem,</hi> as well as <hi>bonum
civem,</hi> a good man as well as a good commonwealths
man. Shall I adde further, that all who wiſh well to
the publike from principles either of religion or policy,
want not here their own tentations, perſwading to a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
of ſectaries, in regard of the neceſſity of an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
againſt the common adverſary, and the great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
if not certain ruine, of the cauſe, by our own rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
            <p>Vnder theſe fair colours and handſome pretexts doe
ſectaries infuſe their poyſon, I mean their pernicious,
God-provoking, Truth-defacing, Church ruinating, &amp;
State-ſhaking toleration. The plain engliſh of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is this: whether the Chriſtian Magiſtrate be kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of both Tables: whether he ought to ſuppreſſe his
own enemies, but not Gods enemies, and preſerve his
<pb facs="tcp:123900:4"/>
own ordinances, but not Chriſts Ordinances fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> violation.
Whether the troublers of Iſrael may be troubled. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the wilde boars and beaſts of the foreſt muſt have
leave to break down the hedges of the Lords vineyard;
and whether ravening wolves in ſheeps clothing muſt be
permitted to converſe freely in the flock of Chriſt.
Whether after the black Devil of Idolatry and tyranny
is trod under our feet, a white Devill of hereſie and
ſchiſme, under the name of tender conſciences, muſt be
admitted to walk up and down among us. Whether not
only pious and peaceable men, (whom I ſhall never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to perſecute) but thoſe alſo who are as a peſtilence or
a Gangrene in the body of Chriſt, men of corrupt minds
and turbulent ſpirits, who draw factions after them,
make a breach and rent in Iſrael, reſiſt the truth and
reformation of religion, ſpread abroad all the ways they
can their pernicious errors, and by no other means can
be reduced; whether thoſe alſo ought to be ſpared and
let alone. I have endeavoured in this following diſcourſe
to vindicate the lawfull, yea neceſſary uſe of the coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
power of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate in ſuppreſsing
and puniſhing hereticks and ſectaries, according as the
degree of their offence and of the Churches danger ſhal
require: Which when I had done, there came to my
hands a book called <hi>The ſtorming of Antichriſt.</hi>
Indeed, <hi>The recruting of Antichriſt,</hi> and <hi>the
<pb facs="tcp:123900:4"/>
ſtorming of Zion,</hi> (if ſo be that I may anabaptize
an Anabaptiſts book) Take one paſſage for inſtance,
pa. 25. <hi>And for Papiſts,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>though they are
leaſt to be borne of all others, becauſe of the
uncertainty of their keeping faith with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
as they call us, and becauſe they may be
abſolved of ſecurements that can ariſe from
the juſt ſolemn oaths, and becauſe of their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
againſt the Proteſtants in divers Countries
where they get the upper hand, and becauſe
they are profeſt Idolaters, yet may they be born
with (as I ſuppoſe with ſubmiſsion to better
judgments) in Proteſtant government, in point
of religion, becauſe we have no command to
root out any for conſcience, &amp;c.</hi> Why then? is
this to ſtorm Antichriſt? or is it not rather a ſtorming <hi>of
this party,</hi> in the prevailing whereof <hi>God will have
far more glory then in the prevailing of the
Popiſh and Prelaticall party,</hi> as himſelf ſpeaketh,
pa. 34. And if he will ſtorm, ſure ſome of his Ladders
are too ſhort. <hi>If any one rail againſt Chriſt</hi> (ſaith
he, p. 23.) <hi>or deny the Scriptures to be his word,
or affirm the Epiſtles to be only letters written
to particular Churches, and no rule for us, and
ſo unſettle our faith, this I take may be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Magiſtrate, becauſe all or moſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:123900:5"/>
in the world doe it.</hi> That all the Nations in
the world doe puniſh for theſe things, I am yet to learn:
and thoſe that doe, doe they not alſo puniſh men for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ways of unſetling the grounds of faith beſides theſe?
The declining of ſome of the Epiſtles as being letters
written upon particular occaſions, and no rule for us,
is an error which hath been pretended to be no leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
then thoſe errors which now he will have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged.
Laſtly, if he would needs ſtorm, why would
he not make ſome new breach? I find no materiall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
in him for liberty of conſcience, but what I
found before in <hi>the bloudy Tenent, the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
Samaritane,</hi> and <hi>M. S.</hi> to <hi>A. S.</hi> ſo that my
enſuing anſwers to them ſhall ſerve his turn. And
now Reader <hi>buy the truth, and ſell it not.</hi> Search
for knowledge <hi>as for hid treaſures.</hi> If thou readeſt
with a unprejudiced mind, I dare promiſe thee through
Gods bleſsing a ſatisfied mind.</p>

               <hi>Lutheran</hi> Writers, make a controverſie where they need
not, alledging that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> (ſo nicknamed) hold as
the Papiſts doe, that all Hereticks without diſtinction are
to be put to death: The truth is, they themſelves ſay as
much as either <hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Beza,</hi> or any other whom they
take for adverſaries in this Queſtion, that is, that Hereticks
are to be puniſhed by mulcts, impriſonments, baniſhments,
and if they be groſſe idolaters or blaſphemers, and ſeducers
of others, then to be put to death. What is it elſe that <hi>Calvin</hi>
teacheth, when he diſtinguiſheth three kindes of errors:
ſome to be tolerated with a ſpirit of meekneſſe, and ſuch as
ought not to ſeparate betwixt brethren: others not to be
tolerated, but to be ſuppreſſed with a certaine degree of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity:
a third ſort ſo abominable and peſtiferous, that they
are to be cut off by the higheſt puniſhments?</p>
            <p>And leſt it be thought that this is but the opinion of ſome
few, that the magiſtrate ought thus by a ſtrong hand, and
by civill puniſhments ſuppreſſe Hereticks and Sectaries: let
it be obſerved what is held forth and profeſſed concerning
this buſineſſe, by the Reformed Churches in their publicke
Confeſſions of Faith. In the latter Confeſſion of <hi>Helvetia,
cap.</hi> 30. it is ſaid that the magiſtrate ought to <hi>root out lies and
all ſuperſtition, with all impiety and idolatry.</hi> And after; <hi>Let him
ſuppreſſe ſtubborne Hereticks.</hi> In the <hi>French</hi> Confeſſion, <hi>art.</hi>
39. <hi>Therefore he hath alſo delivered the ſword into the hands of
the Magiſtrates, to wit, that offences may be repreſſed, not only
thoſe which are committed againſt the ſecond Table, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the first.</hi> In the <hi>Belgick</hi> Confeſſion, <hi>art. 36. Therefore
hath he armed the Magiſtrate with the ſword for puniſhing them
that doe evill, and for defending ſuch as doe well. Moreover it is
their duty not only to be carefull and watchfull for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the civill government, but alſo to defend the holy Miniſtery,
and to aboliſh and overthrow all Idolatry, and counterfeit worſhip of
God. Beza de haeret, à magiſtr. puniend.</hi> tells us in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that the Miniſters of <hi>Helvetia</hi> had declared themſelves
to be of the ſame judgement, in a booke publiſhed of that
Argument. And toward the end he citeth the <hi>Saxon</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123900:7"/>
               <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Brentius, Bucerus, Wolſangus

them of all their Eccleſiaſticall and Academicall functions,

            <p>It will be asked, But how doth it appear that theſe or any
other Judiciall Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> doe at all appertain to us,
as rules to guide us in like caſes? I ſhall wiſh him who
ſcrupleth this, to read <hi>Piſcator</hi> his <hi>Appendix</hi> to his Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
upon the 21, 22, 23. Chapters of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where he
excellently diſputeth this queſtion, Whether the Chriſtian
Magiſtrate be bound to obſerve the Judicial laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
as well as the Jewiſh Magiſtrate was. He anſwereth by the
common diſtinction, he is obliged to thoſe things in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
law which are unchangeable, &amp; common to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
but not to thoſe things which are mutable, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the Jewiſh Republike. But then he explaineth this
diſtinction, that by things mutable, and proper to the Jews,
he underſtandeth the emancipation of an Hebrew ſervant
or handmaid in the ſeventh year, a mans marying his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wife and raiſing up ſeed to his brother, the forgiving
of debts at the Jubilee, marying with one of the ſame
Tribe, and if there be any other like to theſe; alſo Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
treſpaſſes, as touching a dead body, &amp;c. But things
immutable, and common to all Nations are the laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Morall treſpaſſes, Sins againſt the Morall law, as
murther, adultery, theft, enticing away from God, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:123900:8"/>
ſtriking of Parents. Now that the Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
is bound to obſerve theſe Judiciall lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi>
which appoint the puniſhments of ſins againſt the Morall
law, he proveth by theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. If it were not ſo, then it is free and arbitrary to the
Magiſtrate to appoint what puniſhments himſelf pleaſeth.
But this is not arbitrary to him, for <hi>he is the Miniſter of
God, Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and <hi>the judgement is the Lords, Deut.</hi> 1. 7.
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6. And if the Magiſtrate be <hi>Keeper of both Tables,</hi>
he muſt keep them in ſuch manner as God hath delivered
them to him.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſts words, <hi>Mat. 5. 17. Think not that I am come
to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets, I am not come to deſtroy, but
to fulfill,</hi> are comprehenſive of the Judiciall law, it being a
part of the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> Now he could not fulfill the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
law, except either by his practice, or by teaching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſtill to obſerve it; not by his own practice, for he
would not condemn the Adultereſſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 11. nor divide
the Inheritance, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13, 14. Therefore it muſt be by
his doctrine for our obſerving it.</p>
            <p>3. If Chriſt in his Sermon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. would teach that the
Morall law belongeth to us Chriſtians, in ſo much as he
vindicateth it from the falſe gloſſes of the Scribes &amp; Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees;
then he meant to hold forth the Judiciall law concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Morall treſpaſſes as belonging to us alſo: for he vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth
and interpreteth the Judiciall law, as well as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<hi>Mat. 5. 38. An eye for an eye, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. If God would have the Morall law tranſmitted from
the Jewiſh people to the Chriſtian people; then he would
alſo have the Judiciall law tranſmitted from the Jewiſh
Magiſtrate to the Chriſtian Magiſtrate: There being the
ſame reaſon of immutability in the puniſhments, which is
in the offences; Idolatry and Adultery diſpleaſeth God
now as much as then; and Theft diſpleaſeth God now
no more then before.</p>

How ſhall Chriſtian Magiſtrates glorifie God more then

cannot make better?</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14. 23. Now when
the Chriſtian Magiſtrate puniſheth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> againſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
law, if he doe this in faith and in aſſurance of pleaſing
God, he muſt have his aſſurance from the Word of God, for
faith can build upon no other foundation: it is the Word
which muſt aſſure the Conſcience, God hath commanded
ſuch a thing, therefore it is my duty to doe it, God hath
not forbidden ſuch a thing, therefore I am free to doe it.
But the will of God concerning Civill juſtice and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is no where ſo fully and cleerly revealed as in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> This therefore muſt be the ſureſt prop
and ſtay to the conſcience of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Theſe are not my reaſons (if it be not a word or two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by way of explaining and ſtrengthning) but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>Piſcators</hi> reaſons: Unto which I adde, 1. Though
we have clear and full ſcriptures in the New Teſtament for
aboliſhing the Ceremoniall law yet we no where reade in
all the new Teſtament of the abol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhing of the Judicial law,
ſo far as it did concern the puniſhing of ſins againſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
law, of which Hereſy and ſeducing of ſouls is one, and a
great one. Once God did reveal his will for puniſhing thoſe
ſins by ſuch and ſuch puniſhments. He who will hold that
the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is not bound to inflict ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for ſuch ſins, is bound to prove that thoſe former
lawes of God are aboliſhed, and to ſhew ſome ſcripture
for it. 2. That Iudiciall law for having two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
in judgement, <hi>Deut. 19. 15. Heb.</hi> 10. 28. is transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
even with an obligation to us Chriſtians, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
all judgement, as well Eccleſiaſticall as Civill, <hi>Mat.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:123900:9"/>
18. 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. and ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> particulars might be
inſtanced in, which are preſſed and enforced from the Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
law, by ſome who yet mind not the obligation of it.
To conclude therefore this point, though other judiciall
or forenſecall laws concerning the puniſhments of ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Morall law, may, yea, muſt be allowed of in
Chriſtian Republikes and Kingdomes; Provided always,
they be not contrary or contradictory to Gods own Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
laws: yet I fear not to hold with <hi>Junius, de Politia
Moſis</hi> cap. 6, that he who was puniſhable by death under
that Iudiciall law, is puniſhable by death ſtill; and he who
was not puniſhed by death then, is not to be puniſhed by
death now; And ſo much for the firſt argument from the
Law of God.</p>
            <p>A ſecond argument we have from divers laudable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in the Old Teſtament; <hi>Moſes</hi> drew the ſword againſt
Idolaters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 27. the children of Iſrael reſolved to go
out to war againſt the <hi>Reubenites</hi> and <hi>Gadites,</hi> when they
underſtood that they were building another Altar. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 22.
12. <hi>Elijah</hi> commanded to ſlay the Prieſts of <hi>Baal, 1 Kings</hi>
18. 40. In <hi>Aſa</hi> his time there was a Covenant for putting
to death ſuch as would not ſeek the Lord God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
2 <hi>Chro. 15. 13. Iehu</hi> ſlew the Prieſts of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and
the worſhippers of <hi>Baal, 2 Kings</hi> 10. 11. 24. Firſt, ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and making ſure that there were none of the ſervants
of the Lord among them, <hi>ver. 23. Ioſiah</hi> ſacrificed the Prieſts
of <hi>Samaria</hi> upon their own altars, 2 <hi>Kings 23. 20. Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
though an Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being convinced that there was no
god like the God of Iſrael, made a Decree, that whoſoever
ſpeaketh blaſphemy, or uttereth any error againſt God,
<hi>ſhall be out in pieces, and their houſes made a dunghill, Dan.</hi> 3. 29.
As for thoſe whoſe errors and corruptions in religion were
not ſo great, there was ſome (though not the higheſt)
ſeverity uſed againſt them: <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo angry with
the people that were ſeduced into Idolatry, that he burnt
the Calf which they had worſhipped, and ground it to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and ſtrewed it upon the water, <hi>and made the Children of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:123900:10"/>
Iſrael to drinke of it, Exod.</hi> 32. 20. Thereby teaching them (as
<hi>Hierome</hi> and others give the reaſon) to abhorre that Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
while their Idoll did paſſe from them among their own
excrements. <hi>Aſa</hi> did remove his mother <hi>Maachah from
being Queen, becauſe of an Idoll which ſhe had made in a grove,</hi>
1 Kings 15. 13. <hi>Joſiah</hi> cauſed all that were preſent in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
and Benjamin to ſtand to the Covenant. 2 Chron.</hi> 34. 32.
which could not be without either threatning or inflicting
puniſhment upon the tranſgreſſors; there being many at
that time diſaffected to the Reformation.</p>
            <p>O but ſaith <hi>M. S.</hi> to <hi>A. S. pag.</hi> 51, 52. Idolatry and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
were the adaequate object of that coercive power in
matters of religion, whereof we reade in the Old Teſtament.
Nor doe we read that ever the lewiſh Kings or Magiſtrates
attempted any thing againſt Sectaries or Schiſmaticks. I
anſwer, 1. The object of that coercive power of <hi>Joſiah,</hi>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 32. was generally the matter of the Covenant,
that is, the taking away not only of Idolatry, but of <hi>all abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,</hi>
and <hi>a walking after the Lord, and keeping of his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies,
and Statutes, and Commandments,</hi> ver. 31. 33. <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
did drive away the ſon of <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> the high Prieſt, not
for Idolatry, but for marying the daughter of <hi>Sanballat,</hi> and
thereby defiling the Covenant of the Prieſthood, <hi>Nehem.</hi>
13. 28, 29. <hi>Ezra</hi> made the Chief Prieſts, the Levites, and
all Iſrael to enter into a Covenant and to ſwear, that they
would put away the ſtrange wives, and that it ſhould be
done according to the Law, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 3. 5. and whoſoever
would not come to Ieruſalem for this thing, was not only
himſelf excommunicated from the Church, but all his goods
forfeited. <hi>v. 8. Artaxerxes</hi> decreed puniſhment for all who
ſhould oppoſe the Law of God, and the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
wherein he is ſo far approved, as that <hi>Ezra</hi> bleſſeth
God for it, <hi>Ezra 7. 26, 27. Whoſoever will not doe the law of
thy God, and the law of the King, let judgement be executed
ſpeedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or unto baniſhment, or
to confiſcation of goods, or impriſonment, &amp;c.</hi> which doth not
concern Idolatry only, but generally the laws of God, <hi>v.</hi> 25.

               <hi>Set Magiſtrates and Iudges which may judge all the people, all
ſuch as know the laws of thy God.</hi> He who wrote <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
p.</hi> 27, 28. is ſo far confounded with this laudable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> that he can ſay no more to it, but that
it was the commandment of God, not an invention of men
which <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> did thus impoſe, which is as much as we
deſire. But 2. Sects and Schiſmes are to be puniſhed as
well, though not as much as Hereſy and Idolatry. There are
degrees of faults, and accordingly degrees of puniſhments.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> wrote an Epiſtle to <hi>Bonifacius</hi> upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Ep. 50.</note>
to ſhew that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had nothing to doe with the
<hi>Arrians,</hi> and ſo were not to be puniſhed with ſuch rigour
and ſeverity; yet he adviſeth that moderate mulcts and
puniſhments may be laid upon them, &amp; that their Biſhops or
Miniſters may be baniſhed. In his 127 Epiſt. he intercedeth
moſt earneſtly with the proconſul of <hi>Africk,</hi> that he might
not put to death the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> but repreſſe them ſome other
ways. We have alſo a ſcripture example for puniſhing Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
who are not Hereticks. It is agreed among interpreters,
there were in <hi>Iudah</hi> two ſorts of high places, ſome on which
God was worſhipped, others on which idols were worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
&amp; it is moſt manifeſt from 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 33. 17. and from the
reconciling of 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 17. with <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 3. 5. the one ſort was
the high places of Idolatry, the other, the high places of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip;
yet the Prieſts of the latter, as well as of the former,
were puniſhed by <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> as <hi>Toſtatus</hi> proveth from 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.
and the text it ſelf is clear, for he put to death the Prieſts of
<hi>Sama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ia,</hi> who had ſacrificed in the high places of Idolatry,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 20. but as for thoſe who ſacrificed in the high places
of wil-worſhip, becauſe they ſacrificed to the Lord only (as
the word is, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 17.) therefore <hi>Ioſiah</hi> did not put
them to death, only he cauſed them to goe out of all the
Cities of Judah, and to ceaſe from the Prieſts office, ſo that
they durſt not come up to the Altar of the Lord at Jeruſalem,
only they were permitted to eat of the unleavened bread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
their brethren, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. which is parallel to that
law, <hi>Ezek. 44. ver,</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. a prophecy concerning
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:123900:11"/>
the Chriſtian Temple, and the times of the New Teſtament,
w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> reacheth a blow to another ſilly &amp; ſhort-ſighted evaſion,
uſed both in the <hi>Bloudy Tenent,</hi> and in <hi>M. S.</hi> to <hi>A.S.</hi> that all
this coercive power exerciſed in the Old Teſtament, was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall,
&amp; therefore not imitable now in the New Teſtament.
Whereunto I further reply, 1. The reaſon of all that coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
ſeverity was morall and perpetuall, as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 11. Next, why did they not prove that it
was typicall? ſhall we take their fancy for a certainty?
They have neither Scripture nor Interpreters for it. 3. They
confound the Judiciall lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> with the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,
making the Judicatories and Juſtice typicall no leſſe
then the Ceremonies. 4. They doe utterly overthrow the
inveſtiture of Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates with any
power at all in matters of Religion, from the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So that one may not argue thus: The godly Kings
of <hi>Judah</hi> did remove the monuments of Idolatry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
therefore ſo ſhould the Chriſtian Magiſtrate doe.
The moſt arrant malignant may anſwer in the words of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Williams, chap.</hi> 109. that the Civill power or State of Iſrael,
ſo farre as it attended upon the ſpirituall, was meerly figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative:
Or in the words of <hi>M. S. pag. 51. There are two
reaſons very conſiderable why the Kings of Judah might be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
by God with a larger power in matters of religion, then Kings
or Magistrates under the Goſpel have any ground or warrant to
claime from them. Firſt, they were types of Chriſt</hi> (but by the
way how doth he prove that <hi>Aſa, Jehu,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> were
types of Chriſt?) <hi>which no King under heaven at this day is.
Secondly, not the people onely, but the very land over which they
ruled were typicall.</hi> 5. The puniſhment of perſons was a part
of their reformation, as well as the deſtruction of monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and why muſt we follow their example in the one,
more then the other? If we ſmart under both their diſeaſes,
we muſt apply both their remedies, or neither.</p>
            <p>The third argument is drawne from the New Teſtament.
The magiſtrate <hi>beareth not the ſword in vaine, for he is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that doth evill,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:123900:11"/>
Rom.</hi> 13. 4. But I aſſume; Hereticks and Sectaries doe evill,
yea much evill, eſpecially when they draw many others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them in their pernicious wayes. It was the obſervation
of one of the greateſt Politicians of this Kingdome,<note place="margin">See Bacous Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes pag. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>That he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
and ſchiſmes are of all others the greateſt ſcandalls: yea
more then corruption of manners.</hi> One of his reaſons is, becauſe
<hi>every ſect of them hath a diverſe poſture or cringe by themſelves,
which cannot but move deriſion in worldlings, and depraved poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
who are apt to contemne holy things.</hi> I know it will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
If any Sectary make a breach of peace, or diſturb
the State, then indeed the magiſtrate ought to redreſſe it by
a coercive power. So <hi>John the Baptiſt, pag.</hi> 57. So M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,

the tares to be meant neither of hypocrites in the Church,
whether diſcovered or undiſcovered; nor yet of thoſe who

only of Antichriſtian Idolaters and falſe worſhippers: which
is a moſt falſe interpretation. Chriſt himſelfe expoundeth it

41. the tares are expounded to be <hi>all that offend, and which doe

contradict other ordinances for the puniſhment of evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by the Magiſtrate. But this is a baſe begging of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:
for he well knew that thoſe againſt whom he diſputes
hold that his expoſition of the Parable contradicteth the
ordinance of God for puniſhing Idolaters and Hereticks, the
queſtion being whether this be not an ordinance as well as
the puniſhment of ſcandalous livers. Beſides, if the tares be
Antichriſtian Idolaters, and they muſt not be pluckt up, but
ſuffered to grow till the harveſt, as he expoundeth, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth
other Scriptures, which ſay that the ſword muſt be
drawne againſt Antichriſtian idolaters, and they thereby cut
off, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 10. and 17. 16.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to a ſecond anſwer. If by tares I ſhould
ſuppoſe only to be meant Idolaters, Hereticks, and falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
(which is a gloſſe contrary to the text, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate)
yet their argument will not conclude the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
or ſparing of ſuch, except onely in ſuch caſes, and ſo
farre as the true worſhippers of God cannot be certainly
and infallibly dignoſced from the falſe worſhippers, as the
wheat from the tares: as <hi>Jehu</hi> would not deſtroy the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
of <hi>Baal,</hi> till he was ſure that none of the ſervants of
the Lord were among them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 23. The reaſon why
the tares are not to be pluckt up, is, <hi>leſt while ye gather up the
tares, ye root up alſo the wheat with them, verſ.</hi> 29. Now when
a man is ſure that he plucks up nothing but tares, or rather
thornes, without the leaſt danger to the wheat, how doth
the Parable ſtrike againſt his ſo doing? If <hi>M. S.</hi> will not
beleeve me, let him beleeve himſelfe, <hi>pag. 50. For my part,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>when the Civill Magiſtrate ſhall be farre enough out of
this danger of fighting againſt God, I have nothing to ſay againſt
his fighting with ſuperſtition, hereſie, ſchiſme, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:123900:13"/>
Thirdly, what if I ſhape yet another anſwer to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> owne words? <hi>chap. 27. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>this command [Let them alone] was expreſly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the meſſengers or miniſters of the Goſpel, who have not ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
power or authority in their hand, and therefore not to the civill
Magiſtrate, King or Governour.</hi> Now therefore what a bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
argument is it, to reaſon from this Parable againſt the
coercive power of the magiſtrate in matters of religion? If
there muſt be a forbearance of any ſeverity, we muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
Church cenſures and excommunication a way of roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out the tares, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> himſelfe juſtifieth as
much as we doe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and if the utter extirpation and plucking up of
Hereticks by capitall puniſhments, ſhould be underſtood to
be forbidden in the parable, (as it is not) yet the ſtopping
of their mouths, the diſſipating and ſuppreſſing of them,
ſome other coercive way, is not forbidden, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
noteth upon the place, whom <hi>Euthymius</hi> and <hi>Theophylactus</hi>
doe follow in this, allowing of coercive, though not capitall
puniſhments.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and our beſt Interpreters, take the
ſcope and intent of that parable, not to be againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
ſeverity of Magiſtrates, but againſt the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
zeal of thoſe who imagine to have the Church rid of
all ſcandalous and wicked perſons, as wheat without tares,
corn without chaffe, a flock of ſheep without goats, which
hath been the fancy of <hi>Novatians, Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
The parable therefore intimates unto us (as <hi>Bucerus</hi> upon
the place expoundeth it) that when the Magiſtrate hath
done all his duty in exerciſing his coercive power, yet to
the worlds end there will be in the Church a mixture of
good and bad. So that it is the univerſall and perfect purging
of the Church, which is put off to the laſt judgement, not
the puniſhment of particular perſons. Neither doe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
in the parable aske whether they ſhould pluck up this
or that viſible tare, but whether they ſhould goe and make
the whole field rid of them; which field is the generall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:123900:14"/>
Church ſowed with the ſeed of the Goſpel; and ſo
much for that argument.</p>
            <p>Another negative argument is this. Such a coercive
power in matters of religion, maketh men hypocrites and
ſeven times more the children of hell. Chriſts Ordinances
put upon a whole City, or a Nation, may more <hi>civilize</hi> and
<hi>moralize,</hi> but never <hi>chriſtianize</hi> them; ſaith M <hi>Williams,
chap.</hi> 82. I anſwer, this argument doth utterly condemn <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiahs</hi>
Reformation as ſinfull, for he cauſed all <hi>Judah</hi> to ſtand
to the Covenant, as we heard before from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 32.
yet <hi>Iudah</hi> became thereby more hypocriticall. <hi>Treacherous
Iudah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but fained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſaith the Lord,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe very days of <hi>Ioſiah,
Ier.</hi> 3. 6. 10.</p>
            <p>2. This argument maketh alſo againſt the puniſhment of
adulteries, murthers, thefts, robberies, &amp;c. for unleſſe filthy
luſt, hatred, and covetouſneſſe in the heart be mortified,
and men convert freely and ſincerely, the reducing of them
to a morall converſation maketh them hypocrites, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
hell then before.</p>
            <p>3. There are two ſorts of Chriſts Ordinances: ſome for
the <hi>communion of Saints:</hi> others, for the <hi>converſion of ſinners:</hi>
It is far from our thoughts to admit, much leſſe to compell,
a whole City, or Nation promiſcuouſly, to the uſe of the
former. But yet converting or reducing ordinances may and
ought to put upon all whom they concern. The means muſt
be uſed and mens hearts left to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. This Doctrine of the Magiſtrates coercive
power, maketh many to ſtumble at the Presbyterian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
as a bloudy Reformation, as a building <hi>of Zion
with bloud, and Ieruſalem with iniquity, Mic. 3. 10. Anſw.</hi> 1.

appeal the conſciences of thoſe who now plead ſo much
for liberty of conſcience and toleration in this Kingdome,
were they able to root out the Presbyterians and their way,
&amp; could find civil authority inclinable to put forth the coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
power againſt it, whether in that caſe would they not
ſay, that the Magiſtrate may repreſſe it by ſtrong hand, if it
cannot be otherwiſe repreſſed. It is not without cauſe that
I put this Quere to them; for <hi>M. S. pag.</hi> 50. (a paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cited) doth allow of the Magiſtrates fighting againſt a
doctrine or way which is indeed ſuperſtition, hereſy, or
ſchiſme, and only pretendeth to be from God, when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
from men. Alſo that pamphlet called <hi>As you were, p.</hi> 3.

meaning, that every way pretending to be from God
muſt be let alone, but that only we are to refrain &amp; let alone,
till we are certain that we are out of danger of fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, while we endeavour to overthrow it. Now I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
there are ſome who plead for liberty of conſcience,
who profeſſe that they are certain and fully aſſured, upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative
proofs, that the Presbyteriall way is not from
God, nor according to the mind of Jeſus Chriſt (which is
hintedtous both in the pamphlet laſt cited <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6. &amp; in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>pag.</hi> 25.) Therefore according to their principles they
muſt allow of the putting forth of the civil coercive power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:123900:15"/>
the Presbyteriall way. And if ſo, what a grand impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
is this? what a deceiving of the world? what a mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Parliament and of the Kingdome? to plead gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
for liberty of conſcience, when they intend only li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to themſelves, not to others that are oppoſite to them.
Which appeareth yet further by <hi>the compaſſionate Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane,
pag.</hi> 10. he ſaith that no man is to be puniſhed or
diſcountenanced by authority for his opinion, <hi>unleſſe it be
dangerous to the State, pag.</hi> 23, 24. he diſcourſeth againſt the
opinion of Presbyterians as moſt dangerous to the State.
Therefore he would have the Presbyterians diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and puniſhed by authority, and intendeth liberty only
to the <hi>Separatiſts, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>I have done with three objections, but I have three words
more to ſpeak with <hi>the compaſſionate Samaritane,</hi> in anſwer
to his three arguments for liberty of conſcience, in which
though all the ſtrength of his diſcourſe doth lie, I hope to
make him aſhamed of them, if he can at all bluſh.</p>
            <p>His firſt argument is this. <hi>Whatſoever a mans reaſon doth
conclude to be true or falſe, to be agreeable or diſagreeable to
Gods word, that ſame to that man is his opinion or judgement, and
ſo man is by his own reaſon neceſſitated to be of that mind he
is: Now where there is a neceſſity, there ought to be no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for puniſhment is the recompence of voluntary actions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no man ought to be puniſhed for his judgement. Anſw.</hi> 1.
The queſtion is not whether a man ought to be puniſhed for
his judgement, but whether a man ought to be puniſhed
for ſuch profeſſions or practiſes in religion, as are found to
be pernicious, hurtfull, and deſtructive, to the glory of
God, the truth of the Goſpell, the Ordinances of Chriſt, the
reformation of Religion, the peace of the Church. I know
he will be ready ſtill to ſet on foot his argument, for that a
mans judgement and reaſon doth ſo neceſſitate and conclude
him that he cannot chuſe but profeſſe and practice as he doth.
Therefore I adde 2. this argument of his ſtriketh againſt the
juſtice of the Parliament done or to be done upon Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
for as much as their judgement bindeth them, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:123900:15"/>
their reaſon doth neceſſitate them to judge and ſpeak and
act as they doe. 3. It ſtriketh at the very juſtice of God
upon reprobate and unbeleeving men, for as much as they
cannot receive the things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. cannot hear
the words of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 43. cannot receive the ſpirit of
truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 17. But 4. the formall ſolution is this; there
is a groſſe fallacy in the argument, for we muſt diſtinguiſh
neceſſity, there is a <hi>naturall neceſſity,</hi> which takes away the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and a <hi>morallneceſſity,</hi> which takes away the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of
a mans being of another judgement or way. Again, there
is an <hi>abſolute neceſſity,</hi> and a <hi>hypotheticall neceſſity.</hi> Now
the neceſſity of a Hereticks judging thus, becauſe his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
concludeth him thus, is not a <hi>morall</hi> neceſſity or
obligation upon him, as if it were not lawfull to him to
judge or doe otherwiſe, (nay he ought and is bound by the
word of God to judge otherwiſe, and doe otherwiſe) but it is
a <hi>naturall</hi> neceſſity, (I meane of ſinfull nature) and that not
<hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>abſolute,</hi> neither, but <hi>hypotheticall</hi> only, and upon
this ſuppoſition that he hath not yet opened his eyes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more light, nor ſet his heart ſingly and in the feare of
God to ſeeke more light. So that the plaine Engliſh of this
<hi>Samaritan</hi> argument is this: Though Gods word bindeth a
man to ſuch a duty, yet if his owne erroneous, perverſe and
corrupt judgement conclude him ſo farre that his opinion
cannot agree with the word of God, and himſelfe cannot
be brought to the practice of that neceſſary duty; ſuch a
man ought not to be puniſhed. Or as if one ſhould argue
thus: He that hath borrowed from me a thouſand pound,
hath by his owne fault diſabled himſelfe to pay it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may not call him to an account for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let us ſee whether this</hi> Samaritan <hi>be happier in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
argument. Which is this:</hi> It's knowne that the Fathers,
Generall Councels, Nationall Aſſemblies, Synods and Parliaments
in their times have beene moſt groſſely miſtaken: and though the
preſent times be wiſer then the former, &amp;c. yet ſince there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
a poſſibility of error, notwithstanding never ſo great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions
to the contrary, one ſort of men are not to compell ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:123900:16"/>
ſince this hazard is run thereby, that he who is in an error
may be the conſtrainer of him who is in the truth.</p>
            <p>Anſw. 1. Farewell Parliaments, if this argument hold
good. The Parliament may fine no man, impriſon no man,
baniſh no man: they may compell no man to Aſſeſſements,
Taxes, Exciſe, Billeting of Souldiers &amp;c. And why forſooth?
becauſe they may not preſume of an infallible and unerring
ſpirit, but may erre, and have erred as well as other men.</p>
            <p>2 He argueth from the hazard of compulſion, it may
fall out that he who is in the truth may be conſtrained and
perſecuted. True: it may fall out ſo; and the Lord ſave
us that we never be acceſſary to the perſecuting of any who
is in the truth, for ſo it may be againe through mens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and abuſe of the magiſtrates power, (ſo the beſt
things may be abuſed.)</p>
            <p>But the liberty of conſcience which he pleadeth for, runs
a farre greater hazard, even the hazard of not only ſhaking
but overturning truth, and peace, and religion, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and Church, and ſoules, and all. To the ruine of all
theſe, and to a thouſand miſchiefes, this kinde of liberty
prepareth a broad way, and openeth a wide doore; and it
is better, as he ſaid, to live where <hi>nothing is lawfull,</hi> then
where <hi>every thing is lawfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It followes not that becauſe Parliaments may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
of an unerring ſpirit, therefore they cannot be certaine
that they are in the truth concerning this or that particular,
ſo that they may confidently compell men to it, without
feare of fighting againſt God. The acknowledgement of a
poſſibility of error, and that we know but in part as long as
we are in this world, may well conſiſt with mens fulneſſe of
perſwaſion from the light of Gods word, concerning this or
that truth to be beleeved, or duty to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I make haſte to his third argument.</hi> To compell me, <hi>ſaith
he,</hi> againſt my conſcience, is to compell me againſt what I beleeve
to be true, and ſo againſt my faith; now whatſoever is not of
faith is ſinne: to compell me therefore against my conſcience, is to
compell me to doe that which is ſinfull. <hi>And,</hi> Againe I am coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:123900:16"/>
by the Apoſtle to be perſwaded in my owne minde of the
truth of that way wherein I ſerve the Lord, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Anſw. 1. This alſo ſhaketh looſe Parliamentary autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
though the Gentleman who wrote theſe arguments
pretendeth to ſtand for it, as much as any other. His argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will conclude (if it concludeth at all) that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may not compell Malignants, diſaffected perſons, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
to any thing which they are not perſwaded in their
own minds to be right. It is againſt my conſcience, wil the
Antiparliamentary malignant ſay, to contribute to the war,
to acknowledge this for a Parliament, as long as the King
doth not acknowledg it; to reveal ſuch a deſign, or to confeſſe
this or that plot againſt the Parliament, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am examined;
therefore I ſhal ſin if I do ſo, for whatſoever is not of faith is
ſinne, and the Parliament ſhall compell me to ſinne, if they
compell me to doe ſo. <hi>For though the thing may be in it ſelfe
good, yet if it doe not appeare to be ſo to my conſcience, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
thereof in me is ſinfull, which therefore I ought not to bee
compelled unto,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Samaritan.</hi> If hee ſay his argument
is only concerning matters of religion, I anſwer, Whatever
his intention be in offering the argument, the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

manner of doubting, as the Caſuiſts well obſerve, but only
practicall doubts: for a man may have his conſcience mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and practically certaine, ſo that he may doe ſuch a
thing lawfully, and with confidence that he is doing the will
of God, and yet withall he may be perhaps fluctuating in
ſome ſpeculative doubts concerning that very thing. For
inſtance: a Chriſtian may come to the Lords Table with
ſo much faith (I meane not now the faith of the perſon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:123900:17"/>
which juſtifieth before God, but the faith of that action) as
maketh his comming lawfull, though his thoughts be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
with ſome doubts concerning the truth of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and faith. A ſouldier may in faith goe out to warre,
being aſſured that what he doth he may doe without ſinne,
but yet he hath happily his owne ſpeculative doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the nature, cauſes, and ends of the warre. A man
may with freedome and perſwaſion of minde (ſo farre as
concerneth his practice) ſubmit to Presbyteriall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who yet perhaps hath not throughly ſatisfied himſelfe
concerning the grounds and warrants which it hath from
the word of God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Samaritan</hi> will reply (it may be) that he hath <hi>no faith
at all</hi> concerning the practice it ſelfe, and that he may not be
compelled to doe any thing againſt his conſcience, for that
were to compell him to ſinne. To take off this, I adde 3.
If the thing be indifferent, I confeſſe no man is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to it againſt his conſcience, for this hath beene the
tyranny of Papiſts and Prelats, to compell men againſt their
conſciences to certaine rites which themſelves acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to be meerly indifferent, ſetting aſide obedience to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in ſuch things, which (ſay they) is not indifferent.
But if the word of God either directly or by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
make the thing neceſſary, and ſuch as we cannot
leave undone without ſinne and breach of duty; if there
be ſuch an obligation from the word, then may a man bee
compelled to it, though againſt his conſcience.</p>
            <p>But then you will ſay, I am brought into a neceſſity of
ſinning, for if I obey not, I refuſe a duty; if I obey, I doe it
againſt my conſcience. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This neceſſity is not <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,</hi>
but <hi>hypotheticall,</hi> is not <hi>perſe,</hi> but <hi>per accidens,</hi> ſo long as a
man retaineth the error of his conſcience, which he ought
to caſt away. You will ſay againe, ſuppoſing that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
cannot be ſatisfied, nor made of another opinion
then now I am of, whether in this caſe, and ſo long as it
ſtandeth thus with me, may authority compell me to obey
againſt my conſcience, and ſo to ſinne? or whether ought
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:123900:17"/>
they not rather permit me not to obey, becauſe my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
forbiddeth me. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The thing being neceſſary,
as hath been ſaid, it is <hi>pars tutior,</hi> yea, <hi>tutiſſima,</hi> that a man
be compelled to it, though it be againſt his erring and ill
informed conſcience. I know ſo long as he hath ſuch an
erring conſcience he cannot but ſin in obeying. But the
ſin of not obeying is greater and heavier: for this is a ſin
<hi>in the fact it ſelf;</hi> that a ſin <hi>in the manner of doing only,</hi> being
not done in faith: this is a ſin <hi>of it ſelfe,</hi> that is a ſin only <hi>by
accident:</hi> this is a ſin <hi>materially;</hi> that is a ſinne only <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively</hi>
to him, becauſe he thinks ſo: this is a ſin <hi>for the
ſubſtance;</hi> that a ſin <hi>for the circumſtance:</hi> this cannot be
made to be no ſin, for the nature of the duty cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered;
that may ceaſe to be a ſin, for the mans conſcience
may through Gods mercy and bleſſing upon the means, be
better informed. So that there can be no doubt but this is
every way a greater ſin then that, and conſequently more to
be avoided. And thus I have diſpatched the <hi>Samaritane</hi> who
did undertake to pour oyl into the wounds of the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Medice cura teipſum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing comes in my way, is an argument brought
for liberty of conſcience, from <hi>Gamaliels</hi> ſpeech in favour of
the Apoſtles, <hi>Act. 5. 38, 39. Refrain from theſe men &amp; let them
alone: for if this counſell or this work be of men, it will come to
nought. But if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it, leſt haply ye
be found even to fight againſt God.</hi> The ſtrength of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
did lie in this <hi>Dilemma;</hi> this doctrine or way is
either of men, or of God. If it be of men, you ſhall not need
to repreſſe it, for it will come to nought of it ſelf, which he
proves by two Hiſtoricall inſtances of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Theudas.</hi>
If it be of God, it is in vain to ſtrive againſt it, for it muſt
prevail, and the counſell of heaven muſt ſtand. Therefore
be what it will be, there is no danger to let it alone. But
on the other ſide, if ye goe about to repreſſe it ye runne the
hazard both of fighting againſt God, and of provoking the
diſpleaſure as well of the <hi>Romanes</hi> who have not permitted
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:123900:18"/>
unto you the liberty of capitall puniſhments, as of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Jews who magnifie theſe men and their way.
This is the whole ſubſtance, ſenſe, and ſcope of that ſpeech
of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> in the Councell. Hence did ſome argue for a
toleration to <hi>Servetus</hi> and other Hereticks. And though
this their way was then diſcovered to be their folly, <hi>yet their
poſterity approve their ſayings.</hi> The ſame argument is uſed in
that pamphlet called <hi>Liberty of Conſcience, p.</hi> 34, 35. Upon the
ſame foundation doth M <hi>Goodwin</hi> build in his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and the Paraenetick for <hi>Chriſtian liberty, pag. 2. and</hi> 11. ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the credit and authority of <hi>Gamaliels</hi> ſpeech, for
matter of truth to be one and the ſame with other ſcriptures,
and that there is nothing in all that ſpeech but what is fully
conſonant with the word of God, unqueſtionably ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.

people of the Jews, for that <hi>would be but at the Apoſtles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
not execution.</hi> What non-ſenſe is here? the people
were angry at laying hands on the Apoſtles, but there was
no fear of their wrath if the Apoſtles ſhould be killed. Not
for fear of the <hi>Romanes</hi> wrath, which, ſaith he, they often
regarded not, as <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 27. A place which confuteth
himſelf, for when the Jews would have killed <hi>Paul, Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
Lyſias</hi> came with an army and reſcued him: a danger

that we command fire to come downe from heaven, and conſume
them, even as Elias did? But he turned and rebuked them, and
ſaid, Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of, for the Sonne of
man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them. <hi>A place
objected by</hi> Nicolaides Refut. tract. de Eccl, cap. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That prophecy concerning the Chriſtian Church,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 9. is not to be underſtood generally, as the word
ſoundeth, for then adulterers, murtherers, &amp;c. are not to be
hurt and deſtroyed by the Chriſtian Magiſtrate. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
therefore is, that thoſe who have formerly been as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
&amp; Wolves to the poor Lambs of Chriſt, ſhall either be
renewed and changed in their nature, or (which is more
probable) ſhal be ſo reſtrained and overawed by the power
and providence of God, that it ſhal not be in their power to
hurt or deſtroy any of the Saints for the truth or the Goſpels
ſake. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Neither ſhall they bee
able to deſtroy any:</hi> So the <hi>Septuagints.</hi> God ſhall ſo preſerve
and protect his Church, that ſhe ſhall be like a Lamb
among Wolves, or like a Kid among Leopards, or like a
Childe putting his hand on the Cockatrice den, and yet
ſhall not be hurt nor deſtroyed thereby. And as this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
guardeth and protecteth none but thoſe who are in
Gods holy Mountaine, profeſſors and lovers of the Goſpel,
and the ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt: So our Lord Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
<hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54, 55. ſtriketh not againſt any juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
ſeverity, but againſt a private vindictive ſpirit, and
carnall blinde zeale: It being the purpoſe of Chriſt, then,
moſt of all other times, not to exerciſe violence, (as tyrants
doe in conquering new dominions) but to conquer and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
ſoules by his doctrine and miracles, with a ſpirit of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:123900:20"/>
meekneſſe, eſpecially having to doe with the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> or
any other who had never yet knowne nor received the
Goſpel. Even thoſe who ſay moſt for a coercive power to
be put forth againſt Heretickes and Schiſmaticks, doe not
allow of the compelling of Infidels, Pagans, or Jewes, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
puniſhments to receive the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But now after all this debate upon the queſtion in hand,
and after all theſe arguments for the affirmative and for
the negative, ſome will happily deſire and expect ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
modification and explanation of the matter in certain
poſitive concluſions or diſtinguiſhing aſſertions. For whoſe
ſatisfaction I ſay,</p>
            <p>Firſt, there are five ſorts of toleration proceeding from
five different principles. 1. Of <hi>indifferency.</hi> 2. Of <hi>policy.</hi>
3. Of <hi>pretended conſcience</hi> and <hi>equity.</hi> 4. Of <hi>neceſſity.</hi> 5. Of
<hi>charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is when the Magiſtrate is a Nullifidian, Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt,
and Adiaphoriſt, eſteeming as <hi>Gallio</hi> did, <hi>queſtions of the
law</hi> and of the Ordinances of Chriſt, to be <hi>of words &amp; names,</hi>
or things <hi>which he careth not for, Acts</hi> 18. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is when the Magiſtrate tolerateth hereticks
and ſectaries for his own profit, or ſome ſuch intereſt of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
ſuch as maketh the Pope to tolerate the Jews in <hi>Italy,</hi>
yea in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, where they have their ſynagogues, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
and liturgies, becauſe his profit by them is greater
then by the very Courtizans; yea, beſides their certain tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
he doth ſometimes impoſe on them a ſubſidy of ten
thouſand crownes extraordinary for ſome ſervice of the
State, as <hi>Europae ſpeculum, pag.</hi> 221, 222. hath repreſented to
us. And whether the States of the united Provinces do not
grant tolerations upon the like intereſts of their own profit,
I leave it to the judgement of their own conſciences.</p>
            <p>The third is the toleration pleaded for here, by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,
the compaſſionate Samaritane, &amp;c.</hi> as if juſtice, equity,
duty, and conſcience ſhould make the Magiſtrate forbear all
coercive power in matters of religion. All theſe three I
utterly condemn, and the former arguments doe ſtrongly
militate againſt them.</p>

it cannot be condemned as the Magiſtrates fault. Even
a <hi>David</hi> may have cauſe to complain that the ſons of <hi>Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viah</hi>
are too ſtrong for him. In ſuch caſes as theſe, our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
have given a relief to the conſcience of the Chriſtian

Therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> likeneth this coercive puniſhing of

of the Magiſtrare in matters of religion, and the abuſe
of that power; when we juſtifie the power, we juſtifie not the
abuſe of it; and when we condemn the abuſe, we muſt not
therefore condemn the power. <hi>Acontius Stratag. Stat. li.</hi> 3.
<hi>pag.</hi> 147. buildeth much upon this notion, let a man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that his lot is fallen in thoſe times when the truth is
perſecuted by authority, when the Magiſtrate juſtifieth the
wicked and condemneth the godly, (which hath been the
more ordinary condition of the Church) and then let him
accordingly ſhape the reſolution of the queſtion concerning
the Magiſtrates puniſhing of Hereticks. Will not a man
think (ſaith he) it had been better that Hereticks had not
been puniſhed, then that upon pretence of coercive power
againſt Hereticks, the edge of the Civill ſword be turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Preachers and Profeſſors of the truth? But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
of all this, truth muſt be truth, and juſtice
muſt be juſtice, abuſe it who will. Parliaments and Synods
have been many times enemies to the truth, and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
their power in matters of religion: muſt we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deny the power of Parliaments and Synods? or muſt
we caſt off any ordinance of God becauſe of the abuſe of
it? If the thing were indifferent, the abuſe might take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the uſe: not ſo, when the thing is neceſſary. I adde

               <hi>Sixtly,</hi> as the <hi>reformation</hi> and <hi>preſervation</hi> of religion differ
much from the <hi>propagation</hi> of religion: ſo the coercive po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
put forth in the ſuppreſſing of Hereſie or Schiſme, is a
thing of another nature then the compelling of Infidels by
the ſword to receive the Goſpell. Let the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
and <hi>Mahomet</hi> propagate religion by the ſword; that
is not it I plead for. None of the Gentiles was of old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to be circumciſed, but being circumciſed he might be
compelled to keepe the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Alſo if ſtrangers of
the Gentiles were ſojourning or trading in the land of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:123900:23"/>
they might be compelled to abſtaine from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke

               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> to eſtabliſh by a law the toleration, liberty and
