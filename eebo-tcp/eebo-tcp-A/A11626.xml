            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now becauſe no one man can do Gods office (who is all eye and all eare, and all in every place) Kings are inforced to uſe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of inferiour helps, to be eyes, eares, and hands for them; that as the ſunne whoſe office it is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten all the world (which by it's own beams it cannot do at one inſtant) is therefore inforced to communicate himſelf to other ſtarres, who in his abſence may give light and influence: ſo Kings (it being impoſſible that they ſhould be preſent at all affairs of their kingdome) do lend ſome of their own authority to leſſer lights, who do heare and ſee, and do for them; among which lights the Judges of a land, to whom ſacred juſtice is committed, are not the leaſt. This was not unknown to that great King Artaxerxes, who intending the full reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, citie, and temple of the God of heaven, gave order in the verſe before for Judges to be ſet over them; and (though himſelf an heathen

            </p>
            <p>Out of which charge (that I may neither ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly chop it into gobbits, nor curiouſly mince it to a gallamafrie) theſe particulars (God aſſiſting) ſhall be inſiſted upon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That in judgement there muſt be no partiality:</hi> Secondly, <hi>That obſtinate offenders are chiefly to be looked unto:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That Gods honour is firſt to be provided for:</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That the Kings law muſt alſo be freed from violation:</hi> Fifthly, <hi>That judgement muſt in theſe caſes take her due courſe.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>That execution muſt be ſpeedy.</hi> And this is the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Text: now ſee the mine where I dig it. Partiality is prevented, in that generall, <hi>Whoſoever:</hi> Obſtinacy noted in theſe words, <hi>Will not:</hi> Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is firſt provided for in the precedency of <hi>Gods law:</hi> The Kings in the next place, by ſubjoyning the <hi>Law of the King:</hi> Juſtice is brought in for her part, <hi>Let him have judgement:</hi> Speedy execution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Without delay.</hi> WHOSOEVER WILL NOT &amp;c. Of all which while I ſpeak, in my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters name I boldly call for audience: in mine own name I moſt lowly crave your Chriſtian and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable patience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There muſt be no partiality in judgement; <hi>Whoſoever:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, How great or mean ſoever, noble or ignoble, rich or poore, friend or enemy; the one not to be feared, the other not to be pitied. I confeſſe, all offenders are not alike: but this difference ariſeth not from the quality of the <hi>offender,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Chron. 19.6.</note> but of the <hi>offence.</hi> Jehoſhaphat told his Judges that their judgement was <hi>Gods</hi> not <hi>mans,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:141:4"/>
that they ought to judge as God himſelf would, who accepts no perſons. And he whoſe <hi>Dixit</hi> was his <hi>Fecit,</hi> hath ſaid they <hi>are,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 82.6.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath made them to <hi>be,</hi> gods: wherefore as in other things, ſo in impartiality their judgements muſt be little types of Gods great aſſiſes, where ſinne ſhall be judged in all perſons alike, ſaving that the greatnes of the perſon ſhall adde to the puniſhment: for the <hi>mighty ſhall be mightily tormented,</hi> Wiſ. 6.6. <hi>Viri ſublimis culpa grave peccatum eſt,</hi> ſaith S. Auſtin. The greater the man, the greater is the ſinne. Varniſh is no colour of it ſelf; but yet it addes luſtre to every colour: ſo greatneſſe and eminencie of perſon is of it ſelf neither vertue nor vice; but yet it gives a great addition to either. So then the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and not the <hi>perſon,</hi> muſt be judged: for <hi>Whoſoever &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would willingly (before I leave this point) diſgrace this ſinne of partiality in judgement by ſhewing the pedegree of it, and what houſe it comes of; namely either from bribes, favour, raſh anger, or cowardiſe: evil egges all; for <hi>neither barrell, better herring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt from <hi>bribes</hi>; as is to be ſeen Exod. 23.8. as alſo Deut. 16.19. where we heare that <hi>A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blindeth the eyes of the wiſe, and perverteth the words of the juſt</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> two dangerous effects upon two principall parts in doing juſtice, making the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver firſt to have a miſt before his <hi>eyes,</hi> and to be ſtricken with <hi>deceptio viſûs</hi>; and then, not diſcerning the cauſe, muſt of neceſſitie pervert his words, yea caſts him into a fit of convulſion, and draws his <hi>mouth</hi> clean awry; and then how can he give right judgement? Ah! fie upon this ſtinking <hi>wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe</hi>; 2. Pet. 2.15.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:141:5"/>2. Next from <hi>favour,</hi> procured by letters, friends, favorites, ſervants, and the like: for all theſe will ſtickle now and then in bad cauſes, and Judges do too often liſten to ſuch motions, thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others indebted to them againſt ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But letters of this nature are beſt anſwered with ſilence: as for friends and favorites, a Judge in his robes, upon the ſeat of judgement, ſhould be no man of this world; but like the Angels in heaven, where they <hi>neither marry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 22.30.</note> 
               <hi>nor are given in marriage</hi>; that is, all earthly relations do ceaſe. As for your ſervants, if they move in a cauſe, ſuſpect thoſe leſſer wheels to be newly oyled, or elſe they would not go ſo round: yea of all theſe ſay, <hi>Magìs amica veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> I will loſe you all for juſtice ſake.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometime from <hi>anger:</hi> No paſſion but is an evil guide in execution of juſtice, even too much compaſſion; for there is a cruel mercy: but there is none ſo impetuous and dangerous, as this of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: for if there be an angry prejudice againſt the perſon, even ſlender probabilities will ſeem vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſumptions, and preſumptions will appeare pregnant evidence. Anger is the drunkenneſſe of the minde, which robs a man of himſelf: nay, it is a ſhort madneſſe, differing from it onely in duration: for if a man ſhould ever be as in his paſſion, with eyes ſtaring, countenance red and inflate, teeth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and interfering, tongue ſtutting and ſtam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

But if Socrates would not beat his boy when he was angry, how much more ſhould all miniſters of juſtice baniſh

this heady paſſion from the judgement-ſeat, leſt they heat the oven ſeven times hotter in their <hi>own</hi> cauſe then in <hi>Gods,</hi> proceeding in heat againſt the <hi>perſon,</hi> and not in zeal againſt the <hi>ſinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, from <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>cowardiſe:</hi> this caſt away Nabaoth; the Judges had letters written in Achabs name, and ſealed with his ſeal, and they durſt not go againſt the Kings <hi>Mandamus.</hi> With this the Jews brought on Pilate to give ſentence of <hi>death</hi> againſt the Lord of <hi>life,</hi> who adjudged him both to <hi>die</hi> and to be <hi>guiltleſſe of death, Nè non videretur ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Caeſari,</hi> Leſt he ſhould not be Ceſars friend, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leſt Ceſar ſhould not be his friend: But how much better had it been, if theſe Judges had prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the diſpleaſure of the great Judge of all the world? and ſaid, <hi>Da veniam, Imperator; tu minaris car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerem, Deus gehennam:</hi> I will forfeit mine head, or mine office, rather then my truth. Thus they who be in ſcarlet ſhould be valiant men.<note place="margin">Nah. 2.3.</note> To betray a cauſe for want of courage, is worſe then for want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: this is of ignorance, but that is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; therefore not to be expiated but by double ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>A miniſter of juſtice of the two had better be <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The ſecond point is, Obſtinate offenders are chiefly to be looked unto; <hi>Whoſoever will not, &amp;c.</hi> This obſtinacy is indeed an Alecto in anothers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a meer mock-vertue, walking under the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of conſtancy or fortitude, (as many other vices have their cloaks alſo) but we ſhall uncaſe him preſently.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:141:7"/>
through many priſons; he owes for clothes of ſix or ſeven ſeverall faſhions, yet he loſeth no rent, for he takes it all aforehand: he undoes his tenants by ſuretiſhip; for the young maſter, if he gets into an Inne, he comes not out till his horſe pay the reckoning, and there out of his window ſcoffes at thoſe who go to church; his diſcourſe is nothing but rayling upon, and diſgracing the better minded Juſtices, and other miniſters of juſtice; in every quarrell he is either principall or ſecond; he is a night-walker, and if he ſhould never be drunk, he would die for want of ſleep; where ever he comes he miſuſes the Conſtable, and beats the watch; he never comes in any publique aſſembly but a play, nor rides through a town without ſmoke at his noſe: but in proceſſe of time, his means ſpent, his credit crackt, his hopes forlorn, having nothing left of a Gentleman, but his long lock and his ſword, he had rather lack life then living, and either kills a man or takes a purſe, and is brought to the aſsiſes:</hi> Where if ye meet any ſuch, remember the charge, <hi>Whoſoever will not &amp;c.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third point is, Gods honour muſt firſt be provided for, <hi>The law of thy God &amp;c.</hi> It's true, the charge proceeded from an heathen King, but not from an heathen ſpirit; and is recorded by the Spirit of God, to be a moving preſident, and authentick copy for all Kings to write after. Bleſſed be God, our King, when he gives this charge, alters the terms, and ſaith for <hi>Thy</hi> God, <hi>My</hi> God, and doth ſo charge it upon his Judges, and all inferiour miniſters of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in their ſeverall orbs, that, <hi>Whoſoever will not obey the law of My God &amp;c.</hi> Now if heathen Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes could ſtoop ſo low, as to let the law of Ezra's God go before his own: how much more (by a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:141:7"/>
binding argument from the leſſe to the greater) will it be expected from all Kings who own him for <hi>their God?</hi> So that the naming Gods law before the Kings, is not bare complement, and for manners ſake onely; but for the naturall precedency thereof. And verily when God made all this world, and brought man not to the bare walls of it, but as the bee to the hive, even readie ſtockt and ſtored with variety of creatures, both for neceſſitie and delight, and placed order therein by his providence to keep the ſame in reparation, that as men have dominion over creatures, ſo ſome men are made Gods depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to rule over men: all this was not to part with his glory to another, or to ſtand to the curteſie of others, to be at their carving and allowance for his honour; but that all men, even Kings, ſhould hold all of him in <hi>Capite,</hi> and do him homage for his goodneſſe, the Lord granting us indeed the good and ſweet of his favours, but as a rent or tribute, by way of acknowledgement, reſerving the honour of them to himſelf. Hence it is, that in Scripture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Kings power is ſpoken of, there is alſo expreſſed, or at leaſt intimated, Gods ſupremacy. If Paul ſaith, <hi>Be obedient to higher powers,</hi> he addeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note>

               <note place="margin">Prov. 24.21.</note> he hath firſt ſaid, <hi>Fear God.</hi> And ſo here Artaxerxes premiſeth the law of God before the law of the King. Nay, if this be not ſo, what do ye here? do ye not come to heare Gods charge before ye ſhew the Kings commiſſion; as if that could not take place, till this had made way for it? Hence is it alſo that all

good Kings and Magiſtrates in Scripture began their reigne and government with doing ſomething for God and religion, as is evident in Moſes, Joſhua, David, Solomon, and the reſt: and of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory was that of bleſſed Queen Eliſabeth, who firſt bound up that tender-babe the Church of England in the ſwathing band of reformation, before ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided any thing for the eſtabliſhment of her own throne, by the ſubjects recognition of her title to the imperiall Crown.

The Lord reſerved in the Old law as ſacred to himſelf, the firſt-fruits, and firſtlings in every kinde, teaching us in all things to ſerve God of the firſt, and beſt. And what is the Kings law without Gods? what is the Kings peace without Gods peace? outward proſperitie without religion? nay, peace is no peace without religion: unity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out verity breeds not <hi>peace,</hi> but <hi>conſpiracie.</hi> Oh then let God be the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of this ſacred acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: let the beginning be with God, by his aſſiſtance, the ending for God, by providing for his honour.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:141:8"/>
do what ſeemed good in his eyes, if there were no law of the King in Iſrael? Secondly the Papiſts, who though they can brook Kings &amp; many of their laws, yet they cannot endure them ſo neare God and his law, but there muſt be room left between God and the King for the Pope, whom his flatterers call Vice-god, Monarch of the Chriſtian world, Defender of the Papall omnipotency. (oh blaſphemie!) And as for Emperours and Kings, they be but as the Moon, borrowing their light from him their Sunne; and are nothing but his vaſſals, to hold his ſtirrop, to lead his horſe, to carry his canopie, to hold his baſon when he waſheth, &amp; to be depoſed or exalted at his pleaſure. But then let him take it with the appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances: He is Antichriſt for his labour, exalting himſelf, according to S. Pauls propheſie,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.4.</note>

               </gap>, Kings have no peer upon earth, but are the top and head of all men. And ſo, for all Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts and Papiſts, we affirm the fourth point, That next to Gods the Kings law muſt alſo be freed from violation. Thoſe whom God hath joyned together let no man put aſunder: ſuch are every where God and the King, God and Ceſar, Gods law and the Kings law: and indeed they be twins, to laugh and mourn, to live and (in ſome ſenſe) to die together. The Kings law doth clap a ſhore to Gods law; not that Gods law is in it ſelf weak and needs it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are not ſo well bred, as for conſcience or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:141:9"/>
love of goodneſſe to obey, but are much ſwayed by temporall reward or puniſhment by mans law diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted or inflicted. If any ask whether the Kings law doth binde conſcience as Gods law doth; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That Gods law is <hi>immediately</hi> ſeated upon the conſcience, mans law is ſeated upon the conſcience too, but <hi>mediately,</hi> and as it hath authority from Gods law: for God doth permit Kings to make laws as Kings do Corporations, and Colledges to make Conſtitutions, provided alwayes that they contain in them nothing contrary to a ſtatute law: So that though the Kings law doth challenge obedience, as Gods law doth, and gives as it were the ſame arms, yet (like a younger brother) it muſt be with diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If any ask further in what things the law of man hath power to command with ſtricteſt tie; I anſwer, That as Merchants ſometime ſuffer their ſervants in the time of their apprentiſhood, to trade for themſelves in ſome commodities, wherein they themſelves do not deal: So properly the law of man hath his principall ſtrength in things of their own nature indifferent; for theſe be neither commanded nor forbidden in Gods law: To conclude this point, The Kings law is the ſinew of all government, which to cut, is to ham-ſtring Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; for it is better to live where nothing, then where every thing is lawfull.</p>

Verily the law is a dead letter till the Judge breaths the breath of life into it by execution, which is the edge and life of it. The law ſees nothing but by the eyes of the Judge, and Judges are the eyes of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: which if they be by any means put out, a State, though never ſo potent, is but like big-limb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Polyphemus, ready for ruine; or mighty Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſon, pulling down all upon their heads, to their own and the ruine of all ingaged with them in the ſame condition. Cicero could ſay, that <hi>Impunitie is the greateſt breeder and nurſe of tranſgreſsion that may be:</hi> For to let malefactours go without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either not at all or condignly puniſhing them, is but to ſtroke the offenders on the head, as Eli did with a <hi>Do no more ſo, my ſonnes,</hi> and ſo to give them and other after them a kinde of commiſſion to do the like. Take heed of a weak affectation of mercifull Judges, or mercifull Juries; take heed (I ſay) ye do not thereby encourage ſinne, and clap it on the back. Can that be mercy, which is unjuſt?

But oh hard task, to rake in this kennell, to ſpeak of the many-headed vice in all theſe particulars, without diſlike from you, or check from mine own conſcience! ſo that I may ſay in Perſius his words, <hi>Oh, ſi fas dicere.

I meddle not with your employments of ſtate; they are out of my reach, I am no eaveſ-dreeper of ſtate; it is for me to obſerve the ground-winde, not the rack-winde; I keep me therefore within the compaſſe of my Text, and deſire your Honours ſeriouſly to ponder, that acceptation of perſons in judgement is a ſtinking abomination in the noſtrils of the Almighty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for reward, favour, paſſion, or cowardiſe. For the firſt, mine own breaſt doth clear your ſelves, that ye be not as thoſe Judges in Plutarch, who ever came to the judgement-ſeat, as to a golden harveſt, and I hope ye will as well look to the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of thoſe about you. Let it not be with you, as with many great ones, who are ſaid to allot no other wages or reward to their ſervants, but their avales of this nature: partiality for favour findes eaſier en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance then the former: but I beſeech you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that publick places afford not means of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring private friends, but follow that memorable example of Cleon, who being called to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commonwealth, aſſembled all his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends, and diſclaimed all inward amity with them. And moſt truly ſaith Tully, <hi>He deprives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:141:11"/>
of the office of a friend, who takes upon him the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Judge.</hi> Yet alſo take heed of the contrary, of being tranſported with anger: we uſe not troubled water till it be ſetled, we bring not a rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannaged horſe to the turney; no more ſhould you unbridled affections to the judgement-ſeat; but when ye robe your bodies, ye ſhould alſo apparrell your mindes with calmed affections. I confeſſe there is an anger becoming a Judge, for one ſaith, <hi>Qui ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret irâ, caret juſtitiâ, He who cannot be angry, cannot be juſt:</hi> but this is to be underſtood of that anger which <hi>whets courage,</hi> not of that which <hi>blindeth wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for fear, it's too baſe an humour to trapper juſtice, the over-fearfull man is but a piece of a man. Claudius (the firſt of the Ceſars) his mother was wont to ſay of him for his faint-heartedneſſe, that nature had <hi>begun,</hi> but not <hi>perfected him.</hi> The Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians had a law, that if great men ſhould command Judges againſt law, they ſhould refuſe it: and Trajan when he inveſted any Praetour by giving him the ſword, would command him to uſe it even againſt himſelf, in caſe he violated law or equity. Plutarch worthily reproves Ageſilaus for writing thus to one of his Judges in favour of an offender; <hi>Si inſons eſt, dimitte; ſin minùs, meâ cauſà dimitte: utcunque di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte:</hi> If he be guiltleſſe, good reaſon he ſhould be diſcharged; if he be guilty, for my ſake diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him: but guilty or not guilty, ſee he be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. But let your judgement-ſeats be (like So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons throne) ſupported on both ſides with lions. Oh let Judges be abſolute and independent, not having their ſcantlings given them, and their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:141:12"/>
moulded to their hands: for this is to be an <hi>apprentiſe,</hi> and not a <hi>maſter</hi> in the art.</p>
            <p>In the next place I turn my ſpeech to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull Juſtices, who are alſo <hi>Minores Dii,</hi> and the ſecond ſonnes of juſtice: Carry an even hand among your neighbours, help not to ſmother drunkenneſſe, baſterdy, or any wickedneſſe in any, though allied or linked in any relation; proſecute not a ſmall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour over eagerly in one, whereat ye connive in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: in a word, let there be no one ſit on our bench, in whom the countrey may obſerve that the baskets not walking, not giving worſhip, cap &amp; knee enough, not coming in upon your carting daies, not ſaluting you on Newyeares day morning, or any ſuch mean reſpect, or other diſreſpect will incenſe you to whet the ſword of juſtice, and ſo to avenge your private conceits.</p>
            <p>Now a word to the Jurours and witneſſes, &amp; let it be ſpoken not onely to them who are ſo at this aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but to all that have been before, or that may be hereafter: for I would fain for this ſhort Chriſtmas keep open houſe, and give every one ſomething. Let me therefore tell you Jurours, There muſt be no partiality in judgement: but when ye have heard the caſe opened, counſel ſpeak on both ſides, ye know the iſſue to be tried, ye have heard the proof on both ſides, then when ye go together ye have the ſcales of juſtice put into your hands to weigh the evidence, ye cannot but ſee which carries moſt weight, which ſcale goes up and which goes down: Now let not reward, liberall charges, or expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of future kindeneſſes; let not favour, alliance, or neighbourhood, or any ſuch reſpect; let not anger
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:141:12"/>
or malice; let not fear or cowardiſe make the verdict: but for love of God, for love of juſtice, for love of your countrey, for love of your own ſouls do that is right without partiality. But have all Jurours done thus? or will all do thus? Oh no; for how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is it for a Jurour to be prepoſſeſſed of a cauſe, and to reſolve not to go againſt his neighbour, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours friend, his kinſman, his old maſters ſonne, his Lords tenant, and the like; thinking it but a ſmall courteſie and not to be denied, to lend one another an oath in ſuch caſes; and ſo againſt all right do bring in a verdict which makes the Judge amazed, the whole Court aſtoniſhed, and juſtice clean overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and all this by a Suffolk Jury, a place not civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed only, but noted for religion. But what doth ſuch a Jury? Firſt it tells a loud lie, for it's before all the County: next, they call God to witneſſe this lie by falſifying their oath; and as much as lies in them they make him a partie: beſides, they juſtifie the wicked and condemne the juſt: fourthly, they rob and perhaps undo the party againſt whom they go: laſtly (without Gods wonderfull mercy) they caſt away their own ſouls. Oh! what heart bleeds not to ſee ſouls thus thronging to hell by the dozens?</p>
            <p>As for witneſſes, whoſe teſtimony makes the cauſe weighty or light, and who alſo binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſolemnly by oath to ſpeak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, (here's no evaſion) yet how common is it with ſome to be Knights of the poſt, for a ſmall reward to be able to frame an oath of any ſize? yea ſome will do it for a meales meat, and thus deeply tranſgreſſe for a morſell of bread: yea, for a need a man may finde
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:141:13"/>
ſome who will ſwear to things done before they were born. Others for favour and their friends will deſperately ſtretch their conſciences; but, if there be malice, one would wonder at their ſound tales againſt witches and other offenders, and how again they will mince the truth for fear of greatneſſe: but remember, a falſe witneſſe ſhall not go unpuniſht: for God either payes them at the ſtub, by ſhewing ſome ſpeciall judgement upon them; or, if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred (without deep repentance) they have it with intereſt in hell for ever.</p>
            <p>Gods honour and the Kings muſt be freed from violation: for I finde them together in the Text, and ſo I'le keep them in the Application. The ſturdy ſinnes and obſtinate vices of the times againſt Gods law and the Kings, are thoſe for whom juſtice at all hands calls for judgement. I pitch onely upon foure which I take to be the bleeding wounds and running ſores of this Kingdome; all forbidden by the law of God and the King: Theſe are Superſtitious Popery, Blaſphemous Swearing, Profane Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Beaſtly drunkenneſſe. A word of each. Firſt, Popery violates the honour of God; it being inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to each Perſon in the Trinitie: to the <hi>Father,</hi> by attempting an <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> upon the very Commandments of God, by raſing out the ſecond: to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by ſetting up a company of miſerable ſaints for mediatours, and joyning works to his all-ſufficient ſacrifice: to the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> by making the Popes lewd <hi>holineſſe</hi> to be Chriſt his unerring vicar upon earth, as if Chriſt were <hi>Non-reſident</hi> from his Church, when he hath ſaid he will be with it to the end by his Spirit: It is alſo againſt the Kings law and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:141:13"/>
honour; for it reacheth at his Crown, and (if the Catholick cauſe requires) at his life too, by ſetting ſome baſe villain for an Aſſaſſinate, to change his miſcreant life, for the ſacred life of Gods Anointed: and a King thus dead, by them dies an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and accurſed perſon; and the other an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and canonized Martyr. Now the profeſſours of this religion among us, be among the obſtinate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; for few of them will conferre, to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they who will conferre, will not be convicted; or if they be by Scriptures and arguments convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, yet will they not be convinced; and if I had them to ſpeak too, I ſhould have little hope to do them good: yet they ſhall give me leave to bemone their condition. Poore ſouls, (I ſpeak of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſeduced ones) they have no religion but that which is in Feofees hands: and in whoſe hands is it? The Italian proverb tells us, <hi>The worſt of Catholicks are Prieſts, the worſt of Prieſts are made Cardinals, the worſt of Cardinals made Pope.</hi> And the Pope thus bred, is the Feoffee in whom they betruſt all their religion: for they have no Faith but that of the Church, to beleeve as the Church beleeves (a ſhort cut to heaven indeed.) And who is this Church? is it not the Pope vertually, and that upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that he cannot erre? and yet ſome, nay moſt of theſe Popes have been Sodomites; and yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre: all of them have been ambitious Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts; and yet he cannot erre: Some have mixt poiſon with the Sacrament; (and ſo, if there were any ſuch thing as tranſubſtantiation, had poiſoned Chriſt himſelf) and yet he cannot erre: Some have been Hereticks condemned by their ſucceſſours; and yet
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:141:14"/>
he cannot erre: Some have been Sorcerers and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancers; and yet he cannot erre: He muſt not be reproved, though he ſhould carry millions of ſouls to hell; and yet he cannot erre: One was a woman; and yet he cannot erre: ſometimes there have been Popes and Antipopes together; and yet he cannot erre: ſometime none at all for divers yeares together; &amp; then onely he could not erre. Behold your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, your Faith, your Church, your God in this your Pope, O Catholicks: Poore ſouls, who bear ſo great adventure in ſo leaking a bottom! If theſe things be ſo (and many here preſent know them undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to be ſo) may we not wonder that ſo many are ſeduced upon theſe grounds? but more, that this hereſie ſhould dayly gather ſtrength and number, and what the reaſon ſhould be of the increaſe of Popery? We have good laws againſt them, but they (like our arms) lie up and ruſt. What, do we not ſtill ſmell the gunpowder, beyond which is <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> no man knowing what is between it and hell? do we not know that for theſe ſixtie yeares and more, they have laboured of nothing ſo much as the undoing of their deareſt countrey, which bred and bare them? Bleſſed be God, we have the law in our hands: for had they it in theirs, their little finger would be heavier upon us, then our whole body is upon them. Judges complain for want of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: what, have the Juſtices none in their diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? or do their lands lie too neare together? ſome others complain, they have promoted, and nothing done. Well, I beſeech you, all joyn to put thoſe laws in execution: but (alas!) they are put rather to execution, like thoſe excellent proclamations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:141:14"/>
Prieſts and Jeſuites; which once proclaimed, no more is done, but to nail them to a poſt, and there they hang like malefactours. But remember, <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you all, that Sarah and her ſonne can have no ſecuritie, unleſſe Hagar and her brat be beaten out of doores. Superſtitious Papiſts will not obey the law of God, nor the Kings law; therefore <hi>Let them have judgement without delay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods law and the Kings is violated by blaſphemous ſwearing. Our land hath mourned by plague, peſtilence, and famine; and why not for oaths? is there any thing dearer to God, then his name? hath he not ſet a penalty upon the breach of this commandment more then upon any other? and yet how ſavagely and barbarouſly is it kicked, ſpurned, toſſed, and blaſphemed by all ſorts, from Nobles to Peaſants! I ſee and obſerve that Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen, give over any faſhion when it grows common: oh that they would give over ſwearing, ſeeing every clown and carter, every hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and tapſter will ſwear compleatly. We know alſo the Kings law againſt this ſinne; but men will not ſee it executed, but will ſuffer that infamy put upon Gods name, that they will not endure in their own. What, my good name, ſaith every one? oh, you touch my free-hold: nay, men will not endure their Father, Maſter, or Friend to be touched in his name, but will draw their ſwords in the quarrell: and is not Gods name as deare to him, as thine to thee? or is not God more to thee, then Friend, Maſter, or Father? Suffer not then ſo great diſhonour done to his name; but carry every oath to the Juſtice, and let him pay his twelve pence, a petty penalty indeed for ſo great
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:141:15"/>
a ſinne, but yet if duely executed, I preſume by this time many great men had been reformed, or elſe ſworn out of all their living. But alas (ſay ſome) the Juſtices themſelves will ſwear ſometimes: Oh! ſay not ſo: what the keepers of the vines not to keep their own vines? to be the guardians of the Kings law, and themſelves to be breakers of it? I dare not entertain ſuch a thought of many of them: but if any do break this law, I charge him upon his oath to execute the law upon himſelf; ſeeing he never ſweares, but in the hearing of a Juſtice of peace. To end this point, I can never ſufficiently bewail the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the preſent and ſucceeding generation, ſeeing now oaths do even ſtrive for number with words, and children in the ſtreets can no ſooner ſpeak then ſwear. To all ſwearers therefore I ſay, Why will ye hazard Gods threatned diſpleaſure for a ſinne ſo needleſſe, and yet ſo dangerous? To others I ſay, ſuffer none to vomit and belch out oaths in thy hearing, without penaltie of the Kings law. Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſwearers do violate Gods law and the Kings; therefore <hi>Let them have judgement without delay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, Gods and the Kings law is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by profane ſabbath-breaking: for God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this commandment between the firſt and ſecond table, like the common ſenſe between the exteriour and interiour ſenſes, as being uſefull to both: for without it, pietie to God and charitie to man cannot be ſuch as they ſhould. Hence it is that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the profaning his day, the everſion of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as appeares in many places. We may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture what care man ought to have in the keeping, by the Lords care in the deliverie of it, for he ſent it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:141:15"/>
not abroad naked, like many of the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; but clothed it (as Joſeph) with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of divers colours: it is in words larger, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons fuller then any of the reſt. Firſt, there is a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi> for fear of forgetfullneſſe; <hi>Remember.</hi> Next, the bounty of God, for fear of repining; <hi>Six daies ſhalt thou &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, the ſoveraignty of it, for fear of contemning; <hi>It is the ſabbath of the Lord &amp;c.</hi> Fourthly, the generality of it, for fear of miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; <hi>Thou, and thy ſonne &amp;c.</hi> Fifthly, the Lords example and benediction, for fear of exception. Thus you ſee it fortified with an high fence, that it might be made ſtrong for his own ſelf, &amp; like mount Zion, not to be moved. We are not ignorant alſo of the Kings pious laws in force for the obſervation of it; yet in deſpite of both, in many places, how do peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple grudge to give God the ſeventh part of their life? at leaſt they will incroach a little, having ſome odde job or other to do on that day: nay, (alas) what marketting, what drinking and bowſing, what fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and dauncing, and generally what profaning this day almoſt every where is to be ſeen? in ſomuch that this day brings forth more ſinne then any, (<hi>I</hi> think I may ſay) then all the dayes of the week: and if any Turk or Pagan ſhould come into many places among us, &amp; ask the reaſon why we leave our work, and wear our beſt clothes on that day; and anſwer ſhould be made, We keep this day holy to our God: it were enough to make him forſwear Chriſtianity, or giving their names to that God, who is content to be ſerved on ſuch a faſhion. But ye know your charge, Let then profane ſabbath-breakers alſo <hi>have judgement without delay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:141:16"/>Laſtly, beaſtly drunkenneſſe is alſo againſt Gods and the Kings law.</p>
            <p>Gods law every where pronounces woes againſt this ſinne, denouncing ruine to bodie, goods, and good name; yea by name excluding drunkards out of his kingdome. The truth is, a drunkard puts himſelf in the ready way to break every commandment; for when he ceaſeth to be himſelf, he is in a fair poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie to be any thing; for drunkenneſſe never goes alone, but is attended by the black guard of other ſinnes, as oaths, railings, mutinies, quarrells, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, murders, chambering, wantonneſſe, ribaldrie, adulteries, and what not? ſo that, in mine opinion, a man muſt firſt hood-winck his charitie, before it can lead him to beleeve a drunkard not to be every way vitious: and is it not a common plea with men of this rank, to excuſe theſe and other great ſinnes, by ſaying, they were not themſelves? Thus is it againſt Gods law.</p>
            <p>The Kings law hath alſo wholeſomely provided againſt this overflowing ſinne, as we know; but yet (maugre them both) with what a deluge of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe is this land overflown? It is grown a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Epidemicall in court and countrey, city and town; yea our people are grown artificiall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in this ſinne, to drink the three Outs, to drink by the dozen, by the yard, and by the buſhell; oh monſtrous, even in name! how much more in practiſe inſomuch that it ſeems to me, the Germanes are like to loſe their charter. In Rome there was a ſtreet called <hi>vicus ſobrius,</hi> becauſe there was never an ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in it: I think there is ſcarce ſuch a ſtreet to be found in England. There is a ſtory in Athenaeus,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:141:16"/>
which gives us a lively picture of the behaviour of drunkards at their meetings: The roaring boyes, meeting at an alehouſe, ſat by it drinking ſo long, till their brains were ſo ſteeped, that they imagined the room wherein they were to be a ſhip toſſed in the ſea, the fancied ſtorm ſtill increaſing as the cups em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied; ſo that at laſt they begin to fear ſhipwrack; wherefore to make the ſhip lighter they heave the pots, plate, furniture, and all that comes to hand out at the windows, as if it were over board: And thus do good-fellows at theſe meetings throw the houſe out at windows, and keep quarter, to the diſhonour of Gods and the Kings law; and yet the Juſtice is every where milde, &amp; the drunkard merry: I beſeech your Honours therefore charge the Juſtices to abridge the exceſſive number of alehouſes, the ſhops of drunkenneſſe, and that they charge the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles better to look to the demeanour of the reſt.</p>
            <p>And if I may not be heard, let Juſtice ſpeak; ſhe ſaith thus, I have heard Popery, ſwearing, ſabbath-breaking, and drunkenneſſe, all convicted as diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to Gods and the Kings law; I charge you then, <hi>Let them have judgement</hi>; otherwiſe, I take you all guilty of the ſame offences, though not by <hi>committing,</hi> yet by <hi>conniving.</hi> It's true indeed, <hi>Every fat ſhall ſtand on its own bottom,</hi> that is, every one ſhall anſwer for his own ſinnes; yet take heed, leſt we miſtake the account of our own ſinnes; ſeeing thoſe are not to be reckoned our own onely, which are ſo by <hi>perpetration,</hi> but thoſe alſo which are ours by <hi>participation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Juſtice calls alſo for <hi>expedition</hi> in judgement, and deſires that poore mens cauſes might firſt be heard,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:141:17"/>
and not put off to the laſt, for they can worſt bear the charge of longer delay: but ſhe complains that the poore mans cauſe lies like the palſie-man at the pool of Betheſda, where the motion is not made but by an Angel, and ſo the ſtronger ſtep in before them.</p>
            <p>I end with one word for my ſelf; in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Deuteronomie, at the fifth verſe, the Lord appointing cities of refuge for ſuch to flee unto, who had unawares killed his neighbour, doth inſtance in the hewer of wood: who (if while he is felling the tree, the head of the ax ſlippeth from the helve, and ſtriketh his neighbour, ſo that he dieth) ſhall flee to the next citie of refuge, and live: I have been hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Lords ſanctuary, and felling down the huge trees of the ſinnes forenamed: if the head hath ſlipt from the helve, and hurt any; my next citie of refuge is your charitable conſtruction and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interpretation. And even ſo I commit you to God, to whoſe Majeſtie let us all pray, that this Aſſiſes may be much advantage; to the honour of Gods law and the Kings, Amen.</p>
