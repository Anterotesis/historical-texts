         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

MVCH HONOVRED
Friend, Sir Christopher Sibthorp,
Knight, one of his Majesties Iustices
of his Court of chiefe place
in IRELAND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>WORTHY SIR:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Confesse, I somewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to bee of your minde,
that if unto the authorities
drawn out of Scriptures and
Fathers (which are common
to us with others) a true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoverie
were added of that Religion which
anciently was professed in this Kingdome;
it might prove a speciall motive to induce
my poore country-men to consider a little
<pb facs="tcp:19565:3"/>
better of the old and true way from whence
they have hitherto been mis-ledd. Yet on the
one side, that saying in the Gospel runneth
much in my minde;<note n="a" place="margin">Luke 16. 31.</note> 
               <hi>If they heare not Moses
and the Prophets, neyther will they be perswaded,
though one rose from the dead:</hi> and on the other,
that heavie iudgement mentioned by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle;
<note n="b" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>because they received not the love of the
truth, that they might bee saved, God shall send
them strong delusion, that they should beleeve lyes.</hi>
The woefull experience whereof, wee may
see daily before our eyes in this poore nation:
where, such as are slow of heart to beleeve
the saving truth of God delivered by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles, doe with all greedinesse
imbrace, and with a most strange kinde of
credulitie entertaine those lying Legends,
wherewith their Monkes and Friars in these
latter daies have polluted the religion and
lives of our ancient Saints.</p>
            <p>I doe not deny but that in this Countrey,
as well as in others, corruptions did creep in
by little and little, before the Divell was let
loose to procure that seduction which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
so generally in these last times: but as
farre as I can collect by such records of the
former ages as have come unto my hands
<pb facs="tcp:19565:3"/>
eyther <hi>manuscript</hi> or <hi>printed)</hi> the religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by the ancient Bishops, Priests, Monks,
and other Christians in this land, was for
substance the very same with that which
now by publike authoritie is maintained
therein, against the forraine doctrin brought
in thither in later times by the Bishop of
Romes followers. I speake of the more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
points of doctrine, that are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
betwixt the Church of Rome and
us at this day; by which only we must iudge,
whether of both sides hath departed from
the religion of our Ancestors: not of matters
of inferiour note, much lesse of ceremonies
and such other things as appertaine to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
rather than to the doctrine of the
Church.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is knowne unto the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that the name of <hi>Scoti</hi> in those elder
times (whereof we treate) was common to
the inhabitants of the <hi>greater</hi> and the <hi>lesser</hi>
Scotland (for so heretofore they have beene
distinguished) that is to say, of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
the famous colonie deduced from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Albania:</hi> I will not follow the example of
those that have of late laboured to make dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension
betwixt the daughter and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:19565:4"/>
but account of them both, as of the same
people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tros Rutulusve fuat, nullo discrimine habebo.</hi>
The religion doubtlesse received by both,
was the selfe same; and differed little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from that which was maintained by
their neighbours the <hi>Britons:</hi> as by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the evidences that remaine, both of the
one nation and of the other, in the ensuing
discourse more fully shall appeare.</p>

into common use among the learned, that the

               <hi>the Hebrew verity</hi> (for
so with S. <hi>Hierome</hi> doth he style it:) and in the New

he readeth as wee doe, <hi>There is difference betweene a
wife and a virgin;</hi> and not as the Rhemists have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
it out of the Latin. Rom. 12. 19. hee readeth,
<hi>Non vosmetipsos vindicantes,</hi> not avenging your
selves: where the vulgar Latin hath corruptly, <hi>Non
vosmetipsos defendentes,</hi> not defending your selves.
Rom. 3. 4. where the Rhemists translate according
to the Latin, <hi>God is true:</hi> hee sheweth that in the
Greeke copies it is found, <hi>Let God be true,</hi> or, <hi>let God
be made true.</hi> Rom. 15. 17. hee noteth that the Latin
bookes have put <hi>glory</hi> for <hi>gloriation.</hi> Galat. 1. 16.
where the Rhemists have according to the Latin, <hi>I
condescended not to flesh &amp; bloud:</hi> he saith, that <hi>in Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co

out of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> whom hee followeth) the
Greek hath it better, <hi>I conferred not.</hi> Rom. 8. 3. where
the Rhemists say of God, according to the Latin
translation, <hi>that of sinne</hi> hee <hi>damned sinne in the flesh:
Sedulius</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>veriùs habetur apud Graecos,</hi> it
is <hi>more truly</hi> expressed in the Greeke bookes; that
<hi>for sinne</hi> he <hi>damned sinne in the flesh.</hi> Lastly, where the
Rhemists translate after their Latin copie, Gal. 5. 9.
<hi>A little leaven corrupteth the whole paste:</hi> hee saith it

as it is <hi>ill</hi> read in the Latin bookes. So where

               <hi>Claudius,</hi>
following St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> affirmeth that it is better in

            <p>Thus did <hi>Sedulius</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi> two of our most
famous Divines deliver the doctrine of free will and
grace, faith and workes, the Law and the Gospel, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
and Adoption; no lesse agreeably to the
faith which is at this day professed in the reformed
Churches, that to that which they themselves recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the more ancient Doctors, whom they did
follow therein. Neither doe wee in our judgement
one whit differ from them, when they teach that
<note n="l" place="margin">Hoc contra illos agit, qui solam fidem posse sufficere dicunt. <hi>Sedul. in Ephes.</hi> 5. Non ergo sola ad vitam sufficit fides. <hi>Claud in Gal. 5. bis.</hi> Haec sententia illos revincit, qui solam fidem ad salutem ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum suarum sufficere arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trantur. <hi>Id. ibid. in fine.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>faith alone is not sufficient to life.</hi> For when it is said,
that <hi>Faith alone justifieth:</hi> this word <hi>alone</hi> may bee
conceived to have relation either to the former part
of the sentence, which in the Schooles they terme
the <hi>Subject;</hi> or to the latter, which they call the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate.</hi>
Being referred to the former, the meaning
will be; that such a faith as is <hi>alone</hi> (that is to say, not
accompanied with other vertues) doth justifie: and
in this sense wee utterly disclaime the assertion. But
being referred to the latter, it maketh this sense; that
faith is it which <hi>alone</hi> or onely justifieth: and in this
meaning onely doe we defend that proposition; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
still by <hi>faith,</hi> not a dead carkase thereof
(for how should the just bee able to <hi>live</hi> by a <hi>dead</hi>
faith?) but a true and lively faith,<note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>which worketh by
love.</hi> For as it is a certaine truth, that among all the
members of the body, the eye is the onely instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereby we see; and yet it is as true also, that
the eye being alone, and separated from the rest of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19565:13"/>
the members, is dead, and for that cause doth neither
see onely, not see at all: so these two sayings like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
may stand well enough together, that among
all the vertues in the foule, faith is the onely instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereby wee lay hold upon Christ for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;
and yet, that faith being alone, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
from the society of other graces, <hi>is dead in it
selfe,</hi> (as St.<note n="n" place="margin">Iam. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh) and in that respect can
neither only justifie, nor justifie at all.</p>

            <p>I dispute not of the credit of these particular pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages:
it is sufficient, that the authors from whom

of those times, whereof wee now doe treate. For
thereby it is plaine enough (and if it be not, it shall
elsewhere be made yet more plaine) that in those el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
dayes it was an usuall thing, to make prayers and
oblations for the rest of those soules, which were
not doubted to have beene in glorie: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that neither the <hi>Commemoration</hi> nor the
<hi>Praying for the dead,</hi> nor the <hi>Requiem Masses</hi> of that
age, have any necessary relation to the beleefe of
<hi>Purgatory.</hi> The lesson therefore which <hi>Claudius</hi>

               </note> is chiefly done, <hi>for the

               <hi>the severall elements be

of the Virgin or now is in heaven: but the bread into his
body apart, as betrayed, broken, and given for us; the
wine into his bloud apart, as shed out of his bodie for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes and dedication fo the new Testament,
which bee conditions of his person as hee was in sacrifice
and oblation.</hi> But our ancestours, in the use of their

selfe, who was the foundresse of the monasterie of

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19565:24"/>
about to <hi>drinke out of the Chalice,</hi> at the time of her
receiving of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> which they that list to
looke after, may finde in the collections of <hi>Capgrave,
Surius,</hi> and such like.</p>
            <p>But, you will say; these testimonies that have
beene alledged, make not so much for us, in proving
the use of the <hi>communion under both kindes,</hi> as they
make against us, in confirming the opinion of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation:</hi>
seeing they all specifie the receiving,
not of <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> but of the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> of
<hi>Christ.</hi> I answer, that forasmuch as <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe
at the first institution of his holy Supper did say ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly;
<hi>This is my body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my bloud:</hi> hee
deserveth not the name of a <hi>Christian,</hi> that will que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the truth of that saying, or refuse to speake in
that language, which hee hath heard his Lord and
Master use before him. The question onely is, in
what sense, and after what manner, these things must
bee conceived to bee his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud.</hi> Of which
there needed to be little question: if men would bee
pleased to take into their consideration these two
things; which were never doubted of by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and have most evident ground in the context of
the Gospel. <hi>First,</hi> that the <hi>subject</hi> of those sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
propositions delivered by our Saviour (that is to
say, the demonstrative particle THIS) can have
reference to no other substance, but that which hee
then held in his sacred hands, namely, <hi>bread</hi> &amp; <hi>wines</hi>
which are of so different a nature from the <hi>body</hi> and
<hi>bloud</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> that the one cannot possibly in <hi>proper</hi>
sense be said to be the other; as the light of common
reason doth force the Romanists themselves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19565:25"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that in the <hi>Predicate,</hi> or latter part of
the same propositions, there is not mention made
only of <hi>Christs body</hi> and <hi>bloud;</hi> but of his <hi>body broken,</hi>
and his <hi>bloud shed:</hi> to shew, that his <hi>body</hi> is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
here apart, not <hi>as it was borne of the Virgin, or
now is in heaven,</hi> but as it was <hi>broken</hi> and crucified for
us; and his <hi>bloud</hi> likewise apart, not as running in
his veines, but <hi>as shed out of his body;</hi> which the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>
have told us to be <hi>conditions of his person, as hee
was in sacrifice and oblation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lest wee should imagine, that his body were
otherwise to bee considered in the <hi>sacrament</hi> than in
the <hi>sacrifice;</hi> in the one <hi>alive,</hi> as it is now in heaven,
in the other <hi>dead,</hi> as it was offered upon the Crosse:
the Apostle putteth the matter out of doubt, that not
onely the minister in offering, but also the people
in receiving, even<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 26.</note> 
               <hi>as often as they eate this bread, and
drinke this cup, doe shew the Lords death untill hee come.</hi>
Our elders surely, that held the <hi>sacrifice</hi> to bee <hi>given</hi>
and <hi>received</hi> (for so we have heard themselves speak)
as well as <hi>offered;</hi> did not consider otherwise of
<hi>Christ</hi> in the sacrament, than <hi>as hee was in sacrifice and
oblation.</hi> If here therefore, <hi>Christs body</hi> be presented
as broken and livelesse, and his <hi>bloud</hi> as shed forth
and severed from his body; and it be most certaine,
that there are no such things now <hi>really</hi> existent any
where (as is confessed on all hands:) then must it
follow necessarily, that the bread and wine are not
converted into these things <hi>really.</hi> The<note n="q" place="margin">Rhem. in Mat. 26. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Rhemists</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
tell us, that when the Church doth offer and
sacrifice <hi>Christ</hi> daily; <hi>hee in mysterie and sacrament
dyeth.</hi> Further than this they durst not goe: for if
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19565:25"/>
they had said, hee dyed <hi>really;</hi> they should thereby
not only make themselves daily killers of <hi>Christ,</hi> but
also directly crosse that principle of the Apostle,
Rom. 6. 9. <hi>Christ being raised from the dead dyeth no
more.</hi> If then the body of <hi>Christ</hi> in the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> be propounded as <hi>dead</hi> (as hath
been shewed) and dye it cannot <hi>really,</hi> but onely in
<hi>mysterie and sacrament:</hi> how can it be thought to bee
contained under the outward elements, otherwise
than <hi>in sacrament and mysterie?</hi> and such as in times
past were said to have received the <hi>sacrifice</hi> from the
hand of the Priest; what other <hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> could
they expect to receive therein, but such as was suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

himselfe unto us to seduce us, being suborned with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits

said of Simon Magus that he did flye in the ayre:<note n="t" place="margin">Neque signa vos terreant, tanquam per Spiritum facta: quia hoc &amp; Salvator praemonuit. <hi>Id. in 2 Thess.</hi> 2.</note> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that signes should terrifie us, as done by the Spirit;
because that our Saviour also hath given us warning of
this before-hand. (<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24, 25.) <hi>Secondly, that</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Hic ostenditur, crescente fide signa cessare: quando fidelium causâ danda esse praedicantur. <hi>Id. in 1 Corinth.</hi> 14.</note> the faith having increased, miracles were to cease; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch

               </note> now when
the number of the faithfull is growne, there bee many
within the holy Church that retaine the life of vertues,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19565:40"/>
and yet have not those signes of vertues: because a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle

the saying of the Master of the Gentiles; Languages are
for a signe, not to the faithfull but to infidels. (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.

dwelleth at Armagh: because we will not obey their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but will alwaies bee under your governement.</hi>
Whereby we may see, that as the <hi>Ostmans</hi> were desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to sever themselves from the <hi>Irish,</hi> and to bee
esteemed <hi>Normans</hi> rather: so the Irish Bishops on
the other side, howsoever they digested in some sort
the recourse which they had to <hi>Lanfranc</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme</hi>
(who were two of the most famous men in

desirous to hold all good correspondence) yet could
they not well brooke this continuation of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance

upon a Metropolitan of another king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
which they conceived to be somewhat dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie

<hi>Limrick</hi> (for they also had one <hi>Patricke</hi> consecrated
Bishop unto them by <hi>Theobald</hi> Archbishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury)
did ever after that time cease to have any
relation unto the See of Canterbury.</p>
            <p>And now to goe forward: as the Kings and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this land in those elder times kept the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of their Archbishops and Bishops in their

               <hi>Whensoever any cause that is very difficult, and
unknown unto all the Iudges of the Scottish nations, shall
arise; it is rightly to bee referred to the See of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of the Irish (to wit, Patrick) and to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Prelate thereof. But if there, by him and his
wisemen, a cause of this nature cannot easily be made up:
wee have decreed, it shall bee sent to the See Apostolick;
that is to say, to the chaire of the Apostle Peter, which hath
the authoritie of the City of Rome.</hi> Onely this I will
say, that as it is most likely, that St. <hi>Patrick</hi> had a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
regard unto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence
he was sent for the conversion of this Iland: so if I
my selfe had lived in his daies, for the resolution of a
doubtful question I should as willingly have listened
to the judgement of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to the
determination of any Church in the whole world;
so reverend an estimation have I of the integritie of
that Church, as it stood in those good daies. But that
St. <hi>Patrick</hi> was of opinion, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
was sure ever afterward to continue in that good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and that there was a perpetuall priviledge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
unto that See, that it should never erre in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or that the Popes sentences were alway to bee
held as infallible Oracles; that will I never beleeve:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19565:49"/>
sure I am, that my countrey-men after him were of a
farre other beleefe; who were so farre from submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves in this sort to whatsoever should
proceed from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they oftentimes
stood out against it, when they had little cause so to
doe. For proofe whereof I need to seeke no further,
than to those very allegations which have been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
urged for maintenance of the supremacie of the
Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Countrey.</p>

               <hi>Was not Ireland among other Countries

               <hi>All the Bishops that were in Ireland, with most
earnest study, rose up jointly for the defence of the Three
Chapters. And when they perceived that the Church of

they departed from her, and clave to the rest of the
schismatickes, that were eyther in Italy, or in Africke, or
in other countries, animated with that vaine confidence,
that they did stand for the Catholicke faith, while they
defended those things that were concluded in the Councell
of Chalcedon.</hi>

the Northren Irish, and by the Picts and Britons, as soon

            <p>To reduce the <hi>Irish</hi> unto conformity with the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this point, Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> (the
<hi>first</hi> of that name) directed his letters unto them:
<note n="e" place="margin">Exhortans, ne paucitatem suam in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis terrae fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus constituta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sapientiorem antiquis sive modernis, quae per Orbem ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae erant, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti Ecclesiis ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimarent: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve contra Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chales compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, &amp; decreta synodalium to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Orbis Pontificum aliud Pascha celebrarent. <hi>Bed. lib. 2. hist. cap.</hi> 19.</note> 
               <hi>Exhortintg them, that they would not esteeme their own
paucity, seated in the utmost borders of the earth, more
wise than the ancient or moderne Churches of Christ
through the whole world; and that they would not cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
another Easter contrary to the Paschall computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the Synodall decrees of the Bishops of the whole
world.</hi> and shortly after, the Clergie of <hi>Rome</hi> (as wee
have said) upon the death of <hi>Severinus,</hi> wrote other
letters unto them to the same effect. Now where <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sullevan</hi>
avoucheth, that <hi>the common custome used by the
Church in celebrating the feast of the Lords resurrection
was alwaies observed by the Southerne Irish;</hi> and now
<hi>embraced also by the Northren, together with the Picts
and Britons (who received the faith from Irish Doctors)
when they had knowledge given them of the rite of the
Church of Rome:</hi> in all this (according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wont) he speaketh never a true word. For ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the <hi>Southerne Irish</hi> alwayes observe the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of Easter commonly received abroad: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the <hi>Northren Irish,</hi> nor the <hi>Picts,</hi> nor the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi>
many yeeres after this admonition given by the

them. to speake nothing of his folly in saying, that
the <hi>Britons</hi> received the faith from the <hi>Irish:</hi> when
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19565:52"/>
the contrary is so well knowne, that the <hi>Irish</hi> rather

               <hi>Britons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the common custome of celebrating the
time of <hi>Easter</hi> was not alwaies observed by the
<hi>Southerne Irish,</hi> may appeare by those words of <hi>Bede,</hi>
in the <hi>third</hi> booke of his history and the <hi>third</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>Porrò gentes Scottorum, quae in australibus Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae

<hi>the nations of the Scots, that dwelt in the Southern
parts of Ireland, did learne to observe Easter after the
canonicall manner, upon the admonition of the Bishop of
Rome:</hi> it is evident, that before that admonition
they did observe it after another manner. The word
<hi>jamdudum,</hi> which <hi>Bede</hi> here useth, is taken among
authors oftentimes in contrary senses: either to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<hi>a great while since,</hi> or else, <hi>but lately,</hi> or <hi>erewhile,</hi>
In the former sense it must bee here taken, if it have
relation to the time wherein <hi>Bede</hi> did write his
book: and in the latter also it may be taken, if it be
referred to the time whereof he treateth, (which is
the more likely opinion) namely to the comming of
Bishop <hi>Aidan</hi> into <hi>England;</hi> which fell out about
halfe a yeere, after that <hi>Honorius</hi> had sent his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitorie
letters to the <hi>Irish.</hi> who, as hee was the first
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> we can reade of, that admonished
them to reforme their rite of keeping the time of
<hi>Easter:</hi> so that the <hi>Irish</hi> also much about the same
time conformed themselves herein to the <hi>Romane</hi>
usage, may thus be manifested.</p>
            <p>When Bishop <hi>Aidan</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> from the

of the citie of Yorke, Oswi and Alhfrid his sonne

of Ecclesiasticall orders meeting together at the monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which is called Streaneshel, in the presence of Hilde
the most godly mother of that abbey, in presence also of
the Kings and the two Bishops Colman and Aegelberht,
inquiry was made touching the observation of Easter,
what was most right to bee held: whether Easter should
bee kept according to the custome of the Brittous and the
Scots and all the Northren part, upon the Lords day that
came from the <hi>XIIII.</hi> day of the Moone untill the <hi>XX.</hi> or
whether it were better, that Easter Sunday should bee ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
from the <hi>XV.</hi> day of the Moone untill the <hi>XXI.</hi>
after the manner of the See Apostolick. Time was given
unto Bishop Colman in the first place, as it was fit, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19565:56"/>
his reason in the audience of all. Who with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
minde made his answer, and said. Our fathers
and their predecessors, who were manifestly inspired by
the holy Ghost, as Columkille was, did ordaine that Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
should be celebrated upon the Lords day that fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>XIIII.</hi> Moone; following the example of Iohn the
Apostle and Evangelist, who leaned upon the breast of
our Lord at his last Supper, and was called the lover of
the Lord. Hee celebrated Easter upon the <hi>XIIII.</hi> day
of the Moone: and wee with the same confidence cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the same, as his Disciples Polycarpus and others
did; neyther dare wee for our parts, neyther will wee

you shall have it from <hi>Iohannes Sarisburien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
who was most inward with Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

to the illustrious King of England Henry the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and gave it to bee possessed by right of inheritance:
as his owne letters doe testifie unto this day. For all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
of ancient right, are said to belong to the Church
of Rome, by the donation of Constantine, who founded &amp;
endowed the same.</hi> But will you see, what a goodly
title here is, in the meane time? <hi>First,</hi> the Donation
of <hi>Constantine</hi> hath been long since discovered to be
a notorious forgerie, and is rejected by all men of
judgement as a senslesse fiction. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in the whole
context of this forged <hi>Donation</hi> I find mention made
of <hi>Ilands</hi> in one place only:<note n="o" place="margin">Per nostram Imperialem iussionem sacram, tam in Oriente quàm in Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidente, vel etiam septentrionali &amp; meridianâ plagâ, videlicèt in Iudaeâ, Graeciâ, Asiâ, Thraciâ, Aphricâ &amp; Italiâ, vel diversis Insulis nostrâ largitate eis libertatem concessimus: eâ prorsus ratione, ut per manus beatissimi patris nostri Sylvestri Pontificis successorumque eius omnia disponantur. <hi>Edict.

<hi>Iudaea, Graecia, Asia, Thracia,</hi> and <hi>Aphrica;</hi> which use
not to passe in the account of St. <hi>Peters</hi> temporall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> it doth not appeare, that <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
himselfe had any interest in the Kingdome of
<hi>Ireland:</hi> how then could hee conferre it upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

cannot be proved by any sufficient testimonie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie.

to bee formerly made unto the Bishop of Rome and
his successors. Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> therefore, and <hi>Iohn</hi> of

reigne with him; and as thou hast received a temporall
kingdome from him, thou shouldest also receive from him
an everlasting. For the kingdome of this Childe is not of
this world; but by him it is that men do reign in this world.
He is the Wisedome of God, which saith in the Proverbs:
By mee Kings reigne. This Childe is the Word of God:
this Childe is the Power and Wisedome of God: If thou
canst, thinke against the Wisedome of God: thou workest
thine owne destruction, and dost not know it. For thou
by no meanes shouldest have had thy kingdome, unlesse
thou hadst received it from that Childe which now is

            <p>As for the Censure of the Doctors of <hi>Salamanca</hi>
and <hi>Vallodilid:</hi> our Nobility and Gentry, by the
faithfull service which at that time they performed
unto the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> did make a reall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of it. Of whose fidelity in this kinde I am
so well perswaded, that I doe assure my selfe, that
neither the names of <hi>Franciscus Zumel</hi> and <hi>Alphonsus
Curiel</hi> (how great Schoole-men soever they were)
nor of the <hi>Fathers of the Society (Iohannes de Ziguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,

<hi>Pope</hi> himselfe, upon whose sentence they wholly
ground their Resolution; eyther then was or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
will be of any force, to remove them one whit
from the allegeance and duty which they doe owe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19565:71"/>
unto their King and Country. Nay I am in good
hope, that their loyall mindes will so farre distaste
that evill lesson, which those great <hi>Rabbies</hi> of theirs
would have them learne; that it will teach them to
unlearne another bad lesson, wherewith they have
