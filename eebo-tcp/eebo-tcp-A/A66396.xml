            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p n="1">
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. How we can prove the Matter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be true?</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 4. How we prove theſe Books that are now extant, and received by the Chriſtian Church as Canonical, to be thoſe very Books?</p>
            <p>I have already Treated of the Two former, and ſhall now take the Two latter into Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>Where we may obſerve ſomewhat as to the Writers, and then as to Inſpiration.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62573:4"/>
1. As to the Writers; of whom we may reckon Three ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Merely Human; ſuch as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks of, that out of a good and pious intent, <hi>took in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note>
               <hi>hand to ſet forth in order a declaration of thoſe things which were moſt ſurely believed.</hi> And this may be done without any material Error by Perſons duly qualified for it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Thoſe that had what they wrote imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dictated, or at leaſt approved by ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as were inſpired. So <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith that the <note place="margin">Hiſt. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note>Goſpel of St. <hi>Mark</hi> was approved by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s by St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Such as were immediately Inſpired in the writing, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Divine Writers are ſuppoſed to have been.</p>
            <p>Now though the firſt of theſe may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in ordinary caſes, and of good uſe in the extraordinary, where there is no better; yet where the Salvation of Mankind is concerned, there is ſomewhat farther neceſſary, and that is, that the Perſons that write ſhould be aſſiſted and guided by the Holy Spirit of God, or write by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and approbation of thoſe that are Inſpired.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Inſpiration, that is Twofold:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Either when the Matter, Words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Order, are immediately Dictated by God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62573:5"/>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 1, 22.</note> himſelf; as the Decalogue was, and all that was Revealed by Voice; for then it was as Diſcourſe with us.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Or, When Perſons Selected wrote by Direction or Command from God, what was Revealed to them, as to the Matter only, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of Declaration, or Repreſentation.</p>
            <p>In which laſt caſe the Perſons Inſpired took their own way; which is the reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Style and Phraſe between their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Compoſitions; that, for example, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> writ in a lofty courtly Style; and that <hi>Amos,</hi> a Herdſman, writ after a more Ruſtical way. So <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that he writ in a purer and clearer Style, becauſe of his skill in the Greek Tongue.</p>
            <p>Here the Office of the Divine Spirit was to ſuggeſt the Matter, or to repreſent the caſe, to aſſiſt and ſuperviſe, ſo that no Error ſhould be in the Original Copy; though he left each to the liberty of their own way in expreſſing it. As if we were to ſend ſeveral Meſſengers upon the ſame Errand, we deliver the Meſſage to them, and tell them what they are to ſay; but leave every one of them to expreſs it as they think fit, and as they are able: Each of which is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wiſe Servant, though he keeps not exactly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62573:5"/>
to the very words of his Maſter, and all agree in the drift and ſubſtance, though they differ in the expreſſion or circumſtance. So it is in the Evangeliſts, where they all agree in the material parts of the Hiſtory, though they differ often in the words, and ſometimes, perhaps, in ſome minute paſſages relating to it.</p>
            <p>In one or other of theſe two ſenſes, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture may be ſaid to be wrote by Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; that is, either by immediate and verbal Suggeſtion, or by Direction: And this I ſhall now endeavour to prove, by anſwering the Third Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. How we do prove the Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which contain the matter of Revelation, to have been of Divine Inſpiration?</p>
            <p>In proceeding upon this I ſhall premiſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the proper courſe for proving the Divine Authority of the Scripture, is to begin with the Matter, abſtracted from the Books, (as I have already done) and then to proceed from thence to the Books.</p>
            <p>And therefore they begin at the wrong end, that would diſprove the truth of the Revelation, or Matter contained in Scripture, by ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as they make from the Writing, and the Books. For the Matter ſtands upon a proof and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62573:6"/>
evidence of its own (as I have ſhewed) and will ſtand, though the written Word, or Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſhould fail of ſupporting its own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>Therefore thoſe that will venture upon diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Revelation, muſt in reaſon begin with the Matter; let them there try their skill, and call in queſtion the proof by which that is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. But this we have already prevented, by having proved the Matter of Scripture to have been of Divine Inſpiration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though there ſeems not to be ſo clear and full a proof for the Inſpiration of the Books, as there is for the Matter, ſince the Matter has the utmoſt atteſtation it is capable of, <hi>viz.</hi> Miracles; but there were no Miracles wrought to prove theſe Books to have been of Divine Inſpiration, <note place="margin">Serm. V. p. 12.</note>(as has been before obſerved): Yet if we prove that the Books were written by Inſpired Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that what they Wrote is the ſame with what they Taught, it is equivalent, and much of the ſame Force and Authority.</p>
            <p>For what need was there of Miracles to prove the Books to be written by Inſpiration, when the Perſons writing them were Inſpired, and that what they wrote is the ſame with what they taught, and when what they taught was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62573:6"/>
by the Miracles which they wrought?</p>
            <p>Therefore while the Authors were in being, there needed no Miracles to prove theſe Writings to be theirs, when they themſelves aſſerted them ſo to be: And after their deceaſe we have as much reaſon to believe the Scriptures which they wrote to have been of Divine Inſpiration, as what they taught to be a Revelation; both now depending upon the like Evidence, that is, Teſtimony, as to which we have no more proof of the Matter, than we have of the Books.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From hence it follows, That not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture to have been of Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is in effect to reject and deny the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation therein contained: The Scripture being the beſt, and in the preſent circumſtances of Mankind, the only means left for the conveyance of it; I ſay, in the preſent circumſtances, it is the only means; for when the circumſtances were other than they are now, or have been for Sixteen hundred Years and upwards, there was then no ſuch abſolute need of a written Word: When the Inſtructors of Mankind had their Lives protracted to a vaſt extent, as it was with the Patriarch's of Old; or when there were Inſpired Perſons alive to teach and rectify any miſtakes that might ariſe and diſturb the Peace of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62573:7"/>
Church; as it was in the times of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But when things fell into an ordinary courſe, and that fallible Perſons (as all afterwards were) might miſtake in their reports of Doctrine, &amp;c. and the weak memories of others not retain what they had been taught, and that the inſincere would wreſt what was taught to ſerve their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe deſigns; the caſe being thus alter'd from extraordinary to ordinary, ſo was the means of conveyance. And God, that committed the Divine Oracles to be taught by Perſons whom he thought fit to inſpire, employed the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to commit that Revelation to writing for the future Preſervation of it, and the conveying it down ſafe and intire to Poſterity. Without which Mankind, in theſe circumſtances, neither could themſelves have been certain of what they were to believe, nor could they have ſufficiently proved to others what it was they were obliged to receive and to believe, as wanting Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Monuments and Records for it. So that we have ſufficient reaſon to believe that the ſame Divine Goodneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that did make known his Will to Mankind, would take the beſt means, and did take the beſt means for the continuing and preſerving it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62573:7"/>
And Scripture being the only means of that kind, becomes a Rule of Faith; and ſo is of Authority ſufficient to oblige us to receive and obey it.</p>
            <p>If the Matter of Scripture be true and of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration, we are obliged by it, though the Writing, or Book containing it, ſhould be only of Human Compoſition; becauſe it is the Doctrine, and not the way of delivery, that paſſes the immediate Obligation upon us: But when the Book containing that Matter, as well as the Matter it ſelf, is of Divine Authority, and compoſed by Divine Appointment, Direction, or Inſpiration, it obligeth us by vertue of the Compoſition, as well as the Matter; and both are to be jointly received as proceeding from one and the ſame Original and Authority.</p>
            <p>But having aſſerted this, That the Scripture is the only means of conveyance of the Will of God to Mankind, and what becomes a Rule of Faith to us; it is fit to return to the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How we can prove the Scripture to have been of Divine Revelation; or that thoſe Books, ſo called, were wrote by the Direction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, or by Inſpiration from him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62573:8"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. I Anſwer in the ſame way as before, That as there is no Revelation, if the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Revelation be not that Revelation; ſo there is no written Revelation, if the Scripture be not that Book, and be not Inſpired. And then we ſhould want the only certain means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is Writing, or ſhould have been wholly left to the doubtful and uncertain hand of Tradition, for the knowledge and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Revelation.</p>
            <p>Now, I think, this to be an Argument of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable force for the Divine Authority of Scripture; that without this means we ſhould after a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation be in effect without a Revelation: For ſo it will be if the Scripture contain not that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and that we have no ſufficient Record, if that be not the Authentick Record of it.</p>
            <p>But to come nearer the point.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I Anſwer, That there is as much proof for the Inſpiration of the Scripture, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is well capable of, and as much as is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; and if that be ſo, then 'tis unreaſonable to reject it; for they who do ſo, can do it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no leſs pretence, than that they would have ſuch a proof as the matter is not capable of, and more than is ſufficient for the proof of it. But that there is ſuch a proof for the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62573:8"/>
of Scripture as is ſufficient, I think, will be evident if we ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Scriptures have for proof of their Inſpiration, the Teſtimony of ſuch as were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they were written by Perſons Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that were Inſpired when they writ them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they are worthy of ſuch Authors, and have upon them the Characters of ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scriptures have for proof of their Inſpiration, the Teſtimony of ſuch as were Inſpired. The Teſtimony of Perſons Inſpired is as much a Proof of Inſpiration, as if it had been a matter they themſelves were Inſpired with; and therefore the Evidence that we have for the Inſpiration of ſuch Perſons, is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Evidence for the Inſpiration they give Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to. As for inſtance, ſuppoſe that we have not as good evidence for the Inſpiration of the Old Teſtament as we have for the New; yet if the New doth juſtify the Inſpiration of the Old, quotes it as ſuch, and beſtows that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter upon it; then by vertue of ſuch a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, we have as good Evidence for the Old as we have for the New. The meer Quotation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62573:9"/>
of a Book by an Inſpired Perſon, whether as to the Author, Words, or Matter, doth not give the like Authority to that with what he himſelf <note place="margin">Acts 17. 28. 1 Cor. 15. 33. Tit. 1. 12.</note>doth write by Divine Inſpiration; for then <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Menander, Epimenides</hi> and <hi>Callimachus,</hi> who were Heathens, and are Quoted by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> would become Inſpired Writers.</p>
            <p>But the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament are cited by our Saviour and the Apoſtles as the Oracles of God, and as Books of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and which they produce and appeal to upon all occaſions in juſtification of the Doctrine which they taught: So we are told that <hi>all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15, 16.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the whole Scripture (as <hi>Dionyſius Carthuſ.</hi> expounds it) <hi>is given by Inſpiration of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what is meant by the Scripture, is no other than what was generally received by the <note place="margin">Luke 24. 44. V. <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus con. App. l.</hi> 1.</note>
               <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church as ſuch, and which our Saviour diſtributes after their manner into the Three known parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms:</hi> Which diviſion compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in it all the ſeveral Books; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets containing not only the Books properly ſo called, but alſo the Hiſtorical, as written by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Perſons; and the Pſalms containing all the Poetical.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62573:9"/>
And they deſcend yet lower; for of the Thirty nine Books of the Old Teſtament, there are very few, not above Seven or Eight, but what are quoted in the New Teſtament by Name, or for ſome remarkable Paſſage, and as Books of the ſame Character.</p>
            <p>So that if we can prove our Saviour to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles inſpired (as we have done before, when we proved the Matter revealed by them to have been of Divine Authority), at the ſame time we prove the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament to be of Divine Inſpiration; becauſe they had this Teſtimony and Credit given to them by thoſe that were themſelves Infallible and Inſpired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The like Teſtimony have we for the Divine Authority of St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Epiſtles, by St.</hi> Peter, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 15, 16.</note>
               <hi>who gives them the ſame Title of</hi> Scripture <hi>with the Books that were of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Canon;</hi> Our beloved brother Paul, according to the wiſdom given unto him, hath written unto you, as alſo in all his Epiſtles:—Which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt, as alſo the Other Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But though this be a good and ſufficient Proof, where it may be had, yet it is not applicable to all; ſince the laſt of the Inſpired Writers could have no ſuch Evidence; as <hi>Malachi</hi> among the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62573:10"/>
               <hi>Jews;</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> in the Primitive Church, who ſurvived all the reſt of the Divine Penmen. And therefore where this Proof of the Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given to ſome is wanting as to others, we muſt have recourſe to other Arguments that will ſupply what is deficient. The Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has the Teſtimony of the New to vouch for its Divine Authority; but what can thus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify to the New, when there is no other Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and no Inſpired Perſons to come after?</p>
            <p>But this will be help'd by the next Evidence, which is, That</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures were written by Perſons In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, and that were Inſpired in the writing of them.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) They were written by Perſons Inſpired: Thereby is meant, that whoever were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, known or unknown, we have yet good and ſufficient Evidence that the Penmen were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired both as to the Matter and Manner or Way of Writing. (But this belongs to another place.) Or that the Authors of thoſe Books were the ſame that before taught by Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>That the Writers of the Old Teſtament were of this kind, we have already proved from the Teſtimony of the New, as far as that is of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to verify it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62573:10"/>
And that the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, whom we have before proved to be Inſpired, were the Authors of the Books of the New Teſtament, we have as good Aſſurance as the <hi>Jews</hi> had that the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> was written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the <hi>Pſalms</hi> by <hi>David;</hi> or that ever there were ſuch Philoſophers as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or ſuch Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> or any Books writ by them.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſo much the ſtronger Evidence have we, as it has been the Duty (as they thought) and the Intereſt of ſo conſiderable a part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as the Chriſtians are, to preſerve theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords ſafe and entire, and to take care that they be ſuch in all points as they received them; and conſequently according to their ſenſe of them they are of Divine Inſpiration, and wrote by thoſe Inſpired Perſons. And for which there can be no greater Evidence than this ſort of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; unleſs we would have God reveal to every particular perſon, That the Authors of thoſe Books were Inſpired; or point it out by ſome ſpecial Miracles, which ſhall ſerve as the Star to the Wiſe Men, to direct us to it.</p>
            <p>But ſince this is wanting, and cannot reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be expected, we muſt reſt ſatisfied with that which is the only poſſible Evidence, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62573:11"/>
which not only the Primitive Chriſtians did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit as ſufficient, but was not conteſted by the moſt violent Adverſaries of their Religion: Among whom the Queſtion was not, Whether the Perſons reputed to be Inſpired, were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of thoſe Books? or, Whether thoſe whoſe Authors are not known, were of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with thoſe that were known? but, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the matters of that ſuppoſed Revelation, and contained in thoſe Books, were true, and that thoſe Authors were ſincere Relaters of it?</p>
            <p>And whereas there were ſome Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that were not ſo early and univerſally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced as others, yet they were not ſo much <note place="margin">V. Euſeb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eccl. Hiſt. l. 23. c. 24, 25. l. 5. c. 8. l. 7. c. 24, &amp;c.</note>doubted of as to their Authority, as the Authors, (ſuch as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the ſecond and third of St. <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation);</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were by the <hi>Alogi</hi> that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writes of, who rejected the Works of St. <hi>John</hi> as not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Opinion, That Chriſt was a mere Man.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Sacred Penmen were Inſpired in their Writing, in the ſenſe before ſpoken of, <hi>p.</hi> 4. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There was as much need to Write, as to Teach; to Write with reſpect to the abſent, and to Poſterity; as to Teach and Preach to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62573:11"/>
preſent; for there is no other way to Teach in thoſe caſes, than by Tradition or Writing. But the Defect which thoſe Holy Men found all their Diſcourſes labour'd under as to their Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by Tradition, through the infirmity of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, and an incapacity of tranſmitting the Matters now contained in the Scriptures, to future Ages in that way, without Prejudice, Corruption, and Abuſe, diſpoſed them, under the direction of the Holy Spirit, to commit them to Writing. So St. <hi>John</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Theſe things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that ye might believe.</hi> So St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 5. <hi>I will endeavour that ye may be able after my deceaſe to have theſe things always in remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There was as much need to Write by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, as to Teach by Inſpiration, for Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is but another way of Teaching. And if the Apoſtles had the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt in all matters of moment when they Taught, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe (had we no other Evidence for it) that in the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances they had the ſame Aſſiſtance in what they Writ.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſo much the more might it reaſonably be expected, that they ſhould have the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that Divine Power operating upon their Minds, and guiding, as it were, their Pen in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62573:12"/>
what they Writ; as what they Writ was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Church, and to be a Standard of Faith, and Rule of Life to all Ages: Whereas what they Taught could continue no longer than the Memories of fallible men could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
            <p>So that we may conclude, That if they Taught and Preach'd by the ſpecial Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, they were alſo under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of it when they Writ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe Divine Penmen conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be alike Inſpired in what they Writ, as in what they taught. Therefore we generally <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 1. 1 &amp; 2 Theſ.</note>find the Apoſtles, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> always, unleſs when he writes in conjunction with others, to begin their Epiſtles with a Declaration of their Commiſſion and Authority by virtue of their Office, <hi>Paul an Apoſtle,</hi> &amp;c. requiring the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and the like ſubmiſſion to what they Writ, as to what they Spoke when preſent.</p>
            <p>And as they thus magnified their Office, ſo they writ as from Chriſt himſelf, after this and the like form, <hi>Grace be to you, and peace from God our father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 1. 7, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nay, they inſiſt upon their Inſpiration, which they received when they writ, to gain it Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with thoſe they wrote to. So St.</hi> Paul,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62573:12"/>
               <hi>Gal. 1. 1.</hi> Paul an Apoſtle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. <hi>Ver. 11, 12.</hi> I certify you, brethren, that the Goſpel which was preached of me, is not after man; for I neither received it of man, nor was I taught it but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>And that Apoſtle expreſly ſaith,</hi> The things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord, <hi>1 Cor. 14. 37. 2 Cor. 1. 13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So St.</hi> Peter, <hi>1 Epiſt. 5. 12.</hi> I have written briefly, exhorting and teſtifying, that this is the true grace of God, wherein ye ſtand.</p>
            <p>Now if they conceived themſelves to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired in Writing, who themſelves were Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (as has been before proved) and did Write with the ſame Apoſtolical Authority as they Taught, it is certain that they were Inſpir'd in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; for they were the beſt Judges of their own Inſpiration, and could beſt know when they were Inſpired. And therefore if any would undertake to diſprove the Divine Authority or Inſpiration of the Holy Scriptures, they muſt firſt of all prove that thoſe Writers were not inſpired, nor did ever give ſufficient Evidence that they were Inſpired. But if they were Inſpired, and do withal declare that they Wrote thoſe Books by Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have as much reaſon to receive thoſe Books as ſuch upon their Affirmation, as we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62573:13"/>
have no believe that they themſelves were Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or did ever Teach by Inſpiration.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is the ſame Proof for the Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtolical Writers, in their Writing, as their Teaching, as what they Write is the ſame with what they Taught; and therefore what they Taught being confirmed by ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be from God, ſo muſt what they Writ; the ſame Proofs that belong to the one, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the other. And accordingly they in their Writings often appeal to what they Taught, as concordant with what they Writ, and to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony given to the one for the confirmation of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They appeal to what they Taught: So St.</hi> Paul, <hi>2 Cor. 2. 13.</hi> I write none other things to you, than what you read, <hi>or know</hi> and acknowledge. <hi>So Gal. 1. 8, 9.</hi> Though we or an angel from heaven preach any other goſpel unto you than that ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let him be accurſed.</p>
            <p>So they appeal to the Evidences of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration in Teaching, for a confirmation of what they Writ: So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>Truly the ſigns of an Apoſtle were wrought among you in all patience, and ſigns and wonders, and mighty deeds.</hi> Gal. 3. 5. <hi>He that miniſtreth to you the Spirit, and worketh mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles among you, doth he it by the works of the Law, or</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62573:13"/>
               <hi>the hearing of Faith?</hi> From whence it is that the Apoſtles challenge the ſame regard to be paid to their Writings, as their Teaching; which they could not have done, were not their Writings of as good Authority as their Teaching, and were they not alike directed and aſſiſted in the one as the other. So St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1. <hi>Let a man ſo account of us as of the miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> or Apoſtles. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3, 4. <hi>I verily, as abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit, have judged already as though I were preſent, &amp;c. in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and my Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>All which is to give Authority to what they writ; but what Authority could that be of to oblige others to receive it, if they themſelves received it not by Inſpiration; and that their Teaching and Writing were not the ſame, and obtained in the ſame way?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Holy Scriptures are worthy of ſuch Authors as were Inſpired, and have upon them the Characters of ſuch Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lecture</hi> V.</note> I have before proved, That the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in Scripture has upon it the Characters of a Divine Revelation. But the Deſign before us now is, to ſhew, That the Writing it ſelf has upon it ſuch Characters as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62573:14"/>
will entitle it to Divine Inſpiration, and is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſuch Perſons to write, as were Inſpired. And that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we conſider who the Perſons were that were the Penmen of the Sacred Writ; that were as well Ignorant and Illiterate, as Learned. <note place="margin">Amos 7. 14.</note>Thus we find in the Old Teſtament, an <hi>Amos</hi> that was no Prophet, nor Prophet's Son, nor bred up in their Schools, but an Herdman, and Gatherer of <hi>Sycamore</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fruit, is made at once a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and as Inſpired, as the Great, the Noble, and Eloquent <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> And under the Goſpel, we find a <hi>Matthew</hi> and a <hi>John,</hi> as well as a <hi>Luke;</hi> a <hi>Peter</hi> as well as a <hi>Paul.</hi> For when the Workmanſhip pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from the Hand, but the Intelligent Mind; not from the Inſtrument, but the Efficient; it is not what the Hand, the Inſtrument, and Agent is, but what the Efficient pleaſes; and ſo God could make an Apoſtle and an Inſpired Perſon out of an Illiterate Fiſherman, as well as out of him that ſate at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel.</hi> For <hi>God choſe the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, &amp;c. that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62573:14"/>
And as it was in Preaching, ſo it is in Writing the Goſpel, in which God no leſs gave them a Mind to indite, than a Mouth and Wiſdom in Teaching, to ſpeak. So that they needed no <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 14, 15.</note>more to meditate before, what to write, than in that caſe what they ſhould anſwer. It was there <hi>as the Spirit gave them utterance,</hi> and here as that did direct, and aſſiſt, or ſuggeſt. St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts Timothy, <hi>to give attendance to reading,</hi> till he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould come to give him farther Inſtruction; and to <hi>meditate and give himſelf wholly to them, that his profiting might appear to all,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 13, &amp;c. But we find no ſuch dependance on human means in what they wrote: Then it is <hi>Paul an Apoſtle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus, and God the Father;</hi> the Goſpel he wrote was the ſame he taught; and which when he wrote, he no more received from man, than when he taught, and which he was <hi>taught by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1. 1, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>And therefore where all was by Revelation, it was not as the Man was, but as he was made: And as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was as much an Apoſtle, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Teacher, ſo he was as much a Divine Writer as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and writes with the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power and Authority, and with as much Certainty and Infallibility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:62573:15"/>
So that there are as few Objections (if we ſtrictly conſider it) made againſt the moſt Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate as the moſt Learned of the Inſpired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; againſt St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> as againſt St. <hi>Luke;</hi> againſt St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul.</hi> But now if thoſe Writers had wrote <hi>after man</hi> (in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Phraſe) and purely from themſelves, As it was naturally impoſſible that ever thoſe Unlearned Perſons ſhould apply themſelves to ſtudy at the Age of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and write of the moſt ſublime Arguments more to the ſatisfaction of Mankind than the profoundeſt Philoſophers; ſo it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that in their Compoſitions they ſhould have been guilty of manifold Miſtakes, when they wrote of ſuch various Points, and Points of no ſmall difficulty to explicate. But when the Unlearned of them are as free from Error as the Learned, and as little liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in what they writ, 'tis evident they writ from the ſame Spirit with, and had the ſame Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance as the Learned.</p>
            <p>And therefore the ſuppoſed Errors in any of them could not proceed from Inadvertency, or Unskilfulneſs, or want of right Information; but are rather Errors ſuppoſed and imaginary, than real; the Miſtakes of the Reader or Tranſcriber, rather than of the Penmen; as I have already ſhewed. <hi>(Serm.</hi> IV.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62573:15"/>
For if the Errors had proceeded immediately from the Writer, they would have appeared more in the Compoſures of the Unlearned than the Learned: But when the Unlearned are as free from them as the Learned, 'tis an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable ſign that the Unlearned wrote from the ſame Spirit as the Learned, and both from a Spirit that is Divine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures will appear to be worthy of ſuch Authors as are Inſpired, if we conſider the way in which they are written, which though not with <hi>excellency of ſpeech, or of wiſdom,</hi> that is, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1, 4.</note>human, yet have ſuch a Majeſty and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhining through the whole, as gives them a Luſtre as much beyond other Books, as the Bodies of Angels which they aſſumed for ſome ſpecial ſervice, excelled thoſe of Mortals, and that were of a Natural Compoſition; and of which we may ſay in the like Phraſe as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of our Saviour, That none could write after this manner, <hi>except God were with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I freely acknowledge, that they are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten according to the ordinary Rules of Art and Method, which Almighty God is no more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obſerve, than he is to govern the World by the Methods and Rules that are ordinarily obſerved among Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62573:16"/>
For as in the Government of the World, where there are different Ends to purſue, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Means to be made uſe of, God confines not himſelf to act as we would in ſuch caſes, but acts above all Rule known to us, and ſometimes puniſhes where we would ſpare, and ſpares where we would puniſh; ſometimes gives to thoſe that we would deprive of ſuch Favours, and deprives thoſe of them to whom we ſhould think fit to give: So it is in the Divine Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, in which he makes uſe of different Hands and Inſtruments, as there are different Tempers in Mankind: He makes uſe of the Poetical Vein in <hi>David,</hi> the Oratory of an <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the Ruſticity of an <hi>Amos,</hi> the Elegancy of a <hi>Luke,</hi> the Plainneſs of a <hi>Peter,</hi> the Profoundneſs of a <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſerve the common Deſign of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mankind in the knowledge of God, and their Duty to him, without that Artificial Method which the Learned Part of the World expect to find, and think fit to obſerve.</p>
            <p>The Heavens and the Earth have upon them the Signatures of an Almighty Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and which we may with <hi>David</hi> employ our moſt ſerious Hours in the Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, with Pleaſure and Advantage. But yet there is no ſtrict Order viſible to us, nor can
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62573:16"/>
be obſerved by us in the Situation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations; nor can we give a reaſon why <hi>Orion</hi> and the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> or <hi>Arcturus,</hi> are placed in that Quarter of the Heavens which is aſſigned them: And the Earth is not like a Garden laid out in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but rather there ſeems to us a rude Variety in the diſpoſition of it; and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who is there that doth not under all theſe ſeeming Diſadvantages, find out the Traces of a Divine Original, and enough to entitle God to the Creation of all? And ſo it is in the Holy Scriptures, where there often ſeems wanting the Accompliſhments of Human Eloquence, <hi>the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing words of man's wiſdom,</hi> and that Decorum and Artifice which the Books of Human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance and Invention are embelliſhed with: But as the Apoſtle ſaith, when he declined <hi>the words which man's wiſdom</hi> (whether of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers or Orators) <hi>teacheth,</hi> it was that their <hi>Faith might ſtand not in the wiſdom of men, but in the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4, 5.</note>
               <hi>power of God:</hi> So we may ſee under the Veil of a ſeeming Irregularity ſo much Beauty ſhining forth, and experiment ſo much Virtue proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, that it will evidently appear, that the leſs there is of Man in the Compoſure, the more there is of God, and that it can have none for its Author and Inditer but him; and which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62573:17"/>
Irregularity can no more detract from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Divine Inſpiration of the Scripture, than it can be queſtioned whether the Sun be the Fountain of Light, becauſe of what we that are at a vaſt diſtance from it, call Spots. For we are at a great diſtance from the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Age, and much more from the lateſt times of the Inſpired Writers of the Old Teſtament, and ſo muſt needs be under ſome difficulties from our unacquaintedneſs with the Style and Way of Writing, as well as the Cuſtoms of thoſe Ages. And there will be therefore ſome Spots and Dark Places in them as there are in the Sun, not for want of Light and Elegance originally in them, no more than for want of Light in the Sun; but becauſe of ſome Deficiency in our ſelves, that are at a Diſtance, and under ſuch Circumſtances as intercept our Sight, and hinder us from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king true and exact Obſervations. But if we could but ſtand, as we are to judge of Pictures, in the ſame Light in which they were drawn; and had lived in the ſame Ages in which thoſe Books were written, we ſhould be able to make a much truer Judgment, and penetrate much farther into the meaning of them, than we now can do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62573:17"/>
But now though all the Parts of Scripture are not equally alike, but like the Inſpired Writers themſelves, of whom ſome were bred up in the Nurſeries of Learning, and others fetch'd from the Fiſhery and the Sheepfold; yet are they all plain in the ſame eſſential Doctrine, and in which the Salvation of Mankind is concerned.</p>
            <p>And not only ſo, but the Style and Order of Words, if thoroughly underſtood as to their Propriety, Elegance, and Uſe, would be very ſurprizing (if we may judge of what we do not know, by what we do); which has not been unobſerved even by ſome of the Heathens. It was <hi>Dionyſius Longinus</hi> the Rhetorician, that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Majeſty and Sublimity of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s way of writing. It was <hi>Amelius</hi> the <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> that at the ſame time as he call'd St. <hi>John</hi> a <hi>Barbarian</hi> (a Title which the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> beſtow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Euſeb. Praepar.</note>all but themſelves) found in his Goſpel the Wiſdom of a Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>But above all, we may ſee the Footſteps of a Divine and Extraordinary Aſſiſtance in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Diſcourſes of our Saviour and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles upon ſeveral occaſions. Let us, for inſtance, take a view of our Saviour's laſt Diſcourſe with the Diſciples juſt before his Death, as recorded by St. <hi>John,</hi> chap. 14. &amp;c. Turn we again to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62573:18"/>
that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> about a Future State, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to it, which is the ſubject of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. See it again in the cloſe and ſenſible Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> See it alſo in the very Digreſſions which thoſe Holy Pen-men ſometimes, by breaking off from their Subject in hand for a while, do fall upon; where we ſhall find that which is equivalent to what is ordinarily ſaid by the Prophets in the Meſſages they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and what is as expreſly ſaid, and will as much be found to be of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. It was certainly as much an effect of the Divine Power to Direct, and Aſſiſt, and even Inſpire thoſe Writers with ſuch ſublime Notions, ſuch convincing Arguments, as it was of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commiſſion to ſend the Prophets with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to publiſh the Divine Commands and <note place="margin">Theol. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. c. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note>Decrees. And therefore it is a very frivolous Exception which a late Author makes againſt the Divine Authority of the Apoſtolical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, That they conſiſt of long Deductions and Argumentations; whereas, ſaith he, <hi>God doth not reaſon, but command,</hi> as he did by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. But how often do we find in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets God arguing with the <hi>Jews</hi> about the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Idolatry, from the Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Perfections of his Nature, &amp;c.? How often
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62573:18"/>
uſing Arguments to convince them of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities and Impieties? How often exhorting them to Repentance and Reformation, from the moſt powerful Conſiderations? And therefore why are the Apoſtles leſs inſpired for that reaſon than the Prophets? When God ſpeaks to Men, and teaches one man by another, it is often after the manner of men; and therefore as he doth ſometimes require abſolute Obedience to his Commands, ſo at other times he condeſcends ſo far as to ſhew them the Equity and the Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of them, both equally becoming the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, and which are a glorious Inſtance of the Divine Wiſdom conſpicuous throughout the Holy Scripture; thereby adding both to the Excellency and the Uſefulneſs of it; and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it in both above any Book in the World. And for this, take the Word of one (who is <note place="margin">

            <p>How we prove the Books that are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and received by the Chriſtian Church as Canonical, to be thoſe very Books that were writ by Perſons Inſpired?</p>

            <p n="2">2.
