            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT may perhaps, and that not <hi>unjustly,</hi> be wondered, that I should appear in behalf of the <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Philosophy, who have always been thought averse from <hi>it,</hi> and inclined to that which is more <hi>Novel.</hi> And it is true, that I have not such a <hi>veneration</hi> for the <hi>Peripatetical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,</hi> as some others have, nor do I think <hi>they</hi> so <hi>satisfactorily</hi> explicate the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> in <hi>sublunary</hi> things, as that an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive brain can <hi>acquiesce</hi> therein: but this is not so mnch the <hi>deficiency</hi> of <hi>that Learning,</hi> as of <hi>humane Nature</hi>; the attempt if self being so <hi>little feasible,</hi> that <hi>whosoever</hi> shall design <hi>any such thing,</hi> shall involve himself in the <hi>like miscarriages,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what <hi>Gassendus, Des Cartes</hi> and others have done, from whose performances the <hi>greatest</hi> advantages we have yet derived is, that it seems manifest how <hi>easie a thing</hi> it is to find <hi>defaults,</hi> and how <hi>difficult</hi> to amend <hi>them</hi>; and how the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Stagira</hi> was not <hi>singular</hi> in his <hi>faylors.</hi>

I can turn <hi>Gunpowder,</hi> the <hi>greatest part</hi> of it into <hi>Salt-Petre: Ergo Gunpowder</hi> is no new invention: &amp; the <hi>Nitre</hi> of the <hi>ancients</hi> &amp; our <hi>Gunpowder</hi> were the <hi>same.</hi> Or, I can turn native <hi>Cinnabar</hi> even farre the greatest part, 13 <hi>ounces</hi> of <hi>sixteen</hi>) into <hi>running Mercury</hi> or <hi>Quicksilver: Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Cinnabar</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> are <hi>all one,</hi> and whosoever useth or diggeth up the one, doth <hi>in Specie,</hi> use and dig up the <hi>other.</hi> But, what if Mr. <hi>Henshaw</hi> had lighted upon such impure <hi>Egyptian Nitre,</hi> as upon refining had yielded <hi>more</hi> of <hi>common Salt,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For that with us seems to be but the transudation of the <hi>Saline</hi> particles of the Lime and coagulating with some corpuscles in the aire, into an <hi>hoare,</hi> or <hi>Chrystalls</hi>; Nor did I ever see any but what was <hi>White</hi>: nor could I observe it to stick naturally to the Wall but in dry weather or when I made constant fires in my Chamber at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where it grew on the Walls near the ground, the Earth being higher much on the outer sides, then the floore within. At other times I supposed it too much diluted with moisture to stick on the Wall.

And that Mr. <hi>Henshaw</hi> did read him it seems evident from this, that his <hi>History of Salt-Petre</hi> seems rather to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed from out of <hi>Glauber's</hi> third part of the <hi>Prosperity of Germany</hi> (who transcribed it out of <hi>Lazarus Ercker</hi> overseer of the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Mines) than from any <hi>Experiments</hi> or <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> of his own and other <hi>Salt-Petre-men,</hi> (with whom <hi>perhaps</hi> he <hi>lightly</hi> discoursed) whatever he pretended the begining of his <hi>History: pag.</hi> 261. For had he minded the <hi>work,</hi> he could not have committed so many <hi>Errours.</hi> I believe that I ought to rectify Mr. <hi>Henshawe</hi>'s computation of what <hi>Petre</hi> the liquor holds by computation before it be put into the <hi>Ash-tubs pag</hi>: 270. and that for <hi>thirty five pound</hi> it ought to be <hi>twenty five pound</hi>: for so 'tis in <hi>Ercker</hi>; who followes that way of calculating, which I believe our <hi>Petre-men</hi> do not. Sure I am, that whereas Mr. <hi>Henshaw</hi> saith that the <hi>liquor of the second boyling</hi> when it is ready to Crystallize <hi>contains in every hundred-weight about threescore and ten pounds of Petre.</hi> That <hi>Ercker</hi> saith: <hi>Liquore sic perfecte parato, ex centenario ejus plus quam</hi> 70 <hi>l.

propounds.
<q>To make the <hi>Coal</hi> some besides <hi>Willowes</hi> use the branches of vine: some make it of <hi>Noccido</hi> a <hi>Nut tree Hazel, bay-tree,</hi> of the bark of the fruit of the <hi>pine,</hi> and some of those twigs they make <hi>Baskets</hi> with, some of young Elder, and some of <hi>Cane</hi> or <hi>Reed</hi>: and in fine, those coales that are made of <hi>gentle, pliable</hi> and <hi>flexile</hi> wood with pith enough, and that be fine and young and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hard knots, are fit for this use, and it is made in divers manners in great quantities. It is made after the fashion of <hi>common coal.</hi> Those <hi>Virtuosi</hi> that have little to do, use to put <hi>twigs</hi> split into a large pot or other Vessel of Earth, Iron, or Brass, and cover or lute it well about that nothing may respire; and then make a fire upon it, continuing it so long that they beleive the twigs are sufficiently burnt without flame; and then they let them coole, and take the <hi>coal</hi> for their use. When I have had present need I have done it without all this adoe I have taken a quantity of clear dry twigs, and broke them to pieces and laid them on an heap close, and set them on fire, and let them burn well: then with a Scoop or a ladle I have sprinkled water on them, and then gently scatterd the fire and quenched them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatever the common practice be, the addition of <hi>coal</hi> is not so <hi>necessary,</hi> but some other things may be substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted instead of it, which practice is usual with those that make <hi>Gun-powder</hi> of sundry other colours besides black.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62241:71"/>
inflames the <hi>Nitre,</hi> and therefore these three Materials powdered and mingled well together, and fire being put to this mixture, it becomes altogether inextinguishable, until all the substance be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed: (except there be some accidental defect in some of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, either of Humidity, or that there were taken of them much different from the convenient proportion) and therefore it is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the office of the <hi>sulphur</hi> is to take hold of the fire with flame, and to introduce it into the other Materials: and that of the <hi>Coal</hi> is only to maintain the said fire without flame, already intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the <hi>sulphur,</hi> and chiefly against that great wind which the <hi>Sal Nitre</hi> causes; but then the office of the <hi>Nitre</hi> is only to cause that great exhalation of wind, for in that wind consists all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and propriety of the Powder, for that is it which drives out the Bullet with so incredible a force, and therefore it is concluded that only on the <hi>Nitre</hi> doth depend all the vertue and puissance of the Powder, and the other two Materials are put therein only to resolve into <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>wind</hi> the said <hi>Nitre,</hi> and for no other end: for he that should compound powder only of <hi>sulphur</hi> and <hi>Coal,</hi> and charge a Gun with a considerable quantity of it, I say, giving fire to it should not be able to drive forth a stick or a straw.

was the Inventor of the Composition, and of the same mind is the Commentator of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> upon the first Book; for of him it is written in many places (as <hi>Vallurius</hi> says in his tenth Book <hi>De re Militari</hi>) how he found out a certain Machine of Iron, with which he threw towards a Land Army stones of prodigious weight and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and with an incredible sound; which gives us to understand that it was a Machine like a great <hi>Gun,</hi> with which he threw great Balls of stone (as it is not long ago, since the Moderns did,) and chiefly for their <hi>great sound,</hi> which in discharging them happens, and in any other kind of Machine it does not appear to me it could be done except in one like it. True it is, that at that time it is probable they were more deformed and unhandsome than those used at this present time; for the first Inventions are always something homely, but mend with time, it being an easie matter to add to things already found out; and the same thing I say of <hi>powder</hi> which in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was found out (either by <hi>Archimedes,</hi> or by whom you will) but was not compounded in such order and proportion as at present is used.

                     <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> and <hi>Hollingshed,</hi> add this out of the Chronicle of <hi>Edw. Hall</hi> published by <hi>Richard Grafton Anno Domini</hi> 1550.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the first year of King</hi> Henry 7. <hi>a new kind of Sickness came suddenly through the whole Region, even after the first entring of the King into this Isle, which was so sore and painful and sharp, that the like was never heard of to any mans remembrance before that time: For suddenly a deadly and burning Sweat invaded their bodies, and vexed their blood with a most ardent heat, infested the stomach and the head grievously: by the tormenting and vexation of which sicknes, men were so sorely handled &amp; so painfully pangued, that if they were laid in their bed, being not hable to suffer the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat, they cast away the sheets and all the cloaths lying on the bed. If they were in their apparel and vestures, they would put off all their Garments, even to their shirts. Others were so dry that they drank the cold water to quench their importune heat and insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thirst. Others that could or at the least would abide the heat and stench (for indeed the Sweat had a great and strong savour) caused cloathes to be laid upon them as much as they could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ear, to drive out the Sweat, if it might be. All in manner assoon as the Sweat took them, or within a short space after, yielded up their Ghost. So that of all them that sickned, there was not one amongst an hundred that escaped: Insomuch that beside the great number which deceased with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City of</hi> London, <hi>two Mayors successively died of the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease within eight days, and six Aldermen. And when any person had fully and compleatly sweat</hi> 24 <hi>hours (for so long did the strength of this plague hold them) he should be then clearly delivered of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease: yet not so clear rid of that, but that he might shortly relapse and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62241:76"/>
observed diligently and marked such things as did them ease and comfort at their first vexation, and using the same for a remedy and medicine of their pain, adding ever somewhat thereto that was sanative and wholsome. So that if any person ever after fell sick again, he observing the regiment that amongst the people was devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed could shortly help himself, and easily temper and avoid the strength and malice of the Sweat. So that after the great loss of many men, they learned a present and speedy remedy for the same disease and malady, the which is this: If a man on the day time were plagued with the Sweat, then he should strait lie down with all his cloathes and garments, and lie still the whole</hi> 24 <hi>hours. If in the night he were taken, then he should not rise out of his bed for the space of</hi> 24 <hi>hours, &amp; so cast the cloathes off that he might in no wise provoke the sweat, but so lie temperately that the water might distil out softly of its own ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ord, and to abstain from all meat if he might so long sustain and suffer hunger, and to take no more drink neither hot nor cold, than will moderately quench and delay his thirsty appetite. And in this his amending, one point diligently above all other is to be observed and attended, that he never put his hand or foot out of the bed to refresh or cool himself, the which to do is no less pain than short death. So you may plainly see what remedy was by the dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience excogitated and invented for this strange and unknown Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, the which at that time vexed and grieved only the Realm of</hi> England <hi>in every Town and Village, as it did divers times after: but</hi> 55 <hi>years after, it sailed into</hi> Flanders <hi>and</hi> Germany, <hi>where it destroyed people innumerable for lack of knowledge of the English experience.</hi>

                  <p>In the twenty second year of the aforesaid King, though the Sweating-Sickness did break out again, yet he saith that it did less hurt and displeasure to the people at this time, than it did before, by reason of the remedy which was invented by the death of many a Creature in the beginning.

                  <p>The second part He proves thus: because that the face of the Moon being looked on with a <hi>Tube</hi> of an <hi>extraordinary length,</hi> with Glasses <hi>excellently polished</hi> (such as <hi>He</hi> used for many years) appears <hi>all of it</hi> like a great Tract of Land co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with <hi>Snow,</hi> which the Sunne variously ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62241:123"/>
are obvious: place a <hi>candle</hi> in the dark at some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable distance, and the flame will appear <hi>round</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with rays</hi>: then take a short <hi>Telescope</hi> fitly made and placed, and look through it, and you will see the irradiation taken off, and the flame represented as <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,</hi> not <hi>round,</hi> and rather <hi>seemingly less</hi> then <hi>greater</hi> then it appeared before to the <hi>naked Eye.</hi> Then turn your eye unto any <hi>coloured Object,</hi> and take notice how big it seems: as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the same <hi>Telescope,</hi> and you shall find that to be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified above what it seemed to the <hi>naked eye</hi> by much.

deny but <hi>some things</hi> and <hi>some motions</hi> are observed <hi>by them,</hi> which a <hi>naked Eye</hi> cannot discern; but this <hi>knowledge</hi> arrives to a slender degree of <hi>certainty,</hi> when the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> come to be <hi>particularly</hi> explicated; and <hi>theoremes</hi> or <hi>assertions</hi> framed thence) so I would not have them <hi>too much relied</hi> on, nor men be too confident in <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>Conclusions</hi> which have no <hi>surer Foundation</hi> then those <hi>probabilities</hi>: and I do herein joyn with <hi>Claramontius</hi> in that <hi>Epiphonema, In tanta diversitate, quid certi ex tubo Optico habemus</hi>? If I must sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>skill</hi> or accurateness of <hi>Galilaeo, Scheiner, Gassen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Hevelius, Fontana, Ricciolus,</hi> and <hi>Zucchius,</hi> and such like; pardon me, if I know not <hi>whom</hi> to believe.</p>
                  <p>I have been the more large in this Point because of the <hi>insolence</hi> with which Mr. <hi>Glanvill</hi> persecutes that <hi>Reverend,</hi> and otherwise <hi>learned</hi> person, whom he represents to the world as <hi>He</hi> pleaseth, and accordingly treats him with that <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>scorn</hi> which is less allowable towards a <hi>Divine,</hi> and such a one as is, and always hath been in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey very much esteemed by several <hi>honourable</hi> Families, as well as others. However God hath so <hi>providentially</hi> order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>dispute,</hi> thereby to check the <hi>pride</hi> of our <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> that <hi>The Man of Words</hi> cannot triumph over the <hi>Man</hi> of Axiomes. And if it be true, that our <hi>Aristotelean</hi> was <hi>amazed</hi> at the hard words of <hi>Dioptrick Tubes,</hi> &amp;c. as if there had been <hi>Magick</hi> in them: I doubt not to <hi>Iustifie Him</hi> in it; for the insolent <hi>Virtuoso</hi> made use of <hi>them,</hi> not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>knowing person,</hi> but as <hi>Conjurers</hi> use <hi>strange termes,</hi> and of an <hi>uncouth sound,</hi> though perhaps really <hi>Hebrew, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> or <hi>Arabique.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides all this, perhaps Mr. <hi>Cross</hi> seems to have been offended at something in that mixt <hi>discourse</hi> or <hi>dispute,</hi> that might derogate from the <hi>Authority of the Scripture</hi>: many sayings are not <hi>innocent,</hi> but as they are <hi>worded</hi> or <hi>uttered.</hi> To say <hi>the Scripture was written to mens fancies</hi> is an expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion very <hi>unwary</hi> in a <hi>Divine</hi>: although a <hi>convenient</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation may <hi>excuse</hi> it. To say <hi>it is not written according to vulgar Methods</hi> may so be spoken, that the <hi>action</hi> may render the words <hi>culpable.</hi> And in <hi>another Age</hi> they might
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62241:124"/>
have passed better then <hi>now,</hi> when men are prone to <hi>vilifie the Scripture,</hi> especially the <hi>little Wits.</hi> I perceive Mr. <hi>Sprat</hi> is not over-tender of the dignity of the <hi>Scripture</hi>: for although there be an <hi>ancient Canon</hi> of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the applying the <hi>Sacred Word of God</hi> ad <hi>scurrilia</hi> &amp; <hi>adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latoria</hi> (which <hi>Canon</hi> is authorised even by the <hi>Council of Trent</hi>) yet doth he encourage men to apply it to ordinary <hi>Raillery.</hi>

                  <p>Our <hi>Virtuoso</hi> is not willing to dispute whether <hi>Hermes</hi> were the Author of Chymistry, or not: It had become one that is encharged with the Cure of Souls very well, to have declined all these other <hi>disputes,</hi> as being remote from those <hi>Studies,</hi> by which he <hi>ought</hi> to qualifie himself for a befitting discharge of the <hi>Ministry.</hi> But to tell him further, what I am sure he is ignorant of, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did never attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Hermes</hi> the Invention of <hi>Physick,</hi> or any part of it, but to <hi>Apis</hi> and <hi>Aesculapius</hi>; and as for that <hi>Chymistry</hi> which they practised, which consisted in melting down and improving of <hi>Metalls,</hi> or making of <hi>Gold</hi>: the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did never reckon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that <hi>Art</hi> amongst the praises of their <hi>Hermes,</hi>

But to raise this Enquiry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the times of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Empire, it is manifest out of <hi>Pliny,</hi> that <hi>mineral</hi>-waters were drunk in those ancient times: and that the <hi>Stomoma</hi> or <hi>rust of iron,</hi> as also that drinks in which <hi>Iron</hi> was quenched, was given in the time of <hi>Dioscorides</hi> and <hi>Galen.</hi>

                  <p>I shall conclude this discourse of <hi>Herophilus,</hi> with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation about the time when he lived; which was not in the days of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> though Mr. <hi>Glanvill</hi> represents them as <hi>Contemporaries</hi>: but many Centuries before, in the time of <hi>Ptolemaeus Philadelphus,</hi> and he is famed for his raillery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Diodorus Cronus,</hi> who denied there was any <hi>motion,</hi> yet had his <hi>shoulder dislocated.</hi> See <hi>Conring.</hi> de medic.

                  <p>As to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and their skill in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> I cannot say much of it, except it be to their <hi>disparagement.</hi> They were a <hi>military</hi> sort of people, <hi>rough-hewen,</hi> and thought <hi>all that</hi> below their <hi>studies</hi> or <hi>serious thoughts</hi> which our <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Philosophers</hi> boast of, and recommend unto our care with so much <hi>vanity.</hi> All the <hi>Mechanick,</hi> I had almost said the <hi>Liberal Sciences,</hi> they thought to be <hi>excellent</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in their <hi>slaves,</hi> not in <hi>themselves</hi>: And they who gave <hi>Laws</hi> to all the world, scorned to be instructed by their <hi>vassals,</hi> and a <hi>conquered</hi> Nation. Upon this account, not onely in the time of <hi>Tully,</hi> but afterwards to the days of <hi>Quintilian</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> (I know not which writ the Book <hi>De Oratoribus</hi>) it is evident, that however many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did inform themselves of the several parts of <hi>ingenious Learning,</hi> yet did that <hi>haughty people</hi> behold those persons with <hi>indignation,</hi> and some thoughts of <hi>hatred,</hi> in so much as that those who were best <hi>versed in it,</hi> pretended igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and scorn of it. Things being in this condition, and the <hi>Romans</hi> having no other <hi>Physicians</hi> then their <hi>Slaves,</hi> it is not to be wondered if they were not emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for <hi>Anatomy. Cato</hi> had banished the <hi>Physicians</hi> long ago, and after-ages gave <hi>them</hi> little encouragement.

                        <head>To the Royal Society the <hi>VIRTUOSI,</hi> and all the Honourable Members of it, the Humble Address of AGNUS COGA.</head>
                        <p>YOur Creature (for he was his own man till your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment transform'd him into another <hi>species</hi>) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those many alterations he finds in his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he thinks himself oblig'd to represent them, finds a decay in his purse as well as his body, and to recruit his spirits is forc't to forfeit his nerves, for so is money as well in peace as warre. 'Tis very miserable, that the want of natural heat should rob him of his artificial too: But such is his case; to repair his own ruines, (yours, because made by you) he pawns his cloaths, and dearly purchases your sheeps blood with the loss of his own wooll. In this sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack't vessel of his, like that of <hi>Argos,</hi> he addresses himself to you for the Golden Fleece. For he thinks it requisite to your Honours, as perfect Metaplasts, to transform him without as well as within. If you oblige him in this, he hath more blood still at your service, provided it may be his own, that is may be the nobler sacrifice.</p>
