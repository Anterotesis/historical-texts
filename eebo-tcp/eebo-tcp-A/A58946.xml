            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Elders and Brethren of the English Church in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> To Mr. <hi>Woolsey</hi> prisoner in <hi>Norwich,</hi> wisdom and grace be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by Christ, to acknowledge and walk in Christ, as we have received commandment from the Father.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is a part of our joy and comfort, (amidst the many afflictions allotted us in this life) to behold the truth of the Gospel prevaile with those that are upright of heart, and tread with a right foot in the practise of the same: so it is no little grief to see or hear of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of any from the strait paths of the Lord, to either hand: of which sort there is great store this day, (as always hath been before time) Touching whom we may complain to the Lord with the Prophet, <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 9.3.</note>
               <hi>Thou hast multiplied the Nation, but hast not encreased the joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you which in your late Letter unto us blame the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of Opinions in <hi>the small number of those that are Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Idolatrous Church, ad errours and lyes, dissonant and contrary to the whole truth of God, and true libertie of the Gospell,</hi> &amp;c. should have laid to heart your own words, and spared to publish so dangerous an error, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of clearing your selfe (as you say) both of error and heresie. But as all the rivers of <hi>Damascus</hi> could not wash away <hi>Naamans</hi> Leprosie,<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.</note> so neither can all the reasons that you have rendered, excuse or cleanse your Doctrine from the contagion of heresie; if you persist and go forward thus to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36826:4"/>
hold your selfe, to perswade and thrust upon others, your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from meats, which is reckoned by the Holy Ghost for a Doctrine of Devils, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.3.</p>
            <p>Touching which point, although you have had heretofore sufficient answer (wee doubt not) by that faithful Martyr of <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 10.7.</note> blessed memorie Mr. <hi>H Barrow,</hi> wherein as you ought and should, so we might and would rest, without making further reply: Yet because wee have (for the present) no Coppy of those writings, that might witnesse for us hereafter, neither as we thinke were they sent unto you in the name of the whole Church then at <hi>London,</hi> we have now written briefely what God hath given us to see in this matter; hoping that this joynt sentence of our Church, confirmed by the Word of the Lord, will take effect, (through his grace) for the disswading and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of you from your Errour; otherwise, that you may have the less excuse in the day of Christ. And God which hath taught us from our youth until now, forsake us not, even in our old-age and gray heads, till we have declared his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel unto this generation, and the truth thereof to so many of those that are to come, as it shall please him.<note place="margin">Psal. 71.17, 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine which in your Letter you would maintain for the truth of God, <hi>wherein you are obedient unto him</hi> (you say) <hi>as all others must be, that truly fear his Name,</hi> is, <hi>That you will not willingly eat blood, nor things strangled, nor things offered to Idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the abstaining from Bloud, you alleadge three Reasons. 1. <hi>The commandment of God to Noah,</hi> Gen. 9.4. 2. <hi>His commandment by Moses to Israel,</hi> Deut. 12.16. Levit. 17.13,14. And 3. by <hi>the whole company of the Apostles, Elders and brethren at Jerusalem, to the Churches of the Gentiles,</hi> Acts 15.23,28,29.</p>
            <p>From which you conclude, that it remaineth <hi>firm and sure to this day, as any other testimonies of holy Scripture, to be observed of all the faithful till the coming of Christ.</hi> After this, you make answer to certain <hi>mis-alleadgings</hi> (as you call them) <hi>of other Scriptures against this truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And first, for the commandment given to <hi>Noah,</hi> you write
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36826:4"/>
               <hi>that nothing hath been or can be said against it.</hi> Whereto we answer, that we have cause to doubt of your fidelity, when you affirm nothing hath been said; and to blame your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for avouching nothing can be said against the perpetuity of that commandment. And for the first, (to free your self of suspicion) we pray you send us a true and perfect Copie of all that Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> (to omit others) did write unto you: for there we are perswaded something hath been said against it. For the later, we wish you to follow the counsel of the holy Ghost, that saith <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 12.3.16.</note>, <hi>Vnderstand according to sobriety, and be not wise in your self</hi>; considering that the Word of God <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.36</note> 
               <hi>came not out from you, neither came it unto you onely.</hi> The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from blood commanded to <hi>Noah,</hi> we hold to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and was then a figure for the time present, but is now disannulled <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 7.18.</note> for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof: And that for these Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the other observations of Religion in those times before the Law was given by <hi>Moses,</hi> were for the outward things figures and shadows <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 8.20. &amp; 12.7</note>, as building of Altars, offering of Sacrifices, <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> difference of beasts clean and unclean, <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 14.20,&amp;c. 28.22.</note> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tythes, offering of <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 4.4.</note> First-fruits, <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> Circumcision, and sundry the like. So that it helpeth not to say abstinence from bloud was commanded before the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is now to continue, more then it will help a Jew to say, <hi>Circumcision,</hi> &amp;c. was commanded before <hi>Moses</hi> Law, (Yea Christ himself saith <note n="i" place="margin">Joh. 7.22.</note> it was not of <hi>Moses,</hi> but of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) therefore it is to continue still.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We understand (according to that small measure of light which God hath given us in those dark shadows) that abstinence from blood was a figure of our sanctification, and that in three respects. 1. The first concerning Gods Worship and Service, which that it might with the more holiness and reverence be used and regarded, he would have some special things not profaned or in common use of men. So he forbad the making or using of that holy Oyl wherewith his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Priests were anointed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.23,31-33. and the like of that precious Perfume, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.37. Also, he forbad them to eat that fat of beasts which they should burn on the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36826:5"/>
altar to the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.25. And that the blood was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden also in this regard, appeareth by <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.11. <hi>For that the soul of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>for an atonement for your souls:</hi> So that the common eating of any blood might have bred in them a contempt of the price of their atonement, which was in figure the blood of beasts, but in truth the <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 9.14</note> blood of Christ. And for as much as this sacrificing of Beasts was in <hi>Noahs</hi> time and <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> before, it was meet in the wisdom of God, when he gave them flesh to eat, to debar them of the blood, for the cause mentioned.</p>
            <p>The second respect concerned thankfulness to God for the use of his creatures which he giveth unto the sons of men. Therefore of them all the Lord reserved one principal part from himself, that thereby his people might acknowledg his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Such was the law of all <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 23.19.</note> first-fruits, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. which every man was to bring before the Lord, acknowledging <note n="h" place="margin">vers. 2,3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> verse 5,9,10.</note> his own unworthiness, and Gods mercie in giving him the increase of that good land. In like sort they were forbidden to do any work with their first-born bullock, or sheere their first-born sheep, or eat them otherwhere then before the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.19. Yea, all their own first-born Children they must redeeme, and the very unclean beasts they were to redeem or kill, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.19,20. Every tree that they planted for meat, they might not eat thereof the first three yeares; in the fourth year all the fruit was to be holy to the praise of the Lord, and in the fifth year they did eat, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.23. When they eat of the bread of the land, they must offer a cake of the first of the dough, <hi>Num.</hi> 15.19,20. and sundry the like. Accordingly do we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Lords minde here, that giving them flesh to eat, he restrayned the blood, as being a thing wherein they had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, but the Lord; for that it was the soul or life, that is the Chiefest part of every beast; and so their restraint from blood to be an occasion for them to praise the Lord, that had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them the flesh to eat.</p>
            <p>The third respect concerned the love of men each to other, that they should abstain from Cruel affections, and salvage fierceness, and put on the bowels of meekness, gentleness,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36826:5"/>
compassion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not onely towards their friends, but also their enemies; whereunto they were led by sundry figures; and taught their duties to men, by their behaviour to brute beasts. Of this sort were the abstayning from any bird when they took the eggs or the Yong, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.6,7. The helping of their neighbours (yea their enemies) beast when it is strayed, or lay under the burthen, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4,5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.4. The not muzling of the oxes mouth that trod out the corn, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.4. The resting of Beasts on the Sabbath day. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. which such like. And that the Lord in sparing the blood of Beasts, had regard herein to the blood of men, appeareth by the next words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.5. saying, <hi>And surely I will require your blood wherein your lives are, at the hand of every Beast,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby he sheweth how precious the blood of men was in his eyes, that would punish the shedding thereof both on men and Beasts: and therefore to the end they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the spilling of each others life, he withheld them from eating the life, that is, the blood of Beasts. It might seeme a kinde of cruelty to eat Beasts blood, and want of humane clemencie: wherefore <hi>Solomon</hi> noteth a righteous man even by this, that he regardeth the life of his <hi>Beast</hi>;<note place="margin">Prov. 12.10.</note> and addeth on the contrary, <hi>But the mercies of the wicked are cruel.</hi> By which opposition it appeareth, that God in restrayning <hi>the life or blood of Beasts,</hi> intended hereby to restrain men from cruelty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We hold the abstinence from blood to be figurative and temporarie, upon that which is written <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16,17. <hi>Let no man condemn you in meat and in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or new moon, or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come: but the body is of Christ.</hi> Where he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckoneth meat and drink among other shaddows; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth not any meat, no not blood; nor any feast, no not the Sabbath. If it be said, <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of meats and drinks under <hi>Moses</hi> law onely, and not of blood, which was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den long before to <hi>Noah</hi>; wee answer, 1. that blood was also forbidden in <hi>Moses</hi> law amongst other meats,<note place="margin">Levit. 17. Deut. 12.</note> therefore is here also abrogated among other meats. 2. Again, as much may be said for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the seventh day, as for blood;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36826:6"/>
yea more, both in regard of the antiquitie, and of the use and end. For the prohibition of blood began but in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, but the seventh day was sanctified from the beginning of the world:<note place="margin">Gen. 2.2,3.</note> so that if blood may be exempted from the Apostles general abrogating of meats, because that edict was more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then the Law, then much more may the seventh day be exempted from amongst the other sabbaths, because it was of farre greater antiquitie. The use and end also of the seventh day was more excellent then that of blood: <note place="margin">Gen. 9. Levit. 17. Exod. 20.10,11. Exod. 31.13.</note>for blood was forbidden (as you alledge) because it was the life of the Beast, but worke on the seventh day was forbidden for a remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the creation of the world, and rest of God; and for a signe that we might know that the Lord doth sanctifie us: so that the end of the sabbath in this respect excelleth the end of blood. And if further it be said (as afterwards in your Letter you urge) that blood was forbidden because it was the life; and seeing it is the life to this day, therefore to this day it may not be eaten: we answer, As much may be said for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; that to this day, and always, a rememberance is to be kept of the creation of the world and rest of God; now and always it is the Lord that sanctifieth us.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.3. Reve. 4.11. &amp; 14.7. Heb. 4.10,11. 1 Thes. 5.23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore we conclude from this Testimonie of <hi>Pauls,</hi> that if none may condemn us in respect of the seventh day, more then of the other feasts and sabbaths, so neither may any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us for blood, more then other meats or drinks, which were shaddows of things to come, whose body wee have in Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the prohibition of eating blood in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. was figurative, appeareth by the punishment of murther, there presently annexed; the Lord saying,<note place="margin">verse. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Whoso sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">verse. 5.</note>Yea, at the hand of every Beast (as well as of every man) God required the blood of man. And of the beast he required it thus (as at the publishing of the law appeareth) that the oxe which goared to death man or woman should be stoned to death, and the flesh thereof not eaten, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.28. And that this was figurative, your self (we think) will not deny; for you mention no scruple thereof in your Letter. But if any would make conscience of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36826:6"/>
suffering such a beast to live, or eating the flesh thereof, he might fetch his ground from <hi>Noahs</hi> time, as well as you that will eat no blood.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It may be shewed to be a Type or shadow, and now abrogated, by the same reason that <hi>Paul</hi> alledgeth for eating all other meats, saying,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.25,26.</note> 
               <hi>Every thing that is sold in the Shambles, eat ye, making no question for conscience sake; for the earth is the Lords, and the plenty thereof:</hi> which testimonie of <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 24.</note> if it be of weight to settle the conscience touching other meats, then of blood also, seeing it is a part of the plenty of the earth, and the Lords, as well as any other thing which now he hath given us free use of by Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written, that this world and all other things are ours; we Christs, and Christ Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21,22-23.</p>
            <p>Thus have we shewed you something of that which may be said against the perpetuity of that law in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. which is the ground of your erronious building.</p>
            <p>The next reason by you alleadged from the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> falleth with the former, and by all the arguments which we have brought, is shewed to be <hi>Typical</hi>: and you may aswel deny any other of <hi>Moses</hi> ordinances to be shaddows, as this: Yet you say that <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.11. is misalledged, where God saith, <hi>For the soul of the flesh it (is) in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls.</hi> If this be misalledged (as you write) and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not to be a shaddow; then we must believe it is the substance and truth: Then atonement for mens sins is wrought by the blood of Beasts, in deed and truth, not in <hi>Type</hi> and figure. See whither your error leadeth you. The Holy-Ghost saith, <hi>It is unpossible that the Bloud of Bulls and goats should take away sins,</hi> Heb. 10.4. <hi>but it is the blood of Christ that cleanseth us from all sins,</hi> 2 Joh. 1.7. Whereas therefore the Law saith, <hi>I have given Beasts blood upon the altar to make atonement for your souls,</hi> it must needs be figuratively spoken. And you are greatly to blame to write as you have done, that this Scripture is misalledged. Yet to qualifie the matter, and help your self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you write, that you <hi>confesse as the truth is, that the sacrificial blood had two
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36826:7"/>
causes why it might not be eaten; the one general, because it was the life; the other particular, because it was the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement.</hi> But this is not to confesse as the truth is; for you confesse not at all that it was typical, (which you must do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will renounce Christ who is the truth.) Nay, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you write very peremptorily that <hi>It was not, is not, nor ever shall be proved, that the not eating of all blood was typical: Yea, that it had not any foot of type or ceremony in it.</hi> And further from the truth is that which followeth in your Letter, <hi>that the cause of forbidding common blood, was one onely, to wit, because it is the life, which remaineth still the cause before the Lord, why it might not be eaten, and shall remaine the cause till the comming of Christ.</hi> Herein you deceive your self, and would deceive others, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a figurative and temporary cause, to be a cause in truth and for ever. For the strength of your reason seemeth to be this: Blood might not then be eaten, because it was the life; the same cause continueth now, for it is the life still, and so shall continue till the coming of Christ: therefore it may not now be eaten.<note place="margin">verse 4.</note> The falsehood of which Argument we will shew you by the like. In <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.7. God saith, <hi>The swine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it parteth the hoofe, but cheweth not the Cud, it shall be uncleane unto you, you shall not eat thereof.</hi> Whereupon the Jew might thus argue; <hi>Of a swine we might not then eat, because it parted the hoof, but cheweth not the Cud, and the same cause continueth still, for to this day the swine parteth the hoofe, but cheweth not the Cud: therefore to this day we may not eat of swines flesh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The like may be said for the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, as before we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Such is your reason against eating of blood, whiles you make the cause to be in the nature of the Creature, which you should put in the will and appointment of the Creator. For why might not Beasts that chewed not the Cud be eaten then, as well as Beasts that did chew the Cud? but because it pleased God to exempt them in Type and figure; for otherwise all Gods Creatures are in their own nature good and cleane, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14. Even so may it be said, Why might not the blood be eaten as well as the flesh, but because God would exempt it also in Type and figure, as before we have proved? He that said, Ye shall not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36826:7"/>
eat the blood because it is the soul, might also have said (if so it had pleased him,) <hi>You shall not eat the flesh, because it is the body.</hi> But of his mercie he permitted them the flesh, for the comfort of their Bodies; and of his Soveraignty and like mercy, he restained the blood, for the instruction of their souls, even as by other like shaddows he led them to Christ. If you say the sacrificial blood was a figure, because it was used in the worship of God upon the altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the common blood of all beasts was no figure, for thereof was no use in the worship of God; it is not of weight: for neither was there any use of swine or other uncleane Beasts in the worship of God, yet were they all Types and figures, as the Scripture teacheth us, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.11,12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so we have before proved all blood to be. Unto which proofs we will add this one reason further, and so conclude this point.</p>
            <p>The restraint of blood before Christs comming, seemeth to be for the honour of the Son, in whom and by whom the Father would give all good things to his Church, both for soul and body; and without whom we have no right to any thing, having lost our Soveraignty by <hi>Adams</hi> fall. And first, for spiritual things, <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us<note place="margin">Rom. 16.25,26.</note> that the <hi>Revelation of the mystery</hi> (of the Gospel and mans salvation) <hi>was kept secret since the world began, till now</hi> (under Christ) <hi>it is opened and published among all nations by the scriptures of</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> at the commandment of the everlasting God.<note place="margin">Reve. 5.</note> None in heaven or in earth could open the book, or loose the seales, but that Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Juda</hi>: And as heavenly, so earthly things are loosed and restored by Christ. Before his coming, the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was Gods peculiar possession, and the Jews his chosen Heritage: now all the ends of the earth are given to Christ, all peoples and nations are his, no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence either <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> male or female, freeman or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.28.</note> In like sort men were debarred of many earthly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before his coming, and were nourtured as Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the School-Master of the law,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.24.</note> with <hi>Touch not, taste not, handle not,</hi> and the like restraints: <note place="margin">Col. 2.2,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36826:8"/>
Beasts of the field, the fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea: and now also by Christ all things are made ours,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.21, 22.</note> we being the heirs of God through him<note place="margin">Gal. 4.7. Rom. 8.17.</note> so that no man may condemn us for meat or drink;<note place="margin">Col. 2.16</note> for we know and are perswaded through the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing uncleane of it self,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.14.</note> neither can any thing that goeth in at the mouth defile the man.<note place="margin">Matth. 15.11.</note> 
               <hi>We may eat the soul of the Beast aswel as the body, for the earth is the Lords, and the plenty thereof.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.25.26. This honour hath the Father given to the Son, and the Son to all the Saints. Wherefore we conclude, that this forbidding of any meat, even of blood, derogateth from the power and liberty of Christ, which he hath given to all that believe in his name; and so it is a false and pernitious Doctrine,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1,3.</note> even a Doctrine of devils, as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it, turning men back from Christ, to the begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rudiments<note place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> and types of the Law. But you say, <hi>If it had any jet of Type or ceremony in it the Apostles would never have forbidden it to the Gentiles no not for an hour</hi>;<note place="margin">Gal. 2.5.</note> 
               <hi>for that had been to Bring them into bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remaineth therefore that now we examine your third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and see what it was that they forbad the Gentiles, and for what cause.</p>
            <p>In the 18. of the <hi>Acts</hi> it was determined that those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles whom certaine Pharisees had troubled with words, and cumbred their minds,<note place="margin">verse 5. verse 24.</note> should be written unto to abstain from pollutions of Idols (that is, things offered to Idols) <hi>and forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the strangled thing, and from blood:</hi>
               <note place="margin">verse 20. verse 39.</note> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereof is also shewed to be this; <hi>For Moses from old times hath them that preach him in every city, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath.</hi>
               <note place="margin">verse 21.</note> Now the occasion of this Edict, and the end thereof, with all other Circumstances of the same, and the practice of the Apostles and Churches after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, all plainly teach us, that this was no permanent law, but for the present time and occasion; not for any unlawfulness in the Creatures themselves, of Idolathites, stangled things, or blood, but for bearing with the <hi>Jews</hi> which were so zealous of <hi>Moses</hi> law, and for the quiet of the Church. And this we confirm by these reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because we find not that such abstinence from meats
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36826:8"/>
was ever taught by any of the Apostles before this present time and occasion; which if they had been permanent, and not legal shadows, we are to think they would have preached with other Doctrines of the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the disputation about this Question, <hi>Peter</hi> calleth the Doctrine by them urged a tempting of God, a <hi>yoke not able to be born.</hi>
               <note place="margin">verse 10.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> confirme it,<note place="margin">verse 12.</note> by telling the wonders that God had done among the Gentiles by them, without exception or mention of this Doctrine of blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then <hi>James</hi> approveth in like manner <hi>Peters</hi> words,<note place="margin">verse 14,15.</note> and would not have the Gentiles troubled,<note place="margin">verse 19.</note> but onely written unto about these things; and maketh the reading of <hi>Moses</hi> in the Synagogues, a reason thereof; so that the <hi>Jews</hi> which had been accustomed to <hi>Moses</hi> law from old time, were subject to be offended with these things; whose weakness was to be born withall so much as might be, as the Apostles did teach by their own example; for which, see <hi>Acts</hi> 21.20,21,23,24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9, 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> having occasion to deal afterwards with the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> about one of the things here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, namely <hi>meats sacrificed to Idols,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note> doth plainly teach that they might eat such meats, if it were not to the offence of any mans conscience; making this his ground, <hi>that all things were lawful for him, but not all things expedient or edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. Wherefore any things sold in the shambles they might buy and eat, and whatsoever was set before them at an unbelievers Table they might eat, asking no question for conscience sake:<note place="margin">verse 25. verse 27.</note> so that neither things sacrificed to Idols (whereof he there treateth) nor stangled, nor blood, nor whatsoever else that might be prepared at an Infidels banquet, could defile them with the eating, or Trouble their conscience: and this he proveth by Scripture; for <hi>the earth is the Lords, and the plenty thereof:</hi>:<note place="margin">verse 26. Psal. 24.1.</note> which testimony of <hi>David,</hi> if it be of weight to prove we may eat any meat (as the Apostle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it to that end) then may we eat things sacrificed to Idols, and strangled, and blood,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.21.22. 1 Cor. 8.28.</note> because they are a part of the plenty of the earth, all which is the Lords, and by Christ ours. But for the offence of others he saith, <hi>Eat it not</hi>; And why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36826:9"/>
of him that shewed it (saith he) and for that other mans Conscience, not thine own; adding withall, <hi>For why should my liberty be condemned of another mans conscience?</hi> whereby he evidently teacheth, that it is our Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to eat any thing, even meat sacrificed to Idols; which yet was one of the things forbidden in the 15 of the <hi>Acts.</hi> And would we have a better expounder of that decree then an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, and one that was present and imployed in that business, and knew well the occasion and end of such writing to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as then was, which by this his Epistle he maketh so plain, as none of any Judgment need doubt what was meant?</p>
            <p>Now for your Objections; where first you say, <hi>If it had had any jot of type or ceremony, the Apostles would not have forbidden it to the Gentiles for an hour:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We answer, that neither did they in that sence that you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> from <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.5. which was a bringing into bondage, and loosing the truth of the Gospel; but in another regard, <hi>for the weakness of their brethren,</hi> they would, did, and might.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Paul</hi> an Apostle writing to the <hi>Romans</hi> which were Gentiles, saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.1.</note> 
               <hi>We which are strong ought to bear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the weake:</hi> and againe,<note place="margin">Chap. 14.20,21.</note> 
               <hi>All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for the man that eateth with offence; it is good neither to eat flesh, nor drinke wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended.</hi> And to the Gentiles of <hi>Corinth</hi> (as before is shewed) he saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Eat not meat sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to Idols, for the conscience of him that sheweth thee.</hi> And himself gave an example; who because of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were zealous of the law, purified himself, and offered in the Temple (<hi>Acts</hi> 21.24,26.) which we think you will not deny were types and figures.</p>
            <p>Next, whereas you say touching 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9,20. that <hi>Paul</hi> became a Jew to the Jew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he became not a Jew to the Gentiles; and if this thing were ceremonial, he must needs be counted to become a Jew to the Gentiles, contrary to his own Doctrine and practise, <hi>Gal</hi> 2.5. You shew no reason of this your assertion; yea, the contrary is most plain, in that the Commandment, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15. was in the Jews behalf, whom
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36826:9"/>
the Gentiles were to bear with according to <hi>Pauls</hi> example, and with him to become Jews to the Jews, that they might save and not offend them. It is you rather that are become a Jew to the Gentiles, whiles you thus observe, and urge all Christians of the Gentiles to observe the Jewish Types and shadows.</p>
            <p>Unto 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. where <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Every creature of God is good, and nothing ought to be refused,</hi> &amp;c. you answer, that <hi>Christians liberty there is all one and the same, which God gave to Noah, no more nor no less,</hi> when he saith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9 3. <hi>Every thing that moveth and liveth shall be meat for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is strange that you will thus write: For upon that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty given to <hi>Noah,</hi> there is presently restrayned, even in express words, the blood of all beasts; but in this place of <hi>Paul,</hi> every creature is permitted, without any manner restraint, either in expresse words, or by any necessary Collection: so that except you will deny blood to be a creature, you cannot deny it to be permitted there of <hi>Paul.</hi> Neither are his words drawn by us further then himself, and other places of Scripture do allow: for we have shewed many Scriptures that confirm this evident truth. But then we must needs affirm (you say) that <hi>Paul</hi> in this behalf was <hi>yea, yea,</hi> with the rest of the Apostles, in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and by himself <hi>nay, nay,</hi> in his Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> We answer, there is no need thus to affirme; for he was <hi>yea yea,</hi> in <hi>Acts.</hi> 15. for the weakness of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (as before is proved) and so he alwaies continued, even in his Epistles: He was <hi>nay, nay,</hi> against observing legal Types, as touching the things themselves,<note place="margin">Rom. 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>firmation of that decree <hi>Act.</hi> 15. was ratified by <hi>Paul</hi> himself, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. after that the Epistles of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were written, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon would inferre that his words in those Epistles are drawe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36826:10"/>
further then he intended; it is before answered and proved, that the decree you mention, was but for the time, and for the quiet of the Church, and for the bearing with the Jews; but the Doctrines in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles are perpetual, and do concern the creatures themselves, and our liberty in Christ to use them. So that nothing which you have said can turne away the evident force of these Scriptures, which as a sharp sword do wound and cut down this Jewish error, which you to the hurt of your own soul, and trouble of the Church, have renewed in these last dayes; whereof we pray God to give you a sight, and Christian sorrow for the same.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites.</note>In the next place, you write of <hi>Idolathites,</hi> or meats sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to Idols, more briefly and more fearefully, as seeming to have a Check in your own conscience. For we agree (you say) in one thing, <hi>that no Christian may eat them in the Idol-temple; but in the second point we differ, that some will eat them when they be brought from thence, though it be shewed them, that they are sacrificed to Idols, not caring who be offended,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>though the conscience of him that is offended should stay him and his conscience from eating of it, as it is written,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.13. &amp; 10.28,29,30.</p>
            <p>And is the difference between us but in this second point of eating with offence, as you would pretend? Then we hope you will not blame them that eat without such offence. Then is not the thing of it self unlawful, but in regard of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances: and we which live here, and are not offensive one to another for eating such things, may lawfully eat them, by your own grant. And thus also you yeeld up one of your chiefest forts of your error, to wit, the Edict in the 15 of the <hi>Acts</hi>; for there Idolathites were as fully and absolutely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as blood: whereupon it followeth, that if Idolathices were forbidden but in regard of offending others, then blood also was forbidden but in the same regard. Thus the truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth you in some sort to yeeld: In some sort (we say) for you make no full nor free acknowledgment. You write not <hi>it is lawful to eat them, if it be without offence of others,</hi> neither do you plainly avouch (much lesse prove) the contrary, though both before and after you bewray you erroniously
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36826:10"/>
hold the contrary. Before, you said <hi>you will not willingly eat meat sacrificed to Idols:</hi> and after, when you alledge the law of the damned thing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. and say that the places to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> are misalledged in this behalf, as for blood: we have before spoken of that 15 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and by comparing it with this place of <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have proved it to be the minde of the holy Ghost, not to forbid those meats in regard of themselves, but for the present peace of the Church in bearing with the weake. And so plaine is the evidence of this Scripture for it, that your self (which are so diligent to amove all doubts, as you leave not the scruple of fishes blood unanswered) yet can say nothing at all against this. Wherefore we rest in that which hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said concerning it. But you alledge that law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.17. <hi>There shall cleave none of the damned thing to thine hand</hi>; <hi>and say these things are so called</hi>; wherein you quite mistake and misapply the Scripture: For 1. That law is made for such as being of the Church should revolt from God, and fall to Idolathites, verse 12. 2. Not onely the Beasts, but the men also, with all that they had, were to be slaine, and utterly destroyed; the City to be burnt with fire, and made an heape for ever, and might not be built againe, verse 15,16. 3. Not onely the beasts, but all other substance of those Idolaters were alike damned things; neither were they onely forbidden to eat the flesh, but to have or use any of their Cattel alive or dead: for nothing of that damned thing might cleave to their hand, verse 17. But such is not the estate of meats offered to Idols; for they may be bought and sold in the shambles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25. they may be eaten even at an Infidels Table, without scruple of conscience, verse 27. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the earth is the Lords and the plenty thereof, and the Idol is nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. &amp; 10.19, and so cannot defile the good creature of the Lord. Therefore what God by his word hath sanctified, call not you unclean or damned <hi>Acts</hi> 10.14.</p>
            <p>Lastly, you refer us to your answer by <hi>Acts</hi> 21.15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nto the places of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> for this, as well as for blood. And we which before have discussed this point, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you againe to that which we there wrote in refutation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

               <note place="margin">Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note>As for things strangled, you <hi>count them as one thing with blood: for if the thing strangled, were killed by letting the blood from it, it is lawful</hi> (you say) <hi>to be eaten.</hi> This is all you write of it. And we, which before have proved that blood was a figure, and may now be eaten of any Christian, have thereby also proved it lawful to eat of the strangled thing; which is not otherwise unlawful, but for the blood, by your own Confession.</p>
            <p>There is yet another place <hi>misalledged</hi> (you say) <hi>by the ignorant, against all these things</hi>; <hi>and that is</hi> Rom. 14.17. <hi>that the Kingdome of God consisteth not in meats and drinks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which place by</hi> Paul (as you affirme) <hi>was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together alleadged against them that did eat with offence, and not at all against them that did not eat, or were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eating such things.</hi> Doubtless this place was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged so ignorantly as you have answered it: for though <hi>Paul</hi> applied it to the present particular occasion, yet the position is general, and for ever true, that <hi>Gods Kingdome is not meat or drinke:</hi> wherefore as it was applyed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle against them, so may it by us against you: For you by your Letter would teach us the contrary, that the kingdom of God consisteth (if not in drink, yet) in meats, as Idolathites, and strangled, and blood; which you now urge as a Doctrine of the Gospel (which is the Gospel of Gods kingdom)<note place="margin">Mark 1.14</note> to be observed of all Christians (which are the Children of that kingdom)<note place="margin">Mat. 13.38</note> as in obedience to Christ (who is the King of that kingdome.<note place="margin">Psalm 2.6</note> And seeing the Law and the Prophets were to <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and since that time the kingdome of God is preached,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.16 Acts 28.31</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> a chief laborer in, and preacher of that kingdome, hath taught us that it is not meat and drink; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and being perswaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane in it self,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.14</note> and therefore willeth us to eat whatsoever is sold or set before us, without any scruple of conscience:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10</note> we cannot henceforward (if you persist thus to teach) esteeme you herein for a Preacher of the kingdome of God, but of the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law; and burdenous traditions; yea, of the Doctrine of Devils (and so of the kingdome of Satan) as it is called by the holy Ghost, 1 Tim. 4.1,3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:36826:11"/>Againe you should minde, that a general Doctrine (such as is that position of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14.17.) may be applied to all particular times, places and persons, as occasion is offered; which if you will not learne of <hi>Paul,</hi> who applied those words of <hi>David,</hi>

               <hi>The earth is the Lords,</hi> &amp;c. to his particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of meats, whereas <hi>David</hi> himself never so alleadged or applied them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet learne it (at least wise) of your self, who a little before alleadged the law of the damned thing, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 13, against eating of meats offered to Idols, though it were not by <hi>Moses</hi> alleadged to that end, neither can by any at this day be so applied, as before we shewed.</p>
            <p>And as you teach contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine unto the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>; so do you the like to that which he taught the <hi>Corinths.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10</note> For will you say unto us in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> as he said to them in <hi>Corinth. Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat</hi>; <hi>and whatsoever is set before you by an unbeliever, eat making no question for conscience sake</hi>? Then may we eat both blood and strangled, seeing some such things are often sold and set on Table before us. But you by your Letter would have us touch no Idolathites, eat no strangled, taste no blood;<note place="margin">Col. 2.21</note> and this you teach <hi>as firme and a sure Doctrine to this day as any other testimony of holy Scriptures, to be observed of all the true faithful, till the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this be so, then it behoveth us to ask many questions for conscience sake, otherwise then <hi>Paul</hi> taught. For we must enquire at the shambles touching every <note n="*" place="margin">as coni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

At every strangers table that we come, we must do the like, both for strangled things and blood, which often is mixed with other meats, especially of broths, wherein meat not throughly cleansed of the blood, is boiled: Yea, we must come to the Jews super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, that buy not their flesh at the shambles of the Gentiles, but flay them themselves, for the perfect letting out the blood; for otherwise we may offend like the Israelites in the days of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.32 33,34.</p>
            <p>Thus as <hi>Paul</hi> taught a Doctrine of Christian liberty and comfort for the conscience in meats and drinks;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.29</note> so you teach a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36826:12"/>
Doctrine of bondage, yea of fear and doubt, and distraction of Soul (whiles you urge abstinence from these things, even as any other Doctrine of the Gospel.)</p>
            <p>The Lord Jesus which cast out that dumb spirit that rent and tare the possessed mans body,<note place="margin">Mark 9.17</note> and threw him to the ground, and sometimes into the fire, sometimes into the water;<note place="margin">verse 22</note> cast out by his grace this spirit of error from you, that thus distracteth and tortureth the conscience, and casteth it down to earthly traditions, and rudiments of the world<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1</note>.
