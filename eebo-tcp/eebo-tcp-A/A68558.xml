         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Aliant <hi>Martin,</hi> if euer the earth carried anie
Gyants, as fabulous antiquitie hath auouched,
which entred into wars and conſpiracies againſt
GOD, thy father <hi>Mar-prelat</hi> was a whelpe of
that race; who to reuiue the memory of his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters
almoſt forgotten, hath broken into heauen with his
blaſphemies. If the Monſter be deade, I meruaile not, for hee
was but an error of Nature, not long liued: hatched in the heat
of the ſinnes of <hi>England,</hi> and ſent into theſe peaceable Seas of
ours, to play like a Dolphin before a tempeſt. The heads this
<hi>Hydra</hi> loſt in a famous place of late, where euery newe Bugge
no ſooner puts out his hornes, but is beaten downe; The Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamie
latelie taken of him, the blood and the humors that were
taken from him, by launcing and worming him at <hi>London</hi> vpon
the common Stage; The maine buffets that are giuen him in
euery corner of this Realme, are euident tokens, that beeing
thorow ſouſt in ſo many ſhowres, hee had no other refuge but
to runne into a hole, and die as he liued, belching.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Turkie</hi> hath very good cauſe to bewaile his death, for theyr
Religion like an ancient building, worne with extremity of age,
riues, &amp; threatens ruine on euery ſide, if it be not ſupported by
newe proppes. One of the beſt meanes the deuill inuented to
holde that vppe, was the helpe of thy Father, to pull downe all
other Religions vnder heauen. His Concluſions and thy Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
are two as fitte ſwordes, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelfe could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to kill a Chriſtian. But becauſe thy Father wained with the
<pb facs="tcp:14569:3"/>
Moone for want of ſtrength, when he left thee his <hi>Theſes</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
life or limme, I woulde wiſhe thee to put them in Moode
and Figure for his ſake. <hi>Paſquill</hi> hath vndertaken to write a
very famous worke, Entituled, <hi>THE OWLES AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANACKE:</hi>
wherein, the night labours and byrth of
your Religion is ſette downe: the aſcent and deſcent of the
Starres that fauour it, is truelie calculated: the aſpects of the
Planets raigning ouer it, are expreſſed, with a iollie coniecture
drawne from the iudgement of the Theame, what end your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is like to haue. Now becauſe hee hath reſerued a blanke
Paper at the end of the worke, for the foure ſeaſons of the yere,
(as commonly Calculators doe) he is determined to keepe that
in his hand, till your Syllogiſmes be made, that he may fill vppe
his Booke, with the diſeaſes and remedies of your Arguments,
in what quarter of the yeere ſo euer they fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paſquill</hi> hath taken vp your Gloue, and deſires you to charge
your weapon at him like a Man. If you play with him, as your
father and your ſelfe haue doone with the Biſhops heretofore,
if you barke like a Curre and bite behind, he will haue a trick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with his heele to ſtrike out your teeth. Whilſt you conſult
with your Topicks to ground your reaſons ſure, <hi>Paſquill</hi> wyll
come vppon you with another venewe. For he came latelie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-ſea
into <hi>Kent,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence he cut ouer into <hi>Eſſex</hi> at <hi>Graueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ende,</hi>
and hearing ſome tidings of <hi>Hartford-ſhire,</hi> because hee
cannot ride far without a bayte, he made as much haſte as hee
could to S. <hi>Albanes,</hi> where he ſtaid one whole Sabaoth at the
Chriſtopher, and hauing there peſtered a newe paire of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-tables
with profitable Notes for that quarter, he ſette for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
the Munday following to <hi>North-hampton-ſhire,</hi> ſmyling
and glauncing as he turnd his Horſe about to bidde the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> adiewe.</p>
            <p>To be brefe with your worſhipfultie, <hi>Paſquill</hi> hath poſted
very dilligently ouer all the Realme, to gather ſome fruitfull
Volume of <hi>THE LIVES OF THE SAINTS,</hi>
which Mauger your fiue hundred fauorites ſhall be printed.
There ſhall you read of that reuerend Elder of your Church,
<pb facs="tcp:14569:3"/>
who beeing credited with the ſtocke of the poore, pertaining
to the Bride-well houſe of <hi>Canterburie</hi> to ſette men a work, was
compelled to keepe it to himſelfe, becauſe no poore folkes of
the houſhold of Faith could be found in all that Cittie. There
ſhall you ſee the life and learning of a Paſtor of your Church,
which expounding the Articles of our Beliefe in <hi>Deuon-ſhire,</hi>
when he came to handle the deſcending into Hell, wrote a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Letter to a neighbour Miniſter of his to craue his aduiſe,
and rapt it out luſtilie, <hi>Si tu non vis venire mihi, ego volo venire
tibi.</hi> and ſo by the leakes that remaine in his Latine, made more
worke for the Tinker, than euer your Father made for the
Cooper. I will leape ouer one of your Brother Preachers in
<hi>North-hampton-ſhire,</hi> which is as good a Hound for his ſent to
ſmell a feaſt as euer man ſawe. <hi>Paſquill</hi> met him betweene <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
and <hi>Fawſeley,</hi> with a little Hatte like a Sawcer vppon hys
crowne, a Filch-man in his hande, a ſwapping Ale-dagger at
his back, containing by eſtimation, ſome two or three poundes
of yron in the hyltes and chape, and a Bandogge by his ſide, to
commaund fortie foote of grounde whereſoeuer he goes, that
neuer a Begger come neere him to craue an Almes. O how my
Palfrey fetcht me vppe the Curuetto, and daunced the Goates
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>umpe, when I ranne the ring round about him to retriue him:
it ſhould ſeeme by the manages my beaſt made, that hee knewe
his Maiſter had a ſpeciall peece of ſeruice in hande. You ſhall
haue a goodly bande of theſe men in the volume of the Saints.
<hi>Paſquill</hi> is nowe gone ouer-ſea to commit it to the Preſſe, and
it is his pleaſure (becauſe it is the firſt opening of his ſhop) to
giue you a taſte of his Wares before you buy them, like a franck
Merchant.</p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon, ſweet <hi>Martin Iunior,</hi> play thou the knaue
kindly as thou haſt begun, and waxe as olde in iniquitie as thy
father. Downe with learning and Vniuerſities, I can bring you
a Free-maſon out of <hi>Kent,</hi> that gaue ouer his occupation twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

               </gap>ke a good Deacon for your purpoſe,
I haue taken ſome tryall of his gifts, hee preacheth very preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ouer a Ioynd-ſtoole. Theſe Biſhops are ſomewhat too well
<pb facs="tcp:14569:4"/>
grounded for greene-heades, ſo long as they keepe their place
and power, it is impoſſible for thee to caſt the Religion of this
Land into a newe Molde euery newe Moone. The whole ſtate
of the Lande perceiues it well enough, that to deliuer vppe the
Prelacie to <hi>Martin,</hi> is a Canker more daungerous to the
Church and Realme, than it was for the <hi>Athenians</hi> to deliuer
theyr Orators to <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> their vtter enemie: or tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it is for the Sheepe to betray their Sheepheards to the Woolfe.
Theſe ſtaid Fathers, through their long ſtudie, practiſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in the Church of God, are skilful Phiſitions, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the beating of euery pulſe that beates out of order:
they are able to diſcerne at the firſt touch, from what kinde of
Haereſie, euery one of theſe new Feuers that trouble vs, had his
beginning. Therefore, as the high way to haſten the ende of
the ſicke, when you thinke to profit by their death, is eyther to
counſell them to deſpiſe the Phiſition, and caſt both the Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
and Potion againſt the walles: or els to deliuer them into
the handes of an ignorant Leache, which by miniſtring euerie
Sowters receipt to reforme the ſtate of the bodie, plyeth them
with purgatiue vppon purgatiue, till hee weakeneth the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
and rots both the Liuer and the Longes; So the readie
courſe to poiſon her Maieſties louing people, is to diſcredite
the Phiſitions of their ſoules vnto them, and to ſuffer euerie
<hi>Martin</hi> and Mounte-bancke to practiſe on them.</p>
            <p>By theſe meanes ſhall you ſee Religion haled with violence
into her graue, the goodly frame of this Common-weale ſhall
fall, and Banck-rouptes and Atheiſts pocket vppe the peeces.
But our comfort is, that the wiſedom of her moſt excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
is knowne to be greater, then to be traind from ſo high a
ſeate to ſo baſe a lure, as euery <hi>Martiniſt</hi> caſteth out vnto her.
Her ſacred Maieſtie knowes, that it behooueth all Princes to
haue a watchfull regarde vnto their eſtate, which is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
as well by dooing of nothing that may endomage them,
as by ſeeking of any thing conuenient for them.</p>
            <p>Neuer bragge in this quarrell of your fiue hundred Brethren
of credit and abilitie, <hi>Paſquill</hi> hath excellent Ferrets to followe
<pb facs="tcp:14569:4"/>
them in their owne Boroughs: and he can tell you that there is
a common kinde of affection, which men of this age carrie to
ſuch as you, whilſt they haue any ſeruice to put you to, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them that hauing ſomwhat to doe with a confection of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
reioyce when they finde it, yet they hate the malice of it,
and throw it out of the doores when their turne is ſerued. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doubt I, but that the ſame reckoning in the ende wyll be
made of you, which your fauourers commonly make of theyr
olde ſhooes, when they are paſt wearing, they barter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaie
for newe Broomes, or carrie them foorth to the dunghill and
leaue them there.</p>
            <p>I coulde tell you manie ſtrange ſtratagems of your beſt
Friendes, but <hi>Paſquill</hi> is a Trauailer, and he knowes that Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Printers in theſe daies, are like to Men placed at the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Banquets, if they rowle they eye neuer ſo little at one
ſide, there ſtands an Eunuch before them with his hart full of
iealouſie, and his Bowe readie bent to ſhoote them through,
becauſe they looke farther then the Lawes of the Countrey
ſuffer them Neuertheleſſe, becauſe your faction is ſuddainlie
growne ſtale like an Oyſter, and gapes ſo wide, that euery Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
