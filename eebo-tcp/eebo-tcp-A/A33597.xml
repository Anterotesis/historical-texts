            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Original being burned, to ſatisfie the Deſires of my Friends, and clear my Innocency, I have given forth a Copy thereof; It was directed to <hi>Richard Bellingham,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Maſſachuſets, Simon Broadſtreet</hi> &amp; <hi>William Hauthorn</hi> Aſſiſtents, or whom elſe it might concern; which Letter about the middle of the <hi>7th Month, 1672.</hi> was by a Woman Friend left at the Houſe of the ſaid <hi>Richard Bellingham</hi>: Preſently upon the Receipt thereof, or ſome ſmall Time after the ſame Day, he ſent for <hi>Nicholas Moulder</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> Merchant, and demanded of him a needleſs Queſtion, whoſe Letter it was? for he might have ſeen whoſe Letter it was, being dated from <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> the <hi>12th</hi> of the <hi>6th Month, 1672.</hi> my known Hand and Seal to it; but <hi>Nicholas</hi> anſwered, as he ſuppoſed, It was mine; whereupon the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> very furiouſly in Anger and Paſſion replyed, I was an old ſottiſh Man, to that effect; and cauſed his Man to fetch a Candle and light it, he being in <hi>Auguſtine Lindal</hi>'s Houſe, the Iron-monger, and in <hi>Auguſtine's</hi> Preſence, <hi>Nicholas</hi> and his Man's, opened my Letter, then tore it, and put it into the Flame of the Candle, and burnt all the Writing, without reading of it, and bad <hi>Nicholas</hi> to take Notice of it.</p>
            <p>Thus, after he had contrary to all Law and Right, abuſed my Letter, and his publick Truſt, in burning a Letter of publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, directed to two in Authority with him, and to others of his Spirit, that it might concern, which ſhews his great Weakneſs and Wickedneſs, ſtanding out all Warning from the Spirit of the Lord in his Servants; yet notwithſtanding it had this Effect, the three Beholders have expreſſed ſome Tenderneſs; the young Man that then lived with the ſaid <hi>Richard,</hi> and waited on him, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93446:3"/>
lighted the Candle by his Order, he was troubled in his Mind, and as they termed it, Diſtracted, and told the Governour, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, and that he would not pluck off his Hat to him, and ſuch like; ſo that he ſent him home to <hi>Newbery</hi> with his Father: Thus having abuſed me, as is ſaid, he alſo abuſed my Friend <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Moulder,</hi> and asked him where his Security was, or elſe he would ſend him to Priſon, to anſwer the next Court; but for what, he expreſſed not, nor do I believe he knew; and ſo calling him proud <hi>Quaker,</hi> that durſt ſtand with his Hat on: <hi>Nicholas</hi> being bound to appear at their Court before, he therefore let him go.</p>
            <p>Now this Abuſe was not done by the Government of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets,</hi> but by the Elective Governour, as a private Man, in a private Houſe, before three private Perſons, without his Counſel, and in Anger and Fury; an evil Diſeaſe I know he hath been long warned of, when I was joyned with him in Authority in the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let the rational and impartial Reader judge, not leavened with a perſecuting Spirit, whether I might not ſo expreſs my ſelf, as I have in the enſuing Letter, being intruſted in the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof (and with the chiefeſt in all publick Charges) even before <hi>Boſton</hi> was named, or any Houſe therein, I builded the firſt good Houſe, in which the ſaid Governour and Merchant <hi>Brak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> now dwell: I having ſpent much of my Eſtate and Prime of my Age in propagating Plantations, and now come to the laſt Period, the <hi>70.</hi> Year of my Age; in Diſcharge of my Conſcience towards God, and in tender Love and due Reſpect to all, I write, as I have done, to warn you of your general Calamity, upon which I parted from you, that perſecuting Spirit let looſe, that hath ſo much indangered and hindered your Good both Spiritual and Temporal, and hazard both your Patent, Lives and Eſtates, as in my Letter, to which I refer you, may appear; and reſt your in true Love,</p>

            <p>Now Friend, though I thus write for clearing my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; yet have I nothing but Love in my Heart towards you; for thou art my ancient Friend; thou waſt known to me before thou waſt married, when thou cameſt to <hi>Boſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Lector, and after we came to <hi>New-England</hi> in the <hi>Arbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la:</hi> I ſay, when I was informed out of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>G.F.</hi> and others of our Friends had been with thee, as is ſaid, and that they had left you to the Judgments of God, which you could not eſcape, it would be too hard for you; for the Lord of that Servant would come in a Day he looked not for, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.46. for <hi>John Norton</hi> one of thy Company, who when you pauſed upon the executing of <hi>William Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Marmaduke Stevenſon,</hi> and forbare one Day (it may be at the Mediation of my ancient and worthy Friend <hi>Jo.

encouraged you thereunto, and the reſt of your cruel Works; this bloody Perſecutor being at your Worſhip-Houſe in the fore-part of the Day, and intended to go in the after-part, the Lord came upon him in a Day he looked not for, and in an Hour he was not aware of, and ſo cut him off; for he fell down dead: And did he not ſay, the Judgments of God were upon him? which I leave to thy Conſideration, leſt it be ſaid of thee, thou hadſt Time to repent, and yet repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedſt not, as it is ſaid of <hi>Jezebel. William Hauthorn,</hi> my third ancient Friend, that I have ſaid I would write to; Thy Name is alſo often mentioned in the ſaid Book or Books: I cannot now ſay, how far, with my other two anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Friends, thou art guilty of the Death of our Friends before-ſaid; but this I can ſay, that though Hand joyn in Hand, yet ſhall not the Wicked go unpuniſhed: Friend, ſince thou cameſt in Authority; for in the Ship, I know thou waſt tender, ſerious and retired, as became the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt (for I had Speech with thee many times) and both then and afterward bareſt thy Teſtimony againſt Perſecution, and ſtinting or limiting the Spirit of Prophecy in any, viz. to reſtrain from Preaching, but by Allowance of certain Perſons; if that ſhould take Place in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> thou lookedſt at it as one of the moſt horrideſt Acts as ever was done in <hi>New-England,</hi> and would be as great a Token of God's forſaking <hi>New-England,</hi> as any (I know where thou ſpake it) and it was a good Speech; for this is the Day of God's Appearance in his Sons and Daughters, in pouring out his Spirit, ſo they muſt propheſie; and who can withold the Work of the Lord? Are you ſtronger then he? What hath all your Perſecution come to, mentioned in the foreſaid Books? though Briars and Thorns have ſet themſelves in Battel againſt the Lord, yet he hath gone through you all; for ſince your oppoſing the Truth in your

Jurisdiction, have not many been brought to know him, whom to know is Life Eternal? You may as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the flowing of the Tide into the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Bay, as the Workings of the God of Truth in the Hearts of his People in the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Jurisdiction, or to limit the holy One to a Company or Tribe of Prieſts, who make a trade of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, keeping People alwayes under their Teaching that they may be alwayes paying of them. Now for the Books taken away by your Officers, detain'd ſome years, demanded of your Governour, is an Act of ſuch Hoſtility, that (by me) cannot be paralleled: Should we ſeize of your Merchants Goods in other Places, as you have done of ours, would you not ſay we had done right? as you had done to others, ſo others had done unto you? Had I been in <hi>Spain</hi> (as I have been) in the great City of <hi>Malego,</hi> and the Inquiſitors had come aboard our Ship, or Ships, and they had found Books that they diſliked, yet ſhould I not have loſt the Propriety of my Books; they would ſeal them up, and when the Ship or Ships were ready to ſail, I ſhould have them again: Is this to do as you would be done by? The <hi>Papiſts</hi> will condemn you in this, as contrary to that common Equity that ought to be, &amp; alſo the Priviledge of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject: You have taken away all Law and Juſtice, and have uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it into your own Hands; for you are Court, Jury, Judge, Accuſers, Witneſs and all; no Juſtice is to be had in this Caſe. Oh the Honeſty, the Honeſty of the <hi>Papiſts!</hi> they will not deſtroy Proprieties, though they be <hi>Sectaries,</hi> out of the pure and undefiled Religion, that <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of; out of the Truth and Worſhip in Spirit and Truth, that Chriſt ſet up above ſixteen hundred Years ago.</p>
            <p>I appeal to your own Maſters of Ships and Merchants, if this be not ſo: Did ever any of you looſe a Book? But we muſt looſe ten Pounds Sterling, as they coſt in <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93446:7"/>
they were in your Goverment; a Reaſon againſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Let me have a fair Arbitration upon it, if you will not deliver them up, and your own Merchants ſhall determine it; for this Caſe is properly to be determined by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that know <hi>Lex mercatoria,</hi> the Law amongſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; for though the Eſtate ſeized is not great, yet the Conſequence may be great; and they that will not do Juſtice in ſmall Matters, will not in greater Matters; But it may be, I ſhall receive them again, when I receive the Reward promiſed me for my Pinace, which took the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of <hi>John Oldams,</hi> when he was ſlain by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Stanton,</hi> yet living, cut in the Back, and ſet aſhore by them of <hi>Block-Iſland,</hi> whoſe Pinace and whoſe Charge was <hi>John Oldam</hi>'s Pinace taken from the ſaid <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſome of them brought Priſoners to <hi>Boſton; John Gallop</hi> Maſter and <hi>John Wood</hi> his Mate: Indeed <hi>John Gallop</hi> had a ſmall Iſland given him in lieu of that Service (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it is like, <hi>Gallop</hi>'s Iſland to this Day) then was I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Reward anſwerable to my Charge &amp; Adventure, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But after a perſecuting Spirit aroſe amongſt the Prieſts, and <hi>Ann Huchiſon</hi> and <hi>John Whelcwrit</hi> muſt be baniſhed, and all that ſtood in their Way muſt remove, and the unclean Spirit like Frogs, came out of the Mouth of the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſo that Perſecution was uſhered in, all Perſons that were againſt them, were noted as the removing Party; ſo as I am a Man and a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I would have no Hand in it; ſo that being againſt it and a Magiſtrate, after three dayes Debate in Court (the Prieſts animated their Party; for of the Prieſts none but <hi>John Cotton</hi> was with us; ſome fell from us, ſo that we were the <hi>minor</hi>) we drew up a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, that our Diſſent might appear to ſucceeding times, which after ſome Debate, was admitted according to our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93446:7"/>
Deſires, to ſtand on Record; ſo ever ſince that, I hav been none of you that perſecute; for I would not number my ſelf, as a Man amongſt Perſecutors, whoſe Names ſhall rot in ſucceeding Ages, much more as I am a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> to love one another, and to love Enemies, and my Neighbour as my ſelf, and God above all: I therefore bare my Teſtimony (as it is ſaid by that <hi>Remonſtrance</hi>) againſt that perſecuting Spirit that was let looſe to deceive all in Authority: And though I was in the greateſt Way to be great in the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> to the outward; yet the Locuſts that were come out of the bottomleſs Pit blaſted all to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance there, and my Mind was for removing. And the Planters Play, and <hi>John Cotton</hi>'s Sermon, which was in 1630. printed by <hi>John Humphery</hi> our Agent, to ſatisfie the Godly-minded of our Removal out of <hi>England,</hi> all did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie me to remove, as <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> being grieved for your unrighteous Dealings: So that as I am, or was for that ſeaven Years I lived in the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> a Merchant, and the chiefeſt theree; ſo by Merchants, that walk by the Rule of Righteouſneſs, <hi>To do unto others, as you would have them to do unto you,</hi> let my Cauſe be iſſued; for if you were ſuch, you would not do as you do, to perſecute and deſtroy common Right that is among Nations, and mantained by the Law of Nations. That you <hi>New-England</hi> Profeſſors, that profeſs the Scripture of Truth, and that are out of Poſſeſſion of that Life that gave them forth; for you to ſay, you have a Law for it; what Law contrary to Law, that is no ſooner made, but void by <hi>England</hi>'s great Charter, and your Patent, as repugnant to Law? I find a printed Paper dated in <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Road, aboard the <hi>Arbella, April</hi> the 7th 1630. by us the Heads, that then brought over the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Patent, in the Name of the whole Company, <hi>John Winthrop</hi> Governour, <hi>Thomas Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Deputy, <hi>Sr. Richard Saltingſtal</hi> (ſo called) <hi>Iſaak Johnſon</hi>

O groſs Hypocriſie and Diſſimulation! profeſs it in Print, and perſecute it in Deed; alſo to burn, ſuppreſs and imbecil ſuch Books, as tend to the Furtherance of that which you have declared of in Print: To whom ſhall I compare you herein (that perſiſt to perſecute, as is ſaid) except it be to <hi>Bonner</hi>'s Story and the Perſecutors in the <hi>Marian</hi> Dayes? read their Stories in <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents,</hi> to ſuppreſs Goſpel-Books that came out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> the low Countries, &amp;c.

Now to come to an End; I underſtand that you take away Peoples Goods, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch perſecuting Prieſts, as were never ſent of God, and called of Chriſt Jeſus unto that Work they pretend to, as their Fruits do manifeſt; and they that hear them not, or never ſet them to Work, muſt pay them, or never hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them: And that which is yet more unjuſt is, That they that cannot hear them for Conſcience ſake, muſt not only pay the Prieſts that preach for their Hire; but you that love to have it ſo, have made a Law to pay five Shillings a Day for not hearing them: So you that fled from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, are worſe then they, and ſet up a worſe anti-chriſtian Power: Is it not in matter of Worſhip they do againſt God and Chriſt, if in Caſe they do treſpaſs? And is not Chriſt Judge in ſuch ſpiritual Matters, that will recompence to every one according to their Works; and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all Perſecutors and Pluckers to be ſtill, to ſuffer the

Tares and the Wheat to grow together till Harveſt, which will be the End of the World? And at that time he will ſend his Angels to reap the Tares from the Wheat; and ſo commands his Servants to be ſtill; for it is his Angels Work. <hi>Gamaliel</hi> would be no Judge in ſuch Matters: You that profeſs the Scriptures to be your Rule, what Rule have you in Scriptures, To perſecute any for Religion or Conſcience towards God? but to love Enemies, and to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore turn to the Light within you, wherewith you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, that you have contracted and blaſphemed as Natural, &amp;c. Even Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory, which was declared to you by the Servant of the Lord <hi>John Cotton,</hi> on <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.13. on his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture Day, the Ships ready to depart for England; he ſtated the Difference, it was about <hi>Grace</hi>; he magnified Grace within us, the Prieſts Grace without or upon them: So all the Difference in the Country was about Grace, notwithſtanding the Difference was as great (ſaith he) as between Light and Darkneſs, Heaven and Hell, Life and Death: For as in the Text, when they ſaw the Boldneſs of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> they perceived they had been with Jeſus; and from the Spirit of Jeſus did he then declare, and ſo do our Friends when they come amongſt you, and you might perceive had you the ſpiritual Eye-Salve: Therefore turn to the Grace of God within you, <hi>that,</hi> as in former Dayes, ſo in this is the Saints Teacher, then ſhall you never be without a Teacher: And repent of the Evil of your Doings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Day be paſſed over, and it be hidden from your Eyes, though you ſeek it with Tears, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And as for me, I paſs not to be judged of you, or of Man's Dayes; he that judgeth me is the Lord, and his Witneſs is with me in what I write; and as for my Books ſo taken and ſo detained by you (after demand) as is ſaid; let me have your Anſwer in Writing; a ſmall Requeſt from him, that for ſeaven Years ſerved with you, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and Treaſurer of the Country; yea, and had to this Day, if in ſo doing he could have ſerved the Lord Jeſus; for I am yours in the Service of Truth,</p>

Now Friend, thou ſheweſt what Spirit thou art of, by thy Untruſtineſs and Wickedneſs in burning a Letter, that concerned others in Authority with thee, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to take notice of: Is this thy fulfilling of the royal Law, <hi>To do to others, as thou wouldſt have others to do to thy ſelf</hi>?
