            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce I came home from <hi>London,</hi> I have taken some time to consider of those Solids and Lines made by the Sections thereof; proposed to Consideration (to my Lord <hi>Brouncker</hi> and your self, at your Lodgings, where I was also present) by Mr. <hi>Pett,</hi> one of His Majesties Commissioners for the Navy, and an excellent Shipwright.</p>
            <p>The Bodies proposed to consideration were all of this form. On a plain Base, which was the Quadrant of a Circle, (like that of a Quadrantal Cone or Cylinder) stood an erect Solid, whose Altitude (being arbitrary) was there double to the <hi>Radius</hi> of that Quadrant; and from every Point of its Perimeter, streight Lines drawn to the Vertex, met there, not in a Point (as is the Apex of a Cone), nor in a parallel Quadrant (as in a Quadrantal Cylinder), but in a streight Line or sharp Edge, like that of a Wedge or <hi>Cuneus.</hi> On which consideration, I thought fit to give it the name of <hi>Cono-Cuneus,</hi> as having the Base of a <hi>Cone,</hi> and the Vertex of a <hi>Cuneus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the various Sections of this Solid, in several Positions, he did (rightly) conceive, that divers new Lines must arise, in great variety, different from those arising from the Section of a Cone. Some of which he supposed might be of good use in the Building of Ships; in order to which it was, that he proposed them to Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</p>
            <p>Now because he judged it troublesom (as indeed it would be) first to form such Solids, and then cut them by Plains in such Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions as he des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red; he had (for avoiding that trouble) ingeniously contrived this Expedient. He caused divers Boards, of a good solid Wood, to be exactly planed, some of an equal thickness, some meeting in a sharp edge; those of the former, he caused to be glewed together in a parallel Position; those of the latter sort, he caused so to be glewed together, as that their sharp edges met in one common Angle. And having thus formed several Solids, of Boards thus glewed together, he then caused them to be wrought into such a form as that before described: Which being done, he then caused the Glew
<pb facs="tcp:102624:3"/>
to be dissolved in warm Water, whereby the several Boards, falling asunder, did exhibit, in their several faces, the respective Sections of those Solids. And such were those he shewed us; which being put together, made up such Solids; and taken asunder, shewed the several Sections of them.</p>
            <p>I do not intend at all to disparage the ingenuity of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, which was indeed very handsom, and neatly performed, but do withall suppose, that it would not be unpleasing to your self, or him, to see those Lines described in <hi>Plano,</hi> which would arise by such Section of the Solid.</p>
            <p>That therefore is the work of these Papers, to represent the true nature of such Lines, and the ways to draw them, without the actual Section of a Solid.</p>
            <p>Which I have the rather undertaken, because this is a Solid which I do not know that any other have before considered. And because this may be a Pattern; according to which, other Solids of like nature may be in like manner considered if there shall be occasion.</p>
            <p>If beside these Sections which he hath already considered, there be any other Sections of this or other the like Solids which he shall conceive useful to his purpose; the same may in like manner be represented (without the actual Section of such Solids) by Lines thus described in a Plain.</p>
            <p>But which of them may be most advantageous to his design, I do not pretend to understand so well, nor can with so much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty affirm; as, that I am,</p>

Supposing then from every Point of the Quadrantal Arch DQ, to their respective Points in the streight Line BA, in Plains parallel to the Triangle CQA, the streight Lines Sa to be drawn, compleating a Curve Superficies DSQAaB; the Solid thus contained, I call a <hi>Cono-Cuneus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It differs from a Quadrantal Cone, in this only; That what is here a streight Line AB, is there a single Point; all the Lines drawn from the Points S, meeting there at the Point A.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It differs in this from a Wedge, or <hi>Cuneus;</hi> That what is here a Quadrant CQD, is there a Rectangle.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It differs in this from a Quadrantal Cylinder; That what is here a streight Line AB, is there a Quadrant, equal and parallel to CQD.</p>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>First;</hi> If it be cut by RSa, a Plain parallel to the Triangle CQA, the Line Sa is (by construction) a streight Line; and therefore, the Hypothenuse of a Right-angled Triangle SRa.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And consequently, this <hi>Cono-Cuneus</hi> is equal to half a Quadrantal Cylinder of the same Base and Altitude: For every of the Triangles SRa in the <hi>Cono-Cuneus,</hi> being half the respective Rectangle in the Cylinder, the whole of That will be equal to the half of This.</p>

               <p n="66">66. But these four last mentioned (and divers others, though somewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from them) do all fall under one General, as so many Particulars of it: For the better consideration of which, I shall compleat the Body (or at least the half of it) which is here but Quadrantal; and imagin it farther to be continued downward (below its Circular Base) so far as shall be necessary; and continued upward (after an intersection in the Line AB) in like manner, as opposite Cones are wont to be considered.</p>
               <p n="67">67. Supposing then (<hi>Fig.</hi> 10.) on the Center C, and Diameter ΔD, a Circle described ΔSQD; and CQ perpendicular to the Diameter ΔCD, dividing the Semicircle ΔQD into two Quadrants; and (at Right Angles to the Plain of the Circle) a Rectangle ΔDBβ, divided into two equal parts by the streight Line CA; (and therefore, joining QA, the Triangle CQA will be at Right Angles to both the Plains:) And from every Point S in the Perimeter of the Circle, to the respective Points a in the Line Bβ (in Plains parallel to ACQ) the streight Lines Sa to be drawn, compleating on either side of the Rectangle a Curve Superficies ΔSDBβ: These with the Circle contain a Solid, which I call a <hi>Cono-Cuneus,</hi> made up of four such quadrantal Solids as are above descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed at § 1. which Solid (and its Opposite, made by a decussation in the Line Bβ) we suppose to be continued as far as is necessary.</p>
               <p n="68">68. If this Solid be cut by a Plain at Right-Angles, to the Rectangle ΔDBβ, the Section of that Plain, with this Rectangle, will be either parallel to BD, (and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102624:10"/>
then the Section will be a Right-angled Triangle, as in our first Case, § 6.) or parallel to DΔ; (and then the Section will be an Ellipse, as in our second Case, § 13.) or at lest will obliquely cut the two opposite Sides βΔ, BD, (produced, if need be) in δ, d; which Line δd I call, the Diameter of the Curve Line, made by the Section of the Solid.</p>
               <p n="69">69. And, under this last case, fall the four last of these before-mentioned, (the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh) as appears by the Scheme: Where Cd, CB, Cb, answer the fourth Case; Δb, Δc, ΔA, answer the fifth Case; Bc, BC, Br, answer the sixth case; and Aδ, AΔ, Ar, answer the seventh Case. But the Curves answering these Diameters I have omitted, to avoid confusion in the Figure.</p>
               <p n="70">70. Now a Point being assigned (<hi>Fig.</hi> 11.) in any of the Diameters δd, the Ordinate, or perpendicular height of the Curve over that Point, is thus found Geometrically: By the Point assigned ρ, suppose aρR drawn parallel to BD, cutting βB in a, and ΔD in R; on which, suppose a Perpendicular Plain ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, cutting the Semicircle ΔSD in RS, and the Solid in a RSa Right-lined Triangle; wherein ρσ being drawn parallel to RS, will be Perpendicular to the Plain of the Rectangle, as is the Line RS: And therefore σ is that Point of the Curve-Super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="71">71. Therefore the Point ρ being given, a and R be known also; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, RS the Ordinate or Right-Sine belonging to the Point R, in the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle ΔSD: Then, because a RS, aρσ, are like Triangles, <hi>As</hi> aR <hi>is</hi> to aρ, <hi>So</hi> is RS <hi>to</hi> ρσ.</p>
               <p n="72">72. Having thus found as many of the Points σ as shall be thought necessary, a Curve-Line regularly drawn by them is that Curve to which δd is the Axis.</p>
               <p n="73">73. The Arithmetical Calculation may be thus performed: Supposing ΔD to be divided into any number of equal parts at the Points R, the Lines Ra (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced if need be) will divide δd into the same number of equal parts at the Points ρ: And if, from d, be drawn de parallel to Δδ, cutting Δβ in e, and ρε from the Points ρ, the Parallels ρε will cut δε into the same number of equal parts.</p>

First; Let any streight Line, at pleasure, LM (<hi>Fig.</hi> 12.) be divided at the Points ρ, into any number of unequal parts, as a Line of Ordinates at equal distances in the Quadrant of a Circle; (in like manner, as the Line CQ is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the Points S in the first Projection, <hi>Fig.</hi> 16.) and on the other side of M, let λ M be so divided also into the same number of Parts; and on the several Points ρ, M, erect Perpendiculars, continued both ways as far as shall be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Which general Construction is applicable to any case at pleasure; and being once drawn, may successively be applied to many.</p>
               <p n="83">83. Then (supposing, in the Solid proposed, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. δ E, parallel to Δ D, cutting AC in E; and Eq, parallel to CQ, cutting AQ in q;) set off, in the Perpendicular at M, <hi>Fig.</hi> 12. a Line ME equal to that Eq in the Solid, and draw the streight Lines E λ, EL; which Lines will cut off, in the other Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels, the Lines ρ S, equal to the Ordinates of that Ellipse in the Solid, (<hi>Fig.</hi> 11.) whose Axis is δ E; (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch as are R σ in the second Projection, <hi>Fig.</hi> 17.)</p>
               <p n="84">84. In like manner, (supposing, in the Solid, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. de parallel to D Δ, cutting CA, or the continuation thereof, in η; and η q, parallel to CQ, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting QA, or the continuation thereof, in q;) set off in the Perpendicular at M, (<hi>Fig.</hi> 12, 13.) a Line M η equal to η q; (on the same side of λ ML with ME, or on the contrary, according as d and δ are on the same, or opposite Sides B β;) and draw the streight Lines η λ, η L; which Lines will cut off, in the other Parallels, the Lines ρ s, equal to the Ordinates of that Ellipse in the Solid, whose Axis is η d.</p>
               <p n="85">85. Then (dividing E η into as many equal parts at the Points ω, as are the unequal parts in λ L) from every of the Points ω, draw streight Lines to λ or L respectively; which Lines will cut off, in the respective Parallels, ρ S, (the first in the first, the second in the second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> numbering the Points ω from E, and the Parallels from λ;) the Lines ρ σ, equal to the desired Ordinates of the Curve proposed.</p>
               <p n="86">86. Lastly; Drawing a streight Line δ d (<hi>Fig.</hi> 14, 15.) equal to that in the Solid (the Diameter of the Curve proposed); and dividing it in the Points ρ into as many equal parts, as are the unequal parts in λ L; and to each Point of Division, applying at Right Angles the Lines ρ σ, equal to those upon the Line λ L (on the same or contrary sides of δ d, as those are of λ L); and, by the Points σ, drawing the Curve-Line which they direct: This Curve-Line is the same with that which is made by the Section of the Solid proposed, by a Plain on the Line δ d at Right-Angles to the Rectangle Δ DB β.</p>
               <p n="87">
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102624:11"/>87. The same may be performed by one of the Triangles λ ME, <hi>Fig.</hi> 13. reckoning the Parallels therein twice over, (the Ordinates in each Quadrant being the same) and dividing E η into as many parts as before.</p>
               <p n="88">88. If the Base Δ SD be an Ellipse, this process will be the same as in a Circle; but if it be a <hi>Parabola, Hyperbola,</hi> or other the like Curve, the Line λ L, which is now divided as a Line of Ordinates at equal distances in a Circle, must then be divided as such a Line of Ordinates of that <hi>Parabola, Hyperbola,</hi> or other Curve, whose Axis is Δ D: And then the rest of the Operation pursued with very little alteration.</p>
               <p n="89">89. In the whole Progress, I have still supposed the Parallelogram ABDC to be Rectangular, and the Quadrant CDQ at Right-Angles with that Plain, and the Triangles ACQ, a RS, at Right-Angles to both of them (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Body to be Erect, not Scalene); and the Plain cutting this Body, to be also at Right-Angles with that Parallelogram. But in case any of what we suppose to be Rectangular, should be Oblique, the Sections will be somewhat different from these described, in like manner, as the Sections of Scalene Cones, or the Oblique Sections of Erect Cones, differ from the Right Sections of Right Cones. But of these cases, I intend not here to discourse farther, contenting my self with the Perpendicular Sections of these Erect Solids.</p>
