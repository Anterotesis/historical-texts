         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OR,
An Anſwer to a Libellous Sheet,
Entituled,
The Quakers Laſt Shift Found Out.</head>
            <p>IT is with no ſmall Regret, <hi>Sober Reader,</hi> that I am thus neceſſitated to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
my own and my Friends Innocency, againſt theſe Unfair Aſſaults: I
prefer Peace before War; and heartily deſire loving Neighbourhood, rather
then daily Conteſt; but this is our Satisfaction, we did not begin with them, but
were begun with by them: And ſuch great and general <hi>Accuſations</hi> call for the like
<hi>Defences;</hi> ſince where <hi>Charges</hi> go unanſwered, <hi>Guilt</hi> is moſt uſually reflected, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where WE are concerned; there being a ſort of Men <hi>devoted to miſconſtrue</hi>
whatever we ſay or do, with whom it is become Criminal to defend our ſelves; and
do deſerve to be chid for ſaying, <hi>They wrong us:</hi> Such continued Unchriſtian Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
againſt us will, I hope, give all Impartial People to hold me excuſed for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
this <hi>ſecond Vindication,</hi> which I intreat them in the Love of God to conſider,
that they may the better find out where the SHIFT lieth, whether in us, or this
<hi>Nameleſs</hi> Author and his Abettors.</p>
            <p>The Intent of my paper was, to meet with the <hi>Vox populi,</hi> or common Fame, that
as we might be defended, ſo the People diſabuſed, by declaring, that <hi>notwithſtanding
thoſe Defamatory Reports City and Country had credited againſt us, we had</hi> NOT <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their Information of the Meeting, much leſs</hi> deſignedly <hi>avoided it; That it was
unfair to concern us in a Meeting without our Conſent; and that we made them a ſolemn
Offer of a Publick Meeting,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee how well he hath made good his <hi>Title-Page,</hi> in which he calls his
Paper an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to mine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He tells us, that</hi> We made an Appeal to the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> againſt <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> and that upon
this Appeal the Teachers and Elders among them deſired <hi>T. H.</hi> that he would in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Meeting bring forth his Evidences and Witneſſes: That Mr. <hi>Kiſſin</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Knowls</hi> wrot Letters the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Aug.</hi> to <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> informing them of Time
and Place.</p>
            <p>But what is all this, to prove that we receiv'd any <hi>certain Account</hi> from them of
the Meeting; that we <hi>purpoſely</hi> avoided the Meeting; and that we were ſo far uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in it, as that our <hi>Conſent</hi> to meet was unneceſſary? The Ground of my Paper.</p>
            <p>He ſayes that <hi>G. W. had notice at the</hi> Vizes, <hi>having ſeen a Letter of</hi> T. Hicks, <hi>ſent
to one in that Town:</hi> But ſuppoſe it to be true; what is that to me, the Perſon moſt of
all concern'd in the matter? Or, how doth this reach <hi>P. Ford's</hi> Letter, writ to inform
them of my Abſence, and to deſire <hi>the Meeting might be ſuſpended, to prevent vain
Boaſting?</hi> Was it ſuſpended? <hi>No.</hi> And hath not vain Boaſting followed? <hi>Yes.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> A
Surreptitious Meeting! A Vain Triumph! Doth not this Proceeding rather give to
ſuſpect a <hi>Deſign</hi> to meet in our Abſence, that made it of no moment to the Meeting,
<hi>after they heard of it,</hi> though before they wrot for, deſired and expected our Preſence.</p>
            <p>But ſaith he, <hi>W. P. was at home the Night before:</hi> Grant it; Muſt I therefore hear
or know of any ſuch Meeting, or my Concernment in it? <hi>I received no Account,</hi> I ſay
again, of either the Meeting, or my Relation to it, directly or indirectly, till about Ten
the Night after it was over. And for <hi>G. W'</hi>s Knowledge of the Meeting, it is expreſt
with Injuſtice both to him and my ſelf; for he had not that Account which belonged
to him to have; Therefore <hi>not His</hi> Account. What was a <hi>Rumor</hi> to him; or <hi>T. Hicks'</hi>s
<hi>Letter</hi> to another man, receiving no Account himſelf, much leſs any Account of his
Concern in the Meeting <hi>till the</hi> 29th <hi>of the laſt Month, which was the Day after the
Meeting.</hi> Beſides, muſt we take it for granted that G. W. was juſt then at Leiſure to
take Poſt for the Meeting; under both it had been well nigh impoſſible for him to reach
it; for this <hi>Author</hi> tells us, that <hi>T. H. writ</hi> not till <hi>the Tueſday before</hi> the Fryday (ſo
call'd) on which the Meeting was appointed; which was to give him little above a
Day to ride about four ſcore Miles: Moreover, He was then pre-engaged for <hi>Briſtol;</hi>
and ſo ignorant of his Concernment in the Meeting, as he after that writ to his Wife
<hi>to Know</hi> if our Friends were concern'd in it. This his SHIFT is too Thread-bare
to palliate that unworthy Surpriſe</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Others had <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>aith he What then? ſay I. Were not we the Perſons chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern'd? Could any Body elſe have anſwer'd for <hi>T. Hicks.</hi> beſides himſelf?
Who then could fill up our room, e<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pecially in matters of Fact? If T. H. was thought
fit to be there to explain and vindicate his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> then ſhould we in Defence of our
Anſwers: But, if our Abſence might ſo eaſily be diſpenſed with, why ſhould <hi>T. H'</hi>s
Preſence have been ſo requiſite? for <hi>T. H</hi> and his Books, againſt our Books only,
were unreaſonable Odds. The Plea ſhould have layn between Books and Books, the
Controverſie being written: And if it was needful that as well he as his <hi>Dialogues</hi>
ſhould be there, then that as well we as our Anſwers; though I cannot ſee with what
Liberty we could have defended our ſelves, ſince <hi>Such as offered to ſay any thing on our
behalf, were interrupted;</hi> which gives us Cauſe enough to believe, that this Perſon
was beſide the matter, when he tells us, that <hi>the</hi> Baptiſts <hi>were glad to ſee any of us there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he ſays, <hi>That I Prevaricate,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>The</hi> Baptiſts <hi>concern'd us in that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when we concern'd the</hi> Baptiſts <hi>in that Meeting:</hi> A SHIFT to be ſure, though not
his <hi>Laſt.</hi> I would fain know, if we were not concern'd in that Meeting, becauſe we
concern'd the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> in that Meeting; as I take it, we were reciprocally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that Meeting, and therefore equally intereſted in the Appointment of Time and
Place; for was there not the ſame Reaſon that we ſhould be there, <hi>viva voce</hi> to
make good the Charge in our Book, as that T. H. ſhould be there, <hi>viva voce</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to clear his Book from our Charge? Never can they defend themſelves from
that Injuſtice. It is not the part of a juſt Judge, to hear and determine for one Party
in the Abſence of another. Beſides, for what End did they pretend to give us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
if not that we ſhould be there? It muſt not be forgot, that while <hi>in their Letter to
me they d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſire and expect it,</hi> in the Letter to <hi>J. Oſgood they render it needleſs;</hi> nay,
it was aſſerted by one eminent among them in that Meeting, as I am credibly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>That neither G. W. nor W. P. were concerned to be preſent:</hi> If ſo, why was our
undeſigned Abſence reputed and reported to be the Conſequence of our Fears?</p>
            <p>But the Man thinks he hath a ſtronger Argument then all this, in my Book (inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
the <hi>Spirit of Truth Vindicated,</hi> pag. 78. <q>That to which an Appeal is made
muſt be capable of giving an Infallible Judgment, and ſo a true Judge, or elſe
the Appeal is Fooliſh.</q> He is ſo wiſe as to leave the Application to his Reader, for
which Way he could make it bear to his Purpoſe, I know not: But let it ſuffice, <hi>Firſt,</hi>
That I made not the Appeal by him recited, as the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> of my Book proveth:
<hi>Next,</hi> Nor can any ſober Man think, we intended by our Appeal to the <hi>Baptiſts</hi>
our abiding by their Judgment, be it right or wrong; They very Words of it ſhow
the Appeal to the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> was not to try <hi>whether</hi> T. H. <hi>was guilty;</hi> but for <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt him,</hi> having proved him guilty; for that were to admit of their Judgment,
to conclude us againſt our ſelves; they themſelves will not think us ſo kind to them:
Take the Appeal as this Perſon recites it; <hi>Now if you the Teachers and Elders among
the Baptized People do not publickly clear your ſelves of</hi> T. Hicks, <hi>and theſe his unjuſt
Proceedings againſt us; we may take it for granted, that you own his VVork, and may
juſtly deal with him as the</hi> Baptiſts <hi>great Champion, peculiar Agent or Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
&amp;c.</hi> Now I would fain know which Way this binds us from all further Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
upon the ſame Score? Nothing can be well clearer, then that this Appeal aim'd
no further, then to know <hi>whether the</hi> Baptiſts <hi>did and would own or reject</hi> T. H'<hi>s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
that we might the better underſtand whom to addreſs our ſelves to next time.</hi>
There is great Difference in the Nature of Appeals: And the Reaſon of my Writing,
as he citeth me, was, to prove the <hi>Light</hi> capable of giving an infallible Judgment, from
my Adverſary's acknowledging it to be the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> and appealing to it, as a right
Diſcerner, for Judgment about what is right, and what is wrong, which this Perſon,
<hi>T. H. like,</hi> left out: Howbeit, thus far what he cites, reacheth our preſent Caſe;
for <hi>doubtleſs, they had Power to give Judgment againſt</hi> T. H. <hi>if they had been but as
willing to uſe it, having ſuch clear Evidences in our Books before them.</hi> Nevertheleſs,
this doth not prove, <hi>That we knew of the Meeting, that we were unconcerned in it, or that
we deſignedly ſhunned it:</hi> The Foundation of our Paper, no wayes ſhaken by this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller's
Sheet. The Meeting was pretended for a <hi>Church-Examination;</hi> but almoſt
every where, in and about <hi>London,</hi> noiſed by the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> themſelves to have been
for a <hi>Diſputation,</hi> and our Abſence accordingly interpreted: A manifeſt Injury to
our Books, Perſons and Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>For my Offer to <hi>J. Gladman,</hi> he meanly ſhifts it, and ſeeks to creep out at the
Word FORMAL; ſo that we are to read it thus, <q>
                  <hi>VVilliam Penn</hi> did offer, but <hi>not
formally Challenge,</hi> to meet <hi>T. Hicks</hi> with the <hi>Bible</hi> in one Hand, &amp; with his <hi>Dialogue</hi>
in the other.</q> Let it be ſo; I hope it is enough to ſatisfie the World, that <hi>an Offer was
made and rejected:</hi> Nor is my printed One more Formal; for it was on Purpoſe made
to remove all Obſtruction to a Meeting, upon Terms formally propoſed; for which
I ſhall produce a Witneſs in convenient Time and Place. In the mean while it is to
be conſidered, that the Perſon miſtakes, when he makes T. H. <hi>to have offered</hi> W. P. <hi>any
ſuch Meeting,</hi> whatever he might do to <hi>G. VV.</hi> as the very Page he refers to in <hi>T. H'</hi>s
third <hi>Dialogue</hi> proves: Further, that he never offered me any Meeting, <hi>but in private,</hi>
and that too not till after he had <hi>twice publickly wronged me,</hi> which was refuſed, not
to decline a Meeting, but as reputing it too mean a Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>For his reflective Commendation of my <hi>Prudence,</hi> becauſe I did not, after their
Example, appoint a Meeting without their Notice; it ſpeaks ſo much the Juſtice
of my Proceeding, that it reflects Folly upon his Mention of it, and not a little Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
too, ſince a Meeting to be agreed upon by two Parties, cannot be ſaid <hi>to be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any one of their Breaſts,</hi> without telling a manifeſt Untruth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Black Menace of us and our Religion,</hi> with ſome <hi>Hydr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an</hi> Piece, ſuddenly to
be publiſht, we are very little ſolicitous about; our Conſciences are approved to
God in this Matter; and we hope (through his Aſſiſtance (however miſrepreſented
to the World) before we have done, to approve our Cauſe Juſt in the Minds of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
People.</p>
            <p>To conclude; ſince he tells us, <hi>That the</hi> Baptiſts <hi>have received Satisfaction in</hi> T. H's
<hi>Proceedings againſt us</hi> (and great Cauſe we have to believe, that ſome of them were
