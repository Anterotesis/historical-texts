            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PROCEEDINGS
AT THE
Seſſions, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>NEwgate</hi> hath not for a long time been more
thronged, nor a greater Goal-delivery
been known, then at the Laſt Seſſions:
though for the moſt part the Crimes
were ſo foul, and the proofs ſo pregnant, that the
whole buſineſs was diſpatcht in three days time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62606:3"/>
But a remarkable inſtance of incorrigible wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
appeared in another, who but the very
laſt Seſſions was burnt in the hand, and yet took
thereby ſo little warning that he was now in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and found guilty of a Fellony and Burglary.</p>
            <p>For which crime three other Men were likewiſe
arraigned and condemned, having had the Brand
already. And a Woman who formerly had been
(an old offender in ſuch caſes) with another her
Companion were convicted alſo of a Burglary, but
only the former conemned to Dye, the laſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her belly, and by a Jury of Matrons was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to be with child.</p>
            <p>In brief there was in all 21 convicted of Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
or caſt, but ſeveral got off, ſome by being
burnt in the hand, and ſome by Tranſportation,
amongſt which there were two Boys that were
Brothers both by nature and in wickedneſs, one
not above eleven years old, but able in depth of all
kind of Roguery, to ſupply the want of years.</p>
            <p>But there was none to be
preferred to him, who for want of witneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelf guilty of a Robbery near High-gate
upon a Country Higler, who being coming to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
to London with ſome Poultry one morning ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
early was ſet upon by four of the Foot-padd,
who took away ſome of his Poultrey, for money
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62606:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had none, or very little about him, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
coming by they were forced to run away, and
thereupon the Perſon rob'd, and others after ſome
time parſuing after them, they at laſt took one of
them, which was the Priſoner now at the Bar, who
being arraigned for the ſame, reſolutely denied that
he was any of them, or knew any thing of or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Fact charged againſt him; and perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therein for a long time with ſo much ſeeming
earneſtneſs and obſtinacy, that the proſecutor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſuſpect his Eyes, and think that he might
be miſtaken in the perſon, till at laſt the Priſoner
deſired that ſince the witneſs had declared he was
robbed by four perſons, whereof two came before
his Horſe, and two behind him, he would declare
in which rank he then was, whither before or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
To which he anſwering that he was behind:
The Criminal ſuddenly and more loudly than wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
cry'd out. My Lord! this is a perjut'd Villain,
and you ought not to believe a Word he ſayes,
for by—I was at that time one of the 2 that
came up before him, whereby he confeſt himſelf
concerned, and was accordingly found Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>There was eight in all burnt in the Hand, ſix
ordered for Tranſportation, three ſentenced to be
whipt, and one to the Pillory for a Cheat.</p>
            <p>But for the particularities of Petty Larcetines,
and ſmaller Rogueries, it would be too tedious

of Murther, and that upon their own Children,
whoſe Crimes being ſo nearly reſembling each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we may place them together in this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
For being both Young Wenches, they
were it ſeems inticed to Folly, and at laſt got

came to be diſcloſed, and they reſpectively
Commited. They had little to ſay for themſelves

whereby it is provided in ſuch Caſes that unleſs
the ſame be proved by, at leaſt one Credible

            <p>After them we may reckon another who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
