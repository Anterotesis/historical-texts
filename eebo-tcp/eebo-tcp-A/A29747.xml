            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AMongst the Prejudices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Hearts of many of the People of this Generation are plagued, this is not the smallest or least; that they accept of, or reject what cometh to the publick view of the World<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> more as they affect or disaffect the Authors, then according to the Worth and Merit of the Thing published: And are more ready to say, <hi>As
<pb facs="tcp:44047:3"/>
concerning this Sect, we know that every where it is spoken against,</hi> Then to say, <hi>But we desire to hear of thee, what thou thinkest,</hi> Or with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bereans,</hi> to search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daylie, whether these Things be so or not.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Reader,</hi> For removing thy Prejudices, know, that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sheets exhibite unto thee, several Precious and Excellent TRUTHS, not to be found every where so succinctly and yet clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled; Which, if thou hast any Spiritual Senses exercised to discern Good and evil, may by the Blessing of <hi>GOD,</hi> prove whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Food to thy Soul: And if thou hadst known the Reverend and Worthy <hi>Author,</hi> thou could'st
<pb facs="tcp:44047:3"/>
not for his sake, have had the least ground to be prejudged at any Truth, that ever did come from his Pen. And for thy better Knowledge of him, he hath left some Monuments behind him of his singular Piety and Learning, which if perused, would no doubt make him great in thy Esteem: And these Monuments are extant in his Writings, both in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> in <hi>Polemick</hi> and <hi>Practical Divinity;</hi> Such as his Book, <hi>De Causa Dei, contra An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Sabbatorios.</hi> His <hi>Refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Errors of</hi> Wolzogius <hi>and</hi> Velthusius, <hi>about the Right Interpretation of Scripture, and about Church Government,</hi> And an Manuscript intituled, <hi>Defensio Ecclesiae Scoticanae, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44047:4"/>
Which was exhibite to the <hi>General Assembly</hi> of this Church, <hi>Anno 1692.</hi> And is not yet published, but we wait for it, and expect that it shall be of the same Accuracie with the rest: All these, he hath Writen in <hi>Latine</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Moreover he hath written excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and made evident the dreadful tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their pestiferous Errors; And for <hi>Practical Divinity,</hi> let the first and second Part of <hi>The Life of Faith,</hi> with his Book intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>CHRIST the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and it shall be evident that he hath done great Service to the Church of <hi>GOD,</hi> particularly in discovering from the Scriptures, the right way of making use of
<pb facs="tcp:44047:4"/>
               <hi>CHRIST</hi> for sanctification; A little Subject handled before him, especially in such a plain andclear Method.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Christian Reader,</hi> I would advertise thee, not to look for that Accurateness of expression in the following Sheets, which may appear in the Authors other Writings; For they are only some Notes of Sermons preached in the time of the Authors trouble, at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> for the most part in his own Chamber; Which after his Death, came to the hand of the Reverend Mr. <hi>James Kool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Minister of the Gospel at <hi>Sluis</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and by him were published in <hi>Dutch,</hi> as an Appendix to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Authors Book, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

And to conclude, I
<pb facs="tcp:44047:5"/>
am hopeful that the Reader shall find, that what pains he shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow, upon the perusing of them, shall not be in vain, they contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many Soul-Solacing Truths, so clearly proposed, together with many Pathetick Exhortations, and Soul-Searching Marks of Christians, all founded upon clear Scripture Testimony, and when perused, he shall say, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port he hath heard of them, was not only true, but that the half of what was true of them, was not reported.</p>

Having laid hold on Christ, as he is offered in the Gospel, and so resting on him for Salvation, wait for the breathings &amp; influences of the Spirit on the Soul, in the careful and earnest undertaking and pursuit of the means, that your head may be lifted up thereby in hope.</p>
            <p>For encouradgement thereto, observe these following things. 1. This lively <hi>Hope</hi> in the Soul, will calm many storms, and keep the Soul in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For further clearing and confirming hereof, observe these following <hi>Considerations.</hi> To wit. 1. That Christs being and living in the Soul, gives us to know the greatest Love and Respect He hath for that Soul: And whom he Loves. He Loves unto the end, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13 1. And what can separate the Soul from his Love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39.2. Christs coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Soul, intimates his union therewith, which union is fast, and who can loose it?

In a word, that he is in them, is begun Glory, Glory in the Seed, and in the out-sprouting: He is in them, working the work of Grace, and that is the foundation of Glory: Here they have begun Communion with him, and that shall never be broken off, but be carried on to a more imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This Truth makes way for confuting 1. <hi>Papists,</hi> who are against assurance of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and who defend and teach, that we are to fear and doubt all the dayes of our Lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As (1) Upon an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that God is merciful; which can afford them no more ground of the hope of Glory, then to all living, yea then to Devils. (2) Who build their hope upon their naked fancy of their good Heart, which is most false, the Heart being <hi>Deceitful above all things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately wicked</hi>: So is it an undoubted token that Christ is not in them: For since He i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Who build their hope upon their innocency and freedom from scandalous out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakings; with the Pharisee <hi>Luke</hi> 18 Yea a Heathen will pretend more then they.

Dead and formal Worship, is no assured hope of Glory. (6) Who build on the forsaking some Lusts and former evil practises, to which they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly addicted; whereas notwithstanding Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan may have a sure and certain Poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. This Truth serves to inform us of these two. 1. That the state of these, who are yet without Christ is very sad, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: For if without Christ, they have no hope of Glory: And what have they then, though they had the World at their disposal, and were swiming in Pleasure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>? Alas! they want that, which might sweeten the want of all other things, to wit, the hope of Glory. 2.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44047:51"/>
That the condition of those, who have fled to Christ, and have gotten that noble Guest, Christ in them, is unspeakably happy: For let their outward Estate be here in the World, what it will, they may Sing in the hope of the Glory of God; having Christ in them, so they have the assuredest hope of Glory imaginable: They have Christ, who is the whole Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant whereby Glory is ensured: They have him with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>n their Souls, who already hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them the possession of Glory, fitting them to have a Portion in the Inheritance of the Saints in Light: And who takes possession of them, that he and they may never more be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. This Doctrine contains also in it a Reproof. 1. To Unbelievers who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they be wholly without Christ, and his Spirit, nevertheless dreams and imagins, that they have an undoubted right unto Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; And so deceives themselves wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>h a vain and ungrounded hope, that all will be well with them at last. 2. For reproof to Believers, who have this assured ground of hope, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless improves it not for their comfort and encouragement: But holds themselves up with doubtings and scruples concerning their Right and Inheritance; taking heed to the lying whisperings and temptations of Satan, and so lives in Terrors, sinful Fears and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, whereby they wrong and grieve the

They ought to Labour to have this Truth, deeply rooted in their Hearts, that before Christ be in them, they can have no well grounded hope ever to see God in Glory. 2. That herein they are to be convinced of the necessity of giving ear unto the Call of the Gospel, and to give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto, which is (as we shall after hear) that we receive Christ, the Prince of Life in our Souls. 3. That therefore there should be nothing so desirable to them, as to have Christ living and working in their Souls<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and to rest on nothing less for a satisfying ground of the hope of Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 5. This Truth holds out unto us, the sure ground of the consolation of Believers, in whom Christ is: O! what cause of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and rejoycing have they, go as it will with them in the World: For though the World frown upon them, nevertheles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Objection,</hi> But it may be asked, how comes it then, that even such are more filled with fears and anxieties then others, concerning their Eternal Happiness and lively hope, and are continually in fears and doubting, posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Life often in sorrow?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is one thing to have Christ in us, and another thing to see him in us; This is a new and different Gift: And God may give the one, when he thinks good to with-hold the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. The Lord may thus for wise and holy ends measure out his Favours: As he is a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, so he is also wise; he doth what he will, and yet doth all in deep Wisdom, for wise and holy ends: The Lord may have a high and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign hand in this business, and may find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

therein themselves: And that (1) When they give too much heed to the lying Injections and temptations of Satan: It is not safe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain discourse with such an enemy, who is a Lyar and a Murderer from the beginning: He is too great a Sophist and Disputer for us. (2.) When they give too much way to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which darkens all, and gives Satan ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and occasion to accuse of Hypocrisy, and to alledge and say, providing Christ be in you, how is it so and so? (3) When by the false Injections of Satan, they Nick-name the work of Christ in them, consenting to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the enemy, and joyning with him in affording Objections against all the work of Grace in their Soul: And thus having filled their mind with prejudices against themselves, through the instigation of Satan, they are not in case, either to receive, or accept of any right Information concerning their Souls. (4.) It may also f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And because it is a material business we shall therefore speak the more to it. 1.
