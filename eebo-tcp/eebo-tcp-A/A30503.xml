            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

and many of his loving Subjects.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, He hath diſgraced the KINGS
Workes, by making weake Bankes,
when hee might have made them
ſtrong.</p>
            <p>SEcondly, by making hollow and counterfeit
Bankes of light Moore Haſſocks, and Sedge,
skimming and deſtroying three times ſo much
ground as would have performed the ſervice, if
he had taken the beſt of the ſoyle.</p>
            <p>THirdly, he hath diſgraced the Kings works
in cauſing divers Sluces and Saſſes to bee
made of rotten timber, which ought to have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43950:3"/>
beene made of the beſt Brickes or Stone, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they are to be placed for perpetuity.</p>
            <p>FOurthly, he hath abuſed the King in miſſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his treaſure.</p>
            <p>FIfthly, hee hath abuſed the late Earle of
Bedford, and divers Noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that adventured with him in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
by undervaluing the Works which they
made, and by hindering their proceedings, to
their extream loſſe and diſadvantage, and to the
great hindrance of all thoſe Gentlemen that are
intereſſed in that great Levell, conſiſting of
three hundred and ſeven thouſand Acres.</p>
            <p>SIxthly, he hath abuſed divers of his Majeſties
Subjects, in taking their Lands from them
illegally, without any compoſition or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>SEventhly, he hath expoſed to wilfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
hazard the Lands, Cattell, Corne,
and other goods of many of his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
ſo that they are in great danger of being
drowned this preſent winter, as doth appeare
by this inſuing diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43950:3"/>
THe firſt worke hee cauſed to be made,
was a Sea Bank in Wyſbeach Saltmarſh,
which is ſo ſlender, that three Roods of
the new Sea Banke hath not ſo much earth in it
as one Rood of the old Sea Banke. Hee ought
alſo to have armed the new Sea Banke with
Sods on that ſide which is next the Sea: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus ſleightly made, and not armed, the Sea
hath lately broke the new Sea Banke in divers
places, and weakned it for a great ſpace; but in
regard it was an eaſie flood, the damage is little
in compariſon of what it might have beene, that
Land being alwayes well ſtored with Sheepe,
that may ſoone be loſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond worke which hee cauſed to bee
made, was a Sluce at the outfall of a draine, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Sheir Draine, which worke he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to bee made in unſeaſonable weather, not
knowing (I am ſure not attending or not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
the danger, when it was plainly to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at the laying downe of the foundation:
for at that time the loſſe might have beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented:
it is ſaid that that Sluce, with the ſpade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
and miſchances which happened whileſt
the Pit was making, by the Seas breaking in
twice upon them, did coſt the King at the leaſt
three thouſand pounds, which money is every
penny loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43950:4"/>
The third worke was the inlarging of a part
of Wyſbeach River for the ſpace of a mile,
wherein he was as much wanting of the depth
of the Earle of Bedfords worke, as he exceeded
in unneceſſary bredth, (leaving the River as
narrow as the Earle left it, two miles above the
new Worke, and two miles below it,) a worke
that is broad and ſhallow may be made without
skill or care. And if the truth may bee ſpoken
without offence, ſuch is that worke. The depth
of that new Worke cannot be perceived above
one month in the yeare, and that is when the
winter floods have recovered the outfall to the
Sea; for ſo ſoone as the waters doe riſe in the
River, it ſeemeth to them that know not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
to be a very great inlargement, being
very faire to the eie, but wanting depth can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
no better then eye-ſervice.</p>
            <p>Whereas the River of Wyſbeach runneth
from the Towne Bridge to Guyherne fix mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
miles of the way towards Peterborough
in a neare and ſafe tract, in regard the ſoyle
where the River now runneth, is clay, earth, or
Silt; that ſubſtance would have inlarged the
Bankes on either ſide of the River, to ſo great a
proportion, that the Countries lying on either
ſide would have been much better ſecured then
ever they were in the times which are paſt: yet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43950:4"/>
Sir <hi>Cornelius Virmuden</hi> either through wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or weakneſſe, left the ſafe and neareſt way
where hee might have enlarged the River to
what proportion hee pleaſed, and ſecured the
Lands on either ſide from danger, as is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and made a new Banke of Haſſockes, light
ſpungy Moore, and Sedge, in a Fenne called
Walterley, where there is neither Clay, Earth,
nor Silt, unleſſe it be at the firſt entrance, for the
ſpace of a furlong. The new Banke ſo made, is
more then two miles and three quarters in
length; in which Worke he miſſpent at the leaſt
two thouſand and three hundred pounds (or
thereabouts.) Beſides which great loſſe to the
King, and damage to the owners of the Lands,
his intent is to lay foure hundred ſeventy foure
Acres of the ſaid Land, waſte to the ſaid River,
upon which Land there is three Tenements
newly erected, and two other that are ancient:
and this he will doe, as he falſly pretendeth, to
make that Land a receptacle for the common
Waters: whereas in truth he doth it of purpoſe
to doe me a miſchiefe, in regard I did contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
ſome of his opinions before the late Lord
Treaſurer, when my ſelfe was a Commiſſioner
for his Majeſty in October 1638. when God
knoweth that which I ſpake was in the ſincerity
of my heart, for the advancement of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
ſervice, without any by reſpects. One of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43950:5"/>
Workes which I then propounded, was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a Bricke Sluce below Spaulding, to keep
out the Sea Floods: and Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> diſliked
it, affirming that there was no way to draine
the Fennes, but by making of large Bankes: yet
now that he doth what he pleaſeth, he himſelfe
hath very lately not onely approved in ſpeech,
(for therein he is very giddy) but he hath cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
with a workman to make a Timber ſluce
with a Saſſe beſide it, to bee placed in the ſame
place, for which the King is to pay three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
and five hundred pounds, wherein appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his deceitfull dealing with the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Banckes,</hi> at
that time the Kings Atturney. And if the old
firme Banke were cut, ſo that the Common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
might come to the new hollow Bank which
he hath cauſed to be made, it is undoubtedly
certaine, that they will drown all the reſt of the
ſaid Lands, being at the leaſt foure thouſand
Acres; and if that were effected, it would bee no
way beneficiall to the generall Drayning, as
doth appear by a Certificate made by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Gentlemen, and Land holders in that
Country. Theſe Lands were banked and drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by an Act of Parliament made the fourth of
King <hi>Iames,</hi> and have ever ſince that time beene
maintained and upheld, and were not queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Earle of Bedfords undertaking. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43950:5"/>
there is no mention of making this Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
for the Common waters in thoſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> did deliver to the
Kings Majeſty in Ianuary 1638. Yet contrary
to all juſtice, hee hath taken theſe Lands from
the owners, without any compoſition or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and intends to drowne all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, he hath cauſed a Banke of H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſockes
and light ſpungy Moore (which in three or four
yeares will ſhrinke to leſſe then halfe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
which it now hath, and after that to be
ſo much leſſe, as it will bee little better then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
for it will bee hollow and ſpungy ſtill.)
Such a Banke he hath cauſed to bee made from
Guy herne to the Eaſt end of Wittelſey. He hath
alſo continued the ſame Banke (but in a better
Soyle) from the Weſt end of Wittelſey to Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground,
intending thereby to keepe the River
Neene from drowning thoſe Fennes which lye
betwixt theſe new Bankes and the North Bank
of Bedford River: and certainly they will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them this preſent Winter from Neene. But
if the North Banke of Bedford River bee ſetled
ſo low that the River of Owſe overtop it, and
make breaches in it (as I beleeve it will) thoſe
falſe fires will ſoone bee diſcerned. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
heard Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> fleight all the workes
which were made by the late Earle, as if they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43950:6"/>
were rather hurtfull then beneficiall to the
Country. But hee did the Earle great wrong,
for if thoſe Workes faile, all his Haſſock Banks
will not be worth three pence. Nor could hee
have made them, if the Earle had not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Wyſbeach River to the Sea, and kept the Sea
from choaking it againe; which was a worke
farre exceeding all that Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> hath done.
His plot is by ſubtilty to rob the late Earle and
thoſe Adventurers of the credit of their works,
and after that to make all ſuch as know not the
truth, beleeve that himſelfe with ten thouſand
pounds, will preſently make one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Acres fit for the Plow, which is a meere
deluſion. And as it is wicked in it ſelfe, ſo is it
attended with a danger much worſe then all
that hath beene yet diſcovered. And it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether it be not paſt recovery. This miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
hee hath caſt upon many of his Majeſties
Subjects, inhabiting the low Lands, called Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
in Lincolne ſhire, and the North ſide of
Wyſbeach, both which Countries are full of
people, and well ſtored with Cattell: they lye
betweene the Fennes and the Sea, and are much
lower then the Common Fennes: they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
from Inundation by Bankes conſiſting of
a ſandy ſubſtance, and are ſo low, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
defend the ſaid Countries from Inundation.
Now Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> hath turned the Southerne
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43950:6"/>
waters upon them; for there will come three
times ſo much water upon them now as did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The new Bankes were made in regard
Neene cannot paſſe in its owne Chanell to the
Sea, nor dilate it ſelfe over the face of thoſe
Fennes which lye on the South ſide of Wittel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,
as formerly they did.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, he hath cauſed a Timber Saſſe to bee
placed neare Stanground, which hath coſt the
King eight hundred pounds at the leaſt. The
uſe of the Saſſe I beleeve will be good (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
time) but I like not his direction, who
dares to ſpend the Kings money in Timber
workes, when indeed they ought to be made of
the beſt Brickes or Stone, I thinke rather
Stone then Brickes, in regard that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
affordeth great plenty of good Stone at ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cheape rates. This Saſſe is not onely made
of Timber, but of Firre Timber, and that ſo rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that it was not fit to be uſed in the making of
a good Stable; and in ſtead of Oken Plankes
three inches thicke, it is planked with Deale
boards but one inch thicke, which will be rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
before the other works are finiſhed.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, he hath cauſed divers petty Sluces
to be made of the like Timber and Deal boards,
which ought to have beene made of Brickes or
ſtone, in regard they are intended for perpetuity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:43950:7"/>
Eightly, he hath miſſpent the Kings Treaſure,
in giving over large wages unto many workmen;
for ſince Michaelmaſſe laſt, money being wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to forward this goodly deſigne, Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi>
procured ſome aſſiſtance from thoſe Gentlemen
whoſe Lands lye on the South ſide of Wittelſey,
(in regard theſe new Bankes will be ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
unto them) paying the workmen part of
their wages, in Bullockes, Sheepe, Beere, Cloth,
and other commodities; amongſt them there
were ſome payd part of their wages in Wheat at
fifteene Shillings the Combe, which did the next
day ſell the ſame Wheat for nine Shillings the
Comb. And if their wages were not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
large, the condition of thoſe workmen is
ſuch, that they will not worke two weekes to an
end, unleſſe they doe receive the due of what
they earne, much leſſe continue working two
months without pay, and then accept of nine ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
for fifteene. And here I beſeech you give
me leave to give my deceaſed Maſter, and thoſe
Noblemen and Gentlemen that adventured with
him, their due praiſe; from the firſt to the laſt of
their undertaking, their workmen never wanted
their wages, but were duly paid every weeke, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the untimely difference in the yeare 1637.
The reaſon why I mention this, is, that you may
the better diſcerne how groſly the Kings Majeſty
hath beene abuſed, not onely in the loſſe of his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43950:7"/>
treaſure, but in paying the workmen with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
and in commodities much inferiour to
them which I have named, and indeed not fit to
name, which for their baſeneſſe I omit. And all
this to ſupport an unadviſed action, which I am
confident will occaſion a thouſand times more
loſſe, then all the good which can be expected, if
duly conſidered.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if it be objected, That I have informed
againſt Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> in diſcontent, or becauſe he
by his ſubtilty did defeat me of my imployment
in thoſe Workes, after I had undergone the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
difficulties, and meaneſt ſervitude, from the
firſt day to the laſt of the late Earles undertaking,
or that I have wronged him in this my Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and cannot juſtifie every particular which is
here expreſſed; inſtead of relieving me, let mee
undergoe the diſpleaſure of all them whoſe helpe
I doe implore. But if that which I have diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
be true, I doe moſt humbly pray that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of my meane eſtate may by your Juſtice
be kept from utter ruine; and that a Commiſſion
of Inquiry may be directed to examine and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
my preſent loſſe, and future danger; and
that they may alſo conſider whether the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the foure hundred ſeventy foure Acres
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43950:8"/>
before mentioned, will bee beneficiall to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
drayning or not. And that in the meane
time it may be ordered, that the old Banke
may not bee cut.</p>
