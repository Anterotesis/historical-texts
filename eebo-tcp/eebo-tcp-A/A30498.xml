         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ANother Letter coming to our hands subcribed <hi>J. T.</hi>
the tendency thereof being to beget a dislike in <hi>R. L.</hi>
(to whom it was writ) to the Principles of Truth,
as prosessed by us the truly reformed Christians, called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
and to prevent the writing of more such, occasion'd
our making thus publick the following Answer to Priest
<hi>Potts</hi>'s Letter; and the rather, understanding the said <hi>J.
T.</hi> saw it, and takes no notice thereof in his, although it
answers the substance thereof, excepting in these following
particulars.</p>
            <p>1. His accounting it an Errour in us not to swear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We in short say, we have Christs Command for not
Swearing, <hi>Matt. 5. 3, 4. Swear not at all:</hi> and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Apostle, <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. which we believe ought
to be observed by all Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104011:3"/>2. He charges us with denying the Trinity, as he terms it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We do really own the Three that bear record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost, and these
Three are One, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. and we also own the Three
that bear witness in Earth, the Spirit, the Water and the
Blood, and these Three agree in One, as <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and so we
do and always did believe, according to the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>3. He charges us with denying the Scriptures to be the
Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We believe the Scriptures to be what they call
themselves, a Testimony or Declaration, as in <hi>Luke 1. 1.
Joh.</hi> 5. 39. but Christ we own and believe to be the Word of
God, according to <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 13. so we own the
Word of the Lord that came unto the Prophets, saying, as
in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 1. and in divers othes places; and we own
and believe the Sayings of the Word, as recorded in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures: so the Word that came unto the Prophets
was the Sayer, or that which spoke unto them, and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are the words or sayings which the <hi>Word</hi> (or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ) spoke unto (and through) the Prophets; as
is evident from the Testimony of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.

            <p>WE having met with a Paper of thine, and finding our
selves and others of the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therein, with our Christian Religion and Faith in
the Lord Jesus Christ, which we are called to bear witness unto
and contend for, were not willing to let it pass without taking
notice of thy false Charges upon us and our Religion, together
with thy weak Vindication of thy self, with the rest of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of your Church in those things which thou hast yet to prove:
And we find our selves the more concerned because of thy Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
in thy Paper, where thou saist; <hi>It does become your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to make this plainly appear to you, and me, from whom they have
drawn you; and therefore if they can make it out, I again challenge
it of them and you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the way we would have thee take notice of this, that
<hi>Robert Lacky,</hi> in his Letter to thee, doth acquaint thee, that it
was the Light or Grace of God that let him see the Evil or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in himself and others, and so meerly the Love of God that
prevailed in his heart; so that it was not Man that drew him
from thee and thy Teachings, but the Lord Jesus Christ the true
Shepherd, whom the Father promised, that by his Spirit of Light
and Grace did draw him, and so fulfilled the Promise of the
Father in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 10. where he saith, <hi>He would deliver his
Flock from the mouth of such as fed themselves, that they might not
be meat for them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104011:4"/>In the first place we observe thou blamest him for saying. <hi>If
he or any other, through the Light of Gods Grace in the heart, do
see Defects in themselves or others, that profess that Religion where
in they were bred, he does not understand how he incurs Damnation
by forsaking it,</hi> &amp;c. And so in thy Answer blamest him <hi>for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
Religion</hi> (as thou sayest) <hi>with the Carriage of its Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> It's true, there may be wicked men Professors of a
most holy and pure Religion; and therefore for some particulars
being of an evil carriage, to condemn a Religion, is not proper:
But when a man finds and understands that in the Exercise of
his Religion he receives not power against Sin and Temptation
in himself, nor yet sees the effect of such a power in others (it
may be not in the very Teachers,) but that is lived in, which
answers not the Law of God, nor the Life of a true Christian;
and yet here is no dismembring of such, or excluding them from
their Church-Fellowship; This may justly give ground to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a Defect in that Religion: and therefore it may be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
for a man under these Observations, both concerning
himself and others, to enquire and seek after a Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Power may be enjoyed from Christ to overcome Sin, and
withstand Temptation; and we do believe thou thy self art
not ignorant how that not only many of the people of your
Church are of a loose Conversation, but diverse of your Clergy
also; and yet they suffered to abide in their Places and Offices,
without either being excluded or silenced; though the Apostle
exhorts to withdraw from every Brother that walks disorderly.
And again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. He writes unto the Church, not to
keep company with any called a Brother, that was a Fornicator,
or Covetous, or an Idolater, or Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner;
such thou maist see were to be denied Fellowship in
the Church. But we have often observed how that in your
Church there have been and still are both Swearers, Liars, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
and men given to other profaneness; and yet little zeal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104011:4"/>
appearing to excommunicate or exclude them. But when any
for Conscience sake could not pay the Priest his Wages, though it
were but some small matter, oftentimes such a one should soon
be prosecuted and excommunicated; so that by your practices
(whatever you may profess in words) you are more zealous
for your Gain and Interest, than for excluding Evil, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
Righteousness in your Church, and so, like them the
Apostle speaks of, <hi>who minded earthly things, whose end</hi> (he said)
<hi>was destruction.</hi> Phil. 3. 19. Now such practices are no marks
of the Church of Christ; but of a false Church, where there is
want of zeal for Righteousness; whereby it is manifest that you
are not in the undefiled Christian Religion, which keeps from
the Spots of the World, and leads into Fellowship with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and his Son. And therefore there was no such danger (as
thou insinuates in thy Letter) in his leaving of your Church, of
incurring the Damnation of his Soul, or choosing an unsafer way
to Heaven, in coming to that Religion he hath chosen.</p>
            <p>Next, we observe thou seemest to take an advantage at his
saying, <hi>It is the Light of Gods Grace that let him see the evil of
his own heart that he lived in, and the evil of others also;</hi> and so
wouldst strain these words, <hi>the evil of others,</hi> particularly to the
seeing of the hidden evils of their hearts in secret, as he saw his
own; whereas it is not to be questioned, but that he intended
the evil that others brought forth into Words or Actions:
Though when he speaks of himself he names his heart, saying,
<hi>my own heart;</hi> yet thou unfairly makest a great deal ado about
it, to bring him under blame, as if he assumed Gods Prerogative,
and plainly contradicted the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in the 14<hi>th chap.</hi> of
the <hi>Romans;</hi> but that thou hast no just reason for these thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours,
wise men may easily comprehend: However it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that through the Light of Gods Grace in the heart men
may come to see the defects in themselves, and also in others,
without assuming Gods Prerogative. And as to thy saying, <hi>It's
a Term often used by the Quakers, but not rightly understood by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104011:5"/>
them,</hi> thy Charge is false; The Quakers understand it, and thou
canst not make out the contrary, though it's easie for thee and
others to accuse; but that we leave upon thee to prove and make
out. But as for his seeing the wickedness of his own heart, it is
not to be questioned, and also to see the vanity and wickedness
of others is not difficult: For it is apparent enough, that men
that are in the Society of the people of your Religion may see
what is brought forth daily that is not agreeable to Christianity
both in words and actions, And seeing this, and that which
Christ lays down being granted, that <hi>out of the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaks, and a good man out of the good treasure of
his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
treasure brings forth evil things.</hi> Matth. 12. 35. Then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this Rule of Christs, by what men bring forth in their
Conversations the Heart may be judged; and though the Lord
search the Heart and try the Reins and to know secrets is his
Prerogative, yet what is thus manifested (according to the rule
of Christ) is no presumption to believe or give judgment in.</p>
            <p>And as to the Apostles words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. thou makest an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
application of them, in bringing them as a testimony
in this concern against him; for the case in which they were not
to judge one another, was in point of Faith, or their growth or
liberty therein; the weakness of the Faith of a weak Brother
was to be born with in that straitness that was upon some, as in
respect to Meats, and the observing of Days, which others were
grown over, that were not to be judged, but in point of Faith
were to be left to their own liberty; and in that case, saith he,
<hi>Let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth, for God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him;</hi> and he that did eat was not to despise him that did
not eat.</p>
            <p>So thou maist see that the Apostle had a regard to their
growth in the Faith, and so would have all walk accordingly
in wisdom, with care not to hurt one another: But what is this
to people of a loose life, whose words and actions are contrary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104011:5"/>
to the Law of God, and so sinful? May we bear no Testimony
against such? was it not the practice of the Prophets, Christ and
the Apostles to reprove such, and give Testimony against them,
and yet not contradict <hi>Paul</hi> in this case? How ignorant thou
shewest thy self to be of the Scriptures!</p>
            <p>But mark thy Judgment, and where it will fall; Have not
(these many years) your Church and Ministry been cencerned in
persecuting such as could not for Conscience sake, and in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of their Faith, observe days, and other things, which you
required; and when they could not conform to you, they have
not only been judged by you, but sorely abused, and cast into
Prison, put in the Stocks, and their Goods spoiled. Thus have
many suffered only for matters of Faith and Conscience towards
God: And so herein it is evident, that your established Church
thou speakest of is highly guilty of the Fact thou chargest to be
plainly contrary to the Apostle in that forecited Scripture in <hi>Rom.</hi>
and so is judging another mans Servant in that wherein he ought
to be left to his own Master, and presumest to meddle with Christs
Prerogative; so you are under thy own Condemnation, being
guilty of that which thou wouldst condemn in others: And this
to be your practice can be proved by many Witnesses that have
suffered upon this account by your Church both in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland.</hi> From what is beforesaid it's evident, that for a man to
say, that he sees the evil of his own heart by the Light and
Grace of God, and the evil of other men, which were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
with him in his loose Conversation, doth not bring him
under the Censure of the Apostle, as thou ignorantly dost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:
therefore thou maist take it home to thy self, and thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
as a just Judgment upon you for the reasons aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
            <p>Thou further sayest, <hi>that perhaps we will object, that Christ, in</hi>
Matth. 7. 16. <hi>says, ye shall know them by their Fruits,</hi> &amp;c. To
which thou answerest, <hi>he does so;</hi> but tellest us, <hi>it hath relation
to false Prophets,</hi> and withal wouldst insinuate as if <hi>the Teaching
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104011:6"/>
Quakers</hi> (as thou callest them) <hi>were such;</hi> but that they are such
is a false insinuation, which thou canst never be able to prove.
And <hi>by Fruits,</hi> thou tellest us, that <hi>both there and in other places
is meant the Doctrine of those false Prophets, or Teachers, that be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
the proper Fruits of such men, and not their particular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> That Christs words here have a relation to false
Prophets, we grant it, and that they are to be known by their
Fruits we also acknowledge; but that the Fruits there meant
are only their Doctrines, and not their particular actions, as thou
affirmest, we do deny. And that it is not so as thou saist, doth
plainly appear from the words of Christ in many parts of the
same Chapter: For first he saith, <hi>they shall come in Sheeps
Clothing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves,</hi> (so not in the
Sheeps Life.) And what is the Sheeps Clothing? Is it not the
words of the true Prophets, Apostles and Servants of God? as
appears by the Testimony of the Lords Servants, as may be
seen in <hi>Jerem. 23. 30. Behold I am against the Prophets, saith the
Lord, that steal my Words every one from his Neighbour.</hi> And
the Apostle speaking of Deceivers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 18. saith, that <hi>by
good words and fair speeches they deceive the hearts of the simple.</hi>
So that it is evident these false Prophets and Deceivers had
good words; for God said, they had stolen his words from their
Neighbours, &amp;c. and they had fair speeches, but were inwardly
ravening, from whence evil Fruits were brought forth: but that by
Fruits there is not meant their Doctrine, as thou saist. Observe
further what Christ saith in that Chapter; <hi>Do men gather Grapes
of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles? even so every good Tree bringeth forth
good Fruit: but a corrupt Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit, &amp;c.
Wherefore by their Fruits ye shall know them,</hi> ver. 20. And in the
following verses it is most clear, that by Fruits he means their
deeds and particular actions; for his words are, <hi>Not every one
that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven; but he that doth the Will of my Father, which is Heaven;</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:104011:6"/>
(so the Fruits here meant are doings, not sayings.) <hi>Many will
say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy
Name, &amp;c. and then will I profess unto them, I never knew you,
depart from me ye that work iniquity.</hi> Here the working of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
was the cause of their exclusion from him. And further,
speaking of the wise and foolish Builders, he saith, <hi>He that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
these sayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him unto a
wise man, &amp;c. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and
doth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, &amp;c.</hi> so that all
along it doth appear that the particular actions are the Fruits
whereby Christ declares they may be known, and accordingly
may be judged; though thou saist, many Hereticks, men who
have embraced vile Doctrines (as thou affirmest the Quakers do)
have been of good Lives.</p>
            <p>First. <hi>As to thy affirming that the Quakers do embrace vile Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;</hi>
that is false, and we turn it back upon thee as a wicked
slander, and challenge thee to bring them forth, that we may
know what they are that thou accounts so, and whether they
be ours or not. In the next place where dost thou read in all
the Scriptures of men that held vile Doctrines that were of good
Lives?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next matter thou takest in hand to defend in thy Paper, is,
[your Tithes, your great Dalilah:</hi>] for it's evident, that it is your
Tithes, and other Revenues, that is the very cause for which the
most of you did become Ministers; otherwise, we are perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we had not had one of a hundred in those Offices at this
day of you: for it's the Trade, as it's made by you, whereby
you get your rich Gain, that is chiefly in the eye of those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the preferring of Youth into the Schools; and we
think it is as much in the eye of the Ministers in their coming
out of the Schools, and going into the Nations to be Teachers,
as your practice doth manifest. So that Christ and his Gospel
is the least of your concern in the ground of your design, what.
ever may be pretended; For in all things mens ways and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104011:7"/>
are a more sure evidence to demonstrate what they are than
their words; therefore Christ saith, <hi>by their Fruits ye shall know
them:</hi> So that we do not wonder to find thee so concerned to
plead wordly Gain. But to come to the matter, <hi>thy business is
to prove Tithes of Divine Institution now under the Gospel Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi>
(which if thou do, then we will confess it is no defect in
your Religion.) Thou sayest, <hi>it will be no hard matter to do;</hi>
but thou hast not done it: and if it be so easie to do, thou
shouldst have done it to have convinced him that scruples its
Lawfulness. However it may be supposed, thou hast brought
thy chief proof, in quoting Christs words in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. and
<hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 42. where <hi>he speaks of the Pharisees paying Tithes of
Mint, Anise, Cummin, &amp;c. and tells them, these things ye ought
to have done.</hi> And then thou sayest, <hi>nothing can be plainer to them
that are not desirous to wrest the Scriptures to their own destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
So by thy own words this is thy chief proof, being (as thou
saist) <hi>nothing can be plainer.</hi> But as plain as thou wouldst make
the simple believe it is, all that are wise do clearly see that this
has no relation to the Gospel Dispensation, but to the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and Priesthood: And saith the Apostle, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 7. 12.
<hi>For the Priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change
also of the Law.</hi> And in the <hi>8th chap.</hi> thou maist see how he
proves the Law changed, and gives the Reason for the Lords
giving a new Covenant or Testament, and making the first old.
So its plain, the Priesthood that received Tithes, and the Law
that made them of Divine Right to the Priesthood, are both
changed, and both a new Law or Covenant and Priesthood set
up and established by the Oath and Promise of God, which are
the two immutable things by which God shews the immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Counsel abundantly unto the Heirs of Promise, for the
strengthening of their Consolation through Christ, that is made
an High Priest for ever, as thou mayst read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Now thy work is to prove Tithes of Divine Institution in the
New Covenant, and then to prove and shew the Priesthood
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104011:7"/>
that is, to receive them; for thou maist see both the Law that gave
them and the Priesthood that received them are changed; and
though Christ told the Scribes and Pharisees they ought to have
done it; that was according to the Law of the first Covenant,
which was not then disannulled, Christ not being offered up,
but he himself under it: for it is said, <hi>He was made under the
Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5. and
so he taught people to observe it; as when he had cleansed the
Leper, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. he bid him shew himself to the Priest, and
offer the Gift that <hi>Moses</hi> commanded for a Testimony unto
them: and so while under the Law he was for observing the Law;
but now that being ended in him, his Law is to be observed,
and what he has ordained we are to be subject to. But before
we speak to that, we are willing to take a little observation of
the difference between your Priesthood that now takes Tithes,
and Gods Priesthood that received Tithes by his Law in his first
Covenant. First, <hi>Levi</hi>'s Line, that was to receive Tithes of <hi>Israel,</hi>
had not their Inheritance of Land among their Brethren, this the
Lord ordered to be their Inheritance, to wit, Tithes and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which they were to have from the rest of the Tribes; as
thou maist see in <hi>Numb. ch.</hi> 18. And likewise when they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Tithes, which was all the Inheritance they had among
the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> they were not to have it only to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but the Stranger, the Fatherless and the Widow were to
have a share with them; they were to be relieved out of the
Tithes by the same Law, that there might be no Beggers; and
the Owner himself was also to partake of them, as thou maist
see in <hi>Deut. ch.</hi> 14. and <hi>ch.</hi> 26. So it is evident you far exceed
them as to self-advantage; you have all to your selves, your
Ministry is far more chargeable than the Priests under the Law;
neither Poor nor Owner must have a share with you, nor the
Payers of the Tithes eased from the burthen of the Poor, for all
that you get.</p>
            <p>Pray thee tell us how your Tithes come to be of Divine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104011:8"/>
Right? Thou saist, <hi>it is not hard to prove when demanded;</hi> we
demand it, and also deny it, do thou prove it if thou canst; we
are sure, if this Law were in force that gave it to <hi>Levi,</hi> you in
the using of it walk far beside the Law, and so still are under
Condemnation. Oh! is it not a shame, that men that pretend
to be Ministers of Christ, and can tell the people (as thou dost
in thine) <hi>of forsaking all for Christ,</hi> and yet in your practices do
neither walk answerable to the Freedom and Ease of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
nor Justice and Equity of the Law of the first Covenant?
And therefore we advise thee to lay down thy Religious Plea
for these Wages of thine; for we can account them no better
than <hi>Balaams</hi> Wages of unrighteousness, which he loved, but
durst not take, spoken of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 15. for it doth appear there
were such in the Apostles days that forsook the right way, and
followed <hi>Balaams</hi> Errour, and certainly we are not without such
now in our days.</p>
            <p>But now let us consider what Christ hath ordained, who is
the Lawgiver under the new Covenant; thou saist, <hi>though</hi> Paul
<hi>does not mention Tithes and Offerings, yet he speaks what is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to them.</hi> We desire to know what thou intends by <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent?</hi>
dost thou mean of an equal Value and Institution with
them? we grant what <hi>Paul</hi> saith to be just and reasonable, and
according to the Gospel, that it was no great thing where they
had sown Spirituals to reap of their carnal things: and thou seest
<hi>Paul</hi> puts it upon an <hi>If,</hi> and says, <hi>If we have sown spiritual things,</hi>
he claims no power to it else: But this will not serve you, you
cannot abide within the Gospel Ordination and bounds, no more
than you do the Law, about your Tithes, but you will reap
Carnals where you sow no Spirituals. Thou maist see also the
Apostle speaks of <hi>feeding a Flock, and planting a Vineyard, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Milk and Fruit;</hi> but still it's the Milk and Fruit of the
Flock and Vineyard that they had fed and planted, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens; But this will not serve you, let the Nations bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
you will reap whether you sow or not, you will eat whether
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104011:8"/>
you feed and plant or not; you will have it by force, like <hi>Eli</hi>'s
Sons, if you cannot get it otherwise: And thou bringst the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
words, <hi>Even so hath the Lord ordained that they who
preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel;</hi> and then queriest, <hi>doth</hi>
Paul <hi>say the Lord has ordained? and will you say the Lord has not
ordained? is not this to give the Apostle a flat lie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We answer, Nay, we will not say, nor never did, that they
which preach the Gospel may not live of the Gospel, according
to Christs Ordination; (but then it must be according to his
Ordination) and not according to mans Will and Invention, to
answer his own covetous Inclination. And we also grant what
the Apostle saith, <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word communicate
to him that teacheth in all good things;</hi> but still he must be a
Teacher, and it is from them that he teacheth that he must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it: But this will not please you, but you will have from them
that were never taught by you, as thousands in <hi>Ireland</hi> may bear
witness. So thou maist see here how impertinently thou wouldst
apply the Scriptures to them that have no right to them, upon
that account thou bringst them; but they will not serve thy turn.
And where is the Wrester of the Scriptures to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
that thou speakest of? Thou hast need to see if thou
canst clear thy self of it.</p>
            <p>Thou goest on, and saist, <hi>thou canst tell what we will say to these
and such like Texts; you will, I warrant you,</hi> (saist thou) <hi>say that
Tithes are not mentioned, &amp;c.</hi> But thou maist see thou wast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a mistake, and it was a vain confidence in thee to say so.
We have something else to say, as before. <hi>But you will allow
sure that they enjoin a Maintenance, &amp;c.</hi> Thou saist we will
allow that: But then let it be what the Lord has ordained,
and we are content. And now let us observe what that is in
<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. when Christ sent forth his twelve Disciples to preach
and heal the sick, he said, <hi>freely you have received, freely give;</hi>
and the Allowance he ordained for them, when he sent them
out without Money or Gold, was, that they might eat such
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104011:9"/>
things as were set before them; <hi>for,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Workman is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his meat.</hi> And in <hi>Luke</hi> 10. when he sent out his seventy
he gave them the like Command, and told them, they might
slay in that House into which they had entred, eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such things as they did give; <hi>for,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Labourer is
worthy of his Hire;</hi> and in the 8<hi>th vers.</hi> he saith, <hi>into whatsoever
City ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you.</hi> So here it was such as did receive them that they were
to abide with, and it was such things as they did give, and set
before them, that they were to eat: so it was the free act of
such as did receive them that they were to live upon, and be
supplied by. Here is no liberty to compell; but the Power of
the Gospel was to open their hearts to minister freely of their
Carnals, as they received freely of the Spirituals from them;
and this agrees with what the Apostle says in all those places
before mentioned; so that it is evident he had regard unto what
the Lord had ordained: But this will not serve your turn; you
cannot be content with what Christ ordains, and the Apostle
approves of, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 18. Thou shalt not muzzle the Ox that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out the Corn,</hi> and <hi>the Labourer is worthy of his Reward.</hi> The
question may be by some asked what this Reward is? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
clears it up in the 6<hi>th ch.</hi> 8<hi>th v.</hi> having in the former <hi>vers.</hi>
told <hi>Timothy, that we brought nothing into this world, and it is
certain we can carry nothing out;</hi> and <hi>having Food and Raiment
let us therewith be content.</hi> Here was the Counsel of an Apostle
to a Bishop; for it's said he was Bishop of the Church at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
Now things being well weighed according to the Scripture,
where is the Divine Right either for Tithes or the other great
Revenues you Clergymen compell the Nations to pay you? It
is not from Christs Command, nor the Apostles, nor from
any of their Examples, neither Apostles, Bishops, Pastors nor
Teachers: you are without Warrant from the Scripture; you
have neither Precept nor President for your Practices, either as
in respect to your great Revenues that you seek after and enjoy,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104011:9"/>
nor your manner of forcing people to pay you: All we see in
Christs Ordination that was to be done to them that would not
receive them and relieve them, was, they were to shake off the
dust of their feet, as a witness against them: and then Christ
shews the danger of their rejecting, but refers it to the day of
Judgment; but this will not serve you, though ye pretend to
be spiritual men, yet it plainly appears you are for your carnal
ends; you cannot trust your selves under Christs Care, to live
of the Gospel, and what that freely produceth in the hearts of
the people, as Christs Ministers did. And you may see what
they answered when he questioned them, as in <hi>Luk. 22. 35. And
he said unto them, when I sent you without Purse, and Scrip, and
Shooes, lacked ye any thing? and they answered, Nothing.</hi> So here
is Faith and Obedience, and the effects also of the Faith and
Obedience of Christs Ministers set before us for an example:
But it's evident you do no more love to follow the example of
the primitive Ministers, than you love to submit to what Christ
hath ordained; as appears by the great bustle thou makest, and
the many shuffling Arguments thou usest, to invalidate the
good example of the Apostle in that godly Care that was upon
him, that he might not make the Gospel chargeable; which is
no more than the real duty of every true Minister of Christ; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
you make it not your concern, as is evident from your
practices. And what if the Apostle had Power, and asserted his
Power? thou seest what Power he asserts in these words; <hi>Have
we not power to eat and to drink?</hi> and again, <hi>have we not power
to forbear working, &amp;c?</hi> as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. so thou mayst still see
that he pretended to no power above his Masters Commission,
who said, they might eat such things as were set before them,
the Labourer was worthy of his Meat: So still this makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for thee and thy Brethen; his Power you will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with no more than his Example; for then you know you
must not live in pride, height, fulness and idleness, as ye do:
and so being his Power will not answer your ends, you fly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104011:10"/>
from his Power, which was the Gospel which they that preached
it were to live by, to Man's Power and Law for your Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
and by that, force and compell people to pay you, for
whom you do no work, and to whom you cannot say as he did,
1 <hi>Cor. 9. 1. Are not you my work in the Lord?</hi> But alas! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands do you compel in <hi>Ireland</hi> to pay you, that are
not your work in this sense he speaks of? you have no concern
in their Conversion (if they be converted,) but whether they be
or not you matter not, you will have your Revenue from among
them.</p>
            <p>But thou tellest him, <hi>He does not consider that the Gospel of
Christ was but in its Infancy</hi>; Paul <hi>was but then planting it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to make it the established Religion of the Nations, as
now it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> was planting it, we grant; but that the
Religion which he endeavoured to establish is now the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion of the Nations, we deny: For, first, there is no such
Unity nationally in Religion, as he endeavoured to establish;
as in 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 10. Now I beseech you, Brethren, by the Name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, that there be
no Division among you; that ye be perfectly joyned together in the
same Mind, and in the same Judgment.</hi> Secondly, They are not
established in Holiness, and that Perfection, which he laboured
to establish and present in; as <hi>Col. 1. 28. Warning every man,
and teaching every man in all Wisdom, that we may present every
man perfect in Christ Jesus.</hi> And likewise in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. we read,
that he gave Ministers, and Gifts for the Ministry, <hi>for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the Saints, and for the edifying of the Body of Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
till they all come in the unity of the Faith to a perfect man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And 2 <hi>Corinth. chap. 7. ver.</hi> 1. His Labour was <hi>to bring them to
perfect Holiness in the Fear of God.</hi> This is the Religion <hi>Paul</hi>
and others endeavoured to establish in the Nations, and to
establish people in; and for this end <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the Believers
<hi>to be holy in all manner of Conversation,</hi> that <hi>as he which had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104011:10"/>
them was holy, so they might be holy. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 15. Here is
that which they laboured to make the established Religion of
the Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> Uunity, Perfection and Holiness in all manner
of Conversation. Thou affirmest that now it is made as he (to
wit, <hi>Paul</hi>) endeavoured to make it. If this were true, then the
Nations would be gathered into Righteousness and Holiness,
Unity &amp; Peace, Love &amp; Good will: But alas! there appears no
such Fruits of the true Religion amongst the generality of the
people of the Nations; which doth demonstrate, that there is
no such Establishment of it as thou hast asserted, whatever may
be professed in words.</p>
            <p>We take notice how much thou art offended at his telling thee,
that the Ministers wrought with their hands, and takest occasion at
the word Ministers, as if he had said, All laboured, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmest
it's very false: <hi>whereas he only saith Ministers in the
plural number (not All,) which is proved true by the Scripture
and thy own consession,</hi> who grantest that <hi>Paul</hi> and his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travelling
Apostles did labour with their Hands: And then when
thou hast asserted it to be false, thou challengest him to shew another
Apostle besides them in the New Testament, that wrought; For, <hi>saist
thou,</hi> they forsook their Boats, their Nets, their Trades for his sake
and the Gospel, and the New Testament doth not inform us that they
ever returned to these Trades again for a Livelihood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We read, <hi>John</hi> 23. that <hi>Peter,</hi> above three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was called by Christ, with several other Disciples, after
they had so forsaken their Boats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> went a fishing, and that
<hi>Peter</hi> then had his Fishers Coat, [<hi>not a long Gown, as those called
Ministers now wear,</hi>] and we do not believe they went for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but to get Fish; from whence we may groundedly conclude
that they used that Imploy for a Livelihood, at times, when they
were not immediately imployed in preaching the Gospel; and
we challenge thee to prove the contrary, if thou canst.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning thy querying for a Command for keeping the First day
of the week, or calling it the Lords day.</hi> We say, we meet together
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104011:11"/>
on the First day of the week, (for to meet is our Duty,) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
upon other days; and for this Practice we have both Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and Example; the Saints were commanded not to forsake
the assembling of themselves together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
every day is the Lords; and <hi>he that regardeth a day, ought
to regard it to the Lord: and he that regardeth not the day to the
Lord, he doth not regard it,</hi> Rom. 14. 6. But what Scripture have
ye for all such days as you observe, which are called such and
such Saints days?</p>
            <p>Thou saist, thou hast been the longer on this particular, because
thou findest it galls us most.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> When thou hast read our Answer (which by reason of
thine being so long, hath caused ours to be so too,) thou maist
consider of it, and of thy impertinency in quoting the Scriptures
to prove your Practice, which being well observed doth witness
against you; and then we doubt not but it will prove that which
will gall thee and thy Brethren, who are so found in such cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
practices as the Scriptures plentifully testifie against: and
for a further Testimony against your Practices, read these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Scriptures, of which for brevity sake, having been so long
already, we shall forbear to write the words, they that can may
read them in the Bible, <hi>Isa. 59. 9, 10, 11, 12. Jer. 5. 30, 31. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi>

            <p>In the next place, thou undertakest to inform him of some Defects
in that Religion he had chosen: <hi>and first,</hi> thou saist our Teachers
have no lawful Call to preach the Gospel, and quotest the Apostles
saying, <hi>Rom. 10. 15. How shall they preach, except they be sent?</hi>
that is, saist thou, how can they preach the true Doctrine of Christ,
unless they be sent by him, or by those Apostles of Christ who received
immediate Commissions from him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We grant what the Apostle saith, <hi>How can they preach,
except they be sent?</hi> &amp;c. But that our Teachers are not so sent
thou neither undertakest to prove by Argument nor Scripture;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104011:11"/>
although thou hast the confidence to affirm that they have no
lawful Call or Commission to preach the Gospel; which we turn
back upon thee, as a false Accusation; and demand of thee to
prove and make it appear to be true, if thou canst; for we do
believe that none can be true Ministers, but such as are sent by
Christ, and have their Call and Commission from him, and also
receive the Gospel which they preach, and their ability from him:
for the Scripture is plain, that the Gospel-Ministers were sent by
him, and received the Gospel they preached, and ability to preach
it from him, and not from men; as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 11, 12. and in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
3. 6. the Apostle saith, <hi>they were made able Ministers of the New
Testament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit;</hi> and in the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
verse he saith, <hi>our sufficiency is of God.</hi> And <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 7. he
declares, <hi>that he was made a Minister according to the Gift of the
Grace of God, given unto him by the effectual working of his Power.</hi>
And <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 11. If any man speak, let him speak as the
Oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability
which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And so from him, we say, we have received our Call by his
eternal Spirit, and do wait upon him to receive our ability daily,
that what we do may be by the Gift of the Grace of God
given unto us, that God in all things may be glorified: And if
this be not according to the Scripture, and the way of God, do
thou in thy next shew what is; and prove your way of being
bred up at Schools, and learning your Tongues, and taking your
Degrees there, and observing your Ceremonies in your Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and coming forth according to your Traditions, and then
looking for a Benefice the greatest you can get, and then settling
in a Parish for so much a Year, until you can hear of a Place
with a greater Benefice, and then remove for greater Gain and
Preferment, and while you stay in a Parish take such Lordship
upon you, that none of your Church or Hearers may have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to speak, or preach, but such as are so ordained as you are.
Clear these things in thy next to be according to Scripture, if
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104011:12"/>
thou canst. In the mean while we charge this method and these
doings not to be according to the Rule of the Gospel, or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the primitive Ministers; that this is your practice, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
thou canst not deny: But in the true Church this Order
and Liberty was ordained by the Apostle, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 30,
31, 32. <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
first hold his peace; for you may all prophesie one by one, that all may
learn, that all may be comforted; and the Spirits of the Prophets
are subject to the Prophets.</hi> But this Liberty which the Apostle
ordained you do not admit of, no more than you do of other
things, which were the practice of the true Church, and Christs
Ministers; but instead thereof are gone into things which are of
Mans ordaining and setting up. And therefore <hi>Robert Lacky,</hi> and
all in whom God hath opened an understanding to see you aright
have reason enough to forsake you and your Church: and as for
those Scriptures thou quotest to prove a successive Power to send
others, they make nothing for your method of Ordination at all;
for, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. he said, he would be with them, <hi>&amp;c</hi> doth not say
they should send others. In <hi>Acts</hi> 1. the Apostles desired one in
the place of <hi>Judas,</hi> to be numbered with them, and he was chosen
by lot: so here was the Lords lot. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. it is said
they ordained Elders in every Church. Now how these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
do prove a true Succession to your Call and Ordination,
let all that are wise in heart judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Thou saist, we have no Sacraments administred in our
Religion, neither that of Baptism, whereby people are admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Christian Church, nor that of the Lords Supper, by which they
are strengthened and preserved in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, we demand whence thou hast this Term Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and what is the proper signification of it? we are sure
thou hast it not from Scripture. And secondly, We put it upon
thee to prove whence you have your Authority for that which
thou callest Baptism, by which thou saist people are admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Christian Church, <hi>viz.</hi> sprinkling Infants. We deny that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104011:12"/>
you have any Authority from Scripture, either by Command or
Example for it: for we never read in all the Scriptures of either
baptizing or sprinkling Infants: there is no such thing in that
Scripture by thee quoted: therefore thou art in a great mistake
in charging this to be a defect in the Quakers Religion, not to
have such a Practice, which is an unwarrantable human Invention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and it is a great defect in your Religion, to perswade people, that
when you have sprinkled a little Water on the Head or Face of
a Child, and signed it with the sign of the Cross, it is thereby
admitted into the Christian Church, and call it Baptism, when it
is but sprinkling; and therefore a defect throughout. But thy
Charge upon the Quakers Religion, that we deny that of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
by which people are admitted into the Christian Church,
we affirm to be false; for we own that Baptism according to what
the Apostle saith 1 <hi>Cor. 12, 13. For by one Spirit are we all bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c This we
own to be Christs Baptism, and we also own <hi>Johns</hi> Ministration
of Water to have been Gods Ordinance in its day: but yours we
leave for thee to prove from whence you had it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly. Thou saist,</hi> Nor that of the Lords Supper, by which
they are strengthened and preserved in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Let all that are wise in heart consider whether that which
thou callest a Sacrament, which you take, hath such a great effect
in it, as to strengthen &amp; preserve in the Christian Church, which
is Christs Church, for the Protestants do account it no more than
a Sign of an inward spiritual Grace. But we are satisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
what Christ did, as in that Scripture thou quotest, <hi>Luke</hi>
22. for he had regard to the fulfilling of the Law, and his time
drawing near that he was to be sacrificed, and so the true Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 7. For even Christ our Passover is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
for us,</hi>
had a desire to eat the figurative Passover with his
Disciples before he suffered; as thou maist see <hi>Luke</hi> 22. and in
eating the Passover he took the Cup and gave thanks, and gave
it to them, and bid them divide it among themselves; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104011:13"/>
took Bread and brake it, and gave it to them; and after
Supper again he took the Cup and gave them; and thou maist
see what he said both of the Bread and the Cup, the one was his
Body which was given for us, the other was the Cup of the New
Testament in his Blood which was shed for us; which words
import that his Body, which is broken for us, is the substance
of that unleavened typical Bread; and his Blood, which was shed,
is the substance of that Cup; not that the Bread and Wine was
his Body and Blood, for that was but typical: though some do
ignorantly imagine that ho meant, the outward Bread and Wine
was his real Body and Blood; as the Jews thought he had meant
the Temple made with hands, when he spake of the Temple of
his Body: For we read, that when the Passover was instituted,
they were to have a Lamb without blemish, and unleavened
Bread, and the Door-posts were to be sprinkled with the Blood
of the Lamb; which Passover was certainly a Type of Christ the
immaculate Lamb, whose Body is the true Bread that nourishes
the Soul to Life eternal, and his Blood sprinkles the Concience
from dead works to serve the Living God. This is that we have
an eye to, that which was broken for us, and shed for us; and
we think, by thy Writing, thou art not of the Papists mind for
the Real Presence: and if not, then consider what that Bread and
Drink was that was broken and shed for us, which he spake of,
though he was then eating the Passover with his Disciples; and
then come on and see what the Apostle saith to the mystery of
it, which was that which he preferred in the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. there he tells them of the Fathers, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church in
the Wilderness, and saith, <hi>they did all eat of the same spiritual
Meat, and did all drink of the same spritual Drink; for they drank
of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.</hi>
So here thou maist see the Meat was spiritual, and the Drink was
spiritual, and the Rock was spiritual, that they drank of, and that
was Christ: So the Apostle, speaking to wise men, bids them
judge what he saith; as in <hi>ver.</hi> 15, and in <hi>ver.</hi> 16. saith he, <hi>The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104011:13"/>
Cup of Blessing which we bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood
of Christ? and the Bread which we break, is it not the Communion,
of the Body of Christ?</hi> and <hi>ver. 17. For we being many are one
Bread and one Body; for we are all partakers of that one Bread.</hi>
The Judgment of this thou seest the Apostle referred to wise
men; and we know wise men will judge that it is this spiritual
Meat and Drink that strengthens and preserves in the Church of
Christ, whatever thou maist say to the contrary; and so thou
wrongest the Quakers in saying, that we have not the Lords
Supper administred in our Religion; for we greatly delight in
the Lords Supper, to eat and drink that which strengthens and
and preserves us in the Church of Christ; and for your Practice
that you use in your Church, we demand your Example for it,
and whence it did arise? for thou maist see that Christ in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
did eat the Passover with his Disciples according to the Law,
and gave them the Cup both before and after Supper, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
            <p>Thou pretendest thou hast other notorious defects in our Religion, but
forbearest to bring them forth; only one, thou saist, thou canst not omit,
which is so great a one, that it renders the generality of the Quakers
almost no Christians at all; and thou saist most of us are guilty, and
that is a defect in the very badge and mark of a Christian Disciple,
which, saist thou, is Love and Charity; and so quotest Christs words,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 35. By this shall all men know that you are my Disciples,
if ye love one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Thou dost in this as thou hast done in other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
charge us to be guilty, but dost not bring one Proof or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to prove the Guilt upon us from matter of fact, unless
thy saying it is so, be either Proof or Argument, which no wise
man will understand to be so. Thou saist, perhaps, we have cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
among our selves, we love one the other who are of our
Perswasion. However that is well so far, it answers this Text
of Scripture which thou hast quoted; we wish we might say in
truth so much for all of your Persuasion. But thou goest on to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104011:14"/>
shew how we should love Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and tellest us what <hi>John</hi>
says, that God is Love, and the more a man hath of Love, the
nearer he doth approach to the Nature of God; and so tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
us what <hi>Paul</hi> saith of Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what doth all this
towards the proving us to be defective in this great badge and
mark of a Christian Disciple? That this is both your and our
Duty we grant; but thou dost not shew matter of Fact wherein
we are guilty: it is an easie matter to accuse and charge, but
wise men will consider how they can make good the Accusation
before they charge: But since thou hast provoked thereunto, let
us take an observation of the Works of your Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and see how you have born this badge and mark of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Christ, or whether we can find any Defects in her or not,
that we may see whether there is any reason to forsake her or
not? For many years past the Fruits of your Church and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
have been such, that we think it will be hard for any to
say, they are the badge and marks of Christian Disciples, (for
thou speakst in thy Letter of the Protestant Religion as it is profest
in the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>) and so it is of that Church
we now have Reason to take an observation, let it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
from whence hath all that great Persecution for many
years proceeded, whereby so many Families have been ruined,
many thousands imprisoned, their Goods taken away, not leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some so much as a Bed to lie upon, Cattel to till the Ground,
nor Corn for Bread and Seed nor Tools to work withal, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
Stocking, Stoning, and grievously abusing; so that many
thereby have lost their Lives, and meerly because they could
not come to your Worship for Conscience sake, or for meeting
together to worship God according to their Faith, and in these
Persecutions the Ministers have often had a hand themselves in
sending forth wicked Informers, and sometimes appearing in their
own persons, besides the great Sufferings wherein many have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for the Ministers Wages and Hire, which hath not been a
little, this in <hi>England.</hi> Yet we have not escaped in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104011:14"/>
have often been imprisoned for meeting together to worship the
Living God, as we have also been for the Ministers Wages. Now
these not being the acts and deeds of former ages, but of our
present age, and of a people yet living: We need not say much
to make it out, it being still as Wounds bleeding, which may
be seen; therefore come to the Application, and see where the
Imputation of this great Desect, which thou couldst not omit,
will fall: If thou canst prove these doings of yours to be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Love and Charity, then thou clearest your Church from
this great defect; and if so, may be, it may be a true Church; but
sure they manifest quite the contrary, and were never the marks
of a true, but of a false Church; as may be seen from the days of
<hi>Cain</hi> downwards. So that there's no want of Reasons why <hi>R.
L</hi> and others may turn from your Church, and so in turning
from you to the Truth, which the Quakers are Witnesses of, is
not unsafe, but a safe way to Heaven, notwithstanding all that
thou hast said to the contrary in reflection upon us and our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as also upon him, as if he had forsaken you, and changed
his Religion out of Covetousness, for which thou neither dost nor
canst give any grounded Reason; and therefore having said so
much already, we need not say much more to these matters.</p>
            <p>When he answered thee, and told thee, it was the Love of God
manifested in his heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not Covetousness, neither Humours,
Passions, nor Prejudice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all he tells thee so, yet thou still as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
that it plainly appears to be out of Covetousness, and sayest in
this, as in other things, he shakes hands with the Papists, and not
meerly for Conscience sake; so here, as in other things, thou dost
charge and accuse without proving what thou sayest, as if thou knew
his Heart and Conscience better than himself: what dost thou think,
who is now judging another mans Servant? and who is now assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods Prerogative? And when he tells thee, it was the Love of
God manifested, thou tellest him, it seems to thee, that God had
withdrawn his Love from him, in suffering him to forsake so rational
and pure a Religion as the established one is, for a Persuasion that
has either little or no Reason or Purity in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:104011:15"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> As for your esteablished Religion, what Reason and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is in it, or the contrary, we have in some measure before shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all that will but observe your Religion, and the effects of
it, may easily see that this is but a vain boast in thee, to set forth
your Religion for such a rational and pure one. And for thy say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That which he hath chosen hath little either of Reason or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in it; it is but thy Say so; thou dost not undertake to prove
or make it out at all: so that if people will believe what thou
saist, it must be because thou saist it, and not from any thing
thou makest appear to manifest what thou saist to be true.</p>
            <p>Thou goest on still after the same rate, and when he saith, he felt
nothing of incurring the Displeasure of the Lord; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
had more Peace in his own Conscience than when under thy
Teaching; thou tellest him of what <hi>Paul</hi> saith of some whom God had
given up to a reprobate mind, and so wouldst persuade him that this
is his state; and when he speaks of enjoying Peace more than when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thy Doctrine, thou saist the reason is plain enough, while under thy
Doctrine his Conscience was under a tenderness, it wassore with sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Truly we believe there was Reason for it to be sore with
Sin, but he might stay long there before it would be saved from
Sin, and so healed from that soreness; for that you never come
to, by your own confession; for all your days you are complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there is no Health in you; so you are like to be sore
with Sin; but all that see their infirmity, and what Physicians
of no value you are, had need to look out for a better Religion
and better Ministers, or Physicians to their Souls: So that its still
evident he had reason to forsake yours, and look out for a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that had more Power and Vertue in it, to deliver from Sin,
and heal the Wounds it had made; but it is not to be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
that if he had slayed with thee, and lived in his vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
that would have been better born with by thee, than
his owning of that which leads to a Reformation: and so like
them of old, that while people put it into their mouths they cried
Peace; but when they did not, then prepared War against them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:104011:15"/>Thou tellest him of going into the Quakers old way of uncharitable
censuring, because he saith, many of the Protestants in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland</hi> profess Christ in Words, but in Works deny him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is evident from their doings, as is before proved;
so that it is no hard matter to make that Charge good against
them. Do thou clear them if thou canst.</p>
            <p>When he saith, as far as he understands our Principles and
Practice are according to Christs Institution, which he doubts
not but we will make good upon occasion; thou, in answer, saist,
thou knowest our Practice well enough: which if true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if so
bad as thou endeavourest to make people believe of us; why
hast thou brought none of them to make good thy Charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us? And as for our Principles, thou saist, thou never
heardst we had any. Then thou must needs be ignorant of our
Way and Religion: and therefore in thy speaking evil of it, thou
speakest evil of things thou understandest not; and so art of
that Generation spoken of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. And as for our Faith
and Principles, they have been published to the world both by
Words and Writing, they have not been hid in a corner; so that
any that had a mind to concern themselves against us, and yet
(as wise men) would not judge without an understanding (lest like
thee they should speak evil of the things they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand)
might easily be informed what our Principles are: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we are a people that believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and
that the Father sent him into the world to lay down his Life a
ransom for all men, that whosoever believeth in him shall not
perish, but have eternal Life: that he was crucified without the
Gates of <hi>Jer.salem,</hi> and so became a Propitiation for the Sins of
the whole world: and that after he had suffered, and was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
God the Father raised him again by his eternal Spirit, after
which he shewed himself unto many Witnesses, and then ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Heaven, and is glorified with the Father, with that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he had with him before the World was made. And we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
believe, that he is the Light of the World, and that he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104011:16"/>
ought to be followed, according to his own words, <hi>John</hi> 8. 12.
and that he lighteth every man that cometh into the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. and that this Light, wherewith he lighteth
every man, all ought to believe in, that they may be Children
of the Light, according to <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 36. and so we believe in his
spiritual Appearance, according to his Promise, who said, <hi>He would
pray the Father, and he should send them another Comforter, even
the Spirit of Truth,</hi> according to <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 17. and this was
his own Spirit, for he is the Truth; and of this the Saints were
Witnesses, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Gal. 4. 6. And because ye are Sons
God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying</hi>
Abba <hi>Father.</hi> And thus was Christ in the Saints, the Hope
of Glory, according to <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 7. And thus believing and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
the Truth of the Scripture, we wait upon God for his
Spirit, that we may worship him therein according to the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of his Son Christ Jesus, as in <hi>John</hi> 4. 23, 24. and that we
may <hi>pray with the Spirit, and sing with it,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.
15. for the Apostle exhorted the Saints to be <hi>filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
Eph.</hi> 5. 18. and the Saints were to <hi>pray in the Holy Ghost, Jude</hi>
20. So our Faith stands in the Power of God, which is that, the
Apostle laboured that the Saints Faith might stand in; as thou
maist see, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 5. believing that there shall be a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
both of the just and unjust, they that have done good
unto the Resurrection of Life, and they that have done evil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Resurrection of Damnation, according to <hi>John</hi> 5. 29.</p>
            <p>Here we have given thee some account in short of our Faith,
Principles and Practice, and proved them to be according to the
Scripture, whereby thou maist see, if Prejudice and Self-Interest
do not blind thine eye, that <hi>Robert Lacky</hi> in turning from thy
Teaching, to Christ the true Light and his Teaching (according
to Gods Promise under the New Covenant, who said, <hi>they shall
be all taught of the Lord,</hi> which according to our Principle we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
people to wait for) is no unsafe way to Heaven, nor as
thou falsly accusest us, a pursuing such ways as are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104011:16"/>
to holy Scripture, which thou (in some measure) promisest
thou wilt make appear; but hast it yet to do.</p>
            <p>Thou saist, because thou art fully satisfied we cannot make this out,
therefore thou wilt shew him how he has incurred not only the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of God for the present, but the Damnation of his Soul here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
(unless he repent and return) by this his departure from the
Religion he was bred in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Thou maist see thy Satisfaction is without ground, as also
thy confident presumption in thy passing such a Sentence upon
him concerning his present and eternal estate: And surely thy
Judgment herein is groundless, rash and vain, as all may see who
have any true Christian understanding and discerning, and do but
observe what is brought forth under your Teaching in your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
for we understand no reason thou assignest for thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but his leaving of your Religion, which we have before prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he had good reason so to do: and therefore neither he nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other need be afraid of thy threatning upon this account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
from what is before written it is clear, that there are great
defects in the Principles and Exercise of the Religion he was bred
in (if he was bred in yours) and so not according to Christs Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
as may be seen if compared with the Scripture: And
that there are no such defects in the Religion he now embraceth,
but proved in the Principles and Exercise of it to be of Christs
Institution according to the Scripture: and herein thy Challenge
we have answered, and endeavoured to make it appear both to
thee and him, according to thy demand: but if thou hatest to be
informed, it shall lie at thy own door, and thou shalt answer for
it thy self. So it is plain he may have changed out of a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Conscience and pure Love to God and his Soul, and not
out of Interest, Humour, Passion or Prejudice, as thou seemest
to accuse him.</p>
            <p>And as for thy assuring him upon thy word, that it is not for any
temporal advantage that thou seekest to reduce him, but only in love
to his Soul, as thou hast to all mens, as thou saist.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:104011:17"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We think he hath no reason to believe that thou and
the rest of your Clergy have such a love to the Souls of all men,
as to be the only reason of your coming amongst them to be
their Teachers; for your Practice (which is a surer evidence than
your words) speaks the quite contrary, in that you do leave any
people where you are, to go to another place for an Augmentation
and higher Preferment; so that it's evident, it is not the good of
peoples Souls, nor the Glory of God, that chiefly moves you in
this concern, whatever may be pretended to. And so to the
Consciences and Understandings of wise men we refer these things
to be considered of, with our hearts desire to God for you all,
that he would open your Understandings, and let you see the
errour of your ways, and bring you to a Reformation, that the
people you may lead in Errour no longer. We conclude and
remain Desirers of the Good of all men.</p>
