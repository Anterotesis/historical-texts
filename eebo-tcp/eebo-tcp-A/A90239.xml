         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas his Holineſſe, Reverend Young <hi>MARTIN-MAR-PRIEST,</hi>
taking into his Grave and Learned
conſideration, the inſufferable Arogancy of our Ambitious
aſpiring Presbytrie, their ſuper-Prelaticall Supremacy,
their ravenous blood-thirſty malice againſt the poore Saints of
the moſt High GOD, their inordinate inſatiable covetouſneſſe
after the fatt things of the Land, their unparalel'd hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
their plauſible pretences, their incomprehenſible policy, craft
and ſubtilty, their cunning inſenſible encroachments upon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Parliament, the juſt Liberties and freedome of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
their enchanting deluſions, wherewith they bewitch both Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113063:2"/>
and multitude, the cruell Thraldome, inhumane Slavery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable
bondage they would Reform us and our Children into from
Generation to Generation, their powerfull endeavours to make the
Parliament betray their Truſt, break their Oathes, pull downe Old
Courts of Tyranny and Opreſſion, to ſet up new; free us from Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Perſecution, to devour us with Presbyterian cruelty, convey our
native Rights and Freedome to the <hi>Pontificall</hi> uſurpation of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
that neither wee nor our Children after us, (<hi>notwithſtanding the
expence of our Eſtates, ruine of our Families, effuſion of our Blood to redeem
them</hi>) may live in the Land, without the hazard of Impriſonment,
loſſe of goods, baniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hanging, &amp;c. except wee be Presbyterian,
theſe and many other things of high concernment, reveren'd Young
MARTIN taking into his ſerious and deliberate conſideration, and
ſeeing this eminent irrecoverable ruine, ready to devour both Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and people, hang over their Heads, threatning certain deſtruction
to us and our Poſterity, if not timely and ſuddenly prevented; Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Holineſſe, reverend Young MARTIN, out of ſincerity to God,
and naturall love unto his diſtreſſed Country, moſt willingly became
ſervant to your ſuperlative Holineſſe, to eaſe your burthen in this your
toylſome time of <hi>Claſſicall Exaltation,</hi> of a little State-Ambition, and
ſpirituall Supremacy, and as much as in him lyeth, to vindicate the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of Parliament, our Birth-rights and native freedome from your
divine Spirituallity, ehat you might have the more time to ſtuffe your
guts, extend your panches, cram your bellies, farcinate your ventricles,
ſnort out <hi>Directories,</hi> blurt out <hi>Ordinances,</hi> grin at Chriſt, and ſnerle at
his Sectaries, and for his meritorious pious endeavours, MARTIN ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
a reward, as very juſtly he might; but to cloake your covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ingratitude, you pick Quarrells againſt him for ſome ſmall
failings in his Treatiſe; I hope you will deale better with Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
for his <hi>mid-night Dreames, his diſtracted ſubitaine apprehenſions,</hi> I can
tell you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he expects it, but MARTIN might have conſidered your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
to the Lord Biſhops, from whom formerly you received the
Holy Ghoſt, with all your ſpirituall Preferments, and were firſt put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a capacity of <hi>Lording it,</hi> as you now doe, over the people, whom, like

their grace and favour, you have devoured up, and ſhare their

inheritance amongſt you; (<hi>O divine pillage! gratefull children!</hi>) Or
if he had conſidered your pious providence to make ſure the <hi>Ordinance
for Tithes,</hi> before you could be inſpired with the <hi>Directory,</hi> hee would
firſt have had his 400l. <hi>per annum,</hi> with the Deane of <hi>Pauls</hi> houſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by an Ordinance of Parliament, upon him during his naturall
life, like as our Brother <hi>Burges</hi> hath (<hi>a ſuper-Epiſcopall Induction!</hi>) or
elſe dedicated his labours according to your antient practiſe, to ſome
great Lord or other in the Kingdome, in whoſe hands was the deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall

his Lord (<hi>like as it was wont to doe with you,</hi>) would have moved npon
Dr. MARTIN<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to lift up his hands, and elevated his eyes unto the

done, as now in your divine Wiſedomes, you find it expedient to give
us example, all Livings being fallen into the hands of the Parliament,
to have Dedicated my Book, <hi>To the Honourable Houſe of Commons, &amp;c.</hi>
But foraſmuch, as inſtead of a conſiderable gratuity, you threaten to

the moſt convenient time, to attempt their totall ſuppreſſion; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
which time, ſeeing they are a great party, and ſome of them ſilken
ones too, as was lately obſerved by Dr. <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> who perchance have
yet ſome money left, let that be ſcraped out of them under one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or another, and when they have nothing left, they are eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
make them poore, and you may doe what you will with
them, Poverty will humble a ſtout ſpirit, ſo that if happily they
chance to begger, or lie in the ſtreets, the <hi>Spirits</hi> as happily may ſteale
them away from you, for your Wiſedomes cannot thinke it ſafe, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
your ſelves too inſolently againſt them, untill firſt triumphantly
you have ſet your feet upon your Fathers necks, the <hi>Lord Biſhops,</hi> as the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> Captaines did upon the necks of thoſe five wicked Kings.

            <p>One thing I had like to have forgot, which I muſt needs trouble
your patience with, or elſe all my Inſtructions will prove dangerous
and prejuditiall to you, you muſt not forget to make all the pulpits in
<hi>London,</hi> to ring againſt MARTIN, and perſwade the people, that
he is a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and under that notion you'l eaſily prejudice them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his writings, but you muſt doe it cunningly, with powerfull
perſwaſions, and all Presbyterian ſubtilty that may be, forewarne them
of him, as of a Serpent, tell them, That wherein hee is moſt rationall,
and hath the greateſt ſhew of truth, therein hee is moſt deluſive,
<hi>latet anguis in herba,</hi> beleeve him by no meanes, his ſeeming Reaſons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113063:8"/>
are but wiles to entrap you, to delude and ſeduce your underſtandings,
ſo that you ſhall perſwade them not to beleeve their owne eyes though
they ſee it never ſo plainly, tell him that his immitation of your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
proſecuting your ſteps through the Society of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>,</hi> the villany
of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> and the taking your ſayings into his mouth, to diſcover
your Hypocriſy, ſubtilty and Pollicy is Blaſphemy, and brand him for
an Incendiary and a divider of the Two Nations, when 'tis but of your
villany from the Parliament and people.</p>
            <p>Tell them hee's an Agent ſent from the Kings Quarters, to foment
Principles of diviſion amongſt our ſelves, to divide us one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp;c. when as indeed it is your ſelves that are the Originall of all
our Diviſions; You firſt divided the Kingdome into two deſperate
Parties, each reſolved to devour other, old ſoaking <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and
new upſtart frisking <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> wreſtling for maſtery, and now leaſt
any beſide your ſelves ſhould reap the benefit of purchaſe in this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
you have, as neer as you can, made a third party, in labouring by
your Jeſuiticall Machiavilian ſubtilty to devide the Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the truſt repoſed in them from the godly party, who have aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
them with their Eſtates and blood, and to deny thoſe their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
friends of their juſt deſervings, their purchaſed freedomes, which
ſhould they doe, they would be branded as infamous to poſterity, even
unfaithfull, ungratefull, &amp;c. <hi>at meliora ſpero,</hi> I hope better of them, if
your wicked <hi>Machiavillian Aſſembly</hi> were but taken from them, and
ſent to their particular Charges. Yea, tell the people, that <hi>MARTIN</hi>
is a Conjurer, and deales with the Divell, and the Spirit of JESUS
CHRIST is not in the leaſt meaſure to be found in his Writings,
but are ſtuffed with nothing but profaneneſſe, hypocricy, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
&amp;c. when by your favour, good <hi>Sym, mutatio nomine de te fabula
narratur,</hi> they are your owne, which in the perſonating of your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
forſooth, hee uſeth, to make a diſcovery thereof, that the people
might not longer be fed with Gloſſes, Pretences, ſhaddows, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee, MARTIN is very jealous over you, even with
an holy jealouſie (<hi>and well he may, that hath got ſuch a payre of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Hornes,</hi>) yet notwithſtanding this his pure Advice, elabourately
gathered from you forth of the Schools, the venerable examples of the
men of your owne Cloath, as alſo from a dilligent obſervation of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113063:9"/>
the courſe of the preſent Times, hee ſhall hardly finde either accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with you for the ſame, or any conſiderable Reward, the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
excepted, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have many other things to write unto you, which by Pen and
inke are not fit to be revealed, which I ſhall ſuſpend for the preſent:
for it may be, ſhortly I ſhall ſee you, and wee ſhall ſpeake face to face,
and that of mine owne accord I ſhould have endeavoured it, and ere
this have come unto you (<hi>even I</hi> MARTIN) once and againe, but
Satan (<hi>with your Foure Hundred Pound</hi>) hindred mee. Wherefore I
ſhall leave you for this time, and commit this my <hi>Pure Advice</hi> to
your ſacred Peruſall, and apply my ſelf in a word or two to
the Common People, as you call them, and
ſo conclude.</p>

            <p>But in plain termes (<hi>loving Freinds, Neighbours and Countrey-men,</hi>) let
us a little reaſon together ſeriouſly: Have not you borne the brunt and
heat of this unnaturall Warre? Is it not you that pay all the Taxes,
Ceſſments and Oppreſſions whatſoever? Is not the whole <hi>Burthen</hi> laid
upon your backs? burthen after burthen, even till your backs breake?
How many thouſands of you, who were of great eſtate, are even redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

under which you groane, and are fit to expire, thoſe greedy wretches

have Ceſs'd the Prieſts, and Impreſs'd them to the Warres, for that
would have been more conducent to the Kingdomes good; for ſhould
but the King ſet his Epiſcopall <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the Parliament their <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian

your former Expences, Ventures and Ceſſements for this preſent War,
and the miſerable condition you and the whole Kingdome ſtrugleth
in, as it were for life, and are now all ready to be devoured, your eſtates
are waſted, your men ſlayne, your hands weakned, and the Kingdome

their ignorance of the Office, and inability to performe their duties therein,

we will deal worſe with you, then with him that hath not taken the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi>
They anſwered, We deſire to be dealt by as the <hi>Covenant</hi> was read and
explained unto us, it is not yet determined by the Parl. of <hi>England,</hi> that the
Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> is to be a patterne to the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
we now joyn with you in hearing, &amp;c. <hi>Mackeleland.</hi> We will not let their

doe what is fitting for preſent, and the Parliament is bound to give us
thanks for ſo doing. And all that will not joyn with us, and doe as we doe,
ſhall pack and be gone, &amp;c. and in the concluſion they were baniſhed, and
could not obtaine a copy of their Cenſure, Thus you may ſee what you are
to rely upon, if in conſcience you cannot ſubmit to any thing they command,
you know your wages, you muſt be baniſhed; and doe not our <hi>Presbyters</hi> not
only labour for the baniſhment, but for the lives of the contrary minded to
them? and is not this think you, as evill meaſure as ever was meaſured out
