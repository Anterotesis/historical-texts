            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS Upon the late tranſactions and proceedings of the ARMY, In reference to the DISSOLUTION of the PARLIAMENT:</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is evident to unbiaſſed men, that the Parliament had a deſign to break and ſpoil the good intereſt of the Army (which hath been as the bulwark of the Cauſe of God and his People) and to form it up to an intereſt to ſerve the wills and luſts of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, endeavouring to put many into commands who are perſons of looſe and profligate principles, and of a mercenary ſpirit, voting of the Commander in chief, a perſon of moſt approved godlineſs, tenderneſs to all the People of God, and fidelity to the Cauſe he hath been engaged in, caſting out ſeveral eminent and faithfull Commanders, who have been as Pillars in the Army, being ſuch who had ſpecially engaged againſt the common Enemy in the late inſurrection, falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them at their return (taking occaſion from a modeſt Petition) with great animoſity and ſeverity, when the Priſoners they took in Arms againſt them were all let alone.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tis eaſily obſerved, that they were under the ſame ſpirit and deſigns as they were before their firſt interruption, which was to perpetuate themſelves, there not appearing upon them a ſpirit to doe any thing effectually for promoting the good work of God, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in the Nation, according to their profeſſions and engagements.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Parliament was ſpecially to be conſidered as the Truſtees of the good and well-affected people of the Nation, (having been deſerted and oppoſed in Arms by others) to aſſert the good intereſt of the Nation and the people of God therein, who called forth the ſaid good people to ſtand by them with their lives in their hands in the aſſerting their own intereſt, upon which call, the Army upon principles of conſcience, and not as the ſervants of men, offerd themſelves, and this Army in ſpecial manner was modelld by the Parliament for thoſe good ends, and have been eminently owned by the Lord in their undertakings in the three Nations, and the hearts of the people of the Lord have been knit to them, (unleſſe ſuch who turned back to the Royal Intereſt) and have ſtill an adherency to them, looking upon them as entruſted with this Cauſe they have been honoured of God in; Now when the Parliament ſhall be found going about to pervert their truſt (ſo comitted to them by the good people) to the ruine of the good intereſt of the Army, and with that, the cauſe that hath been contended for, as is the judgment of moſt of the ſober-minded people upon their late actings, It is then juſtifiable in the Army, yea duty and faithfulneſſe, to withſtand them as they have done, and are juſtified in the conſciences of their friends in ſo doing; It being a received Maxim (and that with ſuch as are no very good friends to the Army) as ſuitable to all ends of Government, that when a Community of people ſhall commit a truſt to a few of themſelves (which is the preſent caſe) upon ends declared and profeſſed by both, that ſuch a Community may revoke that truſt, by calling off their Truſtees, when they ſhall go about to make void thoſe ends for which they themſelvs have profeſſed to be entruſted, (and yet not be found under any undue reſiſtance of Powers) that truſt being not irrevocable by any law of God, Nature, or Nations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the Officers of the Army called this Parliament to ſit again, after their long interruption (or rather former diſſolution, for ſo indeed it was, upon a righteous account, though now ſome of late in Print condemn the former General of the Army in ſo doing, when themſelves inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly preſt him to it, as is notoriouſly known) the ſaid Officers did it, as conceiving it the beſt expedient to caſt off the Government of a ſingle perſon, which they found and acknowledge to have been a ſnare to them; but in ſo doing, the Officers propoſals were as a Compact and Covenant, on their part with them, in behalf of themſelves and the good people that owned them; and ſeveral eminent members of the Houſe before their ſitting, being treated with by ſome of the Army, promiſed an amicable cloſure with them on thoſe grounds, which were alſo ſo accepted after their ſitting, which in their late actings they have even wholly caſt off; but the Officers of the Army thereby peremptorily obliged themſelves to conſiſt to the ſame with a <hi>full and fixed reſolution,</hi> (as to the ſubſtance of them) as they ſhould be found ſubſervient to the promoting of the Cauſe of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That many of the good People, who any ways aſſented to the late calling together of the Parliament, profeſſed in their applications to the Council of Officers of the Army, that they looked upon their calling together as a meet expedient to ſerve the preſent exigency, and they ſailing the expectations of moſt ſober people, they are equally ſatisfied with their removal.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That this very Parliament at their firſt diſſolution, declared in one of their papers, That it was juſtifiable for the Army to keep out the major part of the Houſe, when they were deſigning to give back the cauſe into the hands of the King at the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> Treaty, when there would have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left but a Paper to ſecure it; And if juſtifiable ſo to deal with a major part, there is the ſame reaſon of dealing ſo with thoſe that remained, if they ſhall be found (though in another way) doing the ſame thing, which is clearly our preſent caſe.</p>
            <p>Upon all which it will appear there was a true and real neceſſity, upon righteous principles, leading the faithfull Officers of the Army to what they have done, profeſſing it the great grief of their Souls, that they ſhould be neceſsitated to ſuch an extremity, and hope it ſhall not be judged fickleneſs, lightneſs, or inconſtancy, that they are put upon ſuch overturnings in which they have been of late engaged, but rather a conſiſtency to an unwearied purſute of that <hi>Good Cauſe of the Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> which out of all theſe confuſions and ſhakings, will ariſe in its own beauty and glory in the beſt ſeaſon of the Lord; and the ſaid Officers hope, if the Lord will take pleaſure in them, to make it appear, that their Hearts are ſtill towards the exaltation of the ſaid <hi>Cauſe,</hi> to the refreſhment of the Hearts of all good people; profeſſing alſo they have no other intereſt but wherein the people of God are equally concerned, and are begging a ſhare in their prayers to the Father of Lights for them.</p>
